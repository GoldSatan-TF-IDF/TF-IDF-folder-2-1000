ysabel guy gavriel kay for linda mcknight and anthea mortonsaner there is one story and one story only that will prove worth your telling whether as learned bard or gifted child to it all lines or lesser gauds belong that startle with their shining such common stories as they stray into robert graves prologue the woods came to the edge of the property to the gravel of the drive the electronic gate and the green twistedwire fence that kept out the boars the dark trees wrapped around one other home hidden along the slope and then stretched north of the villa up the steep hill into what could properly be called a forest the wild boarsanglierforaged all around especially in winter occasionally there might be heard the sound of rifle shots though hunting was illegal in the oak trees and clearings surrounding such expensive homes the welloff owners along the chemin de lolivette did what they could to protect the serenity of their days and evenings here in the countryside above the city because of those tall eastern trees dawn declared itselfat any time of yearwith a slow pale brightening not the disk of the sun itself above the horizon if someone were watching from the villa windows or terrace they would see the black cypresses on the lawn slowly shift towards green and take form from the top downwards emerging from the silhouetted sentinels they were in the night sometimes in winter there was mist and the light would disperse it like a dream however it announced itself the beginning of day in provence was a gift celebrated in words and art for two thousand years and more somewhere below lyon and north of avignon the change was said to begin a difference in the air above the earth where men and women walked and looked up no other sky was quite what this one was any time of year any season whether a late autumns cold dawn or midday in drowsy summer among the cicadas or when the knife of windthe mistralripped down the rhone valley the way soldiers had so often come making each olive or cypress tree magpie vineyard lavender bush aqueduct in the distance stand against the windscoured sky as if it were the first the perfect example in the world of what it was aixenprovence the city lay in a valley bowl west of the villa no trees in that direction to block the view from this high the city more than two thousand years old founded by romans conquering heresurveying and mapping levelling and draining laying down pipes for thermal springs and their deadstraight roadscould be seen on spring mornings like this one crisply defined almost supernaturally clear medieval houses and modern ones a block of new apartment buildings on a northern slope andtucked into the old quarterthe bell tower of the cathedral rising they would all be going there this morning a little later than this but not too much so two alarm clocks had gone off in the house by now the one woman was already showering you didnt want to linger of a morning not with what they were here to do photographers knew about this light they would try to use it to draw upon it as someone with a thirst might have drawn from an ancient wellthen again at twilight to see how doorways and windows showed and shadowed differently when the light came from the west or the sky was bloodred with sunset underlighting clouds another kind of offering gifts of different nuance morning and evening here noon was too bright shadowless for the cameras eye gifts not always deserved by those dwellingor arrivingin a toobeautiful part of the world where so much blood had been shed and so many bodies burned or buried or left unburied through violent centuries but as to that in fairness were there so many places where the inhabitants through the long millennia could be said to have been always worthy of the blessings of the day this serene and savage corner of france was no different from any other on earthin that regard there were differences here however most of them long forgotten by the time this mornings first light showed above the forest and found the flowering judas trees and anemonesboth purple in hue both with legends telling why the tolling of the cathedral bells drifted up the valley there was no moon yet it would rise later through the bright daylight a waxing moon one edge of it severed dawn was exquisite memorable almost a taste on the day a tale that had been playing out for longer than any records knew began to arc like the curve of a hunters bow or the arrows flight and fall towards what might be an ending part one chapter i ned wasnt impressed as far as he could tell in the halflight that fell through the small high windows the saintsauveur cathedral of aixenprovence was a mess outside where his fathers team was setting up for a preshoot and inside where he was entirely alone in the gloom he was supposed to feel cool about being by himself in here melanie his fathers tiny assistant almost ridiculously organized had handed him a brochure on the cathedral and told him with one of her winks to head on in before they started taking the test digitals that would precede the real photographs for the book she was being nice to him she was always nice to him but it drove ned a bit crazy that with everything else she had to deal with melanie stillobviouslymade mental notes to find things for the fifteenyearold tagalong son to do keep him out of the way out of trouble she probably knew already where the music stores and jogging tracks and skateboard parks were in aix shed probably known before they flew overseas googling them and making notes shed probably already bought a deck and gear on amazon or something had them waiting at the villa for just the right time to give them to him when he looked completely bored or whatever she was perfectly nice and even cute but he wished she didnt treat him as part of her job hed thought about wandering the old town but hed taken the booklet from her instead and gone into the cathedral this was the first working day first setup for a shoot hed have lots of chances later to explore the city they were in the south of france for six weeks and his father would be working flat out almost the whole time ned figured it was just as easy to stick around the others this morning he was still feeling a bit disoriented and far from home didnt have to tell anyone that though the mayors office in the city hall up the road had been predictably excited that they were here theyd promised edward marriner two uninterrupted hours this morning and another two tomorrow if he needed them to capture the facade of their cathedral that meant of course that any people wanting to go in and out to pray for their immortal souls or anyone elses were going to have to wait while a famous photographer immortalized the building instead as greg and steve unloaded the van there had even been a discussion initiated by the city official assigned to them about men going up on ladders to take down a cable that ran diagonally across the street in front of the cathedral to the university building across the way neds father had decided they could eliminate the wire digitally if they needed to so the students werent going to be deprived of lights in their classrooms after all nice of us ned had thought pacing back and forth his father had started making crisp decisions the way he always did when finally on location after the long buildup to a project ned had seen him like this before barrett reinhardtthe publishers art director for the bookhad been here in provence two months ago preparing a list of possible photographs emailing jpegs back to edward marriner in montreal but neds father always preferred to react to what he saw when he got to a place he was shooting hed pointed out a balcony off the second floor of the university right above the square opposite the facade and decided theyd shoot with the digital camera from the ground stitching a wide shot on the computer but he wanted to go up to that balcony and use largeformat film from there melanie following him around with her binder had scribbled notes in differentcoloured inks his father would make his photo selection later when he saw what they had ned knew the challenge would probably be getting the tall bell tower on the left and the full width of the building into one shot steve had gone with the guy from the mayors office into the university to see about access to the balcony a crowd had gathered to watch them setting up greg using adequate french and a smile was making sure the spectators stayed around the edges of the square out of the shots a gendarme had come to assist ned had watched sourly his french was better than the others but he hadnt actually felt like helping hed left at that point and gone inside the cathedral he really wasnt sure why he was in such a bad mood on the face of it he ought to have been really cool with this out of school almost two months early skipping exams he did have three essays to write here and deliver in july back home staying in a villa with a swimming pool while his dad and the others did their work within the dark highvaulted cathedral he abruptly removed his ipod buds and hit the off button listening to houses of the holy in here wasnt quite as clever as hed thought it would be hed felt silly and even a little bit nervous alone in a place this shadowy and vast unable to hear anything around him he could imagine the headlines canadian student stabbed by led zeppelinhating priest the thought amused him a little hed put it in an email to the guys back home later he sat down on a bench halfway up the central aisle stretched out his legs and glanced at melanies booklet the cover photo was taken from a cloister an arch in the foreground a sunlit tree the bell tower behind against a really blue sky it was postcard pretty it probably was on a postcard his father would never take a picture like it not in a million years not of this cathedral edward marriner had talked about that yesterday while theyd watched their first sunset from the terrace ned opened the brochure there was a map at the front the light was dim but his eyesight was good he could make it out as best he could tell from the map key on the facing page this place had been built in a dozen stages over too many centuries by too many people who didnt care what had been done before they arrived a mess that was the point his dad had explained the facade they were setting up to shoot was hemmed in by aixs streets and squares it was part of them entangled in the citys life not set back to be admired the way cathedrals usually were the front had three styles and colours of stone that didnt come close to matching up with one another his father had said that was what he liked about it remember why were doing this shot hed reminded everyone as theyd piled out of the van and started unloading perfect cathedral facades like notre dame in paris or chartres were snapped by every tourist who saw them this one was different and a challengefor one thing they couldnt back up too much or theyd crash through a window into a university classroom and ruin a lecture on the eternal greatness of france greg had laughed suck ned had thought and reached for his earbuds that was when melanie had fished the brochure from her black shoulder tote the tote was almost as big as she was the running joke was that half the missing objects in the world could be found in melanies bag and she had a good idea where the other half were alone inside ned studied the map and looked up where he was sitting was called a nave not an aisle i knew that he thought inwardly imitating ken lowerys exaggerated voice in science class as best he could tell the nave had been finished in but the part just behind him was four hundred years older and the altar ahead was gothic whenever that was the small chapel behind that had been built around the same time as the nave where he was sitting if you looked left or right the dates got even more muddled he stood up and walked again it was a little creepy being alone in here actually his footsteps in nikes were soundless he approached a side door with two heavy old iron locks and a new brass one a sign said it led out to the cloister and listed the times for tours the black iron locks did nothing any more the new one was bolted figured couldnt get out that might have been a cool idea sit in a cloister and listen to music he didnt have any religious music on the ipod thank god but u would have done the cloister melanies map informed him was really old from the s so was the side aisle where he was standing now but the chapel up at the end of it was eighteenth century the newest thing here you could almost laugh they could put a starbucks somewhere in this place and it would fit as much as anything else did chapel of saintjava he walked towards that late chapel by the steps to the altar not much to see some fat white candles had burned down none were burning now people werent allowed inside this morning edward marriner was at work out front ned crossed in front of the altar and worked his way back down the other side this aisle was from the map told him he stopped to get his bearings this would be the north side the cloister was south his father was shooting the west facade for no good reason it made him feel better to work that out this was a shorter nave hit a wall partway down ned found himself back in the main section looking up at a stainedglass window he found another bench near the last side chapel by the bell tower saintcatherines the brochure advised it had been the universitys chapel ned imagined students hurrying here to confession five hundred years ago then back across the road to lectures what did they wear to school in those days he popped in his buds again dialing pearl jam on the wheel he was in the south of france well forgive him for not doing cartwheels his father would be shooting like a madman his own word from now to the middle of june the photographs were for a bigdeal book next christmas edward marriner images of provence accompanying a text by oliver lee oliver lee was from london but had lived down here for the last thirty years writing melanie had told him all this six novels including some prizewinners star english writer star canadian photographer star french scenery bigdeal book neds mother was in the sudan the reports were of serious fighting again north of darfur she was almost certainly there he thought leaning back on the bench closing his eyes trying to let the music envelop him angry music grunge pearl jam finished alanis morissette came up next on his shuffle the deal was his mother would phone them here every second evening that ned thought bitterly was going to for sure keep her safe doctors without borders was supposed to be respected and acknowledged everywhere but they werent always not any more the world had changed places like iraq had proven that and the sudan was real far from being the smartest place on earth to be right now he pulled off the buds again alanis complained a lot he decided for a girl from the ottawa valley who absolutely had it made gregorian chants someone asked ned jerked sideways along the bench turning his head quickly what the sorry did i scare you hell yes he snapped what do you think he stood up it was a girl he saw she looked apologetic for a second then grinned she clasped her hands in front of her what have you to fear in this holy place my child what sins lie heavy on your heart ill think of something he said she laughed she looked to be about his own age dressed in a black tshirt and blue jeans doc martens a small green backpack tall thin freckles american accent light brown hair to her shoulders murder t s eliot wrote a play about that she said ned made a face urk one of those i know murder in the cathedral were supposed to study it next year she grinned again im geeky that way what can i say isnt this place amazing you think i think its a mess but thats whats cool walk twenty steps and you go five hundred years have you seen the baptistry this place drips with history ned held out an open palm and looked up as if to check for dripping water you are a geek arent you cant tease if i admitted it cheap shot she was kind of pretty in a skinnydancer way ned shrugged whats the baptistry the round part by the front doors wait a sec something occurred to him howd you get in the place is closed for two hours i saw someones taking photos outside probably a brochure no he hesitated thats my dad for a book really who is he you wouldnt know edward marriner her jaw actually dropped ned felt the familiar mix of pleasure and embarrassment you messing with me she gasped mountains and gods i know that book we own that book well cool what will it get me she gave him a suddenly shy look ned wasnt sure why hed spoken that way it wasnt really him ken and barry talked that way to girls but he didnt usually he cleared his throat get you a lecture on the baptistry she said if you can stand it im kate not katie not kathy he nodded his head ned not seymour not abdul she hesitated then laughed again all right fine i deserved that but i hate nicknames kate is a nickname yeah but i picked it makes a difference i guess you never answeredhowd you get in side door she gestured across the way no ones watching the square on that side through the cloister seen that yet ned blinked but he couldnt say after that any premonition had come to him he was just confused thats all the door to the cloister is locked i was there fifteen minutes ago nope open the far one out to the street and the one leading in here i just came through them come look the cloister is really pretty it began then because they didnt get to the cloister not yet going across they heard a sound metal on metal a banging a harsh scrape another bang what the hell ned murmured stopping where he was he wasnt sure why but he kept his voice down kate did the same thats the baptistry she whispered over there she pointed probably one of the priests maybe a caretaker another scraping sound ned marriner said i dont think so it would have been in every possible way wiser to ignore that noise to go see the pretty cloister walk out that way afterwards into the morning streets of aix get a croissant and a coke somewhere with this girl named kate his mother however was in the sudan having flown far away from them again to the heart of an insanely dangerous place ned came from courageand from something else though he didnt know that part yet he walked quietly towards the baptistry and peered down the three steps leading into that round pale space hed gone right past it when he came in he realized he saw eight tall pillars making a smaller circle inside it with a dome high above letting in more light than anywhere else its the oldest thing here whispered the girl beside him by a lot like ad he was about to ask her how she knew so many idiotic facts when he saw that a grate had been lifted from over a hole in the stone floor then he saw the head and shoulders of a man appear from whatever opening that grate had covered and ned realized that this wasnt that this couldnt be a priest or a caretaker or anyone who belonged in here the man had his back to them ned lifted a hand wordlessly and pointed kate let out a gasp the man in the pit didnt move and then he did with an air of complete unreality as if this were a video game hed stumbled into not anything that could be called real life ned saw the man reach inside his leather jacket and bring out a knife priests didnt wear leather or carry knives the man laid it on the stone floor beside himthe blade pointing in their direction he still didnt turn around they couldnt see his face ned saw longvery longfingers the man was bald or had shaved his head it was impossible to tell his age there was a silence no one moved this would be a good spot to save the game ned thought then restart if my character gets killed he isnt here the man said quietly i was quite surebut he is playing with me again he enjoys doing that ned marriner had never heard that tone in a voice it chilled him standing in shadow looking towards the soft light of the baptistry the man had spoken in french neds french was very good after nine years of immersion classes at home in montreal he wondered about kate then realized shed understood because absurdly as if making polite conversationwith a knife lying on the stone floorshe asked in the same language who isnt here theres just a roman street under there right it says so on the wall the man ignored her completely as if she hadnt made any sounds that mattered in any way ned had a sense of a small man but it was hard to tell not knowing how deep the pit was he still hadnt turned to look at them it was time to run obviously this wasnt a computer game he didnt move go away the man said as if sensing neds thought i have killed children before i have no strong desire to do so now go and sit somewhere else i will be leaving now children they werent kids stupidly ned said weve seen you we could tell people a hint of amusement in his voice the man said dryly tell them what that someone lifted a grate and looked at the roman paving hélas all the gendarmes of france will be on the case ned might have grown up in too quickwitted a household in some ways no he said we could say someone threatened us with a knife the man turned around inside the opening in the floor he was cleanshaven leanfaced dark strong eyebrows a long straight nose a thin mouth the bald head made his cheekbones show prominently ned saw a scar on one cheek curving behind his ear the man looked at them both a moment where they stood together at the top of the three steps before he spoke again his eyes were deepset it was impossible to see their colour a few gendarmes would be interested in that i grant you he shook his head but i am leaving i see no reason to kill you i will replace the grate no damage has been done to anything go away and then as they still stood there more in shock than anything else he took the knife and put it out of sight ned swallowed come on whispered the girl named kate she pulled at his arm he turned with her to go then looked back were you trying to rob something down there he asked his mother would have turned and asked the same thing in fact out of sheer stubbornness a refusal to be dismissed though ned didnt actually know that the man in the baptistry looked up at him again and said softly after a moment no not that i thought i washere soon enough i was wrong i think the world will end before i ever find him in time or the sky will fall as he would say ned shook his head the way a dog does shaking water off when it comes in out of the rain the words made so little sense it wasnt even funny kate was tugging at him again harder this time he turned and walked away with her back to where theyd been before by saintcatherines chapel they sat down on the same bench neither of them spoke across the echoing empty space of the dark cathedral they heard a clang and scrape then a bang again then nothing hed be leaving now ned looked down at the ipod on his belt it seemed just then to be the strangest object imaginable a small rectangle that offered music any kind of music you wanted hundreds of hours of it with little white buds you could put in your ears and block out the sounds of the world the world will end before i ever find him in time he looked over at the girl she was biting her lower lip staring straight ahead ned cleared his throat it sounded loud well if kate is for katherine he said brightly were in the right place you can do the praying what the she looked at him he showed her the map pointing to the name of the chapel his bad joke im not catholic she said he shrugged i doubt that matters whatwhat do you think he was doing shed seemed pretty confident assertive when shed first come over to him she didnt seem that way now she looked scared which was reasonable ned swore he didnt swear as much as some of the guys did but this particular moment seemed to call for something i have no idea whats down there i think theyre just grates to let you look down and see the old roman street the tourist stuff on the wall also said there was a tomb going back to the sixth century but thats something i she stopped he stared at her what kate sighed this is gonna sound geeky again but i just like this stuff okay dont laugh at me im nowhere close to laughing she said they didnt bury people inside city walls back then it was forbidden thats why there are catacombs and cemeteries in rome and paris and arles and other placesoutside the walls they buried the dead outside what are you saying well the info thing posted over there shows a tomb here from the sixth century a little over from wherehe was so how didwell how did someone get buried in here back then shovels ned said more out of reflex than anything else she didnt smile you think thats what that guy was a tomb robber he asked i dont think anything really he said he wasnt but he also said she shook her head can we go ned nodded not through the front we might step into a shot and my dad would kill himself and then me he gets intense when hes working we can leave the way i came in through the cloister a penny dropped for ned right thatll be how he got in i bet between my seeing it locked and your finding the two doors open you think hes gone out that way long gone by now he hesitated show me that baptistry first are you crazy hes gone kate but why do you ned looked at her history lesson you promised she didnt smile why are you playing boy detective he didnt have a really good answer this is a bit too weird i want to try to understand ned he said hed killed children he shook his head i dont thinkthat means what we think it means and that sounds like a line from a bad movie maybe but come on this where the creepy music starts come on kate he got up and she followed she could have left by herself he thought later sitting on the terrace of the villa that evening they didnt know each other at all that first morning she could have gone out the way shed come in saying goodbye or not as she pleased they walked together down the three steps into the baptistry and stood above the grate beside that inner ring of pillars the light was beautiful after the dimness of the cathedral streaming down through windows in the dome above the shallow well in the centre ned knelt and peered through the bars of the grate if it was supposed to be a viewing point it wasnt much of one it was too dark down there to see where the sunken space might go heres the bit about the tomb kate said she was at the west wall in front of some tourist information a typed laminated sheet framed in wood ned walked over basically it was just another mapkey to this part of the interior kate pointed at a letter on the map and then the text keyed to it as shed said it seemed someone was buried there a citizen of aix in the sixth century and look at this she said she was pointing to an alcove on their left ned saw a really old wall painting of a bull or a cow and below it an almost obliterated mosaic fragment he could make out a small bird part of some much larger work the rest of it was worn away these are even older kate said what was this place before where we are the forum was here centre of town the roman city was founded about a hundred and something years bc by a guy named sextius when the romans first started to take over provence from the celts he named it after himself aquae sextiae aquae because of the waters there were hot springs until recently thats why there are so many fountains have you seen them we just got here the cathedral was built on top of the forum uhhuh theres a sketch of it on the wall where your dad is now was like the major intersection of the roman town thats whythats why i still dont understand someone being buried here back then well it was hundreds of years after wasnt it it says sixth century she looked dubious it was still taboo im almost sure google it later or i will boy detective kate sounded as if she was trying to tease but didnt actually feel like it ned could relate he shook his head again he still wasnt quite sure what he was doing or why he looked at that faded bull on the wall it sure didnt look like any church art he knew this place was really old he shivered and perhaps because of that because he felt scared he walked quickly back knelt again by the grate put both hands on it and pulled it was heavier than hed expected he managed to shift it a bit making the scraping sound theyd heard before the man had broken some clasp or catch ned saw he just had to lift and slide but help me this suckers heavy are you insane nobut my fingersll be crushed if you dont she moved to the part hed levered up and on her knees beside him helped slide it over there was an opening now large enough for a small man or a teenaged boy to get through you are not going down there kate said i am not staying to watch i bequeath you my ipod ned replied handing it to her and then before he had time to think about it and get really frightened he put his feet over the edge of the pit turned so he was facing the side and lowered himself just as he did he started thinking about snakes or scorpions or rats skittering through the dark ancient space below insane wasnt a bad word to use he decided his feet touched bottom and he let go he looked down couldnt even see his running shoes you wouldnt by any chance have take this said the girl named kate in the same moment she handed him a small red metal flashlight i keep one in my pack for walks at night efficient of you remind me ned said to introduce you to someone named melanie he turned on the beam you going to bother telling me why you are doing this she asked from above would if i knew he said truthfully he shone the beam along the dark grey stones beside and below him he knelt the slabs were damp cold really big like for a roadwhich is what shed said theyd been on his right the foundation wall was close below the grate straight ahead the flashlight lit the short distance to the sunken well which was dry now of course he saw worn steps the beam picked out a rusted pipe sticking out attached to nothing there were spiderwebs entangling it no snakes no rats yet to his left the space opened into a corridor hed been expecting that actually that was the way back towards the main part of the cathedral where the placard on the wall had said a tomb would be ned took a deep breath remember he said the ipods yours dont delete the led zep or coldplay he bent low because he had to he didnt get very far maybe twenty steps it didnt go farther it just hit another wall hed be right under the first nave here he thought the roof was really low his flashlight beam played along the rough damp surface in front of him it was sealed closed off nothing that even vaguely resembled a tomb it looked like there were just the two corridors from the grate to the well and this one where are you kate called im okay its closed up theres nothing here like he said maybe this whole opening was just for getting down to fix the pipes plumbing bet there are other pipes and more grates around the other side of the well ill go look she called does this mean i dont get the ipod ned laughed startling himself as the sound echoed and it was then as he turned to go back that the bright narrow beam of kates flashlight playing along the corridor illuminated a recessed space a niche cut in the stone wall and ned saw what was resting in it chapter ii he didnt touch it he wasnt that brave or that stupid the hairs were actually standing up on the back of his neck another grate kate called cheerfully from above maybe you were right maybe after they covered up the roman street they just needed i found something he said his voice sounded strained unnatural the flashlight beam wavered he tried to hold it steady but the movement had illuminated something else and he looked at this now another recess the same thing in it he thought at first then he realized it wasnt not quite the same found what do you mean kate called her voice only a few steps away and up seemed to ned to be coming from really far off from a world hed left behind when he came down here he couldnt answer he was actually unable to speak he looked the beam wobbling from one object to the other the first one set in an eggshaped hollow in the wall and mounted carefully on a clay base was a human skull he was quite certain this wasnt from any tomb down here it was too exposed too obviously set here to be seen this wasnt a burial the base was like the kind his mother used on the mantelpiece or the shelves on either side of the fireplace back home to hold some object shed found in her travels an artifact from sri lanka or rwanda this skull had been placed to be found not laid to some dark eternal rest the second object made that even clearer in a precisely similar hollowedout recess beside the first and set on an identical clay rest was a sculpture of a human head it was smooth worn down as if with age the only harsh line was at the bottom as if it had been decapitated jaggedly severed at the neck it looked terrifying speaking or signalling to him across centuries a message he really didnt want to understand in some ways it frightened him even more than the bones hed seen skulls before you made jokes like with the one in science lab alas poor yorick such a terrible name hed never seen anything like this carving someone had gone to great pains to get down here hollow out a place fit it to a base beside a real skull in an underground corridor leading nowhere and the meaning waswhat what is it kate called ned youre scaring me he still couldnt answer her his mouth was too dry words werent coming then forcing himself to look more closely by the light of the flashlight beam ned saw that the sculpted head was completely smooth on the top as if bald and there was a gash in the stone facea scarring of italong one cheek and up behind the ear he got out of there as fast as he could they sat in the cloister in morning light side by side on a wooden bench ned hadnt been sure how much farther he could walk before sitting down there was a small tree in front of them the one on the cover of the brochure it was bright with springtime flowers in the small quiet garden they were close to the door that led back into the cathedral there was no breeze here it was a peaceful place his hands holding kates red flashlight were still trembling he must have left melanies brochure in the baptistry he realized theyd stayed just long enough to close the grate dragging it back across the open space scraping it on the stone floor he hadnt even wanted to do that but something told him it needed to be done covering over what lay below tell me said kate she was biting her lip again a habit obviously he drew a breath and looking down at his hands and then at the sunlit tree but not at the girl told about the skull and the sculpted head and the scar oh god she said which was just about right ned leaned back against the rough wall what do we do kate asked tell thethe archaeologists ned shook his head this isnt an ancient find think about it a second what do you mean you said i said it looked old but those things havent been there long cant have been kate people must have been down there dozens of times more than that thats what archaeologists do theyll have gone looking at thoseroman street slabs searching for the tomb studying the well the font she said thats what it is not a well whatever but point is that guy and me were not the first people down there people would have seen and recorded andand done something with those things if theyd been there a long time theyd be in a museum by now thered be stuff written about them theyd be on that tourist thing on the wall kate what are you saying im pretty sure someone put them there just a little while ago he hesitated and carved out the spaces for them too oh god she said again she looked at him in the light he could see her eyes were light brown like her hair she had freckles across her nose and cheeks you think forour guy to see our guy he didnt smile though he would have another time his hands had stopped shaking he was pleased to see he nodded the head was him for sure bald the scar yeah it was there for him okay um put there by who i mean whom he did smile a little this time youre hopeless im thinking out loud boy detective got your cereal box badge left it behind yeah you left this too she fished his brochure out of her pack he took it from her you gotta meet melanie he said again he looked at the guide the picture on the cover had been taken this same time of year the flowers on the tree were identical he showed her nice she said its a judas tree whos melanie figured that shed know the tree my dads assistant he has three people with him and someone from the publisher coming and me and what do you do he shrugged hang out crawl into tunnels he looked around anything here fresh air i was getting sick inside me too down there i shouldnt have gone probably not they were silent a moment then kate said in a bright fake tourguide voice the columns show bible tales mostly david and goliath is over there she pointed to their right ned got up and walked over his legs seemed okay his heart was still pretty fast as if hed finished a training run he saw a linked pair of round columns supporting a heavy square one which in turn held up the walkway roof on the top square were carved two intertwined figures a smoothfaced man above the much larger head and twistedover body of another one david and goliath he looked back at kate who was still on the bench jeez how did you figure this out she grinned i didnt im cheating theres another guide thing on the wall farther down i read it when i came through from outside the queen of sheba is on the other side she gestured across the garden towards the walkway opposite because she was pointing ned looked that way which he wouldnt have done otherwise and because he was standing where he was he saw the rose resting against the two round columns of another pillar on the far side and it was thenjust thenthat he began to feel really odd it wasnt fear that had been in him awhile by then or excitement this was like something unblocking or unlocking changingjust about everything really slowly he went around that way along the shaded cloister walk past the door to the street that kate had used to get in he would have gone out that way with her a moment before only a moment and the story would have stopped for them he went along that side and turned up the far one opposite where theyd been kate was still sitting on the wooden bench the green backpack on the stone paving beside her ned turned his eyes to the pillar in front of him with the single rose leaning between the two columns he looked at the carving it wasnt the queen of sheba he was as sure of that as hed been about anything in his life whatever the printed sheet on the wall might tell you that wasnt who this was they didnt always know the people who wrote brochures and guidebooks they might pretend but they didnt always know he was aware of kate getting up and coming towards him now but he couldnt take his eyes from the woman on the pillar this was the only one of all the slender doubled columns here that had a fulllength figure on it his heart was pounding again she was worn almost completely away ned saw more eroded than any of the other smaller carvings hed passed he didnt know why that was at first and then because of what was opening up inside him he thought he did know she had been made this way barely carved into the stone the features less sharply defined meant to fade to leave like something lost from the beginning she was delicately slender he saw and would have been tall you could still see elegant careful details in the tunic she wore and the robe that swept to her ankles he could see braided hair falling past her shoulders but her nose and mouth were almost gone worn away and her eyes could barely be seen even so ned had a sensean illusion of a lifted eyebrow something ironic in that slim grace he shook his head this was an eroded sculpture in an obscure cloister it should have been completely unremarkable the kind of thing you walked right past getting on with your life ned had a sense of time suddenly the weight of it he was standing in a garden in the twentyfirst century and he was sharply aware of how far back beyond even a medieval sculpture the history of this ground stretched men and women had lived and died here for thousands of years getting on with their lives and maybe they didnt always go away after entirely it wasnt the sort of thought hed ever had before she was beautiful he said whispered it actually well solomon thought so said kate mildly coming to stand beside him ned shook his head she didnt get it did you see the rose he said what rose behind her kate dropped her pack and leaned forward over the railing that protected the garden there arentthere arent any rose bushes here she said after a while no i think he brought it put it here before he went inside he our guy you mean ned nodded and hes still here what he had just realized that last part himself the thought arriving as he formed the words hed been thinking reaching within trying to concentrate and it had come to him he was scaring himself now but there was something he could see in his minda presence of light or colour an aura ned cleared his throat you could run away from a moment like this close your eyes tell yourself it wasnt real or you could say aloud instead as clearly as you could manage lifting your voice you told us you were leaving why are you still up there he couldnt actually see anyone but it didnt matter things had changed he would place the beginning later as when hed walked across the cloister and looked at the almostvanished face of a woman carved in stone hundreds of years ago kate let out a small scream and stepped quickly back beside him on the walkway there was a silence broken by a car horn sounding from a nearby street if he hadnt been so certain ned might have thought that the experience underground had rattled him completely making him say and do entirely weird things then they heard someone reply eliminating that possibility i will now confess to being surprised the words came from the slanting roof above and to their right towards the upper windows of the cathedral they couldnt see him it didnt matter same voice kate whimpered again but she didnt run believe me said ned trying to sound calm im more surprised i guarantee i beat you both said kate please dont kill us it felt so strange to ned over and above everything else to be standing next to someone who was actually speaking words like dont kill us and meaning them his life hadnt prepared him for anything like this the voice from the roof was grave i said i wouldnt you also said youd done it before kate said i have then after another silence you would be mistaken in believing i am a good man ned would remember that hed remember almost everything in fact he said you know that your face is down in the corridor back there you went down that was brave a pause yes of course it is of course the voice was low clear precise ned realizedhis brain hadnt processed this properly beforethat hed spoken in english himself and the man had replied the same way i guess it isnt your skull beside it real bad joke someone might have liked it to be ned dealt with that or tried to and then something occurred to him in the same inexplicable way as before whowho was the model for her then he asked he was looking at the woman on the column he found it hard not to look at her silence above them ned sensed anger rising and suppressed inside his mind he could actually place the figure on the roof tiles now exactly where he was seen within silvercoloured i think you ought to go now the man said finally you have blundered into a corner of a very old story it is no place for children believe me he said again i do kate said with feeling believe me ned marriner felt his own anger kick in hard he was surprised how much of that was in him these days right he said run along kids well what am i supposed to do with thisfeeling i have in me now knowing this is not the goddamn queen of sheba knowing exactly where you are up there this is completely messed up what am i supposed to do with it after another silence the voice above came again more gently you are hardly the first person to have an awareness of such things you must know that surely as for what you are to do that hint of amusement again am i become a counsellor how very odd what is there to do in a life finish growing up most people never do find what joy there is to find try to avoid men with knives we are notthis story is not important for you neds anger was gone as quickly as it had flared that too was strange in the lingering resonance of those words he heard himself say could we be important for it since i seem to have no said the voice above them flatly dismissive as you just put it run along that will be best whatever it does to your vanity i am not as patient as i might once have been oh really not like when you sculpted her ned asked what cried kate again in that same instant there came an explosion of colour in neds mind and then of movement above and to their right a swift coiled blur hurtling down the man on the roof somersaulted off the slanting tiles to land in the garden in front of them his face was vivid with rage bone white he looked exactly like the sculpted head underground ned thought how did you know that the man snarled what did he tell you he was of middling height as ned had guessed he wasnt as old as the bald head might suggest could even be called handsome but was too lean as if hed been stretched pulled and the lack of hair accentuated that along with the hard cheekbones and the slash of his mouth his greyblue eyes were also hard the long fingers ned saw were flexing as if they wanted to grab someone by the throat someone ned knew who that would be but really really oddly he wasnt afraid now less than an hour ago hed walked into an empty church to kill some time with his music bored and edgy and frightened beyond any fully acknowledged thought for his mother only that last was still true an hour ago the world had been a different place tell me no one told me anything he said i dont know how i know these things i asked you that remember you just said im not the first ned said kate her voice creaked like it needed oiling this sculpture was made eight hundred years ago i know he said the man in front of them said a little more than that they saw him close his eyes then open them staring coldly at ned the leather jacket was slate grey his shirt underneath was black you have surprised me again it doesnt often happen i believe that ned said this is still not for you you have no idea of whatyou have no role i made a mistake back there if you wont go i will have to leave you there is too much anger in me i do not feel very responsible ned knew about that kind of anger a little you will not let usdo anything a movement of the wide mouth the offer is generous but if you knew even a little you would realize how meaningless it is he turned away a darkclad figure slender unsettlingly graceful last question ned lifted a hand stupidlyas if he were in class the figure stopped but didnt turn back to them he was as theyd first seen him from behind but lit by the april sun in a garden why now ned asked why here they could hear the traffic from outside again aix was a busy modern city and they were right in the middle of it the man was silent for what seemed a long time ned had a sense that he was actually near to answering but then he shook his head he walked across the middle of the cloister and stepped between two columns and over the low barrier back to the walkway by the door that led out to the street and world wait it was kate this time the man paused again his back still to them it was the girls voice it seemed to ned he wouldnt have stopped a second time for ned that was the feeling he had do you have a name kate called something wistful in her tone he did turn after all at that he looked at kate across the bright space between he was too far away for them to make out his expression not yet he said then he turned again and went out opening the heavy door and closing it behind him they stood where they were looking briefly at each other in that enclosed space separated in so many ways from the world ned in the grip of emotions he didnt even come close to understanding walked a few steps he felt as if he needed to run for miles up and down hills until the sweat poured out of him from here he could see the rose again between the two pillars behind the carving people said she was the queen of sheba it was posted that way on the wall how did he know they were wrong it was ridiculous directly in front of him the corner pillar was much larger than those beside itall four of the corners were this one he realized without much surprise had another bull carved at the top it was done in a style different from david and goliath and nothing at all like the woman two bulls now one in the baptistry fifteen hundred years ago and this one carvedif he understood properlyhundreds of years after that he stared at it almost angrily what do goddamn bulls have to do with anything he demanded kate cleared her throat new testament symbol of st luke ned stared at the creature at the top of the pillar in front of him i doubt it he said finally not this one not the old one inside either what are you saying now he looked over saw the strain on her face and guessed he probably looked a lot the same maybe they were kids someone had pointed a knife towards them and that was almost the least of it he looked at the sculpted woman where kate stood and felt that same hard tug at his heart again palecoloured stone in morning light almost entirely worn away barely anything to be seen as if she were a rendering of memory itself or of what time did to men and women however much theyd been loved and where had that idea come from he thought of his mother he shook his head i dont know what im saying lets get out of here need a drink detective he managed a smile coke will do fine kate knew where she was going she led him under the clock tower and past the city hall to a café a few minutes from the cathedral ned sat with his coke watched her sip an espresso without sugar impressed him he had to admit and learned that shed been here since early march on an exchange between her school in new york city and one here in aix her family had hosted a french girl last term and kate was with the girls family until school ended at the beginning of summer her last name was wenger she planned to do languages in university or history or both she wanted to teach or maybe study law or both she took jazz dance classes hed guessed something like that she ran three miles every second or third day in manhattan which was not what ned did but was pretty good she liked aix a whole lot but not mariechantal the girl she was staying with seemed mariechantal was a secret smoker in the bedroom they shared and a party girl and used kate to cover for her when she was at her boyfriends late or skipping class to meet him it sucks lying for her she said i mean shes not even really a friend sounds like a babe though got her phone number kate made a face you arent even close to serious and whys that because youre in love with a carving in a cloister thats why that brought them back a little too abruptly to what theyd been trying to avoid ned didnt say anything he sipped his drink and looked around the long narrow café had two small tables on the street but those had been taken so they were inside close to the door the morning traffic was busycars mopeds a lot of people walking the medieval cobblestones sorry kate wenger said after a moment that was a weird thing to say he shrugged i have no clue what to make of that sculpture or what happened she was biting at her lip again why was heour guywhy was he looking down there for whatever it was could it have been the font something about the water ned shook his head dont think so the skull and the carved head were the other way along the corridor he had a thought kateif someone was buried there theyd have walled him up right not left a coffin lying around she nodded her head sure so maybe he was thinking the wall might have just been opened up for some reason kate leaned back in her chair god ned marriner is this like a vampire story i dont know what it is i dont think so but you said he made that carving in the cloister you do know how old that thing is look forget what i said there i was a bit out of it nope she shook her head you werent when he came down from the roof i thought he was going to kill you and then he said when it was done he sighed youre going to ask how i knew he said it did cross my mind she said it without smiling bet mariechantal wouldnt bug me about it shed be clueless checking her eyeliner and her cellphone for text messages am i bugging you no does she really get text messages on her eyeliner kate still didnt smile something did happen to you back there yeah im all right now since he left i feel normal he tried to laugh wanna make out she ignored that which was what it deserved you figure its over just something to do withi dont know he nodded thats it something to do with i dont know he was joking too much because the truth was that although he did feel all right now sitting here with a girl from new york from now drinking a coke that tasted exactly the way it was supposed tohe wasnt sure whatever had happened was over in fact being honest with himself he was pretty certain it wasnt he wasnt going to say that though he looked at his watch i should check in before lunch i guess he hesitated this part was tricky but he was a long way from home and the guys who would needle him you got a phone number we can keep in touch she smiled if you promise no more comments on my roommate mariechantal my main squeeze thats a dealbreaker she made a face but tore a sheet out of a spiralbound agenda she pulled from her pack and scribbled the number where she was staying and her cellphone number ned took from his wallet the card on which melanie had neatly printed in green the villa address the code for the gate the house phone her mobile his fathers the canadian consulate and the numbers of two taxi companies shed put a little smiley face at the bottom when shed handed the card to him last night hed pointed out that she hadnt given him their latitude and longitude he read kate the villa number she wrote it down you have school tomorrow she nodded cut this morning cant tomorrow im there till five meet here after can you find it he nodded easy just down the road from the skull in the underground corridor she did laugh this time after a second they paid for their drinks and said goodbye outside he watched her walk away through the morning street then he turned and went back the other way along a road laid down two thousand years ago chapter iii the morning shoot was wrapping when ned got back he helped steve and greg load the van they left it in the cathedral square illegally parked but with a windshield permit from the police and walked to lunch at an openoven pizza place ten minutes away the pizza was good neds father was irritable that wasnt unusual during a shoot especially at the start but ned could tell his dad wasnt really unhappy with how things had gone this first morning he wouldnt admit that but it showed edward marriner sipped a beer and looked at ned across the table anything inside i need to know about even when ned was young his father had asked his opinions whenever ned was with him on a shoot when ned was a kid it had pleased him to be consulted this way he felt important included more recently it had become irksome as if he was being babied in fact more recently extended right up to this morning he realized something had changed he said not too much i dont think pretty dark hard to find angles like you said its all jumbled you should look at the baptistry though on the right when you go in theres light there and it is really old way older than the rest he hesitated the cloister was open i got a look in there too the important cloisters in arles melanie said dabbing carefully at her lips with a napkin for someone with a green streak in black hair she was awfully tidy ned thought whatever this one looked good he said you could set up a pretty shot of the garden but if you dont want that you might take a look at some of the columns he hesitated again then said theres david and goliath other bible stuff saints on the four corners one sculptures supposed to be the queen of sheba shes really worn away but have a look his father stroked his brown moustache edward marriner was notorious for that oldfashioned handlebar moustache it was a trademark he had it on his business card signed his work with two upward moustache curves people sometimes needled him about it but hed simply say his wife liked the look and that was that now he said looking at his son ill check both tomorrow weve got two more hours cleared so ill use them inside if greg says the stitched digitals this morning are all right and we dont have to do them again will i need lights inside for sure ned said maybe the generator i have no idea how the powers set up depending what you want to do in the cloister you may want the lights and bounces there too melanie said they do concerts inside greg said theyll have power the baptistrys off to one side bring the generator greg dont be lazy edward marriner said but he was smiling bearded greg made a face at ned steve just grinned melanie looked pleased probably because ned seemed engaged and she saw that as part of her job ned wasnt sure why he was sending the team inside maybe taking photos tomorrow the sheer routine of itshouted instructions clutter film bags and cables lights and lenses and reflectorswould take away some of the strangeness of what had happened it might bring the place back to nowfrom wherever it had been this morning it also occurred to him that hed like a picture of that woman on the column he couldnt have said why but he knew he wanted it he even wanted to go back in to look at her again now but he wasnt about to do that his father was going to walk around town after lunch with two cameras and blackandwhite film to check out some fountains and doorways that barrett the art director had made notes about when he was here oliver lee had apparently written something on aixs fountains and the hot springs the romans had discovered kate wenger had just told him about those she just about forced you to call her a geek that girl for the book neds father had to balance the things he wanted to photograph with pictures that matched lees text that was partly barrett reinhardts job to merge the work of two important men in a big project his idea apparently was to have smaller blackandwhite pictures tucked into the text that lee had written along with marriners fullpage or doublepage colour shots ned didnt feel like looking at fountains he knew what he did need to do greg was going back up to the villa to upload the digitals from this morning and check them on the monitor he was also going to confirm by phone the arrangements for shooting in arles about an hour away the day after tomorrow melanie handed greg detailed instructions about that printed in her usual green ink ned saw a smiley face at the bottom of the card he was pleased to see he wasnt the only one she did that to he rode back with greg in the van changed into a fadedout grey tshirt and shorts clipped on his water bottle and pedometer put the ipod in its armband and went for a run he had essays to write here and a training log to complete for his track coach both were homework really the running was better melanie had told him the night before that if he went down their laneway and turned right at the road instead of left towards town then kept going as it curved back uphill hed end up eventually where the road ended at some area where people biked and jogged in the countryside she said there was supposed to be an old tower up there to look at it irritated him as usual that she was organized to the point of planning his training routes but he had no better idea where to go and there wasnt a good reason not to try that path it was a steep downhill on their little road past the other villas and then steadily back up for a long winding way along the ridge above upanddown was good of course ned ran on the crosscountry team this was what he needed hed begun to think hed gone wrong before he finally came to the car barrier on the other side of it he found the trail there were arrows on a wooden pole pointing one way towards a village called vauvenargues and in the other direction to that tower melanie had mentioned someone went by on a mountain bike towards vauvenargues ned went the other way the tower wasnt far the trail continued down and around it towards the northern edges of aix it looked like ned didnt like to stop during a run no one did but the view from up here was pretty cool and so was the round ruined lookout tower he wondered how old it was this whole place was just saturated in the past he thought layers and layers of it it could get to you one way or another he took off the earbuds and drank some water there was a low really lame fence around the tower a sign said it was dangerous to cross and a bigger fence had been authorized and was coming but there was no one in sight now so ned went over the railing and then he bent and stepped into the tower through a crumbled opening in the honeycoloured stones it was dark inside after the sunlight there was no door anywhere just the one broken opening he looked up in a high empty space he could see the sky a long way above a small circle of blueblack it was as if he were at the bottom of a well there were probably bats he thought there must have been a stairway once winding up but there was nothing now he wondered what this had guarded against what theyd been watching for up here he felt himself cooling down too much in the shade not good you pulled muscles that way he stepped back into the sunshine blinking and gazed down at the city there was an aqueduct in the distance on the far side of aix vividly clear after a moment ned spotted the bell tower of the cathedral in the middle of town and that brought him back to this morning he was nowhere close to wanting that he turned and started running again back the way hed come but with the stop and cooling down and jet lag he had lost his rhythm he found it harder going than he should have past the car barrier and downhill now along the road it was a good jogging route though had to give melanie credit next time he could go the other way at the signpost keep going log his proper distance he was halfway back up their own steep road leading to villa sans souci at the top when he realized something he stopped running having actually shocked himself why now he had said and the man in the grey leather jacket hadnt replied maybe ned had an answer after all maybe it even mattered for the first time that when she was alive his grandmother had told him some of her old stories ned walked thoughtfully up the last part of the hill and punched the gate code to get onto the property he paced up and down the terrace for a bit stretching he thought about jumping in the pool but it wasnt that warm and he went upstairs and showered instead dropping his clothes in the hamper for the cleaning help the villa had been rented with two women to work for them both were named vera which made for challenges greg had named them veracook and veraclean pulling on his jeans ned went down and into the kitchen he got a coke from the fridge veracook clad in black grey hair pulled tightly in a bun was there she had baked some kind of hard biscuits he took one from by the stove she smiled approval greg was on his cellphone in front of the computer in the dining room so the house line was free ned went back upstairs and into his fathers bedroom and dialed the mobile number kate wenger had given him bonjour um hi im looking for mariechantal screw you ned but she laughed miss me already how sweet he felt himself flush was glad she couldnt see it i just came in from a run um i realized something that you did miss me im flattered she was sassy on the phone he thought he wondered how she was on im or texting everyone got looser online no listen um its april thirtieth on thursday then may day kate was silent he was wondering if hed have to explain then heard her say jeez ned beltaine thats a major deal ghosts and souls like halloween how do you know this you a closet nerd my moms familys from wales my grandmother told me some of this stuff we used to go on a picnic sometimes on the first of may want to go on a picnic if you bring mariechantal he hesitated kate where were the celts around here were they here yeah they were i can find out where i can too i guess no you leave the heavy lifting to me grasshopper you just keep running and hopping see you tomorrow after school see you he hung up grinning in spite of himself it was nice he thought to meet a girl in a situation where he didnt have to explain her or what was going down to the other guys privacy that was the thing you didnt get a lot of it back home they had dinner at the villa french time after eight oclock the clear understanding melanie explained seriously was that they had to eat here every so often or veracook would get insulted and depressed veradepressed greg said and start burning their food and stuff like that before they ate neds father took a vodka and tonic out on the terrace while the others went into the pool melanie tiny as she was looked pretty good in a bathing suit ned decided she made a big deal about the water being freezing cold it was but got herself in steve was a swimmer had the long arms and legs he was methodically doing laps or trying tothe pool wasnt really big enough as ned and his father sat watching them greg suddenly burst through the terrace doors sprang down the wide stone steps across the grass and cannonballed into the water wearing the baggiest most wornout bathing suit ned had ever seen edward marriner laughing offered an immediate pay bonus if greg promised to use their next coffee break to buy a new swimsuit in town and spare them the sight of this one again melanie shouted a suggestion that greg could skinnydip if he wanted to save the money greg splashing and whooping in the frigid water threatened to take her up on it you wouldnt dare she said and why not melanie laughed shrinkage in cold water male pride end of story you have greg said after a moment a point steve who had stopped his laps laughed aloud up on the terrace ned looked at his father and they exchanged a smile you okay so far his dad asked im good a small hesitation momll call tomorrow i know they looked at the others in the water veracook will have decided they are insane edward marriner said shed have figured it out eventually said ned they left it at that they didnt talk a whole lot these days ned had overheard a couple of his parents conversations at night about fifteen years old and mood swings it had made him think about being totally affectionate for a couple of weeks just to mess with their heads but it felt like too much work ned didnt mind his father though it got old after a while watching people go dropjawed the way kate wenger had when they learned who he was but that wasnt anyones fault really mountains and gods was one of the bestselling photography books of the past ten years and passageways though less flashy it didnt have the himalayas his dad used to say had won awards all over the place his father was one of the few people who took pictures for both vanity fair and national geographic you had to admit that was cool if only to yourself when the others came shivering out of the pool to dry off melanie said hold it a sec forgot something what you forget steve said his yellow hair was standing up in all directions no possible way she stuck out her tongue at him and disappeared inside her room was the only bedroom on the main floor she came dripping back out still wrapped in her towel with another one around her hair now she was holding a bag that said france telecom she dropped it on the table in front of ned in case ground control needs to reach major tom she said shed gotten him a cellphone it was ned decided easy to be irritated with tiny melanie and her hyperefficiency but it was kind of hard not to appreciate her thanks he said really melanie handed him another of her index cards with his new phone number written out in green on it above another smiley face it has a camera too the package is open she added as he pulled out the box and the fliptop phone i programmed all our numbers for you ned sighed it was too easy to be irritated with her he amended inwardly i could have done that he said mildly i actually passed cellphone programming last year i did it in the cab coming back up here she said i have fast fingers she winked oh ho said greg chortling be silent baggy suit melanie said to him unless you are going to tell me that arles is up and running up and run your fast fingers over my baggy suit and ill tell you neds father shook his head and sipped his drink youre making me feel old he said stop it the house line is your dads im stevens greg is starpound keystarstarpound melanie said sweetly ned had to laugh even greg did melanie grinned triumphantly and went back in to shower and change greg and steve stayed out for a beer drying off in the mild evening light greg said it was warmer on the terrace than in the pool it wasnt even may yet neds father pointed out the french didnt start swimming until june usually there was water in the villas pool only as a courtesy to their idiocy the sun was west over the city there was a shining to the air the trees were brilliant a moment later the serenity of that provençal sunset was shattered by a startling sound then it came again after a braincramp moment ned recognized it the tune from disneylands kiddie ride its a small world the four of them looked around their gazes fell collectively upon neds new phone on the table warily he picked it up flipped it open held it to his ear forgot to mention melanie said from her own mobile in the house he heard her trying not to laugh i programmed a ringtone for you too tried to find something suitable this ned said grimly into the phone means war you do know that dont you oh ned she giggled i thought youd like it she hung up ned put the phone down on the glass tabletop he looked out for a second at the lavender bushes planted beyond the cypresses and the pool and then at the three men around the table they were each including his father struggling to keep a straight face when he looked at them they gave up toppling into laughter he couldnt sleep how unsurprising ned thought punching his pillow for the twentieth time and flipping it over again jet lag would be part of it on this second night overseas they were six hours ahead of montreal it was supposed to take a day for each hour before you adjusted unless you were an airline pilot or something but it wasnt really the time difference and he knew it he checked the clock by the bed again almost three in the morning the dead of night on april that might have another meaning ned thought hed have to remember to tell that one to kate wenger later today shed get the joke if he could keep his eyes open by then the way tonight was going he got up and went to the window which was open to the night air he had the middle bedroom of the three upstairs his dad was in the master greg and steve shared the last one he pulled back the curtain his window was over the terrace looking out at the pool and the lavender bushes and a clump of trees on the slope by the roadway if he leaned out and looked to his right he could see aixs lights glowing in the distance the moon was orangered hanging over the city close to full he saw the summer triangle above him even with moonlight the stars were a lot brighter than they were in westmount in the middle of montreal he wondered how they looked above darfur right now his mom would phone this eveningor tomorrow eveningwhatever you said when it was am the world will end before i ever find him in time he hadnt wanted to think about that but how did you control what you thought about anyhow especially at this hour half awake the mind justwent places dont think about pink elephants or girls breasts or when they wore skirts and uncrossed their legs sometimes in math class hed wander off in his thoughts for a run or think about music or a movie hed seen or what some girl hed never met had typed privately to him in a chatroom the night before if it was a girl there was always that to worry about online his friend doug was totally paranoid about it you thought about a lot of different things minute by minute through a day sometimes late at night you thought about a skull and a sculpted head in a corridor underground and that was going to be so helpful in getting to sleep ned knew so would brooding about what had happened inside him this morning after another minute irresolute he made an attempt to access locatewhatever word would suitthat place within himself again the place where hed somehow sensed the presence of the lean nameless man on the roof above them and where he had grasped another thing he had no proper way of knowing that the person up there todayright here right nowhad made the eighthundredyearold carving theyd been looking at kate had been right of course the mans response hurtling down to confront them white with rage had told them what they needed to know but ned couldnt feel anything inside now couldnt find whatever he was looking for he didnt know if that was because it was overa totally weird flicker of strangeness in the cloisteror if it was because there was nothing to find at this moment looking out over dark grass and water and cypress trees in the night there wasnt a whole lot of point standing here in sleep shorts thinking about it he decided to go down for a glass of juice on the way downstairs barefoot in a sleeping house he had an idea a good one actually when you couldnt do anything about the strange hard things you did what you could in other ways he had warned melanie after all she the everefficient one had rigged up a multicharger station for all the mobile phones on the sideboard in the dining room she had even been helpful enough to label everyones slot in green ink it was almost too easy working quickly through the options on each phone ned cheerfully changed gregs ring to the theme from spongebob squarepants and showed no mercy for steve innocent bystander though he might have been rejigging his cell to play the teletubbies song he left his fathers alone then he took his time scrolling thoughtfully through the choices on melanies phone a couple of times before deciding afterwards pleased with himself and his contribution to justice in the world he went and got his juice from the kitchen he took it out on the terrace standing shirtless in the night it was cold now his mother would have made him get a shirt or a robe if shed been up if shed been here he tried one more time to see if he could find something within himself feel attuned to anything nothing there he looked out across the landscape and saw only night pool and woods and grass to the south under stars a low moon west he heard an owl behind him there were trees all around the villa plenty of room for nests and hunting as it happens he is being watched in the small stand of trees beside the lavender bushes the figure observing him has long ago learned how to keep from being sensed in any of the ways ned marriner might know or discover by searching inside himself certain skills and knowledge are part of his heritage others have taken time and considerable effort he has had time and has never been fazed by difficulty hed seen the boy appear at the open window upstairs and then a little later watched him come outside half naked vulnerable and alone the observing figure is amused by this by almost all that has happened today but he does think about killing him it is almost too easy because of the day that is coming he holds himself in check if you are in the midst of shaping something urgently awaited you do not give way to impulses like this however satisfying they might be he is impulsive by nature but hardly a fool he has lived too long for that the boy he has decided is random trivial an accident not anyone or anything that matters and it is not a good idea to cause any disturbance now among either the living or the spirits some of them already beginning to stir he knows about the spirits he is waiting for them diverting himself as best he can while he does so he lets the boy go back inside alive and inconsequential the impulse to kill is still strong however he recognizes it knows why it is building when that desire comes it is difficult to put away unslaked he has found that to be so over time and is disinclined to deny himself he changes againthe skill he took so long in masteringand goes hunting moonlight briefly finds his wings in flight then they are lost again entering the woods chapter iv when ned came down to the kitchen in the morning blearyeyed from his disrupted sleep the others had already gone into town second work session at the cathedral there was a note from melanie that said theyd be back by lunchtime hed neglected to put on a shirt and veraclean in the adjacent laundry room smiled at him before pointedly glancing away hed forgotten about her he quickly drank some orange juice and went back upstairs to dress then he phoned melanie three rings yes a really frosty tone for one word he thought impressive hi there he said cheerfully ned marriner she said low and intense you are in so much trouble you have no idea you are pushing up daisies meeting your maker joining the choir he heard her beginning to laugh fighting it damn he said im talented after all talented and dead sleeping with the fishes but melanie he protested id thought youd like it the wedding march the wedding march as a ringtone were in a goddamned cathedral greg is in hysterics hes holding a pillar to stay upright he is peeing on it you will be made to suffer she sounded pleasingly hysterical herself it was all very satisfying im sure in the meantime you might want to phone steve and greg when you get a chance she paused lowered her voice really you got them too got them too see you at lunch he hung up grinning on considered reflection he decided to keep his new phone hidden away for the next little while there wasnt much he could do if she decided to shortsheet his bed but he doubted shed like garden snails in hers and an offhand mention of the possibility might stave off retaliation he thought he could handle greg and steve melanie was the challenge he loafed around the house for the morning energetically avoiding any thought of the papers he was supposed to be writing he was still jetlagged wasnt he who could possibly be expected to write an english or history essay while timewarped despite what kate wenger had said he spent a bit of time online googling celts provence and scribbled a few notes then he went outside in the bright morning and listened to music on the terrace till he saw the van making its way up the hill to the villa gates he took off the ipod and put it on the table he had a premonition of what was coming he sat up in the lounger and waved an enthusiastic hello to everyone his father waved back from the driveway melanie stood by the van hands on hips trying to achieve a withering glarewhich was hard when you were barely five feet tall ned thought greg and steve smiling benignly came up to the terrace together still smiling they grabbed ned by hands and legs pretty strong guys both of them and began lugging him down the steps and across the grass to the pool spongebob spare me ned cried perhaps unwisely he heard melanie and his father laugh which was pleasing but by then he was flying it was cold in the pool it was really cold in the pool gasping and coughing ned surfaced he knew what to say there were timehonoured male ways of responding to this ahh he said very refreshing thank you so much guys ned carefully mentioned snails over lunch outsidehow hed heard they had a creepy habit of ending up in peoples beds here especially in springtime interestingly it was steve who grew thoughtful hearing that melanie pretended to treat it as a dubious piece of misinformation it was hard to tell if she was faking or not neds father in a surprisingly relaxed state said hed shot some potentially workable images in the baptistry shooting towards the dome with soft flash bounces theyd also done some of the columns in the cloister and a zigzag pattern hed noticed out there on the walkway ned hadnt seen that but he didnt have his fathers eye and hed been just a bit unsettled the day before out there i really liked your queen of sheba his father said the colours gorgeous like amber from some angles well check the images later but i think im going to want to have her ill go back if i need to before we go home maybe try late in the day too two good calls ned he was meeting oliver lee at a café in town this afternoon just the two of them first actual encounter barrett the art director was coming over from new york next week and had wanted to be there but both men had decided to get together without an intermediary i may or may not like him but it doesnt matter in the end we dont have to work together and you know hell love you ned grinned the cold water had woken him up pretty effectively longlost cure for jet lag freezing pools everyone loves me edward marriner said even my son your son said melanie darkly is a terrible person really greg agreed shaking his head steve kept quiet possibly thinking about snails in his bed ned decided he was going to have to do the snail thing at some point and live with the consequences it turned out the three others were going to drop his father in town then drive east towards mont saintevictoire which paul cézanne had apparently painted like a hundred times the painter had been born and died here he was aixs main celebrity and hed made the mountain famous ned remembered his father grumbling about cézanne on the flight over leafing through barrett reinhardts notes how it was almost impossible to get a picture of that mountain that wasnt a cliché or some sentimental tribute to the painter he wasnt looking forward to it but barrett had said it was simply not possible to be in provence working on a book of photographs and not shoot that peak especially if you were edward marriner and known for your mountainscapes simply not possible his dad had repeated on the plane imitating the art directors voice this afternoons drive would be partly an outing in the country and partly to check some places barrett had marked on local maps as where they might set up neds father would make that call himself but the others were good at eliminating locations they knew he wouldnt go for you coming steve asked ned ah i have to be in town by fiveish actually im meeting someone who what how greg demanded we just got here ned sighed i met a girl yesterday morning were having a coke holymoly said melanie grinning greg was staring a date already jeez the boys a man among men dont rush him or me edward marriner said i feel old enough as is well get you back in time melanie said checking her watch but change into running shoes ned we may climb a bit sandals are no good okay but will you tie my shoelaces for me ned asked melanie grinned again he was glad the subject had changed this date thing was not something he was easy with they dropped his father in aix and then took the ring road around the city and headed into the countryside along a winding route melanie said cézanne used to walk along to find places to paint it was a fair distance to the mountain if you were on foot ned thought about that in the nineteenth century the middle ages roman times people walked or rode donkeys or something and the road would have been way rougher everything was farther slower back then and at the beginning of the twentyfirst century here they were cruising these curves in an airconditioned renault van and theyd be out by the mountain in twenty minutes or something and then back in the middle of town in time for him to meet kate wenger cézanne or the priests who had paced the worn walkway of yesterdays cloister or those longago medieval students whod prayed in the cathedral and then gone across the square to lectures they had all moved through worlds with different speeds than this oneeven if the students were late for class and running ned wasnt sure what all of that meant but it meant something maybe hed put it in an essaywhen he decided to think about his essays it was a brilliantly bright afternoon they were all wearing sunglasses melanies were enormous hiding half her face steves blond hair and tiny round shades made him look like a russian revolutionary greg looked like a nightclub bouncer ned on impulse took his shades off he decided he wanted to see this landscape the way people had seen it long ago he felt a bit silly but only a bit he thought about that round tower yesterday above the city men on watch there looking out this way he didnt know what theyd have been gazing east to see squinting into a rising sun but someone had feared danger from this direction or they wouldnt have built the tower there would they a more dangerous world than todays he thought unless you were in the sudan say he looked out the window trying to keep his mind here not let it drift that way to africa across the mediterranean not so far away in fact beside him in the middle row of the van melanie leaned over and whispered your dad was really pleased with your two ideas you know he spent a lot of time getting the baptistry shots he always takes his time ned said dont try to flatter your way out of doom woman this is war think about snails in your bed melanie shrugged i like escargot and actually if i compare the prospect to some of the men ive dated ned laughed but then he felt kind of young again he also thought not for the first time that women could be awfully strange if the men had been so dorky whyd she date them why sleep with them he looked sidelong at melanie almost asked her if theyd been alone he might have whatever else you could say about her melanie wasnt evasive she was funny and direct and she didnt actually treat him like a kid just as part of her job shed have answered he guessed he might have learned something he was getting to an age where a few things needed to be figured out one way or another there we are steve said pointing target acquired their first clear glimpse of the peak the upper part of it above the pine trees between the road curved again they lost sight of the mountain then got it again at the next switchback greg pulled over put on the flashers and they sat and looked the triangle of the western face of the saintevictoire rose commandingly above the plain and trees well this is a cézanne was here kind of shot melanie said dubiously we could probably get permission from the owners of one of these houses to set up on their property theyd passed a number of villas on the road okay so yeah we know we can do this what else is there if the man wants to go another way greg said he didnt sound excited either thats why were driving said steve greg pulled back onto the road after another few minutes winding back and forth they approached a village and saw a deadstraight double row of trees along another road meeting theirs from the right a sign said le tholonet there was a chateau on their left it looked like a government building now with a parking lot in front stop a sec steve said greg pulled to the side steve put his window down took off his own sunglasses eyeballing those trees plane trees melanie said theyre all over down here to protect the fields and vineyards from the wind ze mistral ze mistral greg cried in mockhorror she has nevair been zo bad as zis year mes amis and ze wolves paradise has curses melanie said the wind is one of them here and that is a terrible accent gregory she was laughing though she had a nice laugh ned thought nice smile too but they were still at war mercy was for wimps melanie leaned towards neds side looking out his window steve what are you thinking long shot from the top of that straight road theyre pretty gorgeous barrett didnt mark any of these did he move us up a bit greg after greg did steve took out a pocket camera and ripped a couple of fast digitals quality didnt matter in these ned knew they were just to let his father have a glance at what they were talking about steve said looking back at melanie you say there are others like this maybe we check some out later ask around where the best ones are is there anywhere the sun might set or rise along them that might be uhhuh greg said he had pulled right off the road again to where they could look along the double aisle of green good thought eastwest most of these the big winds north ned impressed reminded himself that his fathers people were always going to be competent really good at their jobs even if they might wear ridiculous swim trunks or write notes in green ink with smiley faces at the bottom the line of plane trees marched away from them evenly spaced framing the road on both sides the spring leaves making a canopy above he looked at them a moment out his rolleddown window then shook his head sorry but you wont get a sunset or sunrise he said too many leaves by now guys thats a winter shot greg and steve slowly turned around together in the front seat and stared at him scawy said greg vewy scawy what if he turns out to be like his old man imagine two of them and hes already picked up a chick here i think im going to make ned my new hero steve laughed replacing spongebob thats a major commitment wait till you see him on rollerblades said melanie ned shook his head at that one ack what did you do with someone like melanie right he said i blade just like my dad greg laughed and started the car again while melanie made a note of where they were she leaned forward and added another note she was logging distance off the odometer ned saw just ahead was a tjunction there was a largish restaurant on the right and a small café ahead with tables on both sides of the road that seemed to be all there was to le tholonet they went straight through a little farther along the road rose a bit the screening woods gave way and they had their first glimpse of the full mountain no trees between ned was impressed hard not to be seen this close mont saintevictoire completely dominated the landscape it wasnt huge you werent going to snowboard down it in winter or anything but there were no other mountains or hills around and the triangular peak was crisp and imposing at the very top ned saw a white cross well melanie said checking her notes barretts written money shot just ahead where theres a place to get off the road greg saw it and pulled over he turned the engine off and hit the flashers again they all got out the triangle loomed above a long green field there were trees to their left but none were in the way here it was a wideopen shot easy to frame the rocky slopes were lit by the afternoon light the mountain looked primitive and astonishing the four of them were silent awhile staring boss man wont like it steve said finally he put his sunglasses back on i know melanie said glumly she sighed theres a pulloverandsnapapicture thing going on here they might as well put up a kodak sign and picnic tables ned wasnt so sure actually the stony bleakness above the green meadow didnt say pretty to him it felt more powerful and unsettling than that he was going to say something but in the minute or so since theyd stopped and gotten out he had started to feel peculiar he kept his mouth shut steve took a few more digitals ill make a note but lets go on melanie said im gonna get worried about barrett reinhardt if this is his idea of a money shot the man wants to sell books said greg this is like a photo of a painting everyone knows comfort food they got back in ned swallowed tasted something metallic in his mouth he had no idea what this was veracooks lunch unlikely it was more of a headache than anything else and it had come on really fast he never got headaches if you didnt count the two times he and barry staley had drunk cheap wine at class parties and hed thrown up on the walk home i really shouldnt have remembered that he thought he did feel nauseous actually the road continued to twist and wind south of the mountain the swinging movement didnt help at all there were parking lots on their left where people could leave their cars and climb he saw a big wooden signboard with a map of the mountain trails on it there was a kind of needle in his head now as if someone had a sharp small lance and was jabbing it into his left eye repeatedly a humming sound too highpitched like a dentists drill the others were busy talking as they went greg stopping and starting the van the three of them eyeing angles along this side of the mountain approaches to a shot foreground middle ground melanie was going on about the history of the place it sounded as if theyd decided none of these spots by the road was going to work they were all too close to the mountain no way to frame it ned was hardly listening now he was just happy the three of them were busy and hadnt noticed him leaning against his door eyes closed behind the shades as if from a muffled distance he heard melanie reading from her notes history and geography maybe shed write an essay for him that was a thought he could buy her some escargot he managed to open his eyes there was a broad greengold plain ahead of them stretching east and south away from the mountain melanie was pointing that way ned couldnt follow what she was saying he closed his eyes again he tried to focus on her voice ride over the stabbing in his head the whole landscape will change now melanie was saying were directly south of the mountain everyone thinks of it as a triangle because thats the side cézanne mostly painted but from here its a long long ridge no triangle no peak and ahead where we turn north is pourrières where the battle was just past that well get to where he sent men for the ambush we take a look there greg said the ambush place yeah sure pain de munition its called look for a sign maybe well climb a bit a photo from where they waited oliver lee wrote a bit about the battle i think well yeah if theres a photo steve said he didnt sound happy the three of them tried hard to please his father ned knew they joked a lot teased but it was pretty obvious they were proud to be working for edward marriner he put a thumb to one temple and tried applying pressure it didnt help he had no idea what melanie was talking about what ambush what battle got a tylenol he asked she turned quickly whats wrong ned kind of a headache dork the guy doesnt say that on the date be quiet gregory melanie was fishing in the bottomless black tote tylenol advil aspirin which do you like advils better for a headache three choices figured advil please they were in a village now twisting through it then they seemed to be out and going north she gave him a couple of pills and some bottled water ned drank managed a wan smile there was no photograph worth taking here either they were east of the mountain now heading north to double back home along the other side but trees blocked their view heres your painful munitions place greg said thats how i feel ned muttered artillery in my head greg followed a bumpy gravel road a short distance past a sign strictly forbidding entry then braked to a halt ned was extremely happy when the car stopped okay campers out and scout greg said lets get higher and see whats what i dont think ill climb up if thats okay ned said he was afraid he was going to be sick the needle and drill had been joined by a hammer you guys do what you have to ill wait here he got out with them didnt want to throw up in the van he found a tree stump and sat down his back to the sun ill stay melanie said you two go up phone if you need me you call if you need us steve said looking at ned im fine melanie go and you arent fine youre halfway to green i like green but not in guys faces go on you two well be quick greg said ned felt acutely embarrassed partly because he was actually glad melanie was staying he had never fainted in his life but it crossed his mind that he might he closed his eyes again behind the shades it wasnt that hot but he seemed to be sweating his mouth was dry drink some more water melanie said bringing him the bottle she took off her big straw hat and put it on his head to block the sun do you get migraines never in my life you lots is it offcentre behind one eye you feel like theres an aura in your head whats an aura in my head feel like she laughed a little whos good at describing that stuff he heard her walking around i dont think theres gonna be a photo up there either she said the mountains just a treed slope from this side ned tried to function normally maybe he could shoot at sunrise from up on top of it looking down and out the opposite of cézanne sort of or look maybe dad just does the mountain from barretts spot and the book says this is what cézanne painted a hundred years ago your father be happy with that maybe probably not ned swallowed some more water pressed the bottle to his forehead under the hat what was this ambush about you dont need a history lesson now ned i need something to distract me have you ever fainted that bad oh ned ill call the others no just talk ill tell you if it gets worse it was worse he was waiting for the advil to do something useful she sighed okay this area right where we turned north was like the biggest battlefield one of those changethecourseofhistory things a roman named marius beat this massive army of barbarians who were marching to take rome if he hadnt stopped them here they might have people think what kind of barbarians couple of tribes joined together migrating from the northeast celts basically the romans called them barbarians but they called everyone that how massive he kept the bottle on his forehead really the books say two hundred thousand of them died here maybe more and they had their women and children with them the survivors became slaves thats a lot of people the romans took a bunch of the leaders and threw them down a pit called the garagai up on top of the mountain marius had a witch or wise woman who told him to do that because it was like a sacrifice place and so their spirits couldnt return and help the tribes that town where we turned up was later named pourrières which means putrefaction ick think about two hundred thousand rotting bodies id really prefer not to just now thanks is this revenge melanie no no no really oh ned im sorry but knowledge however you got it changed things ned marriner thought you couldnt go back to not knowing even if you wanted to and when you put what youd just heard together with other things specifically yesterday the feeling hed had in the cloister he felt it again right now that inward awareness unblocking unlocking abruptly ned pushed off the log and stood up his heart was pounding what shh wait afraid now not just in pain ned took off his sunglasses he opened his eyes in the toobright light pain danced and drilled in his brain but what he saw looking out towards the mountain was worse in what should have been the clear mild light of spring the trees and grass between them and the ridge of the mountain were bathedwere saturatedin a sickening darkred hue it was terrifying as though he were looking through some lurid camera filter the world lay drowned in the colour of blood and suddenly he could smell it too appalled horrified he felt as if he were tasting blood it was in his mouth his throat sticky thick clogging and he turned away and was violently ill by the tree stump then again and a third time wrackingly his guts turning inside out oh my god ned i should never have i dont think i like this place a whole lot he said breathing hard melanie had her phone out dont call them he said it was difficult to speak im justjust a migraine i guess too late she was talking fast to greg calling them back he couldnt honestly say he was unhappy about that he needed to get away from here to somewhere where he could try to deal with the undeniable fact that he seemed to be seeing and feeling the presence of massive violent death a slaughter the world soaked in blood yesterday a carving from eight hundred years ago and now this when did he took a steadying breath melanie when was this battle oh ned forget the damn battle here wipe your face she handed him one of those packaged wetwipes one more thing in her tote he did what she told him put his sunglasses back on sipped some water when was it please oh hell he heard her rummaging for her notes his eyes were closed again bc ive got why do you want to talk about that because i dont want to talk about throwing up okay two thousand one hundred years what happened when you fainted did your eyes roll up in their sockets could you die like if you banged your head on a rock or something he heard the guys coming down he kept his shades on he knew if he took them off hed see that redness again everywhere a world defined by dark blood the smell was still with him like meat a thick rotting helplessly just as the other two arrived ned heaved againdry convulsive nothing left in him jeez greg said youre really clocked out arent you lets roll well get you into veracooks hands and bed they got back in the van greg started it geared up and they continued north then left at a junction back along the other side of the mountain greg didnt slow down to look for photo spots now he was driving fast on a road not meant for it ned leaning against his door was aware of steve and melanie casting glances at him every few seconds he wanted to be bravethe heroic invalidbut it was hard when you kept smelling blood and the swinging motion of the van was no help and then halfway back along that winding stretch of road on the northern shoulder of mont saintevictoire he was fine he was absolutely fine it was gone a really bad taste in his mouth from throwing up but nothing more than that nothing but the memory and he knew it wasnt the miraculous properties of advil cautiously he took off his sunglasses no bloodred hue to the afternoon sky or the trees only memory and fear there was that too almost home melanie said in a worried voice im good ned said he looked at her honestly i am its gone no aura nothing you serious steve had turned and was staring at him really im not lying i have no idea what that was about that last part was a lie but what was he going to say food poisoning migraine jet lag melanie ticked them off he could hear relief in her voice it touched him actually guilt over what you did to our phones steve said from the front seat has to be that ned agreed im still taking you home greg said you can postpone your date till tomorrow no way ned said and it isnt a date its a coke at five oclock hah said greg he too was obviously happier now well well stop at the villa anyhow said melanie youve got time and its on the way you might want to shower and brush your teeth think of the girl please right and you can check my fingernails and ears and tie my shoelaces again double knot she laughed piss off ned i am way too young and cool for that she grinned you should be so lucky as to have me kneel in front of you ned felt himself flush greg snorted you cool with a bottomless bag like mary poppins no you arent mel he said sorry to break it to you she leaned forward and hit him on the shoulder dont fondle the driver greg said he started singing spoonful of sugar and steve joined him ned rolled down his window the air was crisp and clear wildflowers yellow and white and purple dotted the sides of the road they crossed over a small bridge the view along the ravine below was gorgeous he saw melanie checking it out too she scribbled something in her notebook that had actually been a really sexy line what shed said up front the guys were still singing that song from mary poppins melanie leaned forward and gave them each another futile whack with her notebook then she sat back and crossed her arms and tried to look aggrieved she saw him looking at her and winked of course he had to laugh melanie chapter v blood like really blood colour kate had another espresso in front of her ned had ordered orange juice this time shed arrived at the café about five minutes after him a bit breathless her school was halfway across town the two outdoor spots had been taken again all around their small table the interior was crowded with people talking loudly smoking reading papers shopping bags at their feet ned still wasnt used to the smoke it was everywhere here he nodded blood red and i could taste blood when i swallowed it made me sick but only near that battlefield it was over when we drove away she was staring at him brown eyes lightly freckled face she had her hair pulled back today was wearing torn jeans and a blueandwhite striped tank top with a mans white shirt over it unbuttoned sleeves rolled halfway up she looked pretty good ned thought he said if you dont believe me no one else is going to i cant even tell anyone else kate shook her head oh believe me i believe you she met his eyes and then looked away after yesterday id believe it if you said you saw the aliens mother ship thats next week he said she made a face you know anything about this marius he asked after a moment the battle there she bit her lip he was used to that already then she looked down at the tabletop ned laughed aloud aha of course you know i knew youd laugh she said why is it dumb to be interested in things ned looked at her it isnt he said tell me im not teasing welli actually wrote an essay about this oh god kate you kill me i have to tease you he stopped thought quickly waitmaybe i ah wont um do you have it here the essay she raised her eyebrows took her time answering ned marriner i am shockeddo you want to plagiarize my paper damn right i want to plagiarize your paper i have three essays to write in six weeks or ruin my summer back home well she said leaning back and grinning now ill have to think hard about that ive been needled a whole lot here and we just met you know you cant go around handing out a papers to just anyone ill buy your coffees ill buy you a better shirt this said kate wenger is my brothers shirt and i happen to like it a lot it is great truly great you look hot in it a babe tell me about marius do i really look hot hotter than mariechantal could ever dream of being that she sniffed is no achievement marius please she sipped her coffee she looked happy though ned felt kind of pleased with himself he was being funny making a girl laugh around them the place was vibrant with the clatter of dishes and cups and the buzz of talk one woman had a small dog under her chair that wouldnt have been allowed back home he liked it marius was julius caesars uncle kate said married caesars aunt a general in north africa at the time apparently a little guy tough smart young when this happenedlike maybe twentyfive or something well what it was is these eastern tribes started moving this way a lot of them with their women and children migrating looking for a place to settle they scared everyone huge men you know blond dudes pumped iron used steroids broke the home run record pretty much the romans were small did you know that i didnt know that why would i know that well they were but really organized anyhow these tribes the teutones and cimbrii hung around here awhile and beat up a roman army then half of them went west to spain but they came back again and decided what they really wanted was land around rome and they decided they were going to go kick ass there could they have everyone seems to think so thats the point of the story rome was terrified this is before their empire remember before caesar they hadnt even conquered here yet just some greek and roman trading colonies on the coastand sextius had founded this city aix their first one and so and so if the tribes got down into italy it was probably game over melanie said more than two hundred thousand whos melanie again my fathers assistant i told you yesterday she has notes on everything what a geek kate grinned way way more than two hundred thousand some people say half a million with the women and children some say more ned whistled softly it seemed called for someone glanced over and he grimaced an apology he tried to imagine that many people moving across a landscape and gave up he couldnt visualize it just got an image of computergenerated orcs anyhow kate said rome ordered marius here from africa and he took charge theyd been creamed by the tribes in that first battle and all the soldiers were afraid of them but he won spoiling the ending you yeah he won from what i gather he steered them into a trap by the mountain he had a better position and when the fight started some of his men ambushed the celts camp where their families were when they turned to defend them the romans just pounded on them from behind and it was a massacre thats your two hundred thousand dead marius saves the day they built him monuments around here but theyve all fallen down ned looked at her awhile youre good you know she shrugged google is your friend nope youre good he finished his orange juice so like if he hadnt beat them theyd have taken rome maybe no roman empire celts settle italy really different world this battle was a huge deal ned shook his head why doesnt anyone know this stuff you kidding people dont even know world war two he looked at her i really need that paper of yours ill bet you do ill think about it she hesitated i mean no of course ill give it to you but doesnt it seem pretty trivial after what kate it seems completely trivial essays are you kidding me but if i think too much about this afternoon or yesterday ill freak theresnothing now inside you he faked a shrug im too distracted by that waycool tank top of yours no jokes tell me i told you nothing today since we left the battlefield nothing yesterday from the time our guy walked out on us nothing have you tried to she trailed off tried to what he knew he was sounding irritated and knew it was unfair control it you gonna play yoda now use the force young ned stop joking i have to joke or ill go screwy with this be grateful you arent dealing with it she was silent a moment i am she said i am grateful but i was there too im not trying to hassle you ned felt ashamed im not being cool am i sorry hard to be cool if youre tasting blood and stuff yeah he couldnt think of anything else to say kate waved her hand for the bill okay ill take off call me tomorrow if you like after school dont go yet he said quickly she looked at him itheres no one else i can talk to i need to touch base if you dont mind i said call me i meant it she flushed a little he sighed i did try actually middle of last night to see if i could feel anything problem is i have no idea what im supposed to be doing or controlling maybe i do need a jedi master not me young ned i can give you an essay though want me to email it thatd be good she took out her notebook and he gave her his hotmail address and added his new cell number reminds me she said you asked about celts where they were around here and of course you found out google is your friend google is my midnight lover im not sure im ready to hear that actually she laughed they were all over the area which figured theres one place ive seen that we can walk to if you want above the city the waiter came by and they paid for their drinks might as well ned said cant tomorrow were going to arles she nodded day after thursday meet after school say outside cézannes studio can you find it we have to go that way ill find it where are we going its called entremont where the celts were based before the romans built this city okay ill be outside that studio at five ill call you tomorrow when we get back from arles cool she got up stuffed the notepad in her pack they walked out together on the street he turned to her thanks kate she shrugged down boy you may not like the essay now whos joking she made a face okay youre welcome call me she gave him a little flipwave with one hand then turned and walked along the cobblestones he watched her go inside the café the man in the grey leather jacket two tables over from where theyd been puts down his newspaper there is no need to hide his face any more he might have learned something here he is thinking a thread a way into the labyrinth this is a possibility no more than that but it is that when you were in urgent need and time was very short and your enemy had most of the weaponsat this pointyou used tools like these two children and prayed to your gods in one way it is obvious in another the girl is entirely right there are too many choices here and from where he isoutside the fireshe has no easy way to narrow them down there are still too many places that hasnt changed but hes decided something sitting hereand these two are at the heart of it despite what he said to them yesterday the boy from the start from before the baptistry since hes being truthfuland he always is with himself he isnt certain about the girl hed waited and watched them from a distance yesterday after leaving the cloister saw them walk here made an assumption theyd be back if hed been wrong if they had met elsewhere not after school or not at all he wouldnt have been unduly disturbed few things affect him that much any more when he is in the world again when he returns his is an entirely focused existence he is only ever alive for one thing well two really at the same time he wasnt surprised when they did show up here nor by what he heard the girl say from behind the screening pages of le monde they have no business going where they are going two days from now but he might he might have many lives worth of business there or not he might lose this time before it even begins it has happened it is unfair an unbalanced aspect of the combat but he has long since moved beyond thinking that way what is fairness in this dance his sitting here is in the end just a feeble reaching out for signsfrom two children who have nothing to do with the tale at the same time he has learned hes had a long time to learn that little is truly coincidence things fall into patterns you can miss patterns or break them but they are there hed acted upon that yesterday and now he finds a few coins drops them on the table rises to go why didnt i know you were here he looks up his way out is blocked he is actually startled the sensation is truly strange a lost feeling remembered for no easy reason he suddenly has an image of his first time here walking through the forest from the landing place invited but uncertain afraid so far from home then coming out of the woods the lit fires he sits down again he gestures the boy is standing between the table and the door he sits gingerly opposite edge of chair as if ready to bolt not a bad instinct all things considered the newspaper lies on the table between them folded back hed been reading the forecast wind clear skies there will be a full moon thursday hed known that of course the boy has spoken in english the man says gravely in the same language you have surprised me again brave of you to come back i take it you sent the girl away ned marriner shrugs he has dark brown hair and light blue eyes a lean build medium height wiry rather than strong barely old enough to shave his face is pale he will be dealing with tension and fear fair enough welcome to my world the man thinks but doesnt say he doesnt feel welcoming no she just went i dont send her places i didnt know anything till i was outside and besides im the one feelingwhatever this is if youre dangerous theres no reason for her to be here dangerous he smiles at that you have no idea i said i wouldnt kill you but there are others who might view your presence differently i know i have no idea but what does my presence mean my presence where he stops to control himself his voice has risen and why didnt i know you were here until i got outside yesterday i that last he decides to answer i was careless i was screening myself from you after yesterday in the cloister but i thought youd gone and so i let it down i had gone i dont even know why i checked inside i was halfway across the market square he considers that then you are stronger than you knew i dont know anything the boy says again his voice is lower now intense there was someone like this long ago a vague sense tugs at him but there are too many years between he has been here so many times ned marriner leans back folding his arms defensively across his chest i have no idea who you are or what happened to me yesterday or today if you heard us talking about that he nods the mountain so what is this about the boy demands he really shouldnt be using that tone you said we were an accident had no role to play but you followed or waited for us he is clever it seems followed yesterday waited just now i took a chance youd come back but why the waiter is hovering he signals for another of what each of them was drinking a mild curiosity rises he still has some of that it seems you dont feel reckless interrogating me like this im scared out of my mind if you want the truth but that isnt the truth he says who did this one remind him of you came back by choice youre demanding answers of me and yet you know that i sculpted a column eight hundred years ago no youre frightened but not ruled by it i probably should be the boy says in a small voice it isnt a column either its a woman the quick familiar anger a sense of intrusion violation rude feet trampling in something private beyond words he makes himself move past it by todays standards this one is young can still properly be called a boy in the past he could have been a war leader at his age fit for challenging killing he has killed children the world has changed he has lived through the changes at intervals coming and going enmeshed in the long pattern sometimes he wants it over mostly he is terrified heartscalded that it might end you could grow weary beyond measure feeling all those things at once the waiter comes back an espresso an orange juice the brisk habitual motions he waits until the man leaves he says still speaking english for privacy once this awareness comes to you it can be a kind of anchor against fear you know what you are feeling know a new thing is in you the fear lies in not understanding why but already youre not the person you were yesterday morning he sips his espresso puts the cup down adds quietly you never will be again a cruel thing to say perhaps he isnt beyond enjoying that thats scary too i imagine it is he remembers his own first awareness of this boy decisions made quickly they look at each other the boy glances down few people meet his gaze for long he finishes his coffee frightened or not you came back you could have kept walking youre inside now then you need to tell me what im inside another flaring within i need to do nothing use words more cautiously or what opposing anger across the table interestingly he really isnt accustomed to talking this much any more or what the boy demands again youll stab me in here pull the knife again he shakes his head or ill walk out ned marriner hesitates again then leans forward no you wont you dont want to leave me you want me in this somehow what did we say kate and me that you needed to hear someone else had once talked to him this way that nagging memory still there was it centuries ago or a millennium he isnt sure people blur after so much time but he believes he killed that other one he looks across the table and realizes that he was wrong in fact this impudent tone isnt the same as that other longago voice with a degree of surprise again he sees that the boy is close to tears fighting to hide it he tries unsuccessfully to remember when he felt that way himself too far back mistwrapped forestshrouded this defiant anger is a boys in the end or perhaps in the beginning anger at helplessness at being ignorant and young not yet an adult and so immune boys believed adults were immune to the pain he is feeling had he been a different man he might have addressed some of this ned marriner has after all come to the edges of the tale and he might even be an instrument but that is all he can be you didnt confide in tools or comfort them you made use of what lay to hand he stands up drops a few coins on the table the boy lifts his head to look at him i dont know if you said anything i need it is too long to tell and im disinclined to do so you are better off not knowing though it may not seem that way to you you will have to forgive meor not as you like then he adds perhaps a mistake it occurs to him even as he speaks i wouldnt go up to entremont on the eve of beltaine though the youthful gaze is sharp suddenly that was it wasnt it ned marriner says he doesnt look any more as if he might cry what kate said about that place the man doesnt respond he really isnt accustomed to answering questions never has been if truth were told even from when he entered the tale himself a little west of here having come across the sea everyone here has come from somewhere else hed said that to her once he remembers her reply he remembers everything she has ever said to him it sometimes feels he walks to the café door and out into the lateapril afternoon the dogs have been waiting scuffling around the market nearby they attack as soon as he reaches the street ned heard a woman scream there were shouts andunbelievablythe snarling of animals in the middle of the city at the two tables outside people were scrambling to their feet backing desperately away from something ned leaped up he wasnt really thinking thought took too long sometimes he ran towards the door on the way he grabbed one of the café chairs it may have saved his life the wolfhound sprang just as he cleared the door purely by reflex adrenalin surging ned swung the chair up he cracked the animal on the head with all the power fear had given him the impact knocked ned into one of the outdoor tables and he fell over it hitting his shoulder hard the dog cartwheeled in midair landed on the street it lay on one side didnt move ned got up quickly the lean man was surrounded by three other animals all of them big dark grey feral these werent anyones pets off leash ned thought people were still screaming from farther along the street and in the market square but no one came to help he did see someone on a cellphone calling the police he hoped again without really thinking he stepped forward he shouted trying to get the animals attention one of them turned immediately teeth bared wonderful ned thought when you got what you wanted you really needed to be sure youd wanted it but the man in the leather jacket moved then swift and unnervingly graceful he slashed at the distracted dog with his knife the blade came out red the animal went down ned moved forward wielding the awkward chair feinting with it like some ridiculous liontamer facing one of the last two dogs he really didnt know what he was doing he was a distraction no more but that was enough he saw the baldheaded man leave his feet in a sudden lethal movement and the reddened knife took another animal the man landed rolled on the road and was back on his feet these were more like wolves than dogs ned realized there was nothing in his experience of life to fit the idea of wolvesor wolfhoundsattacking people in a city street but there was only one left then none as the last animal showed its teeth in a whiteflecked snarl and fled through the market square as people backed away in panic it tore diagonally across down a street on the far side and was gone ned was breathing hard he put a hand to his cheek and checked no blood he looked at the man beside him he saw him wipe the bloodied knife on a blue napkin retrieved from the ground beside a toppled table ned set down his chair for no good reason he righted the table his hands were trembling again the man looked at him and grimaced curse his soul he said softly he thinks he is amusing ned blinked he shook his head as if he had water in his ears like after a highboard dive and he hadnt heard rightly amusing he repeated stupidly he plays games like a wayward child people were approaching cautiously games ned repeated again his voice highpitched as if it hadnt broken yet he was aware that he wasnt holding up his end of this conversation very well ithat thing went for my throat you did choose to come out the man said we invite our fate some of the time he said it the way you might comment on the weather or someones new shirt or shoes he brushed at his jacket and looked at the crowd around them i suggest departing unless you want to spend an evening answering questions you cant answer ned swallowed the man looked at him another moment he hesitated when he did speak ned had to strain to catch it she is worth it always and ever was what he heard then before ned could say anything or even begin to think of what he might say the man spun around and began to run north up the road towards the cathedral for an uncertain moment ned looked at the frightened concerned faces around him he shrugged gestured vaguely and then took off as well he ran the other way across the market square hearing urgent shouts in his wake someone even grabbed for him ned slashed the brief restraining hand away and kept going he sprinted until he was out of town only on the route de vauvenargues leading east towards the cutoff to the villa did he settle into a proper stride he was in jeans wasnt dressed for a run but he had his nikes on and he badly needed to be moving just now somewhere along the way he started to swear under his breath rhythmically his mother hated it when he swore a failure of imagination she called it his mother was in a civilwar zone where people were dying every day neds shoulder hurt his cheek was banged up and he was scared and angry in pretty much equal measure he actually felt as if he might be sick for the second time in a day amusing someone had meant that to be funny it occurred to him that the manhe really needed a namehad said pretty much the same thing about the skull and sculpted head yesterday ned could almost smell the hot breath of the animal that had leaped for him if he hadnt grabbed that chair on the way outhe had no idea what had made him do thathed have had teeth ripping into him how amusing just hilarious put it on americas funniest home videos with all the other cute little animals and men falling over tables and how extremely grateful that arrogant son of a bitch had been come to think of it not a word of thanks we invite our fate hed said whatever the hell that meant ned rubbing his shoulder now as he ran muttered a few more words that would have got him into trouble if either parent had been there to hear well they werent and they werent going to be much good to him in this whatever this was anyhow she is worth it always and ever he was pretty certain that was what hed heard as he turned off the main road taking their own uphill lane the words hit him hard a different sort of blow tidings from that stilldistant really complicated adult world he seemed to be approaching and from somewhere else as well a place farther away that he also seemed to be entering now like it or not a few dozen strides later it occurred to ned marriner that if hed wanted to or had been thinking clearly enough he could have taken those last words as a thankyou of sorts after all a confiding explanation even an apology from someone not obviously inclined to any of those things as the villa came in sight at the top of their roadway beyond a sloping meadow and the lawn framed against the trees that sheltered it from the wind he was thinking of a rose placed yesterday beside a sculpted figure that was not the queen of sheba chapter vi the others were on the terrace having a drink as ned came up the gravel drive the sun west over the city sent a long slanting light it fell on the cypresses the house the water in the pool and on the four people sitting outside making them look golden like gods you should see yourselves ned called keeping his tone cheerful the lights amazing in a moment like this he thought you could get a pretty good idea of what people loved so much about provence he kept on moving he didnt want to get close to the others until he checked himself in the mirror im gonna shower be right out dude greg called out you were supposed to phone me for a ride too nice a day he shouted back going around the side of the house to enter through the front not from the terrace doors where they were ned are you all right his father called theyd told him about earlier obviously he supposed theyd had to hed been pretty sick im fine he said not breaking stride down in twenty minutes he passed veracook in the hallway and she didnt seem too alarmed at the sight of him he looked in the bathroom mirror upstairs his shoulder hurt hed have a bruise be sore for a couple of days but nothing worse than what you got in a hockey game and he didnt think his cheek looked too bad they might not even notice oh my god ned what happened to your face melanie cried the second he walked out on the terrace with a coke melanie he thought he bet the three men wouldnt have seen a thing he shrugged stupid accident i got rushed by a dog near the fruitandveg market and fell over a café table a dog his father said big one too ned said taking a chair and stretching out his legs casually he sipped from his coke and put it on the table larry cato had told him years ago that when you lied you cut as close to the truth as you could or way far off one or the other it was aliens with ray guns or a dog and a café table larry was the type who had theories about these things what the hell steve said did you like get bit no no no i just fell he ran off when people yelled at him melanie had gone into the kitchen she came back out with ice cubes in a plastic bag a dish towel wrapped around them she handed it to him wordlessly my own fault probably ned said i was jogging through the market and who knows what the dog thought i was a terrorist or something his father looked dubious im okay really a bruise ill live dad he held the ice dutifully to his face what about earlier his father asked on the drive he really did have a lot to explain that was weird ned said and then it totally went away dont say food poisoning or veracook will kill herself we all ate the same food anyhow melanie said im thinking motion sickness after jet lag ned managed a grin you just keep thinking butch thats what youre good at steve laughed movie joke ned saw that his father was still eyeing him im fine dad honestly how did it go at lunch edward marriner leaned back in his chair very pleasant perfectly likeable man likes his wine he said he saw the book as more mine than his so i said the opposite and we got on like a house on fire where does that expression come from anyhow greg asked of no one in particular no one answered ned relaxed a little he heard birds from the slope above the house aix gleamed below them down the valley in the late daylight this said steve looking the same way is pretty cool have to say it was ned thought there were at least a couple of more hours before sunset but the light was already turning everything an amber hue and the shadows of the cypresses were falling vividly across the grass i told you he said you guys were a photograph up herefor your own albums a thought occurred to him dad if you tried barretts money shot right around now the mountain would look pretty goddamned unbelievable language ned his father said absentmindedly your mothers calling soon right and god forbid i swear within an hour of talking to her shell know steve laughed again his father grinned touché steve said barretts would be a tourist shot maybe not at this hour steve said ned could be right and those plane trees we told you aboutif you didnt shoot down the alley but across from the west with the sun on them their shadows maybe an hour later than this well have a look neds father said one day when the light looks right well drive out if i buy it we can arrange to set up another time its onlywhat twenty minutes from here bit more said melanie ned keep the ice on your cheek ned put the ice back it was really cold he knew what shed say if he said that how did someone with a punk look and greenstreaked hair get so efficient thats what he wanted to know how was the hot date greg asked before the dog had to beat you off her it wasnt hot or a date but it was fine ned said repressively there were limits who is this his father asked predictably ned gave him a look her names lolita laflamme shes a stripper at the hotbooty club in town shes thirtysix and studying nuclear physics in her spare time melanie giggled edward marriner raised an eyebrow i do sometimes forget his father said slowly brushing at his moustache with one hand that amid the blessings of my life which are many and considerable i am raising an adolescent son having had your brief moment of dubious wit my child could you enlighten me more cogently his father talked like that to be funny ned knew he wasnt actually upset you had no doubts when his dad was really angry ned sighed rattled it off kate wenger my age here for a term at school exchange from new york met her yesterday studentgeek type giving me some help with one of my essays that last he realizedtoo latewas a mistake larry cato would have shaken his head sorrowfully dude never tell more than you need to hed have said ah some help i believe i know what that means are you going to copy her paper his father asked it mildly his mom would have gone ballistic of course hes going to copy her paper greg said jeez cut him some slack boss hes in the south of france i do know his approximate geographic location neds father said trying to sound stern he looked at his son a moment very well heres our deal ned you can get notes for one paper from this girl the other two you write yourself fair fair it was especially since they had no way of checking on him larry would have called it a nobrainer flatout win and no one tells your mother or were both in trouble you think im going to tell her i might said melanie cheerfully if some unnamed people arent nicer to me blackmail said ned darkly is a crime threatening the peace and security of the world on cue the phone rang inside shall i get that melanie said sweetly but even as she spoke edward marriner was out of his chair and moving through the terrace doors they all looked at each other hed gone in very fast it made ned think for a moment he wasnt obviously the only one worried about his mother waiting for that call after a bit as the other three remained silent he got up and went quietly into the kitchen his father was at the table theyd set up against the wall in the dining room where the main computer and a telephone were bending to grab an apple from the fridge ned could hear his fathers voice he washed the apple at the sink veracook smiled at him again ned heard his dad saying thats not especially far from shelling meghan and after a pause dryly oh fine then if someone said theyre going the other way ned took a bite of the apple unhappily he heard im sorry meg you have to allow us to worry you cant stop that any more than we can stop you going he thought about heading back outside wasnt sure he felt good about hearing this his stomach was tight again neds fine his father said a bit jetlagged yes of course hes concerned tries to pretend he isnt a pause i think he likes the setup well enough who knows at that age hes made a friend already it seems another silence no he hasnt started his essays honey weve been here three days he stopped again yes im working doesnt mean his father stopped and then surprisingly laughed edward marriners laughter was different when he was talking to his wife ned realized hes out on the terrace with the others he heard and moved back through the kitchen door to be out on the terrace with the others melanie glanced up she didnt wink or anything just looked at him a little later he heard his father call his name and he went back in and took the phone his dad walked away hi mom hi honey how are you the connection was pretty good his mother sounded the way she always did im cool nice house a pool and stuff come visit she laughed wish i could send me jpegs theres a satellite link at our base okay so hey you all right im fine sweetie busy theres lots to be done im sure they badly need doctors here im sure he said again well all right okay then good talking you take care ned yeah a little silence i really am fine i believe you a small laugh he knew that laugh make your father believe me not easy mom and that was about as much as he intended to say she was smart though she was really smart and he could tell from the silence that she was trying to think how to reply leave it mom he said just keep calling of course i will dad says youve made a friend yeah im quick that way another silence he was a bit sorry about that one she said as hed been pretty sure she would ned dont be angry doing this is important for me sure ned said and youre doing a lot of good stay cool keep phoning dont worry about us ill get started on my essays soon she was silent again he could hear her breathing far away could picture her face right now bye mom he said and hung up it had become necessary to get off the line he stared down at the phone and took a few deep breaths he heard his father come back in he turned around they looked at each other a moment damn it to hell said edward marriner ned nodded yeah he said quietly exactly his father smiled crookedly at him watch your language he murmured and as ned smiled back he added with a rueful shake of his head lets go for dinner ill let you have a beer they went to a bistro on the road east a place out of town towards the mountain but not so near as to worry ned about what had happened earlier melanie had picked the place she had about twenty restaurants in her notebook phone numbers specialties hours probably all the chefs names ned thought in green ink everyone else had some kind of special asparagus appetizer and fish but ned stayed with steak and frites a chocolate mousse after and was happy enough his shoulder hurt but hed known it would his father did actually offer him half a beer but ned passed he didnt much like beer his new cellphone rang as they were walking back to the car damn said greg damn i knew it was a hot date how does he get chicks to call him so fast better swim trunks melanie said right and how would she know that women know these things melanie said it was dark in the parking lot but ned was pretty sure she winked at him the stars were out by then winking themselves in a blueblack sky and the moon nearly full had risen while they were inside he walked away from the others his sandals crunching on gravel and answered the phone a woman not kate wenger hello is this ned ned marriner not a voice hed ever heard speaking english slight british accent its me who is this please it is you im so glad ned listen carefully did anyone hear you ask that question you need to pretend youre talking to someone you know why do i need to do that it was curious he really had never heard this voice but there was something about it nonetheless a variant a riff ill answer later i promise can you make an excuse to go out for a bit when you get home from dinner running maybe ill meet you how do you know i run i promise answers trust me and how do you know this number the woman at the house gave it to me i called there first ned please we need to meet somewhere without people thats a bad movie line she chuckled at that it made her sound younger it is isnt it meet me alone by the old oak tree then why why with no one there she hesitated he had with every word she spoke more of that sense of something almost recognized because i can keep track inwardly of anyone approaching she said what how do you you know how i do that ned since yesterday that silenced him pretty fast he walked a bit farther away his father called ned youre keeping people waiting bad manners phone her back from the villa he lifted a hand in agreement i have to get back to the others and you still havent said who you are i know i havent he heard her draw a breath im nervous i didnt want to do it this way another silence im your aunt ned meghans older sister the one who went away ned felt his heart thud he gripped the phone tightly myher youre my aunt kim i am dear oh ned where do we meet he was walking in the night under that nearly full moon theyd dropped him at the bottom of the hill where their road wound through trees to the villa hed said he wanted to take a walk it wasnt even ten oclock yet his mother probably wouldnt have let him his father was easier that way hed reminded them he had the cellphone he couldnt jog he wasnt wearing running shoes which gave him more time to think he listened for a car behind him hed given her the best directions he could shed said shed find it she might be ahead of him too he had no idea where shed been when she called he was still in shock he decided whatever that actually meant he had believed her on the phone reckless maybe but there was no real way not to believe someone saying she was your aunt the one youd never met and it fit with things hed known all his lifeadult talk overheard before sleep from another room it also made sense of that feeling hed had that the voiceaccent and allwasnt as unknown as it should have been it was close to his mothers hed realized after hanging up things like that could make you believe someone the road went up for a pretty fair distance actually when you werent running he finally came to the car barrier again there was a red peugeot with a rental licence parked there no one in it ned walked around the barrier came up to the wooden sign again under stars this time and turned left towards the tower after a few minutes he saw it looming darkly at the end of the path he hadnt been able to think of any other place it wasnt as if he knew his way around here shed said she wanted to be where no one could sneak up on them no crowds here that was for sure he was alone on the path or he assumed he was it occurred to him that it would have been smart to bring a flashlightand in the same moment he saw a beam of light beside the tower it flicked on and off on and off his heart was beating fast as he walked towards it impulsively feeling a bit stupid he tried to reach inside himself to whatever had let him sense the man in the cloister yesterday and again in the café this afternoon he stopped dead in his tracks he swallowed hard the awareness of a presence ahead of him was so strong it was frightening once hed looked for it there was this glow in his mind where she was greengold like leaves at the beginning of spring thats me dear he heard her call out same voice same very slight british accent interesting you found me i think it must be a family thing im going to screen myself now i dont want them to know im here yet why and who whom the man in the café had talked about that screening thing too ned started walking towards the flashlight and to where he could sense the glow of her not a shining so as to illuminate the night but within him placing her in the landscape like some kind of sonar then a moment later the greengold went out its whom i think she said your mother was always better at that sort of thing hello ned marriner nephew may i please hug you is that unfair shed been sitting on a boulder beside the low barrier ringing the tower now she stood up and came towards him and in the moonlight ned saw his aunt for the first time in his life he wasnt sure actually how he felt about being hugged but she opened her arms so he did the same and he felt her draw him to her and hold on he became aware after a moment that she was crying she let him go and stepped back wiping at her eyes with the back of one hand she was slim not too tall a lot like his mother oh dear she said i promised myself i wouldnt cry this is so uncool i do know that he cleared his throat well aunts arent usually cool he saw her smile i thought id try to be she said she looked at him for some reason ned found himself standing as straight as he could stupid really you look wonderful she said i havent seen any pictures since your gran died two years ago ned blinked gran sent you pictures of me of course she did silly she was so proud of you so am i that doesnt make sense ned said you never even knew me to be proud or anything she said nothing for a moment then turned and went back to the boulder and sat on it again he followed a few steps he wished there was more light so he could see her better her hair was very pale could be blond but he was guessing grey she was older than his mom six or seven years she said a lot of things in families dont make sense dear a lot of things in life right ned said i get that its kind of in my face now i know thats why i came to tell you its all right how do you know choosing her words she said yesterday you entered a space ive been in for some time when it happened i became aware of it of you from where i was the family thing i guess wheres that where you were she wasnt hesitating now england in the southwest a place called glastonbury thatswhere you live with your uncle yes thats where we live why why did you go away she sighed oh ned thats such a long answer can i just say for a bit that i feel easier there than anywhere else i havea complicated connection to it that isnt a good answer but the good one would take all night fine but why did you cut yourself off fromfrom us it had happened years before he was born before thered been any us but shed know what he meant she had clasped her hands loosely was gazing up at him it was weird but even in moonlight he could see how much she looked like his mom that gesture was his mothers even when she was listening making herself be patient i didnt really cut myself off we always kept track of you three through my mother your gran i told you families are tricky meghan felt rightly i suppose that id done something totally unexpected in getting married so quickly to someone she didnt even know moving to england right away she felt id abandoned her she wasvery angry didnt want phone calls or letters or emails later hung up on me didnt write back she was only seventeen when i left remember how can i remember he said he saw her smile now that sounds like meghan he made a face sorry dont be but you do know what i mean big sister marries a stranger city hall no proper ceremony moves across the ocean changes all her life plans without any warning and there wasthere was more to it like she sighed that gets us to the allnight part lets say i was involved in something connected to what you felt yesterday it runs in our family ned on the maternal side as far back as ive been able to trace disappearing showing up again and in me it included some other things that turned out to be really important and really really difficult that changed me a lot ned made it impossible to be what id been before or stay where id been it sounded weirdly as if she were asking his forgiveness he thought about how hed felt by the mountain earlier today and in the cloister before the impossibility of explaining making sense of it i might be able to understand some of that he said thank you dear she looked up at him i thought youd be feeling afraid and confused so i came to let you know you arent alone not the first in this she stopped it seemed she was crying again she shook her head im sorry i swore i wouldnt cry your uncle said i didnt have a hope i actually bet him you lose i guess where is he my uncle she wiped at her eyes with a kleenex i dont know if i should tell you she said ned shook his head too many secrets gets screwy she stared up at him youre probably right between us ned he nodded dave is north of darfur it took him a moment the sudan but thatsmy mom is your mothers there yes your uncles watching over her his mouth had dropped open comically like in a cartoon does shedoes my mom know that his aunt laughed aloud a burst of amusement that made her seem much younger does meghan know are you crazy ned shedshed spit shed be so angry he honestly couldnt imagine his mother spitting maybe as a tenyearoldbut he couldnt picture her as ten either or seventeen feeling abandoned by her sister he said really carefully let me get this my uncle is there secretly to keep an eye on my mom aunt kim nodded i told you weve been keeping track of all of you but shes the one i worry about why her she was silent too many secrets he repeated this is your mother dear it isnt fair this conversation were having so it isnt fair tell me why gravely his aunt said because i think meghan does some of what she doesthe war zones choosing the worst placesas a response to what i told her id done just before i went away i made a mistake telling her ned said nothing he couldnt begin to think of what to say he felt shaky she saw that went on talking quietly shed thoughti would be an ambitious doctor try to do good in a big way id talked like that to her when she was young big sister kid sister sharing my future then ihad that experience and everything changed i went off to some village in england to spend my life doing country medicine childbirth and checkups runny noses flu shots everything scaled way down after the one very big thing she never understood or accepted thatswhat you do she smiled runny noses yes it is i also have a garden she added ned rubbed at the back of his head and you think i think meghans been showing me and herself what she believes i should have been like what i rejected along with rejecting her and shes proving she can do it better ned was silent after pushing to hear this he wasnt sure hed been right if this was something he really wanted to know ned listen people do wonderful things for complicated reasons it happens all the time your mother is a hero where she goes people are in awe of her maybe you dont know thatshe probably doesnt tell but your uncle knows hes been there hes seen it hes done this before only when we knew she was going somewhere very bad she hesitated three times before this one how how did you know where she was going he thought he saw her make a wry face in the darkness daves talented at quite a few things computers are one of them he could explain it better than i can ned thought then he stared jesus my uncle hacked doctors without borders their server aunt kim sighed ive never liked that word hacked is so illegalsounding well it is illegal i suppose she said sounding cross ive told him i dont approve he says he needs to know what shes doing with enough time to get there himself ned shook his head stubbornly great so he just drops his own life and goes there too andand what was uncle dave going to do if mom was attacked or kidnapped by insurgents in iraq or rwanda or wherever the crazy places the anger he lived with the fear dull as an ache hard as a callus in the heart his aunt said quietly dont ask that until youve met him ned you wont ever know anyone more capable of dealing with such places believe me he looked at her and he does this because he does it for me because i feel responsible there was something different in her voice now ned looked down at her where she was sitting on the rock hands still clasped wow he said finally shaking his head again that is controlling i thought my mom was bad is it another family thing last i checked she was fortysomething years old and you still feel responsible for her her laughter again rueful this time if i plead guilty to being a worrier will you let me off with a reprimand and pleasened you mustnt tell her shell spit shell want to murder me with a machete my mother are you shh hold on her tone had changed completely there was a command in it startlingly ned froze listening then he too heard a sound shit whispered his aunt i wasnt paying attention you swore ned pointed out a reflex it was what he did when his mothers language slipped hell yes said his aunt which wasnt his mothers reply we may be in trouble damn my mistake a bad one but why would they attack us what have you been doing here ned why would who attack us wolves what no way wolves are mostly vegetarian i learned that in school last year then tell these to go find the salad bar said aunt kim grimly ned heard a crackle of twigs and leaves from the woods north of them near the place where the path sloped down towards the city do you have anything a pocket knife aunt kim asked he shook his head the question chilled him find a stick then fast and get back towards the tower she flicked on her flashlight and played the beam on the ground between them and the trees ned caught a glimpse of eyes shining he was very afraid then unreal as it all seemed as kim ran her beam across the ground nearer to them ned saw a broken branch and darted forward to claim it as he did he heard his aunt her voice hard icy speaking words in a language he didnt know followed by silence from the darkness what he mumbled hurrying back beside her breathing hard what did you just i asked why theyve come to trouble the living the living you mean humans right us i mean what i said these are spirits ned taking an animal shape they have come early they arent as strong as they will be in two nights two nights right ned thought he knew that part beltaine hinge of the year when souls were abroad or so his gran had told him along with other tales of the old ways his gran had been named deirdre and had grown up in wales half welsh half irish the woman beside him now was her older daughter things he needed to deal with were coming really fast and he didnt know what any of it meant there was a greengold presence inside him again though when he looked that was kim she wasnt screening herself any more were you speaking welsh gaelic closer to what theyd have spoken back when i hope you speak gaelic a dumb question took me long enough to learn my accents terrible but theyll understand me if im right back when when was that he wanted to ask sometimes when you had this many questions ned thought you didnt have a clue where to start another sound to his right this time back up the path they were a long way from the car barrier and her car from the road lights from anyone you didnt answer me kim said ned what have you been doing to draw these to you nothing on purpose believe me i met someone in the cathedral whoheits complicated im sure she said dryly it tends to be she motioned and they moved together stepping over the low rail towards the curved tower wall backs to it facing outwards for the moment her words in that other language seemed to have frozen the creatures out there she flashed her beam at a sound again found another wolf four of them five they were both peering in that direction when ned heard a scrabbling sound to his left beyond his aunt without stopping to think an entirely instinctive movement he stepped past her and swung the branch up and around hard like a baseball bat he cracked the wolf on the side of the head it was heavier than the dog had been this afternoon it didnt spin or flip but it went down ned cried out as his injured shoulder felt the impact his aunt swore again ned heard her snap something almost snarling it herself in the same tongue as before and though he couldnt understand a word he felt himself go cold with the ferocity of what she said cold in fire he thought there was a word for that the sort of stupid thing you got asked on english tests kim repeated whatever shed said same cadences more slowly ned almost felt a collective intake of breath in the night as if the very darkness was reacting to her he was down on a knee holding his shoulder the wolf lay near enough for him to see it it wasnt moving well done his aunt said to him quietly are you hurt shoulder not from now i had to fight a dog this afternoon what ned what have you been doing i got mixed up in something he said after that they were just playing games with him not me she was still a moment then who said that ned the man from the cathedral hes part of all this i think well of course he is thats why youre being tracked can you reach him what like a text message she actually chuckled briefly she was cool he decided even if aunts werent supposed to be no not that can you see him the way you saw me looking inside he hesitated i have done that seen him twice he said he can screen himself im sure he can i cant see him you try ned tried he had the same foolish feeling as before though not quite the same if he thought about it his aunt was here and he could sense the glow of her within only that however not the scarred man whod told them in the cloister that he had no name he shook his head i have no idea what im doing he said why should you she replied gently thats a reason i came to tell you its all right not to know thats why she nodded and a few other things the wolves hadnt made a sound since shed spoken or since hed cracked one of them with the branch have they gone he asked kim turned and looked out he had a sense she wasnt really looking or not with her eyes theyre waiting she said i really wish i knew what this was about hows your shoulder never play tuba again she made an exasperated sound how terribly funny you are just like your mother mom joked like that at your age endlessly it was news to him that was for sure what are they waiting for he asked well know soon enough keep trying to find your friend he isnt my friend believe me a sound behind them a voice in the same instant he is not you would do well to remember it they whipped around together to see something that never left nedeven with all that was to come what appears to us first on a threshold is often what lingers afterwards a very big broadshouldered man stood in front of the broken opening in the tower he had long bright hair a heavy golden necklace and golden armbands he was clad in a tunic and a darker furlined vest with leggings and sandals tied up around his calf and he was antlered like a stag it wasnt a horned helmet or anything like that which was neds first thought he wasnt wearing a helmet the antlers grew straight out of his head it was in that moment that ned marriner finally accepted that he had entered into a world for which nothing in life had prepared him there was no denial left in him he felt fear coil and twist like a snake in his body how did you get in there he stammered he flew down most likely as an owl said his aunt with what seemed to him an awesome calm why not take your own form she added almost casually to the manbeast in front of them playing at shapes is a game and this form is disrespectful even sacrilege not wise the thought the antlered figure said they were speaking french to each other in an oddly formal way in my own guise i am too beautiful for you woman you would beg me to take you right here with the child watching ned bristled clenching his fists but his aunt only smiled unlikely she murmured i have seen beautiful men and managed to keep my selfcontrol she paused looking up at him and then added i have also seen the god whose form you are copying and his son who commanded wolves far more deadly than these weak spirits her voice changed again you have some small shapeshifting power i see it do not expect me to quail i knew men and women with so much more than that there are no words for the telling do not ever doubt me i am offering ironbound truths by moonlight at the edge of an oak grove ned shivered he couldnt help it this is my aunt he thought the yellowhaired figure with the antlers of a stag stared at her for a long time if you speak of the wolflord or the god so carelessly one or both might make you pay a price true enough if i did so carelessly the figure in front of them hesitated you are very sure of yourself woman who are you why have you come into this it is nothing to you nothing for you kim shook her head i havent come into anything except to guard my sisterson he has no power only the beginnings of sight and is no danger to you he is to be left alone ah she makes a demand and if i do not accede ned heard his mothers older sister say quietly then depend on it i will summon powers that will blast you out of time to an ending and you will never do what you have come to do silence in front of them nothing from the wolves behind ned wondered if the others could hear the thudding of his heart it is a wise man who knows his true enemies kim added softly you do not even know what this is about what i am come to do but there was doubt in the deep voice now ned could hear it of course i dont aunt kim said crisply nor do i care do what you must i have told you my only purpose accept it and we are gone do not and you have only yourself to blame if all you dream of goes awry the boy fought this afternoon beside a man i must kill then kill that man if it is your destiny to do so but the boy is mine and will remain untouched he has no wish to interfere is it so can he speak for himself or does a woman do all for him as for a suckling babe aunt kim opened her mouth to reply but ned angered said i can speak just fine i have no idea what that was this afternoon but someone id had a drink with was attacked would you have stood by another silence the cub has a tooth the man said laughing suddenly a deepthroated genuine amusement the rich sound rolled over them of course i would not have stood by shame to my family and tribe to do so that does not mean you might not have died he said you were playing games another explosion of laughter the antlered head thrown back in delight it was thrilling as much as it was frightening truthfully did he say that the fairhaired figure looked at ned ah you give me pleasure by all the gods i am his master he knows it with every narrow breath he draws and as for you children have died in gamesplaying games like that i can imagine ned was still furious so tell me give me pleasure now did i kill your fourlegged friend today with the chair he felt kims hand on his arm cautioning him he didnt feel like being cautioned the antlered figure said he was in a form hed taken for the moment no more than that he is behind you now in another shape tell me foolish child what do you think this is about we told you kim snapped we dont know what this is and will not claim any role unless you compel it she paused then added her voice going colder again will you compel me shall i summon liadon from his sacrifice amazed ned saw the tall figure take a quick step backwards in shocked surprise the head lifting again the antlers caught by moonlight you know a name you ought not to know he said after a long moment his voice had gone quiet it is guarded and holy and i am one with access to it kim said and i have seen the one you mock with your horns i do not mock the man protested but he sounded defensive now playing a game dressed in his antlers no really are you the child to be forgiven by your elders not yet come of age the man before them said have done woman i have been among these groves and pools coming and going returned and gone for past two thousand years ned swallowed hard he heard the man say is that a child to you ned was intimidated now really afraid wondering at his own recklessness a moment before but aunt kim said only it can be of course it can depending on what you have done coming and going show me otherwise go from us and not in his shape i wish to return to my own home this is your place not mine swear to leave the boy in peace and i am gone from your games and your battles the tall glorious figure stared down at her as if trying to penetrate through moonlight to some deeper truth what is your name kim shook her head i will not give you that tonight he smiled then another unexpected flash of teeth and laughed again a sorrow to my heart i would give you the gift of mine and freely bright one if i had a name here kim didnt smile back she said you are waiting for one she will name me she always does both of you kim said ned had been chasing the same thought a hesitation again both of us he looked down at her and then it begins and i may kill him again and taste the joy of it he looked at kim another moment ignoring ned entirely now then he lifted his great head and rasped words in yet another tongue ned didnt know they heard a growling sound in reply twigs snapped on the ground behind them as the animals left you will not enter into it the antlered man said again to kim not unless you force me she repeated you will have to live with that as sufficient surety his teeth showed again i have lived with less he turned ducking through the opening into the round tall tower twisting his head so the horns could pass through they stood a moment waiting there was a quick sharp sound and they looked up and ned saw an owl fly through the open tower top and away to the north they watched it go kim sighed i told him to change his shape he does like to play i guess ned looked at his aunt he cleared his throat that was extremely close she murmured she leaned against his good shoulder i havent tried anything like that in a long time what do you mean kim stepped back and looked at him oh dear ned did you think i could do any of what i said he nodded um yeah i kind of did she sighed fooled you then she said he stared at her he felt cold you were bluffing couldcould they guess that her mouth twitched in an expression he actually knew well from his mother i guess they didnt but damn it all sideways and backwards i so wish your uncle were here chapter vii afterwards ned marriner was to think of april of that year mostly spent in arles among roman and medieval ruins as the last day of his childhood it was an oversimplification such thoughts always are but we make stories narratives of our lives when we look back finding patterns or creating them we tend to change in increments by degrees not shockingly or dramatically but this isnt so for everyone and ned had already learned in the two previous difficult days how he seemed to be different most of us for example dont see our aunts as a greengold light within ourselves on a sunny windswept morning among the monuments of arles he wasnt actually dwelling on this he wasalthough being of a certain age hed have hated to admit ithaving a good time nerdy as that might be the roman arena was seriously nomessingaround impressive hed never been to rome he understood the colosseum there was way bigger than this but the one here would do fine for ned twenty thousand people two thousand years ago watching men fight each other or wild beasts in a place this massive and it was still standing even larry cato might have had to concede it was cool sort of theyd driven here first thing about an hour in morning traffic his father and the others had gotten busy immediately to use the early light setting up an exterior shot where the high stone walls of the arena were being restored gleaming almost white on the righthand side revealing the grimy evidence of centuries on the left with plenty of notice from melanie and barrett reinhardt the city authorities had removed the scaffolding for them leaving neds father a clear line the spring sunlight was brilliant intensifying the contrast between left and right the untouched part and the cleanedup side it was going to be a terrific photograph even ned could see it and his fathers body language as he moved around setting up gave it away anyhow edward marriner was watching the clouds scud past in the breeze he was going to try to time the shutter releases to have one of them in the background half in half out ned had left them to their work hed gone inside the arena and wandered among the seats looking out over the bright sand below they used this place for bullfights these days everything changed nothing changed huge crowds of people coming here to watch a battle in the middle ages the guidebook said there had been a kind of ghetto inside these curved walls shabby fallingdown hovels within a structure that had celebrated the power of rome if you liked irony this was for you ned thought larry would definitely have liked it he looked at an artists sketch of that medieval slum in the book melanie had given him he wondered what that would have been like to live in a world sunken so low struggling just to stay alive with the towering evidence of glory all around you looming above your collapsing little walls and muddy alleys you sure wouldnt have a feeling that the world was progressing or getting better over the years he decided the book reported that one time during a plague outbreak in here the authorities of arles had surrounded the arena and had killed anyone trying to get out of the slum the world might be a little better than that today ned thought parts of it anyhow making his way along the seats he circled all the way around to the chute where they released the bulls he was able to get down from there jumping a barrier onto the sands there were people inside the arenaincluding a big japanese tour groupbut no one seemed inclined to tell him to leave he saw people taking his picture he actually thought about that sometimes how we end up as background faces in some strangers photo album or slide show had he been a little younger he might have pretended to be a gladiator or a bullfighter but not at fifteen with people watching him he just walked around and enjoyed the sunshine and the size of the place the romans were engineers and builders his father had said on the drive here roads temples aqueducts arenas whatever else you thought about them you had to give them that ned wondered if kate wenger had been here had seen this place he thought of calling her then remembered it was a school day besides which it was too soon majorly uncool for that kind of call thinking of her sitting in some classroom made him grin though hed have been in school himself back home at this hour without wanting to actually give his father the satisfaction of knowing it ned had to admit this was way better he took out his own canon and snapped a couple of pictures hed email jpegs to larry and vic and ask how biology class had been today and how much homework they had maybe hed get steve to take a picture of him in the pool at the villa to send they didnt need to know it was freezing cold in there with his friends you had to grab the moments when you had the upper hand ned considered that for a moment grabbing moments with the upper hand mr drucker would have labelled that a mixed metaphor and probably marked him down for it ned smiled to himself mr drucker was on the other side of the ocean they had lunch at a restaurant with a terrace overlooking the roman theatre ruins near the edge of the city centre oliver lee the writer for the book joined them there he lived in the countryside to the north lee was in his sixties tall rumpled and stooped with pale pouchy eyes reading glasses on a chain about his neck and long not very disciplined silver hair that scattered in various directions and gave him a startled look every so often hed run a hand through it to mostly negative effect he wore a jacket and a diagonally striped tie and smoked a pipe there were ashes on his tie and jacket it was almost as if hed been cast as a british author he was funny though a good storyteller it seemed like he knew a lot about wine and provençal food he also knew the chef who came hurrying out to greet him with enthusiastic kisses on both cheeks lees french accent and grammar werent goodsurprisingly after thirty years here he put almost every verb in the present tense he was rueful about that called it frenglish stubborn brits my generation he said still regretting we lost calais back to the french five hundred years ago too superior to take the time to learn any language properly point of honour almost to be ungrammatical why move down here then edward marriner asked he was in a good mood again the morning had gone well obviously he had switched to water after one glass of wine startling the englishman but there was a working afternoon ahead for him oliver lee gestured towards the gleaming marble of the roman theatre across the way pine trees scattered among stones and dark green grass sun and wine ruins and olive trees the ancient allknowing sea an hour away and truffles have you tasted the truffles here neds father shook his head laughing lee drained half of his third glass of wine and smiled affably fiddling with his pipe mostly it was the sun mind you ever lived through a winter in oxfordshire try montreal said melanie oliver lee turned to her had you been there to greet me and had i been even ten years younger my dear id have willingly tried montreal ned blinked and then did so again melanie actually blushed wow said greg looking at her that was impressive ive never seen her do that be quiet you melanie said looking down at her plate interesting neds father said grinning behind a hand smoothing his moustache green hair streaks do it for you oliver do people know this about you adornment has varied widely over the centuries oliver lee said airily waving a hand my own ancestors painted themselves blue long ago with woad silly to be weddedor woaded shall we say to only one look as attractive he chuckled at his own joke green hair is entirely a matter of a womans style and choice and when she has eyes like your melanie she may make any choice she wants wow said greg again um shes single you know and shes read some of your books shut up gregory melanie said fiercely under her breath still looking down ned had never thought about melanies eyes they were green he realized he wondered if the stripe in her hair maybe even her ink colour had been chosen to match women did that didnt they mr lee you are much too nice youll make me lose focus this afternoon melanie said looking up finally smiling at the author and thats bad in photography she still looked flushed lee laughed and shook his shaggy silver mane i must doubt that though it is kind of you to say im just an old man in sunshine among ruins paying homage to youth and beauty do people actually say that sort of thing ned thought evidently they did in oliver lees circles anyhow the waiter came for their plates the others ordered coffee ill be heading home get out of your way lee said to neds father wouldnt want me tripping over your apparatus or meandering into a photograph ned decided this was a role the man played a public pose looking at his father he saw the same assessment there and amusement youre welcome to stay edward marriner said melanie can help keep you from meandering were going over to sainttrophime the cloister ah good youll want to photograph the eastern and the northern sides oliver lee said brisk all of a sudden if the other elementslight and suchare right for you of course the pillar carvings on those sides are the glory and wonder there are legends about them what kind melanie asked clearly pleased to have the subject changed homage to youth and beauty ned was going to have to remember that ammunition for later in the war of the ringtones the sculptures there are so lifelike lee was saying it was believed at various times that magic was used to make them that the sculptor had sold his soul and been given a sorcerers power to turn real people into stone the devils work in the cloister of a church very nice neds father smiled that was the tale for centuries lee finished his wine people have often feared very great art what about the other two sides steve asked ordinary work done later pleasant enough the judgment was crisp dismissive it made you realize how much of an act the eccentric ancient was in its own way ned thought it wasnt so different from larry cato pretending to be bored by everything ill remember that neds father said but ill need melanie to tell me which side is east or north oliver lee smiled a woman is often our guide guardian of portals and all that he lit his pipe taking his time about it then brushed some ash off one sleeve east is to your left as you go in youll put me out of a job melanie protested they laughed what else will you do here lee asked thats all today marriner said two setups is as much as we usually manage we can come back later what else should we look at he pointed the theatre here you might but the cemetery surely outside the walls they always buried people outside the city walls of course les alyscamps was the most famous burial ground in europe for a very long time ruinously pillaged by now of course most of the marbles are gone but if it is quiet and it usually is it is one of the most evocative places i know van gogh painted it there were celtic roman medievalwouldnt even surprise me if there were greek tombs there why greeks ned asked first thing hed said over lunch he wasnt sure why hed asked oliver lee smiled at him through pipe smoke it was the greeks who founded marseille about bc called it massilia they traded with the tribes up this way the coastline was nearer here back then its changed traded did theyfight ned asked oh of course there was always fighting here provence isnt the lavendercoloured paradise travel agents and romance books make out you know i know ned said his father glanced at him but they did trade mostly lee said as the coffee arrived he fussed with his pipe put the lighter to it again in fact the founding myth of marseille has the captain of that first greek expedition being chosen as husband by a chieftains daughter shocking everyone in the tribe she got to pick melanie asked wryly celtic women were a bit different yes they had goddesses of war not gods among other things but i think it was certainly unexpected when gyptis chose protis if it really happened of course if it isnt just a tale cant imagine the warriors of her tribe could have been pleased someone just pops in to the feast and is picked by the princess tough life greg said laughing for no reason he could put a finger on ned felt a chill as if he was hearing more than was being said but he had just about given up trying to have things make sense the past few days he was remembering last nights lonely tower wolves and a staghorned man his bright mood seemed to be gone how did you send dumb emails to classmates after that kind of encounter he felt like going off again to be by himself but he had to wait for the others to finish steve said when did the romans get here then oliver lee enjoyed having an audience they were asked to come by those greeks in massilia when the fighting got worse a few hundred years later some of the celtic tribes were trading with them but others were unhappy about foreigners all along the coast and started raiding collecting skulls for doorposts skulls said ned as noncommittally as he could ah i knew a boy would like that part said lee chuckling yes indeed they did do that im afraid skulls of enemies skulls of ancestors a complex religion really the celts put them in shrines hung them from their doorsa form of worship they found scads of them at a site not far from here and at another one just by where youre staying in aix ned kept his expression neutral entremont he asked thats the one oliver lee beamed at him ive heard about it ned said as his father raised an eyebrow a friend of mine here said it was worth seeing well you can walk around it the views are pleasant enough but its been picked clean by now the finds are in the musée granet in aix but thats closed up for renovations all year everythings in crates actually there was a bit in the paper a few days backa robbery in the storerooms someone nicked a couple of the finds a skull a sculpturethat sort of thing bit of hue and cry valuable things you know we didnt hear about it neds father said ned was controlling his breathing well were not listening to local news or anything greg pointed out ah well archaeological finds are always looted and pillaged lee said waving his pipe first for gold and gems then artifacts think of the elgin marbles in london stolen from greece wouldnt surprise me if these things from aix turned up in new york or berlin on the black market soon it would surprise me ned marriner thought lee excused himself after they paid the bill to do some banking in town and then make his way home he kissed melanies hand when they parted nobody laughed ned arranged to meet the others at the cloister then walked across the street to the theatre ruins they were just reopening after the midday closing ned he turned mind company for a bit melanie asked they dont need me for the first half hour setting up screens and lights it was windier now she kept a hand on her straw hat how could i refuse youth and beauty he said hed wanted to be alone actually but what was he going to say you be quiet she snapped and punched him on the shoulder he covered a wince it was still sore from the day before have you ever heard anything like what he said in your life personally i sure havent which is a good thing i guess i know you get it all the he stopped because she punched him again he wasnt actually in a kidding mood anyhow he was thinking about greeks arriving among the tribes back when and objects stolen from a museum in aix this week he was going to have to figure out what to do about that theft he knew where those artifacts were after all on the other hand the person who had almost certainly taken them might not appreciate interference there was even some question as to whether you could call him a person given that hed had horns growing from his head and then changed into an owl in moonlight in fact you could go further and say he had made it extremely clear he didnt want interference in whatever was about to happen if the joke in that underground corridorand that is what both men seemed to consider itwas over now would it be interfering to report that the objects stolen from the museum could be found under the baptistry in the cathedral he didnt know how could he know he needed to talk to kate or his aunt his aunt all by herself was another subjectobject personthat needed thinking about big time the good news for the moment was that melanie seemed preoccupied too not in her chatty tourguide mode which hed feared she sat down on a grassy mound and took out a long green guidebook but didnt open it nor did she seem unhappy to be left alone when ned wandered away among the random pillars and what was left of the original theatre which wasnt much this site wasnt as well preserved as the arena was grass growing among the ruins and the quiet made for a different sense of the past he glanced back at melanie he wondered if oliver lees comments had upset her maybe shed felt she was being teased the only woman among five menor four men and a kid ned didnt think oliver lee had been teasing he thought hed meant the compliments but these things were still a mystery to him so was trying to figure out last night after the wolves and the owl had gone away he and aunt kim walked back from the tower to her car ned had kept his branch but nothing troubled them on the path he heard an owl as they approached the fork in the trail and it made him jump but his aunt touched his arm not ours she said thats a real one how do you know different sound i live in the country remember he looked at her it was hard to see clearly in the night but her hair was really pale in the moonlight he gestured to it my mom colours her hair i know ive seen lots of pictures shes lovely ned she always was would it be like yours if she didnt colour it she hesitated i doubt that they walked a bit farther ned saw the barrier and her car aunt kim stopped ill drive you back but firstned listen to me it would be unfair to you and to your mother for us to meet like this again i dont want to put you in a position of having to keep secrets umyou think i dont keep secrets from my parents she smiled faintly id worry if you didnt but not this large dear ned was silent hed been thinking the same thing himself actually about everything here you going to leave go home they were at the barrier her car was on the other side but this seemed a conversation better suited to the night not immediately aunt kim said im going to try to find out more about whats happening if i can for a day or two is my phone number on yours now on callback if you need me he nodded am i going to need you her turn to be silent he had a sense she was dealing with real emotion he felt it himself this was his mothers sister and hed never seen her in his life and might never see her again it seemed they shared something too something complicated and difficult i dont know she said finally i hope you dont need me in the way you meant im pretty sure hell keep his promise leave you alone pretty sure she looked up at him what do you want me to say um absolutely positive would do she laughed your parents have done a good job ned he felt embarrassed suddenly yeah well dont tell them he saw her smile but she didnt reply ned thought of something i should have asked before do you and uncle dave have kids have i got cousins in england i dont know about she shook her head im afraid not i never could have children ned looked at her a moment he might be young but he knew enough to change the subject ah you really think my mom would be unhappy ifyou called her or wrote not the best subject change she always has been ned it wouldnt be the first time i tried which is why shed be so angry if she knew id called you that made sense an end run going around her shed spit he guessed he was a bit fixated on that image actually maybe not aunt kim said managing another smile lets go you need to be home before your dad gets worried hes not the worrying type except about my mom i think i know that they walked around the barrier to her car she started it up switched on the headlights he looked at her in the glow of the dashboard panel she really did look an awful lot like his mother but her hair he now saw wasnt silver or grey it was entirely white do you colour it that way he asked its been like this since i was very young really must have been pretty cool back then i suppose your uncle liked it i guess he must have she turned the car around and they wound their way along the narrow twisting road back to the fork where chemin de lolivette branched away ned had pointed and shed stopped i should walk up he had said theyll see headlights from the house i know tricky questions youll be fine tonight but from now on nephewand pay attentionyou stay with the others after darkfall dont go wandering i cant give you that absolutely positive so dont do silly things okay hed thought of a joke but didnt make it not after what had happened i promise but will youif you figure anything out will you at least let me know his aunt had smiled at him you know i will ill call before i go home regardless keep my number ned ned had cleared his throat you know i will he said hed leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek she brought a hand up and touched his face then he got out of the car hed stood in the darkness and watched her drive away started walking up their road and found himself working hard not to cry it had been a hell of a day really hed heard a grunting sound from the trees off the upward path that would be the wild boars sangliers that came out to feed after sundown veraclean had told them about those they didnt scare him other things might no one had asked any questions when he walked into the house it wasnt all that late and he was fifteen after all not a kid any more there wasnt that much to see around the theatre of arles it was peaceful though in the sunlight and shade you could imagine the past ned wondered if that was the tradeoff here in europe the major sights were impressive and overrun with people the smaller ones you could have to yourself he and melanie were alone here except for three cyclists who had chained their bikes to the railing outside and were huddled over a map on the far side of the three columns left standing he walked back to melanie shed put her guidebook down had her knees up and her arms around them she looked relaxed but he wasnt sure she was did you match the streak in your hair to your eyes he asked sitting beside her on the grass he plucked some sprigs and tossed them up to blow away it was windy now she looked at him from behind sunglasses dont tease me ned i wasnt real question she shook her head a dumb one then of course i didnt you think im too old to just like punk as a look way too old he said i said dont tease im twentyfive for gods sake like i said way too she punched him on the shoulder again but it was his good arm this time he held up his hands in surrender she gave an exaggerated sigh and they sat quietly awhile there was a bird singing in one of the trees the cyclists walked past speaking german and went out through the gate ned watched them unchain their bikes and pedal off looking straight ahead behind her shades melanie said i am five feet tall you know that makes just over a hundred and fifty damned centimetres which is short any way you look at it do not make a joke ned no i have at least three i know you do he glanced at her it really bothers you still looking towards the pillars she said not always not even usually i mean there are worse problems in life but its a pain its hard to be taken seriously sometimes like im a hobbit with a daytimer justcute he thought about it my dad takes you pretty seriously i think greg and steve do and i dont think youre cute i think youre an analretentive micromanaging pain she laughed this time ah progress i mean you researched jogging paths here melanie she looked at him i like my job ned a lot im just trying to do it right he sighed i know makes me feel babied though she shrugged dont you arent a baby at all i checked out music stores and jazz bars for greg and found an indoor pool for steve you know he thought about that i didnt know actually think youre the only man in my life here sailor his turn to laugh he would remember that exchange another moment from when he was still young melanie looked at her watch and tsked and got up collecting her gear ned went with her back to the main square the famous church was there a tour group was just entering melanie walked farther along to a side entrance that led to the cloister another cloister ned thought as they went in through an arched covered space they saw a gendarme keeping people out so that his father could work melanie explained who they were the policeman motioned them through ned let melanie go ahead of him up a flight of steps he felt strange again suddenly a disorienting intrusion of that other world he seemed to have accessed something was approaching a vibration in the air almost presences he could feel them not the man in the grey leather jacket or the golden one from the tower but whatever this was it wasnt far away or they werent he looked around him he wasnt sure why this place was shaping awareness in him but on some other level he did know layers and layers of the past were here a past that seemed not to be entirely finished with was it ever finished he wondered they reached the top of the stairs and saw another arch with a green space beyond in shadow and light he wished his aunt were here and at the same time he was uncomfortably aware that there was something he hadnt told her last night before they parted at the laneway and that it might be a mistake im going to cancel anyway he said to himself it doesnt matter you and i are still at war melanie said over her shoulder just before she walked into the cloister dont kid yourself that ringtone doomed you ned he couldnt think of a funny reply in time he watched as she went towards where he could see his father and the others standing in a brilliant light from the dim vaulted cool of the archway ned looked in at them he saw his father moving quickly talking quickly stopping to frame a view with his hands going a few steps over to gauge it elsewhere he saw that the brown hair was greying more now though not yet the notorious signature moustache one day ned understood that hair would be grey or thinning or both and his dad wouldnt be wearing tight blue jeans and moving with such crisp strong strides time would do what it did to people ned stayed where he was looking at his father as from within a long tunnel edward marriner wore a green workshirt and his favourite tan vest with a dozen pockets he had his sunglasses pushed up on top of his head he was talking gesturing but ned couldnt hear what he was saying he seemed far away an effect of acoustics of light and shade it frightened him this sudden feeling of distance of being on the other side of some divide there was a full moon in his mind high among stars in the midst of afternoon childhoods end chapter viii tere had been clouds throughout the night hiding the moon much of the time but the last day of april dawned windy and very clear a mistral was blowing veracook advised over morning croissants they were sheltered here tucked under the slope but it would be fierce today up on mont ventoux or in avignon or the hill villages like les baux or gordes or menerbes small children had been blown off cliffs she said shaking her head dolefully when the mistral came down from the north that same wind was however a photographers dream of light it scoured the sky of anything resembling haze or mist leaving it hard brilliant precise a backdrop that rendered wildflowers monuments medieval ruins bending cypresses electric with intensity edward marriner had been here before in a mistral he wasnt about to try going up any cliffs with their gear but he did change plans for the morning over his second cup of coffee melanie scribbled fast notes and got busy on the telephone greg designated driver carried his mug into the dining room where the maps were spread on the table and bent over them plotting routes steve started loading the van they were now going east an hour or so to some monastery called thoronet in this light the stones of the abbey would almost come alive neds father told him they were alone at the kitchen table its ironic edward marriner said and it pleases me there are a lot of things to like about the medieval cistercian monks and a few not to like they started by opposing church wealth and ostentation but they also detested learning study books themselves and even worldly beauty bernard of clairvaux who shaped the order would have hated the idea that people find their abbeys beautiful now they werent supposed to be that would have been a distraction from what ned asked god prayer silence and work in the most remote places they could find they came down here for the solitude from where east of paris i think dont quote me ned made a face as if this isnt an essay dad edward marriner ignored that sipped his coffee thing is provence has always been seen as a kind of paradise and that attracts people for their own reasons the greeks like he said yesterday at lunch oliver yes in a way everyone whos ever come here has been a stranger trying to make it theirs there are footprints and bones all over some places are like that isnt everywhere like that his father looked at him maybe even greenland and the hebrides have been fought over but its happened in some places more than others this is one of those being desired can be a mixed blessing he grinned suddenly as if hed amused himself this morning my son in this light i am going to make an old cold abbey look so gorgeous the bones of bernard of clairvaux will spin in his grave wherever it is nice of you ned said damn right want to come see ned realized not for the first time that his father loved what he did for reasons he decided not to elaborate upon he declined the invitation hed do some reading on the terrace he said music a training runhed keep out of their hair and out of trouble might even work on one of his essays melanie coming to report the van loaded reminded him that their cell numbers were on his autodialer ned came to attention and saluted she laughed he watched them drive off the two veras were busy upstairs and in the kitchen he did read for a bit outside a novel larry had said was really scary reading supernatural horror didnt have quite the same effect after last night ned wondered if stephen king had ever encountered a figure with stag horns under a watchtower maybe he had maybe that was how he got his ideas ned doubted it he was too distracted to read though kept looking up and watching the trees on the far side of the pool bending in the wind he went back in and checked his email nothing from home but kate had sent him her essay he read it over decided it was perfect too perfectshe wrote way too well neds own schoolwork was okay but he never took enough time to be that good he opened the attachment and spent some time dumbing it down a little so mr drucker wouldnt hear alarm bells going off in his bald head it was good to have something ordinary to think about he stayed at the keyboard till he had the thing shortened and simplified enough to read like an essay ned marriner would do while on holiday in france he added a couple of typos and misspelled some proper names almost as much work doing it this way as it was writing a paper he thought not quite though he was going to have to write the other two essays properly hed promised and he personally doubted kate wenger would give him another essay without expecting something in return he wondered what that might be she was cute in that skinny runner balletstudent kind of way her being so geeky didnt bug him as much over here with the guys not around to needle him about it the guys were where mr drucker was let them suffer he downloaded the arles pictures and sent a couple with emails to larry and ken pretending to feel sorry for them it was too windy to go in the pool below the house away from the sheltering slope he could see the mistral ruffling the water and swaying the cypresses he checked his watch not even noon yet time to kill he wasnt due to meet kate till after five his fathers werent the only plans changed however he would meet her but they werent going up to those ruins not today hed made that decision in arles it was one thing to be adventurous another to be an idiot hed figure out something kate would go for they could tour that studio where they were meeting then have pizza or chinese in town she could tell him all about cézanne she probably knew all about cézanne hed tell her about what had happened last night maybe a part of him was torn about that kate was in on this had been from the beginning but she hadnt been around when the dogs attacked and what hed seen later with aunt kim by the tower was so outside whatever you wanted to call normal that ned wasnt sure how to talk about it it wasnt that he didnt trust her kate wenger was a trust me kind of girl hed already decided that but ned was the one with the burden of whatever was going on inside himself that strangeness near saintevictoire sensing people as an aura inside his head knowing things he should never have known in a way it felt like some kind of honour demanded he keep silent about what he seemed to have found aunt kim had talked that way about her own experiences whatever they were it wasnt a wordhonourthat you heard people use a lot any more there was also the considerable possibility that if he tried to talk about this with others people would think he was flatout nuts that was bmovie stuff of course the guy who sees the aliens land or the mutant giant killer spiders and everyone thinks hes drunk or stoned kate wenger wouldnt think that way ned knew that much he just didnt know for certain what or how much to say hed play it by ear he figured sometimes planning too hard messed you up his father had had plans for today and had shifted them with a gust of wind you needed to be able to do that ned thought react be on your toes he decided to go for a run he was under orders from his coach to keep to his routine and log it anyhow he went up to change kept his phone with him aunt kim had told him to do that she was someone that still needed figuring out shed said her hair had gone whitethe way it was nowwhen she was young as much as anything shed said or done it was that hair the absolute whiteness of it that made ned feel certain shed really gone through whatever it was shed hinted at she was another trust me kind of person he thought she hadnt told him what it was shed done back then that had to do with the honour thing he guessed partly being fair to his mother he made another guess it sounded like shed told neds mom her sister before going away to england and everything in their relationship had gone to hell maybe you got careful after that maybe you learned a lesson he clipped on a bottle of water put some euros in his pocket grabbed a couple of power bars and waved goodbye to veracook at the end of the drive he pressed the gate code and went through he did his stretches there getting used to the wind then started jogging down the slope of their road loosening up halfway down where the trees on the left opened out to a long flat meadow beside the road ned stopped there was a boar a really big one in the middle of that field ned held his breath and wished he were better hidden not from fearthe animal wasnt that closebut so he could watch it without scaring it away they were morning and evening feeders veracook had said they slept through the day this one was a contrarian it seemed on impulse he reached out with his mind hed encountered a few animals lately that werent what they seemed he sensed nothing however he wasnt sure what hed expected but it did seem as if what he was looking at here was just a really massive greywhite boar rooting for food in an open field in the middle of the day on the other hand today wasnt an ordinary day if ned understood anything of what hed been learning hed become suspicious of coincidences and while he was thinking this standing quietly in the roadway the animal lifted its head and looked at him boars were supposed to be nearsighted relying on smell and sound but this one sure did seem to be staring at ned neither of them moved for a long time ned thought hed feel foolish holding the gaze of an animal but he didnt then the boar turned not hurrying but as if determined purposeful and went into the woods on the far side of the meadow carrying a message had it been waiting here for him or was that way way too paranoid a thought did everything have meaning today out here in the woods and fields or would you go a little crazyor a lotif you let yourself think that way he shook his head how could you sort out what had significance when you didnt understand anything the answer was you couldnt and because of that he told himself you stayed out of it that was why he was going to tell kate wenger that they werent going up to the ruins of entremont today not on beltaine eve when the celts believed the gates between the living and the dead lay open after the sun went down an artists studio and a walk and wonton soup in town sounded just fine to ned thanks very much he watched the space at the edge of the woods where the boar had gone in but there was nothing to see he shrugged and started jogging again at the bottom of their road without even thinking about it he turned left and then right heading towards aix there was traffic it wasnt nearly as pleasant a run but he couldnt handle mont saintevictoire to the east and he was not going back up to the tower again melanie had told him about a stadium and track on the edge of the city a street sign pointed left to the stade before he reached the ring road it wasnt far a track would be ordinary familiar uncomplicated you went around and around no surprises there were a few older guys running there in blue tshirts and shorts ned joined them doing laps in the wind his shoulder was still sore it turned out they were from a military school down the way ned thought of a bad joke about french armies and learning how to run but decided it wasnt a smart idea to tell it a couple of them were moving pretty well and ned fell into stride with them he wasnt sure they were pleased that a younger kid was staying with them they probably thought he was american too which would make it worse he guessed so he grunted a few things in french about the weather and trying to keep up his training while over here and that seemed to help some they didnt try to sprint awayor jump him and beat him up for that matter most of the students peeled off across the field when the teachers whistle blew but one of them did two extra laps with ned and waved a goodbye when he ran after the others it felt good to have even that simple gesture of connection what he had to think of as normal life was still going on he had essays to write mileage to log he would email more jokes and jpegs home maybe hed find these guys here again or different ones maybe hed skateboardhe could see ramps south of the track later maybe hed download some new songs from itunes in fact he should do that today he had a monthly download allowance from his mother not used up yet and this was the last day of april you could treat the fact as dark and mystical full moon and spirit stuff or just remind yourself that you had four songs owing to you in the life you actually lived he was stretching and walking to cool off drinking water from his bottle when his phone rang he checked the number on the readout and flipped it open hello babe said kate wenger watcha doing ned blinked babe and whom might this be please he said nicole mary sue mariechantal she laughed screw mariechantal she said not literally though shes got two zits on her chin today anyhow gross how are you her voice sounded different sassier older im cool just finished a run on this track east of the city with some army types bit weird i know that track by the municipal pool the guys are from the école militaire seen them too yummy whats with you today nothing im in a good mood thats all yeah cause your evil roommate has pimples maybe and maybe because weve got an outing later if you have nothing more important doing mec buy us some cheese and apples and a baguette well have a late picnic up there um kate ive been thinking about gotta run babe late for class ciao she hung up babe again ned felt confused if theyd gotten to this stage in two coffees hed sure missed it larry would call him an idiot and tell him to go for it a girl who seemed to like him a long way from home and prying eyesvive la france wasnt this the real life hed just been thinking about download songs email a picture see how far kate wenger would let him go after school he shook his head again trouble was he kept picturing a sculpture in a cloister with a rose leaning against it and an owl rising through the open roof of a tower at night maybe you did have to hang on to normal life but some images could make it hard he was sweating needed a shower he went back to the intersection then to the right up the road he stopped at the bakery and bought a pain au chocolat and ate it as he walked better than the power bars by a lot he took the wide curve left and then their own path when he reached the open field again he looked but the boar hadnt returned small handmade signs at branching points along the road pointed towards the different houses on the way up he saw theirs at the top someonehad to be melaniehad stuck cute little canadian flags to the small blue markers for villa sans souci for the first time kind of late ned thought about what that name meant no worries yeah right and hakuna matata to you too he went back out later in the afternoon before the others returned left a note on the table telling his dad he was meeting kate they had his cell number anyhow the wind was still blowing but not as much as in the morning it was steady and hard though unsettling veraclean had said the mistral would always blow for three or six or nine days but veracook said that was just an old tale and theyd argued about it insulting each other it was kind of funny actually ned wondered how the shoot at the abbey had gone if bernard of wherever was spinning in his grave yet it was a bit of a hike half an hour to the ring road and then around it north towards cézannes studio he thought of taking a bus but he felt hyper and figured the walk would help he passed the grocery store and the bakery again but he didnt buy a baguette or the apples and cheese they were not going up to picnic there was no point he found the studio easily enough it was signposted on a busy street not much charm or quiet around it it would have been a lot different in cézannes day he figured this place would probably have been outside aix in the countryside leaning against the stone wall in the wind he watched the traffic whip by and tried to imagine this house overlooking fields olive trees maybe a vineyard hed seen another sign on the way here entremont was along this same road farther north kate had said that hed taken a few minutes to google the name it was pretty much as oliver lee had told them a tough tribe of celts and ligurians whoever they were called the salyans had built their stronghold up there the romans had taken catapults up in bc smashed it to bits killed bunches of salyans took the rest as slaves then theyd built aquae sextiae which became aixenprovence eventually and now a cluttered cathedral covered their forum so the roman city was gone too he thought there were celtic ruins roman ruins maybe even greek ones somewhere around and ruined medieval abbeys like the one his father was photographing today they were all covered over or tourist spots or just old and forgotten most people couldnt care less couldnt even tell the difference between any of them probably whats a thousand years between friends ned standing by the roadside car horns blaring at intervals mopeds whining past tried to decide if it should matter anyhow if coldplay or eminem or the boston red sox or guild wars online were the big things in your life and you didnt give a thought to ancient celts or bernard the spinner in his grave was that so bad everyone lived in their own time didnt they didnt they have to well really if you left out the types like the nameless guy in a grey leather jacket who had apparently made a carving eight hundred years ago and was here now to put a rose beside it did you have to believe him anyhow yeah ned thought glumly with enough added to the story you did even if you preferred not to same with what hed seen with his aunt he wondered where aunt kim was right now he thought of phoning her but that made him think of his mother and their whole storya different kind of pastand he left the phone in his pocket his mom would be calling tonight he knew one topic he wouldnt raise with her yo miss me lots he turned in time for kate stopping in front of him to rise up on tiptoe and kiss him on each cheek well they did do that here in france but still ah hi he said looking at her yo youve um got lipstick on so do you now she wiped at his cheeks you didnt before he said wow an observant maletype person must make an entry in my blog you have a blog no he laughed but he was still unsettled she looked good her hair was brushed out today not tied back she wore chunky silver earrings andhe belatedly realizedshe had some kind of perfume on he decided not to comment on that montreal men he said instead were the observant ones finest kind so you say wheres the food dude i asked you ned took a breath i ah thought wed do things a bit differently i havent been in town much not at all really thought wed see this studio since were here then cruise aix ill get you a caffeine fix then we can eat chinese or a pizza or something kate wenger stepped back a bit a car horn honked not at them ned i really wanted to show you this place it is seriously cool and it may tie in to the stuff weve been finding he cleared his throat well thats the thing youre right it may tie in and tonights not a real good night if it does beltaine she smiled a little she had some kind of eye makeup on too he realized uhhuh montreal men careful cautious guyslittle bit afraid kate theres a couple things ive got to fill you in on and yes maybe im being a bit careful i did tell you what happened by the mountain remember well obviously if you start getting sick or whatever we turn back you think im an idiot or something no but i think youre a little overfocused on doing this today there hed said it she crossed her arms looking up at him you really are scared stung he said kate im the one who went into that tunnel im not exactly afraid of doing stuff her expression changed i know you arent she shook her head but look ned its twenty after five it only gets dark after eight its a fifteen twentyminute walk and well go right now forget the studio id like to show you entremont even see if anything feels funny to you or anything then well leave i prefer chinese to pizza and i know where to get good hotandsour soup so come on she took his hand and tugged he found himself falling into step her fingers were cool it took a second or twohe hadnt done a whole lot of handinhand walking with girlsfor them to get their fingers sorted out he felt briefly as if he had a few too many digits then they did interlace and it waspretty good actually he seemed to be going north with her after all he caught another hint of that perfume he wondered if theyd be alone at this place as it happens she said cheerfully i am more woman than you deserve i still have two apples and half a baguette in my pack ew ned said for how many days with dignity she said montreal men may do that sort of thing but new york women dont packed this morning they walked beside the road into the wind it was rush hour cars going by a lot of students getting on and off buses classes over for the day ned saw another sign pointing towards entremont just past it the road became a minor highway as they left the city limits so what else happened kate asked whatd you need to tell me her fingers were still in his the guys were they aware of this would be saying things about how he had it made makeout wise heading off with a chick who had started the handholding and had even met him with a tiptoe kiss he wouldnt have gotten far pointing out that sometimes even guys greeted each other with kisses on the cheek in france there was something about kate today or maybenew thoughtmaybe this was what she was usually like and the tourguide geek stuff had been her manner with a stranger he didnt think so ned shrugged inwardly go with it he told himself she was right about one thing beltaine wouldnt actually begin until dark hours away theyd be back in aix you arent talking to me she said he sighed decided to go halfway but keep his aunt to himselftoo many family things entangled in that he said after you left the café day before yesterday the guy from the cloister showed up he felt her react the thing about holding hands you could tell right away you saw him outside no hed been in there two tables over behind a newspaper oh jesus christ she said ned in his current mood found that funny nah im beginning to think this goes back way before him dont be cute ned what happened how did you find him the hard part explaining this he let hisscreen down whatever his guard when you and i walked out and the sense of him i had in the cloister when he was on the roof kicked in i knew he was inside and you went back yeah she walked a few steps in silence i didnt mean it you know beforewhen i said you were scared that felt good but it would be uncool to show it he said well im obviously not careful im being led into the countryside by some hot new york woman i hardly know hot ned marriner you coming on to me babe again there was no way shed have said that before he looked over at her she was grinning and then she winked at him ack ned cried in horror no winking melanie winks all the time i cant stand it i refuse said kate wenger to let my behaviour be dictated by the habits of someone named melanie i will wink if i wish to wink deal with it she was smiling then she pointed ahead ned saw a brown sign with the symbol for a tourist site and oppidum dentremont on it they had arrived it was at a branching of highways a lot of traffic still they waited for a break and ran across no sidewalk here just grass by the highway they walked a little farther north right here up the hill said kate its pretty steep can you handle it ned didnt actually feel like joking they went up a dusty gravel slope he couldnt see anything at first then they were high enough above the highwaythey always built high in those days he knewand he saw a small parking lot and a metal gate the gate was open the lot was empty ive never seen anyone here kate said ive been twice i dont even think the guard sticks around probably just comes to lock up at closing closing ned saw on the gate was at sixthirty they would be out of here hours before dark kate led him through still holding hands along a wide path between olive and almond trees thats whats left of the outer wall she said she pointed this was a city here not just a fort the wall was on their right three metres high in places rough stones still in place a little ahead of them it had crumbled a lot more stones lay where theyd fallen or been dislodged the romans had brought catapults all the way up here ned remembered it couldnt have been easy to do that it was very quiet now two thousand years after he heard birdsong the wind was still blowing the light was really clear what his father had been talking about a little selfconsciously he stopped walking unlaced his fingers from kates and closed his eyes found nothing though no sense of any presence and he didnt feel queasy or unwell or anything like that she was staring at him when he opened his eyes he shook his head told you kate said its an archaeological dig a tourist site thats all so said ned was the cathedral she bit her lip first time today shed reminded him of the girl hed met three days ago they walked on there were almond petals scattered on the ground making it seem like snow had fallen the gravel path reached the end of the high wall and turned south to an opening and ned looked through and saw the long wide levelled ruins of entremont and though hed felt nothing and found nothing when he checked within he still shivered gazing out over low grey stones in the lateday light his gran used to say shivering like that meant a ghost was passing he didnt say that to kate it was bigger than hed expected though he couldnt say exactly what he had expected the path they were standing on ran alongside the ruins on their eastern edge ahead of them a long way ned saw that the plateau ended in a cliff to their left the ground sloped down past trees into a meadow on their right and in front was entremont what was left of it he really didnt want to stay here there were a lot of reasons not to stay but he found himself walking forward with kate looking out over the stones they werent holding hands now her own mood had grown quieter less feverish that was the word ned decided shed been feverish before he stole a sidelong glance at her she looked pale like the stones as if taken aback by what shed done where they were she stopped so he did they were entirely alone here in the wind among the ruins he looked left the site ended not far away in that short slope down to olive trees and the meadow tall grass there wildflowers on their other side were the crumbled excavated ruins beside where theyd stopped were low stones barely knee high the wall of a house he realized there were others like it all around defining small rectangular spaces this was the lower town kate said softly there was no need to be quiet but it felt right theres an olive press over that way under the tree she pointed past the low walls her manner was more like what he remembered ned nodded he walked past her taking the lead now they went farther south alongside what remained of those oneroom houses this had been a street once he realized it rose a little as they went he could see ahead of them where the upper town began there was a wider eastwest roadway big blocks of stone beyond it just before they got there he stepped up on one of the kneehigh house walls to look out over the site and then he stepped down into the space that would have been a home for someone with a roof and walls over two thousand years ago and as he did as he entered something happened inside him again ned stood still the wind was blowing but they were somewhat guarded from it by the trees to the north and what remained of the settlement wall kate looked at him from the path what is it she said he didnt answer this wasnt like any of the sensations hed had before ned what is it he heard kate wenger ask again he took a breath theres justa lot of power here he said what does that mean he heard her fear id tell you if i knew it was true he didnt understand this only that from these stones a feeling like a heartbeat in rocks was coming into him no sense of someone actually here more a its waiting he said abruptly then as he looked ahead towards the higher ruins across the wide eastwest street he added pointing what was that kate turned to look she cleared her throat that was the guard tower at the upper town entrance i saw a layout on their website beside it is where the religious sanctuary was just there see the bigger stones that was the tower ned saw the stones thick grey heavy only the base was left everything else was down had been down a long time but at some point back then between the part where they were and the section ahead of them architecture had changed you changed as a people bit by bit learned things then someone brought war engines to your walls and it didnt matter any more what youd learned he went forward to look almost involuntarily now up on a low wall back down up and over another and then he was on the dusty street that divided the upper and lower parts of entremont it ended to the east he saw on his left where the slope ran down to the meadow this road was wider than anything behind them or ahead main street he thought just across it lay the base of the guard tower he looked at the big stones imagined a tower catapults and time he thought he still had a pulsing in his mind as if the stones were trying to vibrate we should go now ned thought he knew they should go beside the tower base to the right of it was a large rectangular space what kind of sanctuary he asked well celtic of course they found skulls here kate said quietly you know they worshipped the skulls of their ancestors i heard and the heads of their enemies too preserved them in oil or made them into drinking cups he said nice people maybe it was right that these walls had come down if thats what theyd been like or maybe it wasnt and maybe it didnt matter at all what ned marriner felt or thought about it two thousand years later and then finallybecause they were quite close to it nowahead of them in the dusk ned noticed a column standing upright towards the back of that sanctuary space where kate said skulls had been found it was as if he was being pulled that way he stepped over another low wall into what had been a holy place he walked up to that column stood before it and looked more closely the pillar was about seven feet high tallest thing here easily carved on it from the base to the top were a dozen primitive unmistakable renderings of human heads ned swallowed hard and shivered again look at this he said he heard kate behind him she was still on the roadway hadnt stepped inside ned can you believe this he repeated staring at it in the twilight ned she said again he turned to look back she was really pale now ghostlike her arms were crossed tightly on her chest as if she were cold ned this shouldnt be here what what does that mean i saw pictureson the website of the dig this was found here but it was lying down not standing andned they moved it into the museum like fifty years ago thats where its supposed to be slowly he turned back the stone column wasnt lying down and it wasnt in the museum it was in front of him in the shadows of this quiet gathering darkness ned froze he didnt breathe he felt his heart begin to pound very hard his mouth was suddenly dry it took an effort to move his left arm turn his wrist so he could see what he already knew he would see he looked at his watch it was just after six he turned to look at kate why is it dark he said chapter ix after a blank rigid moment during which he could see her absorb what hed just said kate put a hand to her mouth she looked fearfully around her in the great and gathering darkwhich had come down upon them hours too soon ned whats happening as if hed know as if he had any hope of knowing gazing past her still trying to accept the reality of this ned saw torches he tried to swallow it felt like there was sandpaper in his throat his heart thumped again so hard it was painful fires were burning in the meadow east of the entrance through which theyd just come torches in a long linea procession moving towards the ruins unable to form words ned just pointed kate turned to see oh god what have i done she whispered no good answer for that no time for one ned looked desperately around for a hiding place but except for the one column beside him everything in entremont was flat levelled catapults and time he stepped quickly back out of the sanctuary grabbed kate by the hand and bending low started running east along that wide main street between the upper and lower towns they went straight out of the site and down the shallow slope he pulled her to the ground behind a tree they lay there breathing hard he thought she was going to cry but she didnt ned lifted his head after a moment cautiously looking to his right where the torches were twenty or thirty of them he guessed some were inside the lower city now others following coming in the way he and kate had come themselves moments agoin the sunlight of a springtime afternoon it was dark now it was undeniably impossibly night he couldnt clearly make out the figures carrying those flames beltaine he thought the celts used to light sacred fires tonight he was looking at fires kate lay beside him in the grass up close hip and thigh against his he had to give her credit she wasnt trembling or whimpering or anything like that in the midst of everything with the nearness he was aware of her perfume again this she whispered suddenly turning her mouth to his ear is kind of cozy neds jaw actually dropped again so much for whimpering or tears are you insane he hissed hope not but reallyi never in my life expected to see anything like this did you never have dreams about magic and what did that have to do with anything kate get it together i met some of these guys two nights ago i think we could get killed here then stay close she murmured and lets be real quiet she shifted a bit so one arm was right against him quiet wont do it he whispered they can sense things if i can do it they sure can we need to get away he fished in his pocket for his phone turn yours off he rasped last thing we need is a ringtone right now she moved to open her pack and do it ned flipped his phone open thank god he thought it was working here he went to dial greg and then stopped and swore savagely under his breath melanies stupid stupid joke greg had that idiotic multidigit autodial and ned didnt know his actual cell number he punched savagely heard two rings ned whats up he kept his voice very low melanie listen im in a bit of trouble ill tell you later but please get greg to bring the van to the road below a place called entremont quick as he can ill meet him there you know where it is you can tell him how to get here she was brisk unruffled had to give her that i do know just north of town ned you okay i will be when he gets here its ah something like what happened at the mountain poor baby okay ill have him bring advil hang in hell be on his way ned flipped the phone shut and turned off his ringer put it back in his pocket lifeline to the real world from wherever this one was he glanced at kate still right up next to him is there another way back to the highway she wasnt totally out of her mind she whispered they had a stairway up the cliff at the other end but its crumbled away mostly it would go south down the valley i guess we may have to try it this isnt close to safe he lifted his head again more torches at least twenty of them some had been planted along the path now from the entrance to the site lining the road all the way toof course he thought grimlythe sanctuary space where the one tall column stood it was directly in front of them to the left of the main street he couldnt make out the column from here but he could see the flames clearly the moon he realized belatedly was above them now full moon night well i still have to say i like snuggling here kate wenger said ned heardamazinglya huskiness in her voice even more amazingly amid his terror he was starting to find this aspect of things her scent how close she was in the dark grass unnervingly distracting you gonna kiss me or what he heard her say oh god he thought it made no sense at all none forget that now he whispered fiercely lets just go we have to get down to the road well try that other stairway and hope i figure itll take greg twenty minutes no stay where you are just behind them a voice they knew ned froze again his neck hairs prickling he felt kate stiffen beside him i have us shielded here they heard if you go from me theyll sense you and they will kill you tonight for violating this well that would change kates idiotic mood ned thought he heard a rustling sound a figure crawled up beside him to lie prone in the grass as they were by the tree you followed us ned whispered i saw you arrive ive been waiting for them the man from the cloister and café looked at him same leather jacket same cold intense expression i did tell you not to come here today i know ned said he didnt want to whispered kate from his other side i thought it would be cool i like your jacket by the way she smiled so much for changing kates mood the man ignored her his attention fixed on the torches some were planted others were being carried ned still couldnt clearly make out who was holding them why cant i see anyone they arent entirely here yet the man said quietly the matteroffactness made ned swallow hard again they will be when he comes he heard when who comes kate asked softly the man hissed when who comes she repeated more quietly there was silence for a moment the man i have to kill ned looked at him there were too many questions he said i thinki may have seen him two nights ago the figure on his left said nothing waiting ned doggedly went on i was at this tower above our place anddoes he have stag horns sometimes he can golden hair a big man ned nodded the wind blew in the moonlight ned saw smoke streaming south from the torches the man beside him shook his head he said ned marriner i have no idea who you are but you do seem to have yourself entangled here not me kate said much too perkily perhaps the man said gravely you did bring me here with what you said i used your words as a sign lacking any other you named this place among all the possibilities i am grateful beyond words id have likely been elsewhere when she arrived and as the gods are always witnesses she would have made me suffer for it she kate said you said a man was coming another silence she will be here we are where we are the barriers are down holy cow kate breathed is heis this guy like a druid a sudden involuntary movement on neds other side i hope not or i am lost way too many questions ned asked the first one he thought of why is it night he heard a sound almost amusement why would you imagine time should follow a known course tonight here i told you not to come it shouldnt be dark for hours we were going to be gone before youd have been dead when the spirits came if i werent here blunt not a voice to argue with whats his name kate asked this other guywith the horns an impatient voice from neds other side i have no idea yet you arent being very nice kate said with a sniff neither of you ned still didnt get it what was with her but he saw the man on his left shift to look across him at kate he seemed about to say something but he shook his head as if rejecting a thought to ned he murmured i will go up when he comes they will not be expecting me he believes he has led me astray all of them will be intent upon me go back along this field to where you came in then run down the path you will find your afternoon light again beyond the gate ned looked at him what will you do another shake of the head accept my gratitude and your lives leave quickly when i go up in that stillness wind blowing under moonlight they heard a sound from the sanctuary ahead of them ned lifted his head he gasped the figures were visible now and more than that the walls of the guard tower were back they were up had risen again as if theyd never been brought down never known catapults the figures on the street in front of it had their backs to that tower they were looking back along the path theyd just taken ned saw that they were dressed the way the man by the tower two nights ago had been in variously coloured tunics bright leggings boots or sandals swords swords these were celts ned realized and that meant they and the risen tower were over two thousand years old oh god he thought again he wished he were home all the way home and then he realized another strangeness on top of all the others he blinked looked again there was only moonlight smoky torches and yet he said softly why can i see them so well even colours before i couldnt at all now itstoo clear up there the man on his left said nothing for a moment then he murmured you are inside the night yourself in your own way be very careful ned marriner how do i do that ned asked by leaving it matters beltaine can change you whatever that meant the man looked away from them when he spoke again his voice had changed again but see see now here is the bright companion of all my days this too ned marriner would remember the words and how they were spoken he looked towards the entrance to the site someone else was coming along the path no horns on his head this time but ned knew him instantly not a figure you forgot tall broadshouldered longstriding the long bright hair same heavy golden torc about his neck what seemed to be a sword at his side he didnt remember a blade before the others by the sanctuary were watching him approach their torches high waiting the man beside ned whispered see how fair he is the tall one how brilliant ned could feel him tremble i will leave you the man said you have no weapon ned whispered they will give me one he heard remember along this meadow down the path away you said you werent a good man kate wenger said almost accusingly oh believe me he whispered staring straight ahead not even looking at them now i told you truth ned glanced at him and just as in the cloister something was inside his head abruptly a thought whole and complete something he should have had no way of knowing he heard himself say before he could stop were you at the mountain way back then saintevictoire the man in the grey leather jacket shifted as if being pulled from where he wanted to be he gazed at ned in the darkness for a long moment it really would interest me he said finally had we leisure enough to learn who you are im right arent i you were there ned could hear him breathing in the night we all were the man said she was mine that time he added something in a language ned didnt know and then he said go when i go up what will follow you should not see he moved forward low to the ground ned thought he was going to stand and walk up the slope right then but he didnt he stopped behind another nearer tree ned had a sense the man was feeling something too fierce too charged with intensity to have stayed beside them with their questions and chatter and guesses why is it dark whats his name hed been patient he was trying to save their lives but now he needed to ready himself for what was coming kate sighed suddenly beside ned and slipped her left hand into his right lacing fingers again they will kill you tonight how did you react so much to the touch of a girl when youd just heard that maybe ned thought maybe such opposing feelingsfear and the scent and feel of the girl beside himcould somehow go together not be opposed after all it was a difficult idea he looked up towards the site and the square risen tower the tall man had reached the sanctuary and those waiting there he looked golden godlike the others didnt bow but they made a space for him in the wide street his hair was unbound lying on his shoulders it was an axe at his belt ned realized not a sword jewellery glinted on his arms and around his throat a smaller older man stood beside him dressed in white wow breathed kate hes gorgeous she didnt mean the little guy in white a flicker of jealousy went through ned but her words were no less than truth he thought there was a sense of waiting of anticipation on the plateau ahead of them even now that this bright figure had come they were all turned to the north towards the torches planted on either side of the path and because he was looking that way as they were across the low longlevelled ruins ned saw when the white bull entered entremont he felt again as if the world as he had always understood it was changing moment by moment even as he lay hidden in the grass he saw that the animal was being led forward on a rope by three men through the moonlight of beltaine eve the bull was enormous but it was also docile moving quietly the torches were on stakes planted in pairs in the ground and the bullmassive otherworldlypassed between those fires ned somehow knew that there was a meaning to this going back so far he was afraid to think about it another bull whispered kate ned shook his head not another this is the one the others were about the moon was shining and full and in that light the animal seemed to gleam and shimmer beside him kate was watching it in the same way ned was with awe and fearand pity theyre going to kill it she breathed yes he said he saw the golden figure unhook the axe from his belt a sound came from the figures around him this was a sacrifice ned understood what else could it be tonight was the beginning of summers season hinge of the year in the days when these people and those who preceded and followed themhere and elsewhereshaped their rites of goddess and god fertility and death here and elsewhere ned thought wales too his own people his mothers his grandmothers they would have to go quickly as soon as the man in front of them went up ned wasnt sure why he believed he could do thatjust walk upbut what could ned properly understand about this anyhow he knew some things but he didnt know how he knew them and it didnt seem to be helping with anything that mattered once they got out if they got out it would matter less wouldnt it it would be over hotandsour soup he muttered in reply kate wenger giggled amazingly then after a pause she moved their linked hands up to her mouth and bit his knuckle neds heart thumped for different reasons than before behave you she said softly me he murmured genuinely startledand aroused but in that same moment he did have a new thought and felt a hard kick of fear something slid into place he was pretty sure he finally knew what was going on with kate he was about to say it but stopped himself what was the point he couldnt do anything about it they just had to get out for one more reason now if he was right the three men leading the bull had now reached the one with the axe they stopped in front of him the white bull stopped the smaller man in white stood to one side holding something there was silence then ned saw all the figures gathered there bow to the animal as they had not bowed to the man the broadshouldered figure spoke then for the first time ned remembered that voice from two nights ago rich and musical deep as a drum he said half a dozen wordsned couldnt understand themand when he paused those around him fifty of them at least gave a response the man spoke and then they did the wind blew smoke streamed from torches held and those embedded in the ground the bull eerily white in the moonlight stood placidly as if entranced by the chanting voices it might be that ned thought or else theyd given it some drug the voices stopped i cant watch kate whispered suddenly and she turned her face against neds shoulder the man with the axe lifted it so that the weapon too glinted under that moon and then with a shout of joy he brought it sweeping scything crashing down to strike the bull overwhelmingly between the great horns ned felt kate crying only now for the first time for the animal he forced himself to keep watching as the stricken bludgeoned creature collapsed to its forelegs and bloodstrangely hued in the moonsilver nightburst forth soaking all those close to it barbaric ned wanted to say think feel but something stopped him the man in the white robe stepped quickly forward holding a bowl to the spurting wound filling it with blood with both hands he extended it towards the one with the axe the man ned had last seen in the shape of an owl flying from a different ruined tower the big man let fall his bloodied axe he claimed the bowl with two hands ned felt his pulse racing furiously as if he were sprinting flat out towards some cliff he couldnt see the man raised the bowl in front of him the way hed lifted the axe a moment before as he spoke words of incantation the white bull toppled to one side at his feet like some great structure falling blood still flowing soaking into the dusty ground no one answered the words this time beside the tree in front of ned and kate a lean scarred man stood up he said something under his breath it might have been a prayer in front of the sanctuary the raised bowl was lowered by the golden man he drank the blood oh my said kate wenger suddenly too loudly she lifted her head i cantiwhats happening her voice was really strange she jerked her hand from neds shifted away from him ned stared at her the man by the tree had heard he looked back at them kate got to her knees made as if to stand terrified ned pulled her back down kate he hissed what are you doing she tried to pull away dont i needi have to no he heard the man just ahead of them breathe not this one she is too young this should not be kate wenger was writhing and twisting beside ned fighting to get away she kicked him breathing in shallow gasps she scratched his arm then hit him in the chest with both fists and just then in that same precise moment up on the plateau of entremont under a full moon in a darkness that belonged only to this time between times when the walls were down another voice was heard from the entrance to the site beyond the paired torches burning beside the path ned ned are you here come on ive brought the van with his heart aching and the first horrified glimmer of understanding coming to him ned saw melaniesmall and clever and fearless with the green streak in her hairtake a hesitant step forward between the smoking torches the way the bull had in that instant kate wenger went limp beside him she collapsed as if released from a puppetstring from a force that had been pulling drawing demanding her several things happened at once the scarred man looked at the two of them a last time then turned back to the ruins as if he too was being pulled that way and of course he was ned later realized pulled by centuries and by love ned saw him take a step himself and then another up the small slope and there he stopped still unobserved watching melanie staring at her he was completely exposed now up on the plateau he would have been spotted if any one of those gathered by the sanctuary had looked his way they didnt the big man with the fair hair handed the bowl back to the one in white without even glancing at him he stood very still head high hands empty at his sides facing melanie where she stood on the northsouth path they were all watching her ned saw she began to come forward slowly between fires ned shifted to his knees so he could see better he kept one hand on kates shoulder where she lay face to the dark grass but his eyes were on melanie along with everyone elses so he saw when she began to stop being melanie she came along the straight roadway past the low ruined walls of ancient houses towards the sanctuary and the figures waiting there walking between nine pairs of torches ned counted them as she went each time she disappeared and reappeared through the smoke she had changed the first time ned actually rubbed his eyes like a child after that he didnt do it again he just watched with his unnaturally keen sight here he saw when her hair began to change in that moonlight towards red and then when it was red and falling so much longer than before and he thought for the first time how inadequate the words for colours could sometimes be her clothing began to alter halfway down the row she was wearing sandals not boots and a calflength onepiece garment with a heavy gold belt he saw her come through another pair of flames with golden bracelets on her arms and rings on several fingers she was tall by then he watched her walk between the final torches the man who had summoned herwith the power of beltaine and the white bull and the bulls bloodknelt in the roadway so did all the others as if they had been waiting for his sign as if melanie were a queen or a goddess ned could see even from where he was that the big mans face was alight with joy and with need or something beyond need deeper whatever you thought of him you couldnt see that look and not respond to it melanie who was not melanie any more stopped in front of him she was in profile for ned lit by the moon and the carried torches she was more beautiful than any woman hed ever seen or ever imagined seeing he found it difficult to breathe he saw her look up at the moon for a moment and then back down again at the man kneeling before her he said something in that language ned couldnt understand melanie reached down then slowly she touched his yellow hair with the fingers of one hand it was very bright where they were as if they were on a stage acting out motions from long ago but also here now in front of him wherever now was then the woman spoke for the first time and ned heard her say in exquisite french formal very clear change your words returned in this new time shall we not speak in the tongue they use we will have to will we not as the dance begins as you wish my lady he was still kneeling he lowered his head it was difficult to see his face now with the long hair falling it is as i wish her voice was harder to read but it sure wasnt melanies she looked around slowly grave unsmiling taking in those nearby the risen moontouched tower only one of you she said softly only one of us the kneeling figure said alas he lifted his face again ned saw that he was smiling he didnt sound distressed at all two of us the scarred man said from the edge of the plateau no more than that and quietly but everything altered with the words entremont and the night turned they took on they accepted a weight of centuries their place in a long story or so it was to seem to ned looking back there came a cry of rage from the kneeling man he rose took a stride this way amid shouts from the others behind him ned saw spears lifted levelled a sword was drawn by one enormous barechested nearly naked warrior the figure in white lifted his hands still holding the bowl as if to cast a spell or a curse amid all this the man in the grey leather jacket walked forward entering among them as if he perceived no threat at all as if he hadnt even noticed any of this perhaps he hadnt ned thought perhaps he was seeing only the woman as if nothing else signified or had meaning she had turned to watch him approach and so ned could see her face clearly now for the first time he closed his eyes then opened them again his mouth was dry they tested you she said mildly as the man stopped in front of her he didnt kneel she offered no other greeting he inclined his head in agreement they amuse themselves as children do they were speaking french you think not only children surely i enjoy being amused she said i recall amusing you she laughed ned closed his eyes again for a second sometimes yes my stranger she tilted her head to one side appraisingly you look older you said that the last time as well did i she shrugged she turned away from him to the other one the bigger man was rigid tense like some hunting animal ned had a sudden sharp sense that violence was about to explode here time to go he thought i remember that torc the woman said ned saw the goldenhaired man smile and i that lapis ring among the others she lifted one hand looked at it briefly did you give me this one you know i did and when i did so she lowered her hand you will tell me what i know he bowed his head she laughed kate was quiet now beside ned lying on the grass he was still on his knees he felt paralyzed by fear and fascination by the horror of what had happened and he couldnt take his eyes from this woman weve got to get her back he whispered feeling idiotic even as he said it who was he to even think such a thing who went up who was it kate murmured finally lifting her head she wiped at her wet cheeks thats melanie she came herself i have no idea why greg didnt that was going to be me kate said dully you know that ned nodded he did know it it was a difficult thing to get his head around if melanie hadnt come he looked away from kate up the slope the mantheir manin his grey jacket was surrounded he was weaponless they will give me one hed said we should be going right now ned thought he stayed where he was how is it you are here little stranger he heard the golden one demand yes how the woman added they so dearly wish to know look at them you have spoiled the game music in her voice capricious amused children offer riddles they think are challenging he said mildly ned could see her face whenever she turned this way is that truth a riddle solved she asked he hesitated it is a truth love but a woman also gave a hint they might be here for the summoning and i heeded her love ah a woman and is she fair young with a sweet voice you have left me for another woe unto my riven heart there was a little silence beside ned kate wenger had gone still i will never leave you the man said quietly ned marriner shivered on his knees in silvergreen grass hearing that never her manner had changed again the mans back was to them ned couldnt see his expression they heard him say have i not shown as much by now surely her turn to be silent i am a helpless woman she said at length i must believe you i suppose helpless her tone and bearing made a lie of the word tell me she said her manner altering yet again is that carving you made of me still down below in the world it is and do i look there as i do now they could see him shake his head you know you never did in that stone and time has worked its will she took a step back from him withdrawing ah time and must i accept that you have not gone to undo that will is this love am i well served or do you merely offer words he lowered his head as the other man had done i have not been back in the world for long my lady nor have we arrived in an age when i may enter that cloister to work her voice was scornful he offers an explanation how gracious tell me might a better man have done so thats not fair ned heard kate hiss sharply beside him the figure in the grey jacket said only perhaps so my lady i know there are better men ned saw her smile at that it was a cruel look he thought the man added softly but it had occurred to me then as i worked that no carving could come near to what you are i shaped it to be only a hint from the beginning knowing it would become more so through the years wearing away one needs to have seen youand perhaps more than thatto understand more than that ned drew a shaky breath the smile changed and was not cruel any more she lifted a hand as if to touch his face but she didnt she turned to the other one instead and you he says he will never leave me this ones voice was deeper resonant my answer is as it was from the beginning even before that night among the village fires you left us when this began you began this it was always your rightbut until the sky falls i will fight to have you back kate sat up beside ned in the grass the tall woman red and gold as a fairy queen said indeed will you fight for me he said i would prove my love in the strangers blood tonight and always with joy and prove your worth his teeth flashed suddenly he pushed back his yellow hair which was being blown across his eyes he was magnificent like a horse or a stag ned thought suddenly remembering the horns have i ever been unworthy ysabel they heard her laughter ripple across the ruins ysabel ah she said so that is my name this time the animal offered it before it died the druid said as much then i accept of course her amusement was gone another shift of mood like a cloud across the moon she turned her head looking down at the white bull lying in its own blood on the dusty silvered street she said something too softly for ned to hear then she looked up again from one man to the other and now what happens i name you both is that it and then a battle that is why we are alive again a challenge in her now almost anger thats why he couldnt answer before kate whispered about his name this time ned reached out and took her hand it lay quietly in his they watched together it was necessary to leave he knew and impossible the woman had turned this way again towards the smaller man the moonlight was on her face what shall i call you she asked her voice had lost that softer nuance again she was controlling him all of them wilful teasing shall i name you becan because you are small or morven one more time since you came from the sea i had a different name when i did that he said mildly i remember when i first came i remember and ii have beenyou have called me anwyll she lifted her head beloved do you presume so much that i must name you thus because i foolishly did so once not truly angry ned thought but he wasnt sure i only said that it was so upon a time and more than once the man murmured he didnt lower his head you must not imagine i forget kate wenger made a small sound beside ned no one moved on the plateau the torches burned smoke streaming on the wind more than once the woman agreed finally named so or not before that scar and after by the sea and from the waves and ned marriner hidden in the darkness of their downslope and hearing this thought that if before he grew old and died a woman spoke to him words like these in such a voice he might say hed lived a life worth living the woman named ysabel was gazing upon the man she shook her head slowly anwyll must be earned again surely by one of you or neither perhaps but i will not name you donal here not a stranger again after so long little one lean and alone clad in grey you shall be phelan one more time my wolf this is all celtic kate whispered i know ned murmured he was thinking wolf how it suited the moon was high so much sooner than it should have been but what did should have been mean tonight he watched the woman who was not melanie any more turn to the other man gwri for your hair she said that teasing tone again allyn or keane handsome one briant for strengthwould you like one of those it was as if she was testing tasting names on her tongue playing with them one long leg was thrust out to the side a hand on her hip head tilted looking him up and down you have cause to remember that last he replied and threw back his head laughing at his own jest ned thought shed be angry again but he was wrong she laughed too he didnt understand her at all he realized let me kill him here he said gesturing with his hand in a wide sweep grant us leave to fight this is a sacred place tonight ned couldnt see her face but he heard the smile in her voice ah and so we are given your name she said take it cadell you are and have always been my warring one wolf and warrior there was a silence where they stood like figures in a tableau ned saw a shooting star a fireball streak slowly across the western darkness of the sky beyond and disappear like a child in need he made a wish upon it very well that is done thank you my lady if we are to battle now might someone be good enough to offer me a blade it was the lean one speaking brisk matteroffact the man they could now call phelan ned swallowed hearing that the crisp courtesy of the words but there was so much beneath them the night could explode right now a red electric violence go now an inner voice was crying a sword of course with joy said the one called cadell i cannot tell you how much joy he paused then added almost gravely you know that i will kill you i know that you will try someonethe small figure in the white robe ned sawstepped forward holding an unsheathed sword across his palms like another offering hed handed the stone bowl to someone else it was as if hed been waiting for this as if hed known it would come perhaps he had phelan came forward to claim it and begin but in that moment a very long dancethe torment and the glory of itwas altered on that plateau it would be a while before ned marriner realized that this was so and longer still before he understood why and by then it was almost too late no said ysabel phelan stopped a hand extended towards the hilt of the offered sword he didnt touch it both men looked at her she said quietly not a combat not this time and not by armies gathered to you it pleases me not i need to kill him love said cadell there was urgency in the words he pushed a hand through his hair again now that you are among us it is on me as destiny as a longing then master it if you are a man she said bluntly his head snapped back as if the words had been a slap to the face my lady we are brought back to fight for you said phelan softly we have always known this it is what we are she wheeled on him this time ned could see her again the fury in her you are brought back to be deserving of methe one more than the otherin my eyes will you deny that will you challenge it he shook his head you know i will not silence again it was time to go ned knew it was past time he didnt want to die here he heard her say i have another test of love and worthiness oflonging she glanced towards the bigger man on the last word and then back tell how do you long for me my wolf i have told you he said hai listen to the roman i will say it as many times as you are willing to hear my voice the one called cadell cried our peopleyours and mine do not squeeze words as coins from a misers hoard the roman yours and mine pieces of a puzzle ned thought if he lived long enough to work it through ysabel looked at cadell and then back to the smaller man she didnt smile this time it was as if ned thought she was waiting expecting something now because of what had just been said it came phelan spoke looking across her at the other man ice suddenly in his voice words did you say i know your words i remember some of them do you these perhaps kill them all god will know his own he stopped letting the sound fade drift like the smoke then he added softly a hoard is it what sort of piledup treasure tell us all dead women and babes charred flesh blackened bone a hoard such as that perhaps oh god ned heard kate whisper hoarsely ned didnt get it no time to ask the bigger man was smiling even in the face of thisgolden beautiful unshaken by that rage ned could see a wolf in him too suddenly both of them he thought poor little man cadell said mockingly my victory that time wasnt it i do think it was a difficult memory cant escape trapped within walls with those who so foolishly trusted you and i never spoke those words you know it you acted upon them you killed because of them the other man shook his head slowly in elaborate mockpity then took a stride forward will you chide mewill you do sofor deaths will you marius for women and children you will do that here in sight of it and with that name spoken ned understood because of what melanie had said before beside the mountain telling of pourrières below saintevictoire and the worldchanging battle there an ambush behind the celts the supply camp their families wives children two hundred thousand bodies rotting a redness in the world i am not a good man two wolves here ned felt sick again it occurred to him that these two could make a conflagration of the world in their war that they already had but even as he shaped the thought in sudden fear ysabel said no blades no armies it shall not be so hear my will hear me carefully for i will say this once i am going to leave this place you will not fight each other here cadell you will release the druid and his spirits to their rest again when the needfires die i have been summoned they are not a part of this any more say to me now that you will release them she stared at him i will release them he said after a pause you will not change shapes to seek me swear it i swear it but what does seek mean neds question too she looked from cadell to the other man when morning comeswith sunrise and not beforethe two of you will begin to look for me phelan stared at her said nothing she went on call it a quest pretend you are gallant honourable men unstained by any sins who finds me first will prove his worth by doing so i will be hiding and not easily found trust me in this i do not choose to be easily found or idly claimed she paused you have three days and ifwe do not succeed phelans voice was low then do whatever you wish to each other it will matter not you will have failed me both of you i will have been shown to be unimportant to you she stopped looked from one to the other then added in yet another tone i would prefer to be found first uncertainty in her voice ned thought there was a silence up where the torches were burning this isyou offer a childs game my lady i need to kill him cadells voice was anguished you like childrens games i thought the hint of vulnerability gone as soon as it had come and you are forbidden to kill now it is my will but there is this who finds me first may sacrifice the one who fails with my consent and by my desire dear god ned thought by my desire swear to this to all of this then i am gone you have only now come phelan said barely loud enough for them to hear am i to lose you so soon find me she said coldly and so keep me if it matters so very much or wander off to make another carving stone instead of flesh as you choose but swear now both of you three days find me the loser is a sacrifice for his failure she turned back to cadell will you call it a game she was so hard ned thought she was tall and crimson as a fire and terrifyingly cold he felt small inadequate a child listening and he was all those things in almost all the ways that mattered he heard the two men swear to her one and then the other ned we have to go kate whispered before she leaves and they start looking around it was true i will never see her again he was thinking i need to get her back was what he whispered repeating himself feeling stupid again even as he formed the words i need to what were his needs in this melanie well try well think how but not here come on ned her hand was still in his she tugged and he followed and they went from that place from the woman whose name was in his head now singing itself in that elusive changing voice never to leave he knew it even then first night that it would never leave it wasnt very hard to get away in the event slipping back north through the meadow past the wall phelan had been right when they were outside the site on the gravel path again the sky began to grow lighter as they ran by the time they reached the iron gate and passed through it was latespring daylight again bright and fair windy the sun in the west ahead of them as if it had been waiting the van was in the lot the only car there ned stared at it it seemed an alien unreasonable object he walked over melanies tote lay on the front passenger seat it was difficult confusing seeing that they had just been looking at swords and a sacrificial axe a bull lying in the pool of its own blood after passing between sacred fires how did a renault van come to exist in the world how could melanie not be here he felt very shaky thinking about that and afraid neither of them could drive and the van was locked theyd have to walk ned heard traffic below a strident car horn sounding that too so impossibly strange kate tugged again and they started down it was difficult his steps seemed to drag even as she pulled him by the hand he knew what he wanted he wanted to go back into the lost moonlight behind them find me she had said ysabel part two chapter x he began to cry walking back to aix amid the traffic noise and chaos as they approached the city came a delayed afterthenightmare feeling of horror it was difficult to keep moving he just wanted to stop somewhere by the side of the road a bench anything he couldnt stop thinking about melanie the idea that she was gone like that taken over and what was he going to say to his father and the others how did you tell something like this kate said nothing which was a blessing out of the corner of his eye as they came to the ring road ned saw that she was biting her lip again staring straight ahead he thought about her and what had so nearly taken place kate had been a heartbeat awayhardly more than thatfrom what had happened to melanie she had been leaving him going up into the ruins she would have walked between those beltaine fires she is too young the man they knewphelanhad said it would have made no difference and fifteen wasnt that young in the days when this story seemed to have begun you could be married by fifteen have children people had grown up faster once if hed had gregs phone number in his autodial ned thought if melanie hadnt come with the van instead then kate wenger wouldnt be beside him now it didnt help anything to think about that above them the sky was still bright with the lateday light the mistral had died down the sun was low traffic buzzed and rasped mopeds whining through it ned checked his watch a quarter after seven it had been night up at entremont how did you deal with that they crossed the ring road at a light and then stopped and looked at each other kates eyes were puffy what do we do she asked people were all around them on the sidewalk walking to wherever they had to go wherever their lives required them to be she didnt call him babe she wasnt going to do that any more he knew he also knew why shed done it before how beltaine like a tide had been rising within her shed already been shifting towards becoming someone else when theyd met outside cézannes studio before that even then melanie had come and then ysabel a car horn blared and another in angry response there was a traffic jam where theyd just crossed ned saw the ring road was clogged lanes blurred by cars undecided which one was quickest three buses were stacked in a row in the busandtaxi lane the scooters darted dangerously in and out life in the twentyfirst century i dont know what we do he said to kate but i have to tell my dad she nodded i figured ill come with you if you want i mean he mayhe should believe it more with two of us right ned had had the same thought you sure its okay id appreciate she shook her head nothings okay at all but im not walking out on you twos easier for this it was but that made him think of something threes better he said and took out his phone he turned it on tabbed to the memory screen scrolled and had the cell dial automatically one ring only ned whats happened shed know there was something he wouldnt have called otherwise he cleared his throat something bad he said it was tricky controlling his voice i needyou think you can come up to the villa i have no idea what to do aunt kim had the most reassuring voice of course i can are you there now in aix walking home with kate the girl i met walking from where entremont there was a silence oh ned she said all right im west of the city but not far it wont take me long thanks really get yourselves home its the last house on that road where i dropped you uhhuh villa sans souci melanie putthere are these canadian flags on the little signs on my way he hung up kate was staring at him waiting that was my aunt he said she blinked because he said awkwardly shesbeen here done this kind of thing kates expression changed youre kidding me and you knew that like in the cathedral he shook his head met her for the first time in my life two nights ago we sawwe ran into the big guy cadell the one who killed the bull kate bit her lip you didnt tell me that i know complicated family story didnt want to start it on the side of a highway and you werein a pretty funny mood you know she flushed that wasnt me she said i know i mean it was me but id never do i know she smiled a little first time since theyd come back down for a guy you think you know a lot ned tried to smile back and couldnt quite achieve it i dont know he said she nodded slowly okay but this is good isnt it about your aunt i mean shell know what to do right for sure he said maybe was what he thought he wasnt at all certain there was anything they could do he wondered about melanies family he knew nothing about them imagined a conversation hi there called to tell you your daughters disappeared she turned into some woman from more than two thousand years ago red hair shes taller he took a deep breath they started walking again curving around to the left beside the stop and start of the ringroad traffic as if swimming upstream through time time collided hard with the present when they reached the slope leading to the villa ned found his footsteps slowing between the trees and not from fatigue it was reluctance resistance a childlike wish that this state of inbetweenwhen something had happened but it hadnt yet been told and made real with consequencesmight go on forever he told himself the feeling was irresponsible even cowardly that they couldnt start doing something about melanie until hed spoken about it but he also knew how impossibly hard it was going to be to tell this story kate was silent again but beside him he looked into the overgrown meadow on their right when they reached it nothing there but butterflies and bees birdsong wild grass clover a few poppies some bright yellow flowers on the bushes at the edge of the woods at the villa gates he hesitated again his fingers hovering over the code box that opened them kate said we could wait here for your aunt he had been hoping to be honest that aunt kim might have been at the bottom of the road waiting to drive them up he could have handed this off to her been there done that you tell them he looked at kate who had volunteered to help him though shed never even met melanie or his father or the others shed known ned for only four days and she was here he punched the code the gates swung open he punched it a second time to lock them that way and they walked through time moved again his father was on the terrace at the little table a tall drink in front of him steve was in the pool doing his laps in the cold water ned couldnt see greg the gates clanged as they always did when they opened his father turned in his chair at the sound and waved yo steve called not pausing in his laps you walked neds father called better phone melanie and tell her she went down to get you where was greg ned asked walking across the grass kate trailed behind him fell asleep when we got back from the abbey they were planning something dire for him when you called i think you saved him whyd you phone if you were going to walk and whos your friend he smiled at kate ned had a sudden sharp awareness that this was the last moment of peace his father was going to know here it was a hard thought the terrible innocence of people before hearing news that could shatter their lives the doorbell a policeman on the porch at night in rain news of a car accident he wasnt sure what had made him think of that he said this is kate wenger kate my father edward marriner hi kate his father said neds told us about you you sell essays for walkaround money he grinned hello sir no not usually ned have vera set another plate kate can join us for dinner i will ned said he took a breath but i need to tell you something first somethings happened it was awful but he was actually afraid he was going to cry again his fathers expression changed but not in a bad way he looked at ned then kate sit down both of you tell me they sat ned took a couple of steadying breaths steve was still swimming it had to be freezing in the pool a blackandwhite bird lifted suddenly from the grass and swooped across to the trees by the lavender bushes its about melanie ned said oh god his father said the van ned not the van i would have phoned he saw kate biting her lip again what happened then where is she ned tell me shes gone dad melanie she wouldnt leave us in a hundred years maybe in two thousand ned thought is she joking again his father added are you jesus ned im too old for it isnt a joke sir said kate something bad happened andit is really really hard to explain she sounded earnest and intense not even close to a practicaljoke kind of person neds father looked at her and then back to his son youre scaring me im scared too ned said and i dont know where to start that doesnt make me feel any better ned took another breath like the one before you went off the high board at a pool an idea came to him and he followed it before he had time to change his mind daddo you know what story aunt kim would have told mom before she went away did mom ever tell you he had never seen anyone let alone his father look so astonished aunt kim edward marriner repeated blankly kimberly ned nodded did mom tell you anything about it ned jesus what does please dad did she he was pretty sure it was because kate wenger was beside him worried and serious and biting her lip that his father answered she told me very little edward marriner said finally it happened before we met shes almost never talked about it or her sister i know that ned said quietly i asked you once or twice remember his father nodded it was some supernatural story i know that mystical very he clasped his hands together on the table very new age i guess things from celtic roots your mother never liked never believed in and then aunt kim went away uhhuh your grandmother used to keep in touch with her your mother wouldnt even let her talk about kimberly she was angry hurt i still dont understand all of it but i learned not to ask his gaze held neds is your aunt involved in this ned whatever this is sort of can imay i ask one more question first his fathers mouth moved sideways youre going to arent you are youdo youhate that new age stuff as much as mom does edward marriner was silent a moment then he sighed i dont believe any of us knows everything about how the world works go ahead and tell me ned found that there were tears in his eyes again he wiped them away he said thats good dad thanks i didnt expect his father waited steve was still swimming out of earshot ned said for the past three days kate and i have sort of stumbled into something offthewall weird where his father asked it started in the cathedral the baptistry and the cloister the blue eyes were direct now where you sent me yes ned took a chance did you feel anything there another silence leave that for the moment go on his father was used to giving commands ned thought but he didnt do it in a bad way it was almost reassuring he looked at kate we met i guess thats the word we met a man in there and then later some other people whowho dont seem to belong in our time like theyre from the past and itit is a celtic kind of story i think you think it is said kate we know it is were just really hesitant because its scary and totally weird and people wont believe us but today is well its may day eve she stopped i knew that as it happens edward marriner said after a pause he looked at his son we used to go on picnics when your grandmother was alive i remember and tonight wasis a really powerful night for the celts jesus ned his father shook his head what are you trying to tell me kate and i went up to a ruined site near here called entremont this afternoon it was my fault kate interrupted ned didnt want to go i did want to but aunt kim said i you tried to stop us but i went hold it said edward marriner aunt kim said ned closed his eyes he hadnt meant to do it that way but if there was a good way to do this he sure hadnt thought of it i know mom will kill all of us or shell get spitting mad aunt kim says she used to get spitting mad ned please be extremely clear right now ned nodded aunt kim called me when we were leaving that restaurant two nights ago after i had that headache thing by the mountain she realized somehow that i had connected to something she knows about she called you your aunt telephoned you that same look of disbelief the one that should have been funny yeah remember in the restaurant driveway she was already here she flew down because she realized something had happened to me she knew dad flew down from england she lives there with uncle dave his father sighed i actually knew that and she she met me that night when i said i wanted to go for a walk jesus ned third time hed said that ned still thought he might cry it was embarrassing dad shes really great and she was trying to help to explain what had happened to me that it was in her family and moms and she told me not to go anywhere that might involvethose guys but i did i made him go kate said again and we got trapped and had to call for help but it was supposed to be greg and if melanie hadnt come when she did it would have been me who becamesomeone else kate was the one who was crying ned saw he watched his father register that why you edward marriner said quietly thereneeded to be a woman both men were there they were calling her they needed ysabel and i was supposed to become herit was already happening then melanie came because wed phoned wordlessly edward marriner picked up a serviette from the table and handed it to her kate wiped her eyes and then blew her nose ysabel the name spoken on a villa terrace a bellsound in the word he could still see her he could see melanie changing between flames they heard a car changing gears on the steep slope of the road his father turned quickly and ned could see hope flare in his face the heartdeep wish that this was melanie in the van that it had all been an elaborate practical joke to be dealt with by a thunderous grounding of his only child ned looked he saw the red peugeot thats aunt kim he said i asked her to come were going to need her dad his father stood quickly scraping his chair staring at the car as it came through the open gates they watched it pull into the first gravel parking space the engine was turned off a woman got out and looked across the grass at them medium height slender whitehaired she wore a long blueandwhite flowerprint skirt and a blue blouse over it held a palecoloured straw hat in one hand she closed the car door it made a chunking sound in the stillness ned lifted a hand to her she took off her sunglasses and began crossing towards them walking briskly his mothers walk ned thought edward marriner watched her come up the stone steps he cleared his throat with real composure given the circumstances he said kimberly ford hello ned and his friend havehave been trying to explain what this is about thank you for coming you do know what your sister will do to all of us he extended a hand aunt kim ignored it she dropped her hat on the table and stepping forward gave him a long fierce hug she stepped back looking at him edward marriner i have no idea why my sister lets you keep that silly moustache i am so glad to meet you and so sorry it is this way she stepped back a brightness in her eyes she was crying now there seemed to be an epidemic of it neds father cleared his throat again he handed kim another of the serviettes from the table she took it and wiped her eyes she looked over kate kate nodded hi she said in a small voice hi to you dear are you all right sort of i guess not really we were sayingtrying to sayit was going to be me up there it happened to if melanie hadnt come kimberly held up a hand stop please i dont know enough and im sure neds father knows less back up start with the cathedral take us to what just happened this crispness was his mothers too ned thought she took a chair edward marriner sat opposite her he glanced meaningfully towards the pool where steve was still swimming kimberly looked over she turned to ned melanies been changed into someone else is that it ned nodded both men were there the one kate and i saw and the one you and i met by the tower aunt kim closed her eyes damn im sorry ned said miserably i know you told me not toeven phelan told us she stared at him hes the one we met first kate and me he has a name now ned nodded it was all really hard sitting here above a swimming pool holding images in his head of twinned fires and a slaughtered bull that stone bowl held high filled with blood the other ones cadell melanie named them after she aunt kim held up a hand again like a traffic cop she looked at the pool and then at neds father you still need to back up but i think everyone has to be here she said gesturing towards steve you cant keep it from him if shes really gone is she edward marriner asked gone i mean thats so kim nodded shes changed anyhow they wouldnt make this up neds father drew a slow breath processing that greg too then he said finally well have to wake him ill do it ned said he needed an excuse to move he went into the house veracook smiled at him he saw that shed gathered some stalks of flowers and leaves had laid them above the kitchen sink sideways on the ledge not in a vase she noticed his glance and flushed a little dont tell vera she said in french a finger to her lips she laughs at me what are they rowan to protect the house a special night tonight very special ned stared he didnt say anything just went upstairs to get greg he felt burdened heavy with a weight of centuries it was steve surprisingly who insisted they call the police he was almost shouting greg perhaps still half asleep perhaps not was watchful and quiet after ned and kate finished their story he was eyeing aunt kim and neds father waiting to see what they did they arent allowed to kill each other kim said ned shook his head thats what she said not while they look for her she gave them that set time to find her said kate three days it would be three aunt kim said but shes doing something differently i think sounds as though they would fight for her normally maybe not kate said hesitantly it seemed as if sometimes she justchooses one and then theres a war in revenge maybe they all stared at her she flushed looked at kimberly but this was different i think they were both surprised so what does it mean if its different edward marriner asked im not sure aunt kim admitted then what do we do greg asked you know what we do now this isnt goddamned scoobydoo steve glared around the table we make a call for gods sake melanies been kidnapped and we arent detectives shes been changed not kidnapped kim said calmly steven steve the gendarmes will have no possible way of dealing with this and we do steve said his voice rising i mean way i make this ned and his friend saw some whacko cult pagans or wiccans or whatever faking a ritual and melanie got grabbed when she walked in and interrupted them he looked at ned admit it you could have missed what really went down you said there were fires and smoke i wish ned said he felt miserable steve i do but too many things have happened i mean aunt kim and i saw the guycadellwith stag horns and then he changed into an owl steve stared at him and melanie never disappeared ned added after a moment i saw her all the way i could see really clearly up there i dont know why she just changed as she walked between the fires jesus im supposed towere supposed to believe that i think we may have to steve said edward marriner slowly i dont like it any more than you do but something inexplicable seems to be going on i think we let dr fordkimguide us here whys that greg asked but quietly kim looked at him ive seen this before she said long time ago not identical nothings ever quite the same but i can tell you that ned and iour familyhave a connection to this sort of thing what sort of thing greg again still calmly call it celtic pagan supernatural pick the word that works for you and if none of them work steve asked but his voice had softened aunt kim was pretty hard to yell at ned thought she smiled wryly at steve not even idiotic mumbojumbo steve looked at her his expression changed maybe that one he said that might do he hesitated what do you want then how do we get her back yeah what do we do said greg tell us well do it right now they were assuming they could do something ned thought he glanced at kate saw her looking back at him the others hadnt seen ysabel or the two men facing each other among the ruins or the bull being led between flames ned wasnt sure about doing anything useful at all he felt sick thinking about that from inside the house just then as the sun was going down at the end of a day the telephone rang ned looked quickly at his watch so did his father oh bloody hell said edward marriner with feeling listening to the ring ned corrected his earlier thought one person couldprobably wouldfind it extremely easy to yell at aunt kim and disbelieve her too he and his father exchanged a glance ned feeling an emotion he couldnt immediately identify said ill get this one his father halfway to his feet subsided into his chair again in a way that was a surprise in another way it wasnt this wouldnt be a conversation hed rush to have his heart beating fast again ned went in crossed to the dining room and picked up the phone hello hi sweetie its me the connection to africa was really good again it was weird somehow you expected a war zone to have crackly brokenup phone lines ned took a breath hi mom listen you have to listen carefully we need you here fast as you can melanies disappeared some totally weird things are happening i cant even explain on the phone aunt kims come to help but we need you please mom will you come it poured out in pretty much one breathless rush in retrospect he probably could have found a smarter way of telling her but he was really scared and wound up and there wasnt an easy way to do any of this and he hadnt expected to ask for her not in that way like a child there was a silence on the other end of the line not surprisingly he heard her intake of breath ned did you just tell me that your aunt is there he said mom what i said was that i need you did you hear that part now that hed said it he realized he really wanted her here edward wheres your father she called him edward only when it was really serious on the terrace were trying to figure out what to do mom i told you melanies gone do i have this right kimberly my sister is with you in france she sounded a bit in shock actually yes mom we need her too with whats happening his mother swore it was pretty remarkable get me your father please right away he took a breath again no he said what not till you say you heard me mom im hearing you just fine i heard that mom im fifteen im not a kid and im asking for my mother to come help me think about that please another silence a release of breath from far away oh dear oh sweetie forgive me impretty stunned but all right im on my way fast as i can get there soon as im off the phone ill set it up for like the fifth time today or something he felt like crying maybe he was still a kid jeez thanks mom really i love you i love you too now will you get your father please i think hes scared to talk to you im sure he is he knew that tone ill go get him see you soon soon honey he went back out his father looked up so did aunt kim both looked remarkably nervous she wants to talk to dad his father stood up she knows im here his aunt asked ned nodded i asked her to come they stared at him neither spoke for a moment is she his father said finally she says so yeah how nice aunt kim said in a voice that was kind of hard to read his father went inside ned looked at his aunt she was fishing a cellphone from her bag uncle dave he asked god yes she said nodding her head you have no idea how much i want him here right now ned hesitated i might you said so the other night he wouldnt come if my mom had stayed there right hed have stayed with her aunt kim held her phone and looked thoughtfully at him ned marriner is that why you asked meghan to no i really want her shes good my mom when things need figuring out but i also thought from what you said that uncle davethat we might need he trailed off his aunt was staring at him so were steve and greg and kate he realized aunt kim smiled suddenly she looked really pretty when she did he thought you could see what she might have been like when she was younger she shook her head a little seemed about to say something else but didnt she took her phone and walked along the terrace towards the sunset they heard her greet someone then she went around the corner of the house and they couldnt hear any more there was a silence around the table it was chillier now with the day ending steve was barechested wrapped in his towel he had to be cold ned looked at the eastern trees beyond the driveway and the red car and the green wire fence the moon would rise soon for the second time do we tell her parents it was greg and after a moment ned realized the question was addressed to him as if he was the one who should know or decide steve was looking at him as well waiting for an answer that was pretty tough to deal with so was the worry on their faces you had to call it fear really he didnt know the exact relationships among his fathers team but melanie would be someone they cared about a lot um well see what aunt kim says but i think i think we have to wait three days kate said unexpectedly if we can three because steve asked kate looked pale and anxious but determined three because what are you going to say to them and because thats how long she gave the men to find her and why does that decide it it was difficult knowing this but he did seem to know it he had been there on the plateau because if we have any hope of getting melanie back its by finding her before either of them does christ snapped steve standing up in his towel and bathing suit is this hideandseek or james bond what do we do if we find her ask her pretty please to change back and dont forget the green streak in her hair ned glared at him how the hell do i know what do you want me to say greg looked from one to the other of them he held up his hands in a t for time out well fall off that bridge when we cross it he said ned managed a shrug but he was still mad really what did they expect from him steve was looking at him sorry he said sitting down again my bad im freaked i have no idea how to act none of us do kate said unless maybe neds aunt its like going to war greg murmured he scratched his beard how can you know how youll behave or anything like that they heard a footfall neds father was in the doorway to the kitchen he stood there shaking his head i have no idea what you said he murmured to ned but she is coming and she didnt explode not on the phone ned said his father considered that right not on the phone hows she getting here ned asked she thinks she can get to khartoum tonight on a un food plane then to paris in the morning then down here so like late afternoon evening thats right his father said shell phone im missing something greg said why would dr marriner explode thats not her style another footfall from the far end of the terrace aunt kim walked back they all turned that way the sun was behind her almost down daves coming she said hes going to try for a military flight to anywhere in europe tonight then connect she stopped as she saw them staring at her ah she said and meghans on her way edward marriner nodded how nice said kim again chapter xi ned had forgotten about the van they had to go back for it greg had a second set of keys aunt kim had her car ned said hed go with them his father looked as if he wanted to veto that but ned was the one who knew where the van was and it was getting dark the approach of night made them decide to take off right away please come straight back would you like to sleep here tonight edward marriner asked his sisterinlaw kim nodded i think i should kate do you want to stay with us or have you had enough of this kate hesitated then shook her head ill stay if theres room for me i can call and say im overnighting with a friend she gave ned a look and shrugged mariechantal does it all the time shell be jealous he said halfheartedly he was thinking that it was beltaine eve now only if i say its with a guy she said it definitely isnt with a guy edward marriner said firmly you and kimberly can have melanies room on the ground floor if you dont mind sharing aunt kim smiled course not itll make me feel young and maybe well have her back tomorrow neds father added kimberly looked at him seemed about to say something but didnt ned realized that shed been doing that a lot lets get your van she said she drove quickly and well traffic had thinned out it didnt take long to get there ned found that unsettling you were sitting where you could grab a coke from the fridge and listen to u on your headphones and then you were in a place where a bull had just been sacrificed and a man had drunk its blood and summoned a woman to life between fires no transition space between those things hed thought about distance and speed and the modern world a couple of days ago on the way to the mountain hed even had a notion to write a school essay about it saying clever things the memory felt absurd now another existence entirely he looked at kim in the glow of the dashboard lights he wondered if that had been the feeling that had driven her from home after whatever had happened to her could you be drawn so far into this other kind of world that your ownthe one youd known all your lifefelt alien and impossible just ahead on the right he said as the headlights picked out the brown sign for entremont she saw it and turned a little too fast the wheels skidding briefly sorry she said downshifting as they climbed thats how i drive greg said hed been quiet had taken the back seat so ned could navigate ned was impressed with him and grateful greg had been a lot easier than steve about accepting their story he wondered about that too what made some people inclined to believe you and others to react with anger or shock he realized he didnt know a whole lot about greg or steve or melanie for that matter the headlight beams on bright picked out the closed gates and the parking lot to the left of them kim swung into the lot the van was alone there they all got out greg punched his remote and the doors of the van unlocked kim opened the passenger side her bags here figured okay lets go greg said going around to the drivers side ive got the creeps here big time ned heard him but he found himself walking the other way towards the gates they were locked but could be climbed pretty easily kate had said the security guy came just to open them and lock up ned looked through saw the wide path that led east to the entrance trees mostly hid the northern wall of the site from here but he knew it was there and what was on the other side the wind had pretty much died down now ned come on greg called he heard his aunts footsteps coming over theyre probably still in there he said not looking back she told them to give her all night not to start looking till morning she sighed if i had any real power dear id go in with you see what we could do but i dont ned we wont get her back by getting killed there on beltaine would they do that she sighed again he looked at her ive no idea she said i wasnt here if they thought we were going to interfere from what youve told us yeah he said if they thought that some of them might and we are aunt kim said we are going to try to interfere how he saw her shake her head no idea come on greg shouted again they heard him start the engine hes right we dont want to see them tonight or have them see us you two head straight home kimberly said ill meet you there im just going to stop at the hotel for my things ned was still looking through the gates towards that other world beyond greg honked the horn it sounded shockingly loud intrusive ned turned and walked back and got in the van and they drove away he and greg didnt say much to each other aunt kim was ahead of them on the way back to aix and halfway around the ring road before she pulled into a hotel driveway greg stopped by the side of the road until a doorman opened the car door for her and she went into the lobby thenstill not speakinghe pulled back into traffic and continued around the ring to the road east he took the nowfamiliar left after the bakery and grocery store and the small aqueduct and then swung right onto their upwardslanting lane ned had his window down for the cool air country road a mild night the risen moon ahead of them above the trees greg swore violently and slammed on the brakes the van skidded throwing ned against his shoulder belt they stopped ned saw the boar in the road facing them we dont want to see them tonight we dont always have a choice he thought melanie will kill me if i hit an animal greg said maybe itll scoot if i go slow or honk it wont ned said quietly hold on greg huh what do you mean ive seen this one ned what the hell look at it scoot wasnt a word you would ever really apply to what they were looking at the boar was enormous even more obviously so than before seen this close it was standingwaitingwith arrogant unnatural confidence squarely in the middle of the roadway there were a few high widely spaced streetlights along the lane half hidden by leaves and the vans headlights were on it the rough pale grey coat showed as nearly white the tusks gleamed it was looking straight at them they really werent supposed to have good eyesight someone parted the bushes to the right and stepped into the road oh jesus greg said ned do i gun it no said ned he unlocked his door and got out he wasnt sure why but he did know he didnt want to run and he didnt want to face this sitting down inside the van hed also recognized who had come he swung the door closed heard the chunk sound loud because there were no other noises really no birdsong after darkfall barely a rustle in the leaves with the wind almost gone he shoved his hands in his pockets and stood beside the van waiting the druid he saw was still wearing whiteas he had been among the ruins when hed caught the bulls blood in a stone bowl ned knew it was a druid he remembered kate asking phelan if his enemycadellwas one and phelans horror at the very thought druids were the magicwielders this was the one he was almost sure whod shaped the summons that had claimed melanie turned her into ysabel cadell had been waiting for tonight for this man to perform the rite so had phelan for that matter it was necessary to remind himself that he was looking at a spirit someone almost certainly dead a really long time taking shape now only because it was beltaine he was also pretty certain this particular spirit could kill him if it decided to he wondered how far behind them his aunt was if shed taken the time to check out of the hotel or just grabbed her stuff and followed the druid was a small figure not young stooped a little saltandpepper beard seamed face long grey hair a woven belt around the anklelength robe he wore sandals no jewellery no obvious weapon ned thought they were supposed to carry a sickle or something and hunt for mistletoebut he might have gotten that from an asterix comic book and he wasnt too sure how much to rely on that source you could laugh at that if you wanted to he said in french is the boar yours watching us where has the woman gone a thin edgy voice angry controlling accustomed to being obeyed ned heard the other van door open and slam shut thats a real good question he heard greg say way i get this you answer it for us where the hell is melanie tell then you can crawl back into your dumpster easy greg he murmured more afraid by the minute there is no person of such a name any more the druid said not since she walked between needfires i require you to say where ysabel has gone you will not be harmed if you do ned lifted a hand quickly before greg could speak again couple of things he said working really hard to stay calm one i heard her say you were to stay up there tonight and that the two guys were to search alone any comments the man looked almost comically startled you were there during the rite damn straight i was so like i know the book on this you understand you can be killed for that nope i understand that the womanysabellaid down the rules you hurt us here we go missing you think phelans not gonna know about it and tell her you want to ruin this for cadell think hell be happy he heard the bravado in his own voice and wondered where it came from but he was not going to show fear to this guy he didnt seem to be the same person dealing with these people fifteen wasnt a kid in their world maybe that was part of it and it still seemed to him he was seeing too clearly in the darkness as if everything was sharper tonight the druid was staring saying nothing ned cleared his throat hes your boss isnt he your chief whatever so what are you doing here screwing things up for him you are ignorant whatever else you are the figure in front of him said his eyes were deepset under thick eyebrows maybe but why do you care which one of them wins her youre dead again by morning arent you he didnt know if that was so actually he hoped it was another silence and then she was one of us the world began to change when she made her choice and left the druid lifted his voice she belongs among us changes can be undone this is not just about the three of them he looked briefly towards the trees then back ned had a thought hearing that raised voice on impulse he tried the inward searching hed used before to find phelan twice and his aunt by the tower something registered a glow within not the druid ned smiled thinly it was really weird but though he was scared to the point that his hands were trembling he also felt excited alive charged with something by something that he couldnt explain the boar had gone nowoff the road back into the dark field or the woods beyond it had been here to stop them it had done that and departed ned said i had two questions remember heres the other one you say you didnt know i was up there before what are you doing here then why did you think id have a clue about this how did you know me at all or how to find me he knew the answers but wanted to see what the other guy did he was aware that greg was looking at him a kind of awe in his face the vans headlights were illuminating the road and the whiterobed figure insects darted through the light the druid lifted his head by what right do you question me oh fine ned said thats cool ill just wait for your friend to climb out of the bushes and ask him he saw the reaction to that he turned to his right towards the trees by the road there are mosquitoes up here man they must be worse in there you getting bitten he waited there was a stirring in the trees out of the darkness beyond the twin arcs of the headlight beams a redgold figure emerged neds heart started pounding when he saw him cadell had the stag horns growing from his head again ned heard greg swear softly in disbelief who are you the big celt said stepping up onto the roadway where the druid had been angry cadell sounded almost amused his voice was as before deep carrying you could follow that voice into battle ned thought he needed to be careful though it was true the thought hed had looking through the barred gates by the parking lot if these guys thought he and greg were a problem they would do something about it if they could ignore his questions he decided he could do the same with theirs he said tell me since this guy wont you really think phelan wont let her know you broke the rules like broke them immediately i heard you swear an oath cadell said it is beltaine she said to release them when the night ended the voice was still amused diverted it hadnt been ned remembered when phelan walked up into the site after ysabel had come true ned admitted beside him greg was breathing hard but i also heard her say you were to stay there start searching in the morning the big man smiled down at him his easy manner didnt feel faked to ned but im not looking for her he said i was looking for you cute you willing to take a chance shell buy that risk everything on it is she the type to be cool with that kind of scam cadells expression did change then which was kind of satisfying there was a silence ned nodded his head thought so and anyhow why were you looking for me she called your namethe small womanwhen she came up before she went through the fires oh right ned thought and cadell would have known his name who he was from by the tower with aunt kim hed made the connection if ned was understanding any of thiswhich wasnt a dead certaintythe guy had been alive on and off for more than two thousand years hed had time to get clever learn how to grow stag horns change into an owl control wolves and dogs piece a few clues together in the middle of the roadway the druid was muttering to himself angrily rocking back and forth like some windup toy ready to explode ned ignored him you saw us come back for the van he guessed cadell nodded i had someone watching it smart of you ned said one man against one man but you get the ghosts he seems to have you cadell said softly doesnt he ned hesitated no one has us greg snapped he took a step forward we have nothing to do with this we want melanie back then you can all go off and screw each other for all we care an unappealing notion cadell said he smiled what brys told you is true the woman you call melanie doesnt exist any more you need to understand that there is no reason for you not tell us where ysabel might be if you know you bastards greg shouted his hands were balled into fists by what goddamned right do you hold it greg ned said he moved over and put a hand on the other mans arm hold it ned took a breath he was pretty upset himself trying not to let it show they couldnt lose control here though they needed to know too much more he said why should we have any idea where she is why would you even think that the druid said something swiftly in that other language cadell looked at him and shook his head replied curtly in the same tongue then turned back to ned you can be told this much but you must believe i am not your enemy and phelan is not your friend or anyones friend he paused as if reaching for words the druid was still muttering that one ned thought wants to kill us cadell said ysabel changes each time we return each time she is altered a little by the summoning she carries something of the woman brought for her this has happened before then someone else becomes always ned was getting a headache trying to concentrate to remember all of this he was going to have to tell aunt kim maybe she could make sense of it if they got out of here the villa was so close but it felt years away he had to keep greg from exploding he could feel the other mans tension beside him he said she changes you two dont cadell shook his head the antlers moving i am as i have always been from the first days and so is he may the gods rot his heart so why why does she again the druid brys snarled something at the bigger man and again he was ignored cadell wasnt smiling now she alters so that her choice alters you are not expected to understand i am giving you these answers to show goodwill i am not your enemy goodwill greg shouted after what you did to her are you insane ned grabbed for his arm again he could feel greg trembling as if he wanted to charge forward start swinging fists hed get cut to pieces if he did i dont understand ned said youre right maybe i dont need to but believe meand this is the truthwe have no clue where she is cadell stared at him a long moment then he sighed as if surrendering somethinga hope it was always unlikely he shrugged very well your road is clear now leave us to our search keep away from this the woman by the tower she swore that you would that was aunt kim uhuh no dice she promised said ned before you took one of us he pointed a finger was pleased to see his hand was steady you changed things not us he paused took a chance would you surrender someone who mattered to you just like that it is not the same cadell said but hed hesitated yes it is greg snapped you want someone you lost so do we ned looked at him so did cadell ysabel is never lost the big man said that is the nature of this she is in the balance and i have someone to kill then play all that out without melanie ned said he gambled again my aunt will be coming up this road any minute she knows the one youre mocking again with those horns shes seen him remember you want her in on this risk losing ysabel because you chose the wrong woman to change and got tangled with us cadell was looking away now up towards the trees and sky so was the druid ned saw he wondered if hed made a mistake mentioning aunt kim he knew what they were doing he did the same thing himself closed his eyes reaching inward and then out for her no presence no sign of her pale bright glow she was screening herself or too far away i do not mock him cadell said looking at ned again when i am in the woods itpleases me to honour him with the horns he wears ned shook his head angry again and scared it was getting to be a bit much he heard himself saying oh sure right do you honour a king by wearing his crown and where had that come from he thought the druid stopped rocking cadell blinked greg was staring at ned again ned realized he still had a hand on the other mans arm he let it drop who are you cadell said hed asked that already a friend of the woman you took ned said and nephew of the other one the one who matters so you need to just reverse whatever you did to melanie and youll get us all out of your hair there was another silence that cannot be the druid said cadell nodded his head even if i wished it you saw the bull die and the fires he looked at ned a moment and would it be honourable for you to reclaim your woman and have someone else be lost in her stead no good reply to that actually she isnt my woman ned said lamely feeling like a high school kid again even as he spoke that was what you said when guys teased you about a girl for gods sake cadell smiled a different sort of expression it made you realizeagainthat this man had lived a very long time the roadway is clear he repeated gently enough we will go back to the sanctuary and wait for dawn as she commanded as it happens you are righti dont trust him not to tell her and she may choose to let such things matter i have learned at cost not to anticipate her go your way he paused then added again i am not your enemy ned looked at him in the headlights under moonlight wearing those horns the man looked like a god himself with a voice to match a week ago ned had been worrying about his frog dissection in biology and a class party at gail ridpaths house and the hockey playoffs he shivered nodded his head what did you say to any of this anyhow screw you was what gregory said and added an extreme obscenity i would be more careful cadell said calmly greg repeated exactly what hed just said word for word and strode forwardtowards the druid were not going anywhere and neither are you he snarled at the one called brys you handling this stuff you handle it manchange her back before i break your face sometimes a suspended moment boiled over into action just a little too fast stop cried cadell ned saw the druid raise both hands as greg approached moving fast he thought the man was warding a blow he was wrong gregs head snapped backwards his whole upper body lifted as his feet kept movingalmost comicallyforward for an instant edward marriners assistant a solid heavyset man went flying backwards through the air and landed hard in the road flat on his back in the glare of the vans headlights he didnt move his body looked awkward crumpled where it lay oh jesus christ ned said i said stop cadell snapped at the druid and added something savagely in their other tongue neds own anger came a force such as he couldnt remember feeling in his life he wheeled towards the big celt heard himself scream wordlessly with fury and fear and without knowing what he was doing without a clue his right hand swung up and across scything through the night air aimed towards cadell a good three metres away there was a sizzling sound like steak first hitting a barbeque or electricity surging ned cried out again something leaped from his fingers like a laserand sliced through the stag horns severing them halfway up the big man roared in shock and pain then there was silence cadell still twisted in the act of ducking stared at ned a hand went to his horns what was left of them the slicedoff branching part lay beside him in the road ned turned to the druid the whiterobed man lifted his own hands quickly but this time clearly in selfdefence ned could see fear in his face who are you the druid said his turn it seemed people were asking that a whole lot ned thought it could get old fast or be really really scary did you kill him he demanded greg still hadnt moved hes alive cadell said i blocked most of it brys be gone now you disobeyed me you heard my command the druid turned to him speaking slowly a watchful eye on ned he said command me not i have a task here for all of us this is not only the three of you yes it is said cadell flatly it always is shall i unbind you spirit from body right here do you want to try journeying back to the other side right now from this place i will do it you know i can you are here only because of me another moment of stillness a night road between trees and fields the moon risen brys said something in that other tongue words laden with a bitterness so deep even ned could hear it then the druid gesturedtowards himself this timeand disappeared ned shook his head and in just about the same moment he felt a glow within he hadnt been searching for heraunt kim was reaching for him he realized letting him know she was coming he hadnt known that could happen he hadnt known much in fact his right hand was tingling from the force the fury of what hed just done he looked at cadell again the remnants of the brokenoff horns were gone he saw the man stood goldenhaired as he had at entremont ned felt an unexpected sorrow a loss of something of majesty he swallowed i dont know how i did that he said i didnt know youd saved greg hell be all right didnt deserve death so soon though hes a fool he isnt ned protested weakly were way over our heads weve lost someone cadell looked at him then lifted his head as he had before looking above the trees ned saw him register that kim was coming the big man shook his head we all lose people i told you truth so did brys in this she is gone there is no such person in the world any more how are we supposed to accept that or explain it ned asked the celt shrugged not my problem the gesture seemed to say but ned was too worn out too spent to be angry again carry on with your lives cadell said golden magnificent the resonant voice ned remembered phelan saying the same thing to themhim and katejust days ago cadell put a hand up and ran it through his long hair if you stray near to us you are going to be hurt or killed or end up hopelessly between two worlds you are close to that already yourself whoever you are his voice was unsettlingly gentle again i am not your enemy they heard a car below them changing gears to climb farewell the big man said he lifted one hand straight over his head an owl was in the air where a man had been it was flying away north again over hedge field towards the ridge beyond the houses set back from the road then it was gone ned looked at his hands he felt like one of the xmen a comicbook freak his fingers werent tingling any more but he didnt feel any kind of power either aunt kims lights appeared the red car came to a stop behind the van ned heard her door open and close saw her approaching moving quickly almost running her white hair gleamed in the headlights he had never been so glad to see anyone in his life his aunt looked at him and stopped dead ned what happened who was here cadell and a druid there was a boar blocking the road they sent it and then they it was pretty hard to talk sent it why ned they thought we might know where she is she looked around wheres gregory present maam ned turned quickly greg was sitting up propped on one hand rubbing at his chest with the other oh god what happened to you got whomped by the druid guy good thing im way tough viking blood all the way back ned shook his head cadell blocked it youre kidding me no whyd he do that scared of our telling phelan ysabel learning they were down here or maybe hesnot so bad you mean im not way tough aunt kim managed a smile i think youre tough as horseshoe nails gregory but lets go up to the house i dont like it out here after dark not tonight hold it ned said his hearing seemed to be sharper too but a second later the others heard it then they all saw the bobbing flashlight beam above them on the roadway ned greg it was his father were here kimberly called its all right the searchers appeared a few seconds later his dad steve kate hurrying down the slope ned saw that his father was carrying a hoe steve had a shovel kate held the flashlightand a hammer we saw the vans lights then they stopped his father said we got nervous and charged to the rescue like that greg said standing up carefully he was still rubbing his chest jeez you look like extras storming the castle in frankenstein all you needs a thunderstorm and accents neds father scowled very funny gregory kate giggled looking at her hammer i couldnt find a stake she said dracula wasnt that far from the truth here ned thought with risen spirits abroad this was all release of tension and he knew it theyd been scared now they werentfor a while anyhow ned you okay his father asked ned nodded it occurred to him that no one had seen what hed done to cadell greg had been flat on his back out cold ned decided to keep that part to himself he looked at his aunt what was the name of that figure he asked the one you mentioned with the horns from when we met cadell aunt kim hesitated cernan cernunnos their forest god her expression changed he had them again yeah she shook her head so much for my powers of intimidation he left when we felt you coming as an owl ned nodded i think he was worried about you or at least unsure aunt kim made a wry face probably scared of peugeots famous for bad transmissions they were trying to calm him down ned realized he must look pretty freaked out he managed a smile but he didnt seem to be fooling anyone he kept remembering what hed done the feeling of it lets go up kimberly repeated you two can tell us what happened but in the house his father said right greg ill drive you can ride shotgun with this greg eyed the hoe thanks boss thatll make me feel so protected he had to be in considerable pain ned thought remembering greg flying backwards and that crumpled landing he wasnt letting on though people could surprise you ned wanted to smile with the others joke like them but he couldnt do it he stared at his hands again what he was feeling was hard to describe but some of it was grief this time when he came downstairs in the middle of the night his aunt was in the kitchen sitting at the table in a blue robe he hadnt expected anyoneshe startled him the only light was the one over the stovetop you get insomnia too she asked ned shook his head not usually he went to the fridge and took out the orange juice blinking in the sudden light he poured himself a drink kate sleeping she nodded he walked to the glass doors by the terrace did you go out it looks beautiful doesnt it he saw the moon above the city were better off inside dear it isnt a night for wandering but i did go wandering ned said looking at the pool and trees the cypresses were moving in the wind which had picked up again and because i did melanies gone if we hadnt gone up hush listen to me the two of you went because kate was halfway inside the rites already she said so you said so how different she became she was starting for the fires when melanie came it was true it wasnt a truth that made you happy i could have said no not easy ned not in this kind of situation you were in it too he looked at her did you ever say no his aunt was silent for a time once she said and what long story ned he looked away towards the moon in the window again he crossed back and sat at the table with her he said did you see that veracook put rowan leaves on the window ledge aunt kim nodded probably outside all the doors too if we look the past is close to the surface here ned which part of the past she smiled faintly thats the problem isnt it right now from what youve said id guess a lot of it dear he drank his juice were not going to get her back are we his aunt raised her eyebrows oh my and which part of what family did that come from not ours thats for sure is your father like this ned shook his head then stop it right now we havent even begun looking you go get some rest this is three in the morning talking in you and remember we have six good people here and two more coming ned looked at her well yeah but if my mom kills you were down to seven his aunt sniffed i can handle my baby sister he had to smile at that you think so she made that wry face maybe not well see but really go back to bed were starting early theyd made their plans both cars two groups aunt kim with kate in her best geek mode had chosen the destinations it had seemed hopeless even ridiculous when theyd discussed it it seemed more so now in this deadquiet of night he said theres something i didnt tell you from before she sat still waiting when the druid slammed greg i thought hed killed him i goti lost it i guess im really not sure how but like i slashed sideways with my hand from at least four five metres away and ii cut cadells horns off halfway up like with a lightsabre you know she said nothing absorbing this her expression was strange though she reached out almost absently and finished his orange juice you aimed for the horns not him he thought about it i guess i dont think i actually aimed at all i had no idea i could even he stopped it was pretty hard to talk about oh child aunt kim said what do i do about it she squeezed his hand on the tabletop nothing ned it may never happen again it was beltaine youd seen the boar a druid the fires you were pretty far along that road and you have our familys link to all of this maybe more than any of us but you probably arent going to be able to control it and maybe thats just as well so i just forget what happened she smiled again sadly youll never forget it ned but theres a good chance itll never come back keep it a reminder that the world has more to it than most people ever know my dad said something like that i like your father she said i hope he likes me you need my mom to like you a lot more meghan she loves me like a sister ned actually laughed go to bed his aunt said he did and to his surprise he slept up in the wind at entremont middle of the night he is remembering other times watching the torches burn down he is thinking about the forest the first time he came here hed been afraid of dying that day so many lives ago walking through black woods following the guides no idea where they were taking him if hed ever get back to the shore and sea and light even half lost in reverie he is aware when the other man returns to the plateau in his owl shape it isnt as if cadell is making a secret of anything phelan is looking away south doesnt bother turning to see the other man change back he keeps to himself at the end of the ridge overlooking the lights of aix below the sea is beyond across the coastal range unseen he feels it always a tide within and the moon is full he is undisturbed by the other mans disregard of the rules she has given them it isnt as if such behaviour is unexpected she is not going to make her choice because one of them has sought some advantage they have fought each other or waged wars here for millennia she is as likely to see cadells flying as evidence of a greater desire for her or not it is never wise he has learned to believe you know what ysabel will think or do and this newly devised challenge is unsettling cadell will be feeling the same way he knows they know each other very well by now the celt might eventhe thought comeshave returned here because hes actually afraid she might let a transgression have consequence she is capricious almost above all else unpredictable even after more than twentyfive hundred years and she has altered their duel this time into something new sometimes when he thinks the number the length of time twentyfive hundred it can still catch him in the heart the weight of it impossibility the long hammer of fate they never change the two of them she always does in small telling ways she must be rediscovered as a consequence each and every time endlessly different endlessly loved it has to do with how she returnsthrough the summoning of someone else the claiming of another soul his back to the other man and the spirits looking out from the edge of the plateau he is entirely unafraid cadell will not attack him here that far he would never go he expects the beltaine dead to be goneas commandedbefore sunrise though the druid might not be brys is a wild card of sorts in this always has been but there is nothing to be done about that really what he cannot alter he will ignore for the next three days what he needs to do is find her first he needs to concentrate on possibilities and there are too many he reminds himself that she wants to be found tries to grasp what that means in terms of where she might be it is possible that shell move around not stay in a single chosen place they have done this return so many times the three of them she will know how to change garments hide her hair find money if she needs it she cannot fly but there are trains taxis this world will not frighten her any more than it has unsettled either of the men returning to changes there are always changes she is not limited except by the range the ambit of their history here and that is wide east and west and north and to the margin of the sea in the moonlight the land below unfurling south is bright enough for shadows he holds the sound of her voice inside him and gazes out towards the changed invisible coastline remembering he was so afraid that first time here arriving with three ships to establish a trading post on a shoreline known to be inhabited and dangerous you made your fortune in proportion to the danger that was the way of it if the goods on offer were difficult to obtain back home the rewards were that much greater he was young already known as a mariner unmarried as yet willing to take risks shape the rising trajectory of a life not an especially genial man by reputation but no obvious enemies either a habit of command they had made him leader of the expedition they put ashore he remembers on the coast a little west of here the shoreline has silted up is greatly changed in two millennia logging for timber wood burned for fires irrigation systems flood barriers the sea is farther away now than it was he remembers seeing the trees from the boat the forest coming right down to where they made harbour a windbreak cove small stony beach looking from the ship at those oak woods wondering what lay beyond death or fortuneor nothing of significance after all it didnt have to be one or the other the celts came to them two days later appearing silently out of the woods as they were putting up their first temporary structures fear returning the sheer size of them they had always been bigger people and the wildness half naked the heavy gold they wore the long hair bright leggings weapons carried he knew how to fight some of his seamen did but they were traders not truly soldiers they had come in peace in hope and greed to begin a cycle a rhythm of trade seasonal enduring to stay if they could eventually there was no language in common two of his men had been here before farther east along the coast they had twenty or thirty words between them in the barbaric tongue men spoke here and it would have been laughable to imagine one of these giant savages speaking greek the tongue of the blessed olympians of civilized man they were far from civilization on that stony shoreline by the woods the celts accepted gifts cloth and wine and cups for the wine jewelled necklaces they liked the wine and they made an overture a promising one from their gestures on the second encounter two days after the firstmotions of drinking eating pointing inland beyond the treeshe understood what they were conveying he was being invited to a feast no thought of not accepting you couldnt allow fear to control you he left with one companion the next day when they came for him they followed ten of the celts into the trees darkness dropping like a cloak immediately even on a sunny day the sea disappearing behind them then the sound of it gone he remembers on this high open moonlit ground how frightened he was as that days long walk went on he had thought for whatever reason that this tribe lived by the water but there was little reason for them to do so these were not fisherfolk the woods seemed endless enveloping unchanging a journey from his world into another one a space out of time forests could be like that in the stories in life they heard animals as they went never saw any he was lost almost immediately as they twisted to follow a barely seen path mostly heading north he thought but not invariably he realized he was at their mercy the two of them would never find their way back alone your profits were in proportion to the risks you ran towards sunset end of a full days travelling the trees began to grow thinner the faint path widened the sky could be seen then torches they came out of the forest he saw a village lit with fires for a festival he didnt know at that point what the celebration was how could he have known they led him into that torchlight across a defensive ditch past bonfires through an earthen wall then a gauntlet of menand women not hostile more curious than anything they came into a circle a wide space at the centre of small houses made of wood a tall man silverhaired not young stood up to greet them they looked at each other and exchanged gestures he had liked the man from the first moment he was given a cup one of their own he lifted it in salute drank a harsh burning liquor unwatered fire down his throat an effort he remembers not to shame himself insult them by coughing or spitting it out no civilized man would take liquor this way he was far from civilized men hed felt the drink affecting him almost immediately a deep breath a brief smile he handed the cup back a man of restraint moderation chosen for these things as much as for courage and skill a leader responsible for his companion here and the others on the shore the need to be diligent careful he saw her then first time the world changing forever really that he thinks on the plateau of entremont two thousand six hundred years after as near to forever as a man might know for good or ill joy or grief love or hatred death or life returning all those things as much as a man might know he hears a sound now someone approaching stopping he turns this time he knows the footfall as he knows his own very nearly did you enjoy watching cadell asks hiding down below he smiles the bull he shrugs i never enjoy it very much youve improved the kill was clean the celt continues to smile it always is you know it of course they look steadily at each other he wants to kill the other man he needs to kill the other man the beltaine spirits and the druid are a distance away by the sanctuary and the stillburning torches he and the other one might easily be alone here in the night the wind had lessened earlier but has returned now clouds and stars overhead i know where she is cadell says no you dont he replies chapter xii in the brightness of morning driving west again with his father and greg in highway traffic ned was fighting a heavyeyed lack of sleep and the sense that he was a useless irresponsible person he was trying to make himself concentrate on what they were doing on all that had been discussed last night but he kept thinking about kate wenger as shed looked before going to bed ned had been alone at the diningroom table leafing through a guidebookthe section on the history of provenceamid the scattered notes and papers theyd put together earlier they wouldnt have been scattered if melanie had done them hed thought shed have stacked and sorted and filed the pages with coloured tabs of course if melanie had been around they wouldnt have needed those notes would they hed just finished looking up something and was feeling even more depressed and confused whatd you find kate said coming over he glanced up she was barefoot wearing only one of his own oversized tshirts he said ive been meaning to ask you about that bit up there before god will know his own oh right she made a face siege of béziers its west of here yeah i found it in kill them all pretty unbelievable in the muted light and the quiet her body under the tshirt and long legs below it were suddenly way too distracting you werent supposed to be thinking about that at a time like this were you steve and greg had been at the other end of the room slumped on the big couch watching televisionthe matrix dubbed into french which might have been pretty funny any other time neds father was on the computer upstairs emailing and aunt kim was showering kate was just out of the shower herself her hair still wet they were after heretics down here she said it was like a crusade those tended to be vicious yeah but from what phelan was saying the one who spoke those words was with cadell i know and our guy was inside they looked at each other is he our guy she shrugged i dont know what does all this mean like if they are supposed to battle each other for her how do armies come into it kate looked away out the window into darkness maybe sometimes they fight and one gets killed but sometimes she makes a choice and they both live then the other one goes to war youre just guessing she looked back at him well of course im just guessing he sighed sorry sit down eh no way this shirts too short this is all the leg you get he smiled want my sweatpants she shook her head im going to bed uhhuh i should make a bad joke now right probably wet tshirt or something it isnt wet i was careful im a good girl and youre obviously the kind of guy wholl do anything to get a woman to sleep over oh yeah druids and blood my usual never fails you call mariechantal she nodded she was shocked really no idiot but she did want to know what you looked like ned blinked whatd you tell her i said you looked canadian gnight ned she turned and went towards what had been melanies room the night before ned was left at the table images lingering of how clean and fresh shed looked her wet hair and her dancers legs then he thought about melanie and the lean fierce man hed first seen in the cathedral imagined that one leading a red slaughter by the mountain then casting men alive down a pit the way she said marius had done he could see it that was the problem i am not a good man and if he was understanding anything at all the other one cadell had burned a city béziers eight hundred years ago with phelan insideand maybe ysabel whatever her name was that time revenge was kate right had ysabel made a choice picked phelan that time but cadell hadnt died had he made that crusade or just made use of it might that be why one of the men needed to be killed so her choice was made that way or else this part of the world could drown in blood had it been the same at pourrières where ned had felt he was drowning in the slaughter or was this all so far off base it wasnt even funny and what did a canadian look like anyhow in the morning theyd gone back to entremont first on the off chance someone had lingered there the gate was locked though the parking lot empty it was the first of may a holiday in france but it didnt matter ned could feel it there was nothing here whatever had been on this plateau during the night was gone he wondered if the remains of the beltaine fires would be there if they climbed the fence and went in he thought about the bull how would the guard or the first tourists tomorrow deal with that not his problem he supposed his problem was a lot bigger it wasnt that he didnt believe in his aunt but the hard fact was if they were actually going to check out all the sites near aix that had connections to celts or greeks or romans they were going to need months not three days and they might not even have three days there were others searching after all the plan such as it was had been worked out earlier the evening before those had been the notes on the table kate scribbling place names as fast as she or neds father or aunt kim could rattle them off had begun biting her lip part of the way through he remembered it was pretty unbelievably random ned had thought watching the list grow greg took the motorway exit for arles and paid the toll it was a fresh bluesky holiday morning a day for a walk a picnic a climb they continued west for a bit but got off before the city to go north on a smaller road towards a low spiky range of mountains ned saw vineyards on both sides and olive trees their leaves silvergreen in the light there were signs showing where you could pull off to buy olive oil it was beautiful no denying it he had no idea how any of them were supposed to enjoy scenery today though aunt kims plan had been that she and ned with their linkshowever imperfectto the world of the rites that had taken melanie would each anchor a team theyd use the van and her little red car to crisscross towns and ruins and the countryside if either of them got even the glimmer of a sensation any kind of presence theyd telephone the others and and what that was the depressing part even if by whatever miracle of intuition or luck they actually found the place where melanieasysabel was hiding from the two men what were they supposed to do ask her nicely to change back ned remembered that hed put the question more or less in those words the night before hed been sitting next to kate looking at the list she was making glanum arles nîmes antibes vaisonlaromaine orange fréjus pont du gard roquepertuse noves narbonne saintblais hyères hed stopped reading there though kate kept on scribbling glanumwhatever that waswas their next stop this morning the red car was going to nîmes farther west and a couple of the other sites that way they were all pretty much just names to ned and there were way too many it felt hopeless there were even connections to greeks romans and celts in marseille itself and marseille had three million people they could spend days there and what was the point anyhow did they wander the streets calling her name like someone looking for a lost cat and which name even melanie or ysabel it was steve surprisingly whod nailed him on this last night steves attitude had changed almost completely right after greg had added his voice to neds explaining the events on the road including the druids longrange flattening of him greg had credibility it seemed came with a bruised sternum and he hadnt even seen cadell change into an owl ned thought ned had seen it twice now what did you do with that memory steve had said from by the terrace doors ned if we dont have anything better this is what we do man if we find her we figure out a next step were not going to just sit here are we or go around taking photos as if nothings happened no were not going to do that edward marriner had said and it makes no sense to be pessimistic greg added sitting a little stiffly on a diningroom chair i mean this whole thing is so off the wall why shouldnt we do something off the wall and fix it eh ned looked at him you sound like melanie he said greg hadnt smiled someone has to i guess was what hed said ned was thinking about that too as they continued north towards the sharpedged mountains passing tourist signs for a place called les baux what did melanie sound like how did she think what was there about her that he could try to sense or locate or did that even matter was it more a question of thinking about ysabel instead reborn into the world so many times so dangerously beautiful it could scare you he did get scared in fact remembering how hed felt last night looking at her hearing that voice or maybe it was the two men maybe they were what he should be searching for inwardly but what was the point it was pretty clear they had no clue where she wasthat was the whole idea of the challenge shed set them thats why cadell and the druid had come looking for ned wasnt it he considered that for a bit they drove past a farm with horses and donkeys in a meadow on their left there were plane trees along a deadstraight eastwest road they crossed another sign pointed the way to a golf course she wants them to find her he said his father turned around in the front seat edward marriner had insisted on being with his son today it made sense anyhow ned and aunt kim had to be in different cars kate was with kim because she was the only one besides ned who could recognize ysabelor phelan for that matter steve went with the two of them as protection for what that was worth ned had his dad and greg his mother had phoned very early she was taking a military plane from darfur to khartoum then a flight to paris and connecting to marseille shed be with them by dinnertime what do you mean she wants them to edward marriner asked his father looked older this morning ned thought a worried man lines creasing his forehead circles under his eyes he probably hadnt slept much either ned shrugged nothing brilliant think about it ysabel doesnt want to stay lost this is a test for them not mission impossible shes choosing not hiding which means what greg asked eyes meeting neds in the rearview mirror means aunt kims right maybe ned said there should be a way to find some place thatconnects up or makes sense i mean they have to do it so we can too right there has to be some logic to it well it would be easier if we could narrow it to a bit less than twentyfive hundred years his father said now you sound like me last night ned said greg snorted god and his angels forfend his father said and turned back to watch the road edward marriner was carrying two cameras a digital and an slr more for comfort ned thought than anything else it had occurred to him getting into the van that on the viewfinder side of a camera you had a buffer between you and the world there were a lot of ideas coming to him these days for the first time looking out the window he saw the turnoff for les baux coming up traffic slowed as cars made the left straight on gregory edward marriner said checking the map road goes to saintrémy we pull off just before i got it greg said its on the signs what is that ned asked up there les baux medieval hill town castle ruins pretty spectacular youve been with your mother before you were born on our list not for this oliver and barrett have it down for the book though it probably could be for this too best i gather the celts were all over this place before the romans came its way up there greg said look close they were waiting for the cars ahead of them to turn ned looked out the leftside window what appeared at first to be crumbled rock was actually the smashedup remains of a long castle wall at the top of the mountain it blended in almost perfectly wow he said his father was looking too they used to throw their enemies from those walls the story goes nice of them when medieval times the lords of les baux they were called louis xiii sent cannons up to the castle a few hundred years after blew it apart thought it was too dangerous for local lords to have a fortress that strong ned shook his head the romans with siege engines at entremont same thing here with cannons i thought you told me we were coming to a beautiful peaceful place his father glanced back im sure i told you beautiful i doubt i was so foolish as to say peaceful besides greg said in a joking voice when do fifteenyearold dudes want it peaceful could use some about now ned said they came up to the intersection waited for the car ahead to go left and carried on through this next bit heres called the valley of hell edward marriner said melanie has a note it may have inspired dante he had her notebook among the other papers he was carrying he was here too greg asked everyone was here neds father replied thats sort of the point there were popes in avignon for a while long story dante was an emissary at one time i can see it ned heard greg saying valley of hell i mean look at those boulders the landscape had become harsh and barren quite suddenly as they wound a narrow route between cliffs a few splashes of colour from wildflowers seemed to emphasize not reduce the bleakness it was darker the cliffs hiding the sun it felt lonely and desolate looking around ned began to feel uneasy barrett has this place down too edward marriner was saying for the landscape another side of provence but his voice had retreated seemed somehow farther than the front seat there was something else inside pushing it away ned took a deep breath fighting panic he didnt feel ill not like at saintevictoire but he did feeldistant and really odd can you stop for a second he said without hesitation without a word greg swerved the van onto the shoulder which was not all that wide the driver behind themclose behind themblasted his horn and shot past greg came to a hard stop what is it ned his father had turned again and was looking at him the expression on his face a mixture of fear and awe was unsettling a father shouldnt have to look at his kid like that ned thought feeling something he muttered he searched inwardly nothing tangibleonly a disquiet like a pulsebeat a faint drumming doesdo we have anything on whats here what might have been around this place edward marriner pulled a notebook from his leather case on the floor there were labelled coloured tabs separating it into sections his father flipped through found a page skimmed it he shook his head there were quarries for bauxite which gets its name from les baux those are finished now she mentions the valley of hell dante a quote from henry james about driving in a carriage through here she thought we might use it nothing else greg was looking back at him too you feeling sick not that but theres something ned shifted to the right side of the van and opened the door he got out he stood by the side of the road trying to understand what he was feeling traffic was lighter now an occasional car went past greg had the flashers on the high cliffs on both sides cast the road into shadow it was chilly the wind blew from the north not a mistral but not comforting either valley of hell you think shes here greg asked through a rolleddown window ned shook his head no i think what im getting is older from the past i think im feeling something from back then not from now but not as bad as before right greg asked ned looked through the window past his father at greg whose face was a lot like edward marriners now fear and a kind of diffident respect it was a bit scary to realize it but they believed him not as bad he said just the same sense of something still here the same kind of he fought for the words breaking through you mean from medieval times the castle at les baux his fathers forehead was really creased now ned saw the struggle to make sense of this ned thought about it he walked away towards the cliff and looked up at it then he came back and shook his head again cant tell im no good at this but i think it goes further back he took another breath well ask kate or look it up but i think we can go on i dont feel anything here from like now this is just weird thats all his dad looked as if he was about to disagree then he sighed and shrugged im out of my league he said ned got back in and slid the door shut greg looked back at him for a second then put the car in gear and started forward again they passed through that closedin arid canyon in silence came out of shadow into springtime fields and vineyards and sunlight again moments later they saw the roman arch and a tower on the left side of the roadright beside it there was another brown sign pointing towards the ruins of glanum down an angled treelined path on the other side greg pulled into a gravel parking lot directly in front of the arch the lot was almost empty ned got out he saw a couple of families spreading an early picnic on the grass beyond kids were playing soccer he felt like an alien watching them someone from a different world just intersecting theirs greg walked over to look at the arch and the taller oddly shaped structure beside it neds father stopped beside him feel strange looking at them edward marriner said gesturing at the picnicking group ned looked at him quickly i was just thinking that his father made another wry face good we can still share some things ned thought about that the distance it implied not just parents and kids growing up there was more now he swallowed i havent changed dad i justi can see some things i know but thats a change isnt it it was im scared ned said after a moment his father nodded i know you are so am i he put an arm around ned and ned let him his father squeezed his shoulder he couldnt remember the last time theyd stood like this his father let him go edward marriner managed a smile its all right ned and itll be better when your mom gets here you think yeah i do but what can she your mothers one of the smartest people i know you know it too thats why you asked her to come isnt it ned hesitated partly yeah he looked down at the gravel by his feet his father said gently you wanted her out of there ned nodded still looking down after a moment edward marriner said quietly so did i very much we may have cheated a bit but it was still the right thing to do melanie is gone your mother can help youll see ned looked up but aunt kim and mom his father hesitated ned people have tensions history comes back even our own not just the big stories theyll sort it out or they wont maybe but i dont think itllcontrol what we have to do here you dont think ned said certainty his father murmured can be overrated whatever the hell that means ned looked away towards the arch and the structure beside it greg was up close now gazing at them the soccer kids were laughing beyond where are we he asked thats the oldest roman arch in france his father said honours julius caesars conquest here if you go look youll see carvings on it gauls in chains dying this whole area was in the balance then after caesar its roman the other ones later a memorial to augustus grandsons or nephews something like that ned was thinking about the druid on their roadway the night before this is not just about the three of them this arch recorded the beginning of something and the end he thought his father said these two monuments were the only things showing for hundreds of years the ruins across the way were underground till the eighteenth century they only started digging glanum out eighty years ago how do you know all that ned looked over at him his father made a face again did my homework unlike some people i know i read melanies notes last night i couldnt sleep figures want to write an essay for me his father smiled but he didnt laugh they walked down together towards greg up close the arch was even bigger dominating only the one other tall structure beside it the asylum where van gogh committed himself after cutting off his ear is over there his dad said pointing across the field by the ruins ned shook his head everyone was here it was true wasnt it or damn near he looked up at the arch walking around it in silence the carvings on the base and a little higher up were as his father had said battle scenes some eroded or broken off some pretty clear romans on horses hacking down at enemies or fighting on foot gauls fallen mouths open in a scream there were chained captives their heads bowed he saw a woman in a greekstyle robe different from the others he wondered about that he stepped back thinking about the power this arch represented everyone might have been a stranger here once but did everyone who had come conquer and lay claim some visitors he thought killed themselves like van gogh or just went home like dante were the romans good he asked suddenly his father looked startled you expect an answer to that ned shook his head not really dumb question lets go across to the excavations edward marriner said you can tell us if theres anything here that he shrugged you know what i mean ned knew what he meant theyll be closed greg said the holiday i know everythings closed im assuming ned can get a read or whatever by the entrance and if he does greg asked then ill do what i have to do his father said ned and greg exchanged a glance come on edward marriner said he led them across the road then along a path through trees the glanum site had a low wooden gate which was locked though it wasnt especially high they could see the entrance building about a hundred metres down edward marriner looked at his son havent done this in a long time he said and placing a foot on the cross beam of the gate he swung himself up on top then down the other side not bad boss greg said ned didnt say anything he just followed his father over they waited for greg to do the same which he did grunting when he jumped downhis chest had to be hurting ned knew they went up the path alone amid morning birdsong under the mild bright sky the low structure ahead was clearly new beyond it visible now to their left were the ruins ned moved off the path towards the fence that surrounded the excavated area in the distance he saw two tall columns they reminded him of pictures of the forum in rome well yeah he thought the site was bigger than hed expected that was one thing but there was no other thing he couldnt feel anything at entremont earlier this morning he had known it was empty the sense of vacancy had penetrated into him here he just couldnt tell he didnt know he stood by the fence looking through it at those uncovered stones and felt nothing but quietness no awareness of anyone living or dead or returned on the other hand he knew by now that distance seemed to matter for him at least he looked back at his father and shrugged nothing i can tell but i may have to get closer maybe i should go in i can get over this fence with a boost in the same moment the door of the modern building opened ahead of them and a guard hurried out moving with an officious selfimportant stride oh hell greg said bet a euro and a pack of gum hes not real happy to be working a holiday double pay neds father said or more in france smiling broadly calling a cheerful hello he walked to meet the guard at least we dont look like vandals greg said he hesitated i think he combed a hand through his hair and beard and quickly tucked in his iron maiden tshirt ned wasnt sure any of it was an improvement the two of them stayed where they were ned was entirely happy to leave this part to his dad he turned back towards the fence and the site trying without success to sense anything inside he looked over his shoulder his father was chatting nowlooking relaxed it seemed to nedwith the guard the guard didnt look quite so calm but he wasnt blowing a whistle or shouting ned saw his dad take out his cellphone and dial it he looked at greg who shrugged edward marriner started speaking to someone then he handed the phone to the guard who took it hesitantly comically the man stood up straight as soon as he began speaking ned looked at greg again greg shrugged again the guard said something then appeared to be listening to whoever was on the other end it took a while he nodded his head several times it was very quiet they could just hear the traffic from the road ned tried to imagine this place two thousand years ago a fully developed roman town walls and columns temples and houses he saw what looked to have been a swimming pool did the romans have swimming pools he thought they did kate would know there was a bird singing in a tree ahead of them wildflowers were growing along the fence pale purple and white towards the south at the far end of the site the hills rose sharply framing the ruins the valley of hell was back that way cliffs coming right to the shadowed road he tried again still couldnt register anything within it was possible he thought that even if he did it might be someone entirely unconnected with what they were doing with ysabel and cadell and phelan that story once you acknowledgedas if he had any choice nowthe existence of this other kind of world who knew what else might be here lions and tigers and bears come on his father called suddenly in french this kind fellows opening up for us ned started over greg beside him the guard had already gone ahead he was holding the door to the building for them his manner as they approached was remarkably changed youd have to call it deferential whatd you do ned whispered to his dad bribe him that was my next idea i called the mayor of aix she gave me her cell number i caught her making lunch for guests but she spoke with this guy i told her we were idiots to come here on the holiday but asked if she could help out and she did obviously im due to take a portrait of her next week was that planned you kidding i thought the french were supposed to be rigid bureaucratic types they are ned actually laughed his father looked pleased with himself he thought they went in there was a cash register and ticket counter a lot of souvenirsreplica jewellery books tshirts toy soldiers plastic swords miniature wooden catapults ned saw a big model of the site under protective glass in a sunken area on their left and laminated posters around the walls showing the excavations at various stages the guard led them to another pair of doors on the far side he opened one and smiled i will escort you he said i can answer questions if you like monsieur i even have some thoughts for photographs it is a recreation of my own id be very grateful neds father lied but first a picture of you the guard hastily buttoned his jacket edward marriner framed and snapped a digital shot of him at the open door with the ruins beyond merci he said they walked through ned paused overlooking the site it really was large seemed even more so from here not so much ahead of them because the hills to the east came close but running northsouth along the narrow valley it would have been open to the wind in winter he thought the older part is that way the guard said gesturing to their right the biggest houses with their courtyards are ahead of us and the marketplace and the baths let me start with the baths and the big houses edward marriner said greg will you keep the photo log for me ned you can wander aroundjust dont get into trouble that had a bit more meaning than usual his father was proving unexpectedly good at this he was going to say i promise but he didnt the other three went straight and then veered left the guardcheerful now something to do on a boring daywas gesticulating and talking already ned went alone to the right towards the older part it didnt take long to begin after no more than twenty steps he felt a pulsing inside it came and went then a moment later it was there again on and off someone was calling him it would be a whole lot smarter he thought to have greg come over but he couldnt think of a good excuse given that his dad was supposed to be here working with his assistant his heart was beating fast again he swore under his breath then he thought about melanie about why they were doing this and he carried on alone he passed two tall pillars hed seen from the fence the sign at the base said temple of castor and pollux there was a coloured drawing of what it would have looked like two thousand years ago tall and handsome wide steps going up togaclad people under a blue sky he felt the pulse again he could place it now around a corner to the left just ahead another sign there said sacred spring there was one wall still standing on the north side and open steps crumbled and mosscovered leading down towards a dark shallow pool cadell was sitting on the steps looking at the water ned stared at him he ought to feel more surprised than he did he thought why did you call me the other man looked up at him and shrugged i dont know to be honest he smiled im not the one who figures everything out what shall i say a moment of fellowship call it that you will need to learn to screen yourself by the way you are visible to anyone here with any power at all yeah well i dont know how to do that but i dont plan to stick around in your space very long the man smiled again it isnt mine it is your own now too are you going to pretend this never happened after it is over once we get melanie back yeah i am maybe not pretend but i have no interest in staying in this cadell gazed over and up at him the blue eyes bright he was dressed today in black boots and torn faded jeans with a bright red polo shirt half biker half tourist he still had the heavy golden torc around his neck though the other jewellery was gone his long hair was pulled back in a ponytail ned registered again how big he was it isnt really a choice the celt said gently enough some things arent how did you come to be here in a van ned said a smartass line but he didnt feel like being polite greg drove remember greg your friend almost killed him last night i dont name brys a friend i need him for some things sure whatever are they gone the spirits cadell shrugged again probably he might not be i did tell him to leave reallywhy did you come here well why are you here looking for her why else am i in the world the simplicity of that ned glanced away for a moment well so are we looking cadell turned back to the black water below hed been gazing at it when ned came up in the distance beyond the ancient wall ned could see his father and greg with the guard towards the other end of the site it was a clear day they seemed small but distinct his dad was taking pictures shooting this way they wouldnt even hear him if he called the sunlight was bright on them but it didnt fall where cadell sat by the wall looking at the shallow water of the pool the big man gestured this part was ours first up to where we are thats the goddesss spring below us glanis her name was glanums a twisting of it names change given time over that way he motioned to his right the romans built after they drove us out you lived here yourself cadell shook his head no the segobrigae were south nearer the sea another tribe was here a village they allowed the greeks a trading place just behind you past the temple of heracles that was a mistake he seemed very calm this morning disposed to talk even ned tried to picture a celtic village here but he couldnt do it it was too remote too erased he kept seeing romans instead tall temples like the one across the way in the picture serene figures in togas the greeks here too their trading place ned said is that why you started looking here because you were all in this place cadell looked up again started i have been moving since daybreak i am leaving in a moment she isnt here by the way you thought she might be it was a possibility ned cleared his throat we thought so too so it seems ned took a chance pushed a little there isno way for you to do this thing this battle and then release melanie cadell looked at him a long moment is this the woman you love ned twitched me not at all shes too old for me why the hell does that matter cadell shrugged his broad shoulders it matters when we love something in the way it was said ned thought about ysabel how shed looked under that moon last night he tried not to dwell on the image and if he was shaken by the thought what must it be like for this man and for the other he cleared his throat trust me we care it matters cadells gaze was still mild i suppose you were angry in the road did you aim for my horns ned swallowed he remembered rage a white surge i didnt know i could do that im not sure i was aiming at anything i think you were i think you already knew something important what if youd killed me thereand you could haveboth the others would have been gone his expression was calm if one of us dies before she makes her choice or we fight we all go until the next time we are returned ned felt cold suddenly he would have killed melanie last night if his hand had sliced lower i didnt know that he said i think you may have there was really no way to reply to that ned said remembering something else i think phelan was trying to find you to fight you before she was even summoned why would he do that eyebrows raised the question seemed a real one she would never have come then maybemaybe hes tired of the overandover cadell smiled then not a smile that had any warmth in it good if so i can grant him rest here easily you arent tired of it the other man looked away again this is what i am he said quietly and then you have seen her how did a sentence carry so much weight ned cleared his throat again he said you didnt answer my question before you cant release melanie and still have your fight i answered last night your woman passed between needfires at beltaine summoned by the bull his death she is ysabel now she is inside this and so what happens i will find her and kill him and then then she and i will be together and will die in time and it will happen again some day to come over and over the other man nodded he was still looking down at the pool she broke the world that first time giving him the cup whatever that meant whywhy just the three of you living again and again cadell hesitated i have never given it thought i dont think that way go find the roman if you want to play philosopher but he didnt sound angry and after a moment added i wouldnt have said it was just the three of us we are the tale for here i wouldnt imagine there are no others elsewhere however their tale runs the past doesnt lie quietly dont you know that yet the sun was bright on the ruins the day mild and beautiful carrying all the unfurling promise of spring ned shook his head he couldnt even grasp it we are the tale for here in the distance he saw his father talking to the guard greg had moved away from them a little was looking this way he could see ned but not cadell down on the ancient crumbled stairway against the stone wall ned made himself wave casually he didnt want greg here cadell was looking at the pool again glanis watergoddess the water looked dark unhealthy the celts large hands were loosely clasped in profile composed and seemingly at ease he no longer seemed the flamboyant violent figure of before as if to mock that thought he looked up at ned again i killed him here once twenty steps behind you i cut off his head after with an axe spitted it on a spike left it in front of one of their temples what did you say to that tell about beating barry staley in ping pong four games in a row during march break ned felt sick again youre talking about phelan he wasnt named so then but yes the roman the stranger a flicker of anger hes still a stranger after two thousand five hundred years or whatever when does someone belong here by you the blue gaze was cold now that one never we are the tale revisited the number of times alters nothing she chose him when he came from the sea and everything changed ned stared at him you actually think the greeks the romans would never have settled if if she cadell was looking at him im not the philosopher he repeated talk to him or the druid i only know i need her as i need air and that i must kill him to have her ned was silent then he drew a breath i saw some of that change he said across the way the carvings on that arch cadell turned and spat deliberately on the steps below himself ned said quietly dont you get tired cadell stood suddenly he smiled thinly his eyes really were amazingly blue i need sleep yes that isnt what i i know what you meant you said it already leave this you do not understand and you will be hurt when he stood you registered the mans size again neds heart was pounding he folded his arms across his chest i dont think we can he said leave this means giving her up we all give things up it is what happens in life without a fight arent you still fighting this isnt your story it is desperately unwise to enter into it i am certain the roman will have said the same wasnt he greek first dumb reply but he didnt feel like giving in here cadell shrugged indifferently the same in the end a way of knowing the world subduing it she isnt here he had said it was obviously true it was time to go they had ground to cover ned felt cramped with tension he didnt want that to show tough canadian he turned and started walking away after a few steps he looked back were going to arles from here you headed that way need a lift he saw that hed disconcerted the other man some small pleasure in that who are you cadell asked staring up at him now from down on those worn mosscovered steps really im beginning to wonder no lift cadell shook his head ah said ned right youre going to fly and hope she doesnt find out risky he was taking a risk of his own talking this way this man could kill him right here cadell smiled though as if honouring the verbal thrust we do what we must he said and then as if reading neds mind you amuse me i dont feel i need to kill you but it may happen a silence then he added something in a different tone in that language ned didnt understand and after another beat leave this boy heed me i am giving true counsel no said ned he walked away then towards his father and greg and the stilltalking guard he gestured as he went pointing towards the road and the van across the way and the roman arch with the celts in bondage on it and taken in slavery chapter xiii they went back south through the valley of hell greg drove past les baux again turning right heading for arles no one was talking as they approached the city ned had already briefed them then hed done it again on the phone with aunt kim he hadnt told any of them about cadell spiking the other mans head on a stake or threatening ned if he didnt get out of the picture what was the point was he going to leave fly home to montreal and study for a math test melanie wasnt his love or anything totally stupid like that but you didnt have to be in love with someone to fight for them he should have said that back there the real point aunt kim had just explainedand shed repeated it to his father when ned handed him the phonewas that if cadell had been at glanum it meant that their plan wasnt so foolish that was what they had to take away from this if the two menor at least one of themwere checking the same locations they were on the right track themselves well yeah the right trackplus a couple of euroswould get you a café au lait somewhere ned hadnt said that part either kimberly and kate with steve had walked through nîmes already his aunt reported the roman arena the roman temple quiet downtown streets with shops closed for the holiday aunt kim hadnt picked up any sense of the others even though nîmes apparently had a long association with magic and sorcery they were in their car now too on their way to béziers ned knew something about that now kill them all god will know his own he was just as happy not to be going there he wondered abruptly if hed have had a reaction to that longago massacre the way hed had at the mountain not something he was anxious to repeat greg pulled onto the ring road around arles he stopped at a red light then drove slowly looking for a place to park it was not quite noon traffic had been light coming in but a flea market was set up inside the ring road hundreds of people were browsing it wonderful ned thought like we go up and down dodge the pickpockets and ysabel will be buying sandals or hand cream or something he shook his head wrong way to think cadell had been at glanum they were doing the right thing you had to keep telling yourself that greg stopped quickly put on his turn signal and endured a blaring horn behind him till the vehicle hed spotted pulled away from the curb he slid the van into a spot ned would have said was too small they all got out the street was shaded on this side the flea market was in the light what now greg asked he was looking at ned not neds father there was still something unsettling about that how was he supposed to know on the other hand who else but him really ned glanced at his dad we wander i guess go through this thing then back to the roman sites theyll be closed but yeah are youfeeling anything edward marriner asked again he got that apprehensive look on his face whenever he said that it should have been funny ned shook his head no but im really not good at this and those guys know how to screen themselves believe me ill tell you if i get something you didnt tell me back there mild tone but eyebrows raised in a way that ned knew very well first parental comment of the day he had been expecting more actually things had changed i told you nothing happened till we were at opposite ends of the place i couldnt like ask him to hang on a sec till i got my dad he looked across the street it was noisy and crowded cheerful people milling about on holiday a guy in a truck was selling pizza slices and soft drinks another one had ice cream cones there were tables with knockoff shoes and shirts old records books chairs walking sticks jars of honey olive oil skirts and bathing suits kitchenware pottery a very tall very dark man in a brightred african robe was selling watches for five euros someone else had farm implements shovels hoes rakes a wheelbarrow ned saw a guy his own age holding a rusted old sword and laughing why shouldnt he be laughing on a spring day okay details what kind of woman we looking for greg asked he pretended to take out a notebook coponthebeat style describe the perp ned had been waiting for this too and sort of afraid of it how did you describe ysabel how could you possibly he shrugged it wont work like that youre not going to just spot her but shestall shes got red hair i guess auburn chestnut but that can be covered right she looks young but notreally young if you know what i mean thats so helpful citizen greg said wryly is she pretty at least ned looked at him and then at his dad he was remembering you have no idea he said he crossed the road into sunlight cutting between cars and the other two followed him she has spent the night in the cemetery when the wind picked up and it grew cold she wrapped the stolen shawl around herself then went to enter a family vault she knew the bodies were very long gone caskets cracked open and raided for whatever of value might have been buried with the dead but the old iron key turned out to still be hidden where it has been all these centuries each time she has come here shes expected it to be gone found lost one or the other lost to her because it has been found each time it is still under the stone the covering boulder was heavy but she knew the trick of tilting it on the other hand the keyhole had rusted shut this time she couldnt turn the key any more she stood outside under stars and made herself accept another aspect of time going by it happens one way or another each return shed ordered this tomb built herself for a maid of honour and that dead girls family had grown in significance in generations following expanding the vault shed seen it returning in different lives changes such as this over the years no longer disconcert her as much though there was a time when they did she has known too many by now other things might be difficult to deal withthe eyes of one man the voice of the other the memory of bothbut not changes in the world money had been a small problem when she first left the plateau in the night the cache she went looking for was gone the city had grown north overrun the wood where shed buried it seventy years ago and currency has changed in any event it wouldnt have even mattered if shed found her cache francs werent going to get her food or a taxi ride this year euros she had allowed herself to be amused there was always something new cars were faster and there were more of them there was also more light when night fell telephones moved with you now it seemed unconnected to anything men and women walking the streets talking animatedly to someone who wasnt there but in the bright crowded city women left purses carelessly hooked on chair backs in cafés under the plane trees the same trees same cafés some of them or they left their shawls on a spring night when they went inside to adjust their lipstick shed taken her time up and down the wide remembered street and chosen a purse at one sidewalk café near the statue of king rené and a green shawl outside another one halfway back along the street green hasnt always been a colour she has favoured but this time it seems to be she took the last bus to arles walked to the cemetery she bought a skirt and blouse very early in the morning dawn just breaking at the street fair as it opened and returned to the cemetery she had wondered if one of the two men might choose this as his own first destination but they couldnt get here by sunriseunless cadell flew and she has told him he cannot do that he wont listen shed be startled if he did but he wont want to be seen transgressing too blatantly in this new challenge shes set them hed fear her reaction rightly so she knows both men very well eyes of one voice of the other neither seems to be here she is screened of course they will have to find her not just sense where she has gone both at times have been in this place one made love to her here she remembers but neither likes the cemetery for differing reasons they almost always have differing reasons it is what they are about she finds it serene here herself serenity isnt what she lives for but there are moments especially when shes just returned is coming to terms again with being in the world on the other hand she is at ease with the idea that one of them might guess and come immediately here and see the lock of the outer gate picked and find her resting now on a stone bench in the shelter of the church doorway past the oldest of the graves claim her this bright morning right away it excites her to imagine she can picture either of them doing it she hasnt yet decided which one she wants this time she wants both almost always she never finds choosing simple no matter what soul is within her how could it be simple by now sometimes she declines to choose they fight one of them dies the other comes to her she puts her hand to his face another kind of choice but it isnt as if she wants to stay lost seeing them under moonlight at entremont brought everything to her again as it always does right back to the first time the defining night when theyd become the story of this world this part of the world she is also excited by this new game in truth she is still learning who and what she is this time how she is different has been testing that inwardly through the night defining herself she is someone drawn to a green shawl the soul within her each time shes summoned alters her a little makes her behave differently which is why and how her desire her needover two thousand six hundred yearscan change they never alter they return each time as what they have always been gloriously there are no men alive like these two how could it be otherwise with centuries to grow deeper know more become more what man with seventy tooswift years can match these two they are always what they are at the core but they also have more than before each time they bring something new to her it took cadell fifteen hundred years almost to learn to change his shape and fly blessed or cursed this story shes never been able to say does it matter would deciding affect anything at all can it change in any possible way the fact that she came out from the shadows at the edge of the village one night long ago into a weaving of firelight and smoke brightness and dark her hair unboundin the sight of all the segobrigaecarrying a golden cup for the man she chose to wed and she had circled the circle of men assembled there and saw two strangers one stranger really his eyes and seeing him she did what she did so small a thing a cup of water from the goddesss pool extended towards a man a guest at her fathers feast a stranger from the sea the morning sun is higher now it is springtime in the world bright and mild there are flowers along the paths of the cemetery as she walks back through it pale green leaves on the oaks silvergrey on the olives there were no olive trees here when this story began the strangers brought them later from across the sea one of the things they brought olive trees wine writing straight wide roads eventually though soon enough conquest and subjugation springtime it is always spring when she comes back beltaine fires blood of the bull she buries the useless key again pushes back the boulder she could throw the key away now she knows but doesnt want to do that a small sadness as she passes the tomb a girl who died too young she walks the quiet shaded pathway to the outer gate no one is there cars pass by on the road she slips out when there are none to be seen clips the bolt shut goes out into the world again she uses the forestgreen shawl to hide her hair in the light she could have cut it off during the night but she doesnt like cutting her hair once it had been hacked off when she was burned for a witch such things happened in plague years when terror shaped the world there are enough such memories she needs a taxi now finds a place where one stands waiting but when she asks it seems she wants him to take her too far that she doesnt have a sum that will make it worth his time it is vexing at first then amusing she laughs aloud when she does that standing by his rolleddown window in sunlight the driver changes his mind agrees to take her where she wants to go later on the long drive back to arles alone hell be unable to say why he did thatrisking an illegal trip outside his licence zone wasting a morning and half a tank of fuel on a oneway cutrate fareand not even talking to the woman just glancing at her in his mirror as she gazed out the window at provence gliding by he cant say why he changed his mind but hell dream of her for a long time the rest of his life in fact they walked through arles for two hours the street market the area around the arena circling it again standing outside the barred entrance with irritated tourists who hadnt factored a holiday into their travel plans greg tugged at a few of the gates optimistically unsuccessfully they went over the theatre again ned remembered talking with melanie here two days ago it was difficult carrying such images standing here again he looked at the grass where shed been sitting it felt for a moment as if she were dead it scared him he didnt say anything they went on to the remains of the roman forum on the central square everything was closed for the holiday it was quiet his father and greg both kept glancing at ned expectantly like they were waiting for some light bulb to go on above his head or something it could be aggravating but he tried not to let himself feel that way what else were they going to do he didnt see cadell within himself again or phelan or a woman who looked like a goddess with auburn hair they had lunch at the only open café near the remaining columns of the forum the roman columns were embedded in the front of a nineteenthcentury building weirdly coopted as architectural support after almost two thousand years that said something about roman architects ned decided or maybe about nineteenthcentury ones the rest of the forum was under their feet buried like it was in aix around the cathedral van gogh had painted their café apparently ned thought he remembered seeing reproductions of that his father had insisted they eat a proper lunch but the food was tasteless tourist fare they phoned aunt kim from the table the others were in béziers now nothing they were leaving soon they would stop in roquepertuse a celtic site like entremontskulls found there toothen head home neds father paid their bill whats left here greg asked he looked tired too melanie could tell us edward marriner said with a sigh id say everything and nothing if you know what i mean we can go i guess the cemetery ned said suddenly the one oliver told us about his father looked at him if they hadnt lunched with oliver lee earlier in the week theyd never have gone to les alyscamps or even if they had done that lunch but lee hadnt mentioned the ancient cemetery with its long history ned found that if he thought about things like that too much the accident of it all his mind started down unsettling paths like what if hed decided to stay in the villa after being sick on the mountain the way the others had told him to if hed never met kate in the café that afternoon or phelan after shed gone if kate had never mentioned the word entremont to him well she couldnt have if he hadnt been there right and what if hed gone shopping for music that first morning instead of thinking it would be sort of funnya joke to email larry catoto listen to houses of the holy inside a cathedral could you make a pattern out of any of this stitch together the seeming randomness into something that had meaning is that what life was about he wondered trying to make that pattern to have things make sense and anyway how did you make sense of a man turning into an owl to fly from you call it a computergenerated effect and give thanks to george lucas les alyscamps cemetery was a fair walk from the centre of town along the ring road to the outskirts it was empty when they got there closed up barred like all the other monuments today ned put a hand on the bars looking through he swallowed shes been here he said he knew his voice sounded funny she may still be here for all i know i dont know much his dad and greg were staring at him that look again could you get used to it he wondered it wasnt like before the feeling he had not from the mountain not from the valley this morning here it was as if a scent was in the air drifting flowers but more than that or less an almostrecalled memory something unsettling that could reach in change the rhythm of your heart as you stood by iron gates he knew there was nothing actually around them the others would have noticed if there were but he also knew what he knew bonedumb as that might sound and ysabels presence was here disturbing and exciting he swallowed again his mouth dry he wished they had a bottle of water gates padlocked greg said yanking at the lock we could try to climb the iron gate was well over their heads and railings ran both ways from it same height all along the street front maybe you could boost me ned said looking upwards not so you go in alone his father said flatly dont even think it through the bars they could see trees and a long wide walkway splintered with light and shade there was a church at the far end a ticket office a little way down on the left was shuttered ned saw smaller and larger trees stone benches grey stone coffins lying about as if discarded he assumed they were empty he hoped they were empty it was really quiet here he stared through the bars as if gazing could make her come to life in there he pictured her walking towards him along that cool lightandshadow alley between trees and tombs stand behind me his father said suddenly watch the road let me see that lock and a moment later as they obeyed this is easy its been done before i see the scratches jeez you can pick locks ned said he was looking out for cars but glanced back over his shoulder eyes widening his dad had taken out a swiss army knife you have no idea the things your old man can do edward marriner muttered flipping open a blade which is probably a good thing im not gonna touch that line greg said but ned could see that he was surprised too and nervous they were breaking into a major tourist site in broad daylight when was daylight not broad ned thought suddenly what made it broad could you break in more easily in narrow daylight kate might have laughed if hed said that to her or maybe not he wondered if the mayor of aix was in the middle of her lunch party now if shed answer her phone again if they needed her a citroën went by going too fast and took the curve left towards town the sun was high it was windy a few fast white clouds moving south ned heard a scraping of metal behind him got it edward marriner said satisfaction in his voice inside both of you ill close it behind us hold on greg said they waited for a pair of cars to go past okay said greg all clear man why do i feel like james bond they slipped through the gate his father came in last pulled it shut and quickly fiddled through the bars with the padlock so it looked closed again go on edward marriner said out of sight of the road they walked past a stone coffin and the ticket office it was cooler in the shade to their right was a large monument on the left as they went ahead ned saw a lockedup tomb with an iron grate in a heavy door steps led down behind the door ahead between them and the church in sunlight was an area of sunken excavations roped off those are the oldest graves his father said ned looked at him youve been here his father made a face no i told you i read melanies notes of course you could almost laugh except you couldnt because she was gone and then you couldnt because you heard a sound behind you in a place that was locked shut with no one but them inside and you turned thinking it might be a security guard and then you really didnt feel like laughing any more i did tell you to leave this a cold voice said cold could make you shiver it wasnt a guard it was the druid standing between them and the gate that led back out to the world where cars took curves too fast or honked when you slowed to park brys who had almost killed greg last night was still wearing his white robe ned couldnt tell where hed come from where hed been hiding as they walked in or where the wolves had been that now padded up seven of them behind him they sat on their haunches watching the quiet didnt seem peaceful any more ned looked at his father edward marriner stroked his moustache thoughtfully taking his time calmly he said im not quite sure why but i feel a bit relieved to see you exist you wouldnt understand that i suppose the druid said nothing neds father went on in a conversational tone my understanding is that you have powers that can be used to harm us you used them last night on our friend here powers ned was thinking dad pay attention those animals with the teeth he doesnt need powers a week ago a little more hed been doing a halfassed science project on tectonic plates with barry staley he wasnt sure what his father was trying to achieve this might be stalling but he had no idea what a delay would accomplish could they summon the marines what marines it occurred to him for the first time with a clarity that almost buckled his knees that they could die here in this cemetery among the looted tombs that one the druid looked at greg cadell saved his life he fears drawing attention bringing people into this and you dont edward marriner asked still in his most relaxed tone i dont have the time to pay heed to such things i have very little time when i return fear a single death have you any idea how many people have died in this over the years im beginning to are you proud of it the small greyhaired figure lifted his head pride has nothing to do with anything this one is insignificant so are you you do not matter what does ned saw gregs hand in his pocket and finally he realized what this delay was aboutand how pointless it was greg would be autodialing aunt kim who was like two hours away or something or maybe he was calling the mayor of aix at her lunch or whatever was in france james bond would have had a bomb built into the phone the druid was looking at neds father as if trying to decide what to answer this one too ned thought hes been part of this or at the edges of it all this time the one who shapes the summoning maybe he didnt want to stay at the edges she must be claimed by cadell the druid said his voice almost an incantation the stranger must be killed sacrificed he must end there may be ways it can be done even now one of the wolves got up shifted over a bit and settled again then the two of them the man and the woman must be made to understand that this is not just their story what is it then edward marriner asked greg had stopped fiddling in his pocket ned thoughtcouldnt be surehed heard a distant voice from the cellphone aunt kim greg moved closer to neds dad both of them were right in front of ned now he didnt think that was an accident the phone would be on speaker whoever greg had dialed could hear this maybe if it mattered maybe it did he thought suddenly if they were killed here the others would at least know why and how else would they ever learn his hands were shaking he saw greg murmur something neds father nodded briefly the druid said there was a world here once a way of knowing the world it was torn from us and it can be reclaimed ned saw his father straighten his shoulders he crossed his arms on his chest in a gesture ned knew is that it that is how you see this you want to roll back two thousand years of greek and roman culture can you possibly be serious edward marriners relaxed chatty tone was gone you could say his voice was as cold now as the other mans the druids expression flickered maybe he hadnt expected such a response ned sure hadnt and he still wasnt there yet wasnt getting it he was trying to catch up to understand what was being said they would be near to immortal brys said more powerful than you can imagine if this story were ended with that death and if they understood their task the need we have am i serious you ask a fools question the world can change it always changes edward marriners reply was quick sharp with scorn a fool i think not i hear you you just want to decide what it changes to arent you being just a tiny bit arrogant the druids mouth tightened believe me i have known change shaped by others i lived it all my people did i am unlikely to forget arrogant you say and the romans were not neds father looked away past the other man it was ned thought a hard question he was remembering that arch this morning romans on horses wielding swords gauls dying or dead or chained heads bowed and averted he thought of the smashed walls at entremont siege engines or the enormous arena such a little distance from here a twentyminute walk through two thousand years of power edward marriner said more softly the romans they were all about arrogance and conquest but yours is the greater even so the idea that two millennia can be run backwards that they should be whatever the cost cost measuring it out a roman thought edward marriner laughed aloud a startling sound in that still place maybe is it why they were able to destroy you because they worked that way weighed cost and gain thought about things he was asking a lot of questions ned decided he was pretty sure his first guess was right his dad was stalling was that what aunt kim had said to greg to delay for what he was thinking fast maybe kate was dialing on her phone as they stood here maybe she was calling or whatever here in arles something occurred to him he stepped forward and said loudly enough of this already what the hell you guys think because this is a cemetery you can just add new bodies to the count is that the gig here greg looked quickly over his shoulder at ned his expression stricken i was right ned thought they wouldnt have known where we are the marines or the cavalry riding nowhere to go the druids expression also turning to him was bleak have a care he said he looked back at neds father we need only deal with the young one he matters i dont know why yet you and the other are of no concern to me i am content to have you walk away content the young one is my son children die all the time you have others none illjudged on your part screw yourself edward marriner said and added an even harsher string of words the stalling part of this appeared to be over greg moved to stand closer to neds father they were right in front of him again the druid made no movement at all but the wolves stood up showtime ned thought three wolves began circling wide the others moved slowly forward by the tower with aunt kim he had grabbed a branch there were no branches on the sweptclean ground here and there hadnt been seven animals then either he remembered last night on their road sweeping his hand scything the horns from cadells head he didnt remember how hed done it only the rage that had driven the motion he tried to find that within himself he knelt and scooped some gravel keep them off your face greg said quietly punch in the throat if you can kick underneath then run past the guy the gates unlocked remember get to the road punch in the throat a wolf real good plan i say it again brys rasped only one of you matters the other two can leave greg said calmly you heard the man screw yourself gregory was actually ready to die here defending ned trying to save melanie and ned realized he knew hardly anything important about the man a wisecracking burly bearded guy who owned a truly ridiculous bathing suit and mocked his own bulk by doing human cannonballs into a swimming pool neds my new hero he had said the other day because ned was meeting a girl for coffee some hero she was here ned said suddenly do you know it the druid took a halfstep backwards he rattled a handful of quick words like pebbles the wolves stopped they sat down again the flanking movement suspended explain brys said do so now ned stepped up beside his dad they wanted him behind them he wasnt going to allow it back to back to back he murmured when they come that was how they did it in movies wasnt it he made himself take his time even smile time was the whole point he thought of larry cato improbably shitdisturber professional pain in the ass times when that might be useful he said you like giving orders dont you especially when cadells not around what would happen if he was here should i guess the druids mouth opened and closed same as last night maybe he gets pissed off sends you to your room without supper right which tomb heres yours he was close to greg now speaking loudly it was possible aunt kim hadnt gotten the first hint about where they were where is she the druid said doggedly ignoring the mockery another question ned said why do you expect an answer from me should i just do to you what i did last night to him he had no way of doing it but maybe they wouldnt know that grow some horns he taunted ill use them as targets or use the wolves if you prefer you cannot kill them all before they you sure of that really sure you have no idea what i am that at least made sense since ned didnt either tell me something else if youre planning to off me here why should i give you anything i know whats my percentage eh the druid said nothing i mean you are really bad at this dude you need to offer something to make it worth if you care for your fathers life you will tell me what you know or he dies the words were flat blunt hard maybe ned thought the guy wasnt so bad at this after all i said they could leave brys went on but i can alter that if you know she was here you know wheres shes gone are you stupid ned said if i knew where she was would i be here that too was true but it might not keep them alive did logic work with druids inwardly he was wishing he were religious so he could pray to someone or something he was stalling for all he was worth and had no idea what sort of rescue could come he didnt think a bored gendarme arriving at the gates would stop he looked at those gates the others did too even brys because there was a sound from there then another something landed with a distant clatter on the shaded pathway and then improbably a really big man could be seen taking a hard fast run from the edge of the road propelling himself up the far side of the gate arms and legs moving and thenwith what had to be exceptional strengthvaulting himself over the sharp spiked bars at the top in a gymnasts move ned saw him in the air looking like a professional athlete the illusion of an olympic gymnast held briefly but this man was way too big he landed not all that smoothly fell to one knee points deducted ned thought he straightened and stood it could be seen that he was wearing faded blue jeans and a black shirt under a beige travel vest and that his full beard was mostly grey beneath greying hair goddamn the man said loudly bending to pick up his stick i am way too old to be doing this he was some distance away but his voice carried coming forwardfavouring one kneehe proceeded to add words in that language ned didnt understand his tone was peremptory and precise be gone the druid snapped by way of reply do you seek an early death the man came right up to the group of them and stopped on the other side of brys and the wolves early death not at all which is why i cant leave if you want the truth my wife would kill me if i did you see ever meet my wife the very big man said then he looked at ned a searching focused gaze wideset clear blue eyes he smiled hello nephew he said chapter xiv ned felt his mouth fall open the jawdrop thing was happening way too often it was majorly uncool uncle dave he said his voice was up half an octave the smile widened i like the sound of that have to say the greybearded man looked over at neds father edward marriner this would be even more of a pleasure elsewhere i hope it will be soon ned glanced at his dad whose expression would have been hilarious any other time it made him feel a bit better about his own dave martyniuk the other man nodded to the rescue with a really bad landing i saw that you okay im afraid the gate was open edward marriner said we picked the lock to get in neds uncles face became almost as amusing hearing that he swore concisely it was a dramatic entrance neds father said honestly bruce willis would have used a stuntman the two men smiled at each other your wifes coming down on air france from paris dave martyniuk said flight gets her to marignan around pm then whathalfanhour cab ride to your villa bit more neds father checked his watch we might have time to meet her neither of them was even looking at brys or the wolves ned saw edward marriner hesitated how do you know the flight martyniuk shrugged long story mostly to do with computers i see i think you keep an eye on her the other man nodded he looked awkward suddenly only when shes i know kimberly told us iim very grateful he grinned ruefully assuming we get out of here alive she will try to dismember you very likely ill do what i can to protect you id appreciate that meghans formidable oh i know sos her sister oh i know enough we can kill four of you as easily as three the druid said ned turned to him so did the others assuming we get out of here alive brys had shifted position so he could look at all of them left and right aunt kims husbandned hadnt pictured him as being nearly so bigshook his head im not sure friend you dont know enough about me and youre a long day past beltaine losing strength so are the spirits you put in those wolves how do you know that the druid snapped the spirits beltaine cellphone wife mentioned her knows a lot trust me then abruptly the exaggeratedly laidback style altered when next dave martyniuk spoke it was in that other language again and the voice was stonehard there was authority in it and anger ned understood nothing except for what sounded like names he heard cernunnos and something like cenwin but he saw the impact on the druid the man actually grew pale colour leaching from his face ned had thought that only happened in stories but he could see it in brys go home his uncle added more gently speaking french you should have gone last night this is not the hour or the life for your dreams to be made real my wife asked me to tell you that brys was still for a moment then drew himself up as if shouldering a weight a small man standing very straight i do not believe she knows anything for certain and in any case he said why hurry back to the dark i will learn what the boy knows and he will not interfere any more i can achieve so much he gestured at the branch neds uncle had thrown over the gate and picked up you think you can fight eight of us with that dave martyniuk unperturbed nodded gravely i think so yes and there is a reason for you to leave you know there is will you risk your soul and these if we kill you here you are lost druid the three of them can return but not you how do you know these things something anguished in the question same answer my wife with a sharp startling movement martyniuk levelled the branch in front of himself and cracked it hard across his good knee breaking the stick in two ouch he said and swore again then he threw half of it across the open space ned saw it flying it was actually beautiful spinning into light shadow light again under the leaves one of the wolves sprang for it jaws wide and missedit was arced too high neds father caught the thrown branch with unexpected competence and thenmuch more unexpectedlystepped straight forward and swung it hard a twohanded grip sweeping flat he cracked the leaping wolf in the ribs as it landed there was an ugly sound the animal tumbled to crumple against a grey tilting stone no one moved nice throw edward marriner said they need not die here dave martyniuk said quietly turning to the druid again send them back go with them it is past the day you have nothing to gain brys stared at him an equally blue gaze ned had a sense of suspended time a long hovering he felt the breeze saw it in the rippling leaves measurement again calculation it is not only about gain the druid said the world goes deeper than that then he spoke to the wolves in that other tongue and the battle began ned marriner learned some truths in the next few moments the world might be deep for one thing but sometimes it was fast too the second truth was that a swiss army knife was just about useless against a wolf he had his blade ready in timehed had it open in his pocket not long after the druid appearedbut unless you were good enough to stab a hurtling animal in the eye your knife was a distraction nothing more he wasnt good enough to stab it in the eye he feinted realized he didnt have a hope and rolled urgently away from the animal that came for him he heard footsteps a shout then another thick dull sound when he rolled to his kneesready to twist away againhe saw that his father had clubbed this one too that was the third new thing he learned that edward marriner celebrated photographer absentminded father with chronically misplaced reading glasses and trademark brown moustache was lethal with a branch when his only son was in danger greg was already engaging another wolf and the fourth truth was that greg was actually strong enough to do the punchitinthethroat thing hed whisperedbut not quick enough to do it without being hurt from his knees ned saw it happen slash of claws heavy fist shortstroked to animal neck the wolf flopping backwards blood bright at gregs rakedopen sleeve the sudden redness was shocking his dad was over there immediately necessary but with implications principally that ned was now alone without a weapon with three wolves circling him he scrabbled in the gravel again and threw a handful of pebbles at the eyes of the nearest one clever meaningless the animal ignored it then the animal died afterwards ned would try to recapture what hed felt when he saw his uncle hammer that wolfthat was the word that came to himand then immediately send another one twisting frantically back and away from a second swift swinging blow as the third wolf also retreated ned saw the druid lying on the gravel behind it bryss arms were outflung one leg was bent awkwardly under his body he looked at his uncle again a thought came inescapably hes done this before there was a difference between his fathers determined defence of ned and greg gregorys own bravery neds scrambling attempt to do something usefuland dave martyniuks laying low of chosen targets you might possibly be born knowing how to do this but more likely you learned in the doing when and where ned didnt know but he was pretty sure it had to do with the time his aunts hair turned white the three remaining wolves had backed away from neds uncle tails low they didnt run not yet they were watching martyniuk went over to the druid i didnt want to kill him he said i hope i didnt he knelt on the path put fingers to the mans throat the two of them were in the shade there a plane tree in leaf between them and the sun ned saw his uncle shake his head damn it he heard him say he was here to kill ned said edward marriner quietly walking over entering into that shadow as well and the rest of us if he had to martyniuk didnt look up i know weyour son got himself into a story ned wasnt sure why he felt so much sadness looking at the small figure of the druid who had summoned ysabel leaves rustled splinters of sunlight came through as they moved there was a world here once it was torn from us it is not just about the three of them he cleared his throat uncle dave if hesgone does that mean ysabel cant be summoned again after this time his uncle looked up is that her name ned nodded dave martyniuk stood wincing a little he brushed dust from his knees i dont think thats an issue he gestured at the wolves these are spirits too i suspect there are other druids among the ones who come back on beltaine night this onewas stronger maybe kept his place in the story he was trying to change the story ned said or thats what i he trailed off no youre right i think so too his uncle looked at gregory whoever taught you to punch wolves greg was holding his left arm blood was bright through his fingers but he managed a crooked smile it was an option in undergrad i could have done economics did wolf boxing instead extremely funny lets go edward marriner said well find the hospital here greg shook his head no dr ford can bandage this at the villa im all right this looks worse than it is youll need a rabies sequence greg no he wont ned said surprising himself these are spirits in a wolf shape remember they wont be rabid uncle dave nodded hes almost surely right edward theyd insist on the rabies course and he might be kept there and wed have a bit of explaining to do he pointed to the druid this bodyi dont think hell just vanish right away what do we do neds father asked with him will he disappear later i mean go back to being disembodied or whatever ned asked maybe not sure i never took that course in undergrad martyniuk smiled ruefully could we shift that neds father pointed to a stone sarcophagus beside the shaded alley the lid was slightly askew dave martyniuk looked over maybe he said ned watched his father and uncle walk over together they each grasped an end of the heavy stone top he felt a weird sensation a kind of pride watching them count off three then strain together grunting and slide the stone halfway off thats enough i think greg said holding his arm hes not that big he wasnt that big the wolves watched oddly passive now as the two men came back andquite gentlylifted the druid and carried him to the empty coffin they laid him inside and straining again dragged the stone lid all the way back they looked down on it a moment then dave martyniuk walked towards the wolves there were four left the one greg had punched had recovered and gone over beside the others they didnt retreat this time martyniuk said something in that ancient languagewelsh or gaelic whichever it was the animals looked at him and then after a moment they turned and loped away together towards the oldest graves and the church beyond the four men watched them go past the sunken area around the church out of sight what did you say edward marriner asked quietly he was stretching out his back that stone lid would have been heavy ned thought his father was not a man inclined to lifting and pulling or to swinging blows with a branch he was doing things ned couldnt even have imagined a week ago i told them nightfall would likely see them home i wished them peace on the journey back thats it martyniuk nodded he picked up the nearest of the three slain animals and limping carried it out of sight behind the trees he came back for a second one edward marriner picked up the third he looked surprised when he lifted it ned saw as if it was too easy he saw his father raise his eyebrows and follow uncle dave among the trees some animals were harmed in the making of this coffeetable book greg said dryly ned looked at him you okay greg was still holding his shoulder his second injury in two days been better man could have been worse i guess where are the stuntmen when you need them eh the other two reappeared neds father was unbuttoning his shirt he took it off ned fished quickly for his pocket knife again and opened the small scissors his dad tried it but the blade wasnt big enough edward marriner grunted handed it back and then tore the shirt from the bottom most of the way to the collar he ripped off the buttons and wrapped the whole thing around gregs arm before tying it thatll have to do till home he said got a bullet for me to bite greg said edward marriner barechested smiled briefly tylenol in the glove compartment have to do greg said we live in a primitive age at least you dont paint your chest boss another thin smile i may yet neds father said dave martyniuk had a cellphone to his ear he looked over kims in her car shell meet us at your villa i said an hour marriner nodded about right youll follow me ill follow the four of them walked out past coffins past the tomb on their right and the ticket booth between trees and under leaves out the gate and into light as soon as the villa gate clanged open and they drove through with dave martyniuks peugeot behind them ned saw the woman with red hair standing alone on the terrace watching them approach his heart started pounding his father saw her too he pulled the car straight over to the visitor parking pad not around to the driveway on the far side he switched off the engine the three of them sat a moment looking up at her it was late in the day now the sun over the city light slanting back along the valley in their eyes the shadows of the cypress trees very long the woman came down the steps onto the grass then she stopped ill go ned said he got out and walked across the lawn in the light her auburn hair was gleaming she looked amazingly beautiful to him hi mom he said she wasnt crying she wasnt the crying type he was taller than she was now hugs were awkward he was fifteen wasnt he he liked the way she held him though and said his name half reproving half reassuring and he liked her known scent and that she was here that she wasnt in a civilwar zone where people were being blown up or hacked apart with farm toolseven if they wore armbands that marked them as doctors come from far away to help hed gotten her out but this wasnt just his way of drawing her from the sudan they needed her here he was almost sure of it he was also sure trouble was coming in a red car not far behind them we didnt expect you till later he said why dear a mistake already his first words jeez you said evening to dad didnt you yesterday did i i must have been guessing i was able to bump onto an earlier flight from charles de gaulle the only hassle was the taxi driver having no idea how to find this place i had to call the woman here gave him directions veracook meghan marriner smiled that what you call her have to theres a veraclean too thats fun his mother withdrew looking past him hello honey reporting for duty present and accounted for meg he watched his father come up his parents kissed his mom laid her head on his fathers chest there was a time when hed have been embarrassed by that you going native cher his mother stepped back eyeing his fathers bare torso last of the mohicans its a long story well tell but it would be good if you had a look at gregory first do you have a kit weve only got basic firstaid stuff what happened her tone changed we ran into some trouble ed what kind of trouble ned looked back greg was getting out of the car you could see blood on his arm all the way from here it had soaked through the shirt bandage uncle dave had driven his peugeot around the far side of the house to the driveway out of sight ned heard a distant car door close but martyniuk didnt appear greg got clawed by an animal ned heard his father saying i wrapped my shirt around it a wild animal hell need rabies shots where were you gregory come and let me see that ned took note that his father didnt answer either question uncle dave still didnt appear he must have entered the house through the main door on the other side under the hill slope leaving us to our reunion ned thought then he thought something else they hadnt expected his mom to be here yet and shed know him from darfur theyd been there until yesterday there couldnt be that many people associated with doctors without borders in the sudan and this wasnt the only time hed been where she was either she would go to put it very mildly ballistic when she figured out what hed been doing more trouble but there was no way around this one was there unless uncle dave stayed out of sight all the time he was doing that now but there was no they heard another car gearing down for the last upward slope of the road ned turned saw the red peugeot approach it stopped idling in front of the gates ill do the code he said quickly and ran back over he punched the numbers the gates swung and clanged aunt kim drove through ned saw steve in the passenger seat kate smiled at him from the back his aunt slid her window down ned hows greg hes okay aunt kim my moms here shes checking him out and but his aunts gaze had gone past him she was looking into the serene endofday light towards her younger sister ned turned his mother was still beside greg but was looking back this way now at the woman driving the red car they hadnt seen each other he thought in something like twentyfive years there was an ache in his throat a rawness you could think about the endless story theyd stumbled into here and call twentyfive years nothing a blink or you could know that they were a good part of two lifetimes never to return or be reclaimed he thought of brys the latest body buried in les alyscamps the druid had spent so long trying to get something back it couldnt be done ned thought even if you thought youd achieved it what returned couldnt be the same as what had been taken away ill park the car kimberly said quietly ned stepped back and watched as she drove around the far side with everything that was happening this felt like one of the hardest things he wanted to fix it but he was feeling like a kid again and that was hard too it occurred to him that in a way this was what the druid had been doing trying to fix something that couldnt be made right how did you undo conquered gauls on a roman arch how did you undo twentyfive years of silence he watched his aunt walk back around the side of the house kate and steve were behind her but they stopped kim went over the grass towards her sister the two women looked so much alikeeven with the entirely white hair and the dark redseeing them together just made it obvious ned started back that way he saw his fathers face the apprehension there greg looked worse actually as if he could rattle off a dozen places hed rather be just now he made as if to back away but neds mother holding an end of the bloodsoaked shirtbandage said sharply hold still she needs a good look greg said aunt kim stopping beside them do we have antibiotics here i do said meghan marriner uncovering the wound hello kim hello meg how does it look fairly shallow more messy than dangerous clean and stitch but hell need rabies shots uhuh said greg dr marriner i dont it was a scratch not a bite and we dont have time i do love it when my patients treat themselves makes me wonder why i did seven years of medical training you can guarantee with mortal certainty no saliva got on those claws greg really youll bet your life on it ned knew that tone of his mothers hed grown up with it her response to illogic greg didnt waver though he kept on surprising cant guarantee that but i do know docand the boss and ned know toothat it wasnt a rabid wolf it was a wolf meghan said her voice rising they hadnt told her ned realized same ones we saw before ned aunt kim asked quietly he swallowed maybe im not so good at telling them apart and it was dark the other time they were spirits though from beltaine oh christ his mother snapped i absolutely refuse to start in with ned touched her arm she stopped looked at him he could see fury in her eyes mom please you have to start in you have to listen or you cant help they were coming for me mom his mother stared at him he saw anger slipping replaced by something trickier to define what does that mean ned looked at his father for help edward marriner said gravely it was pretty clear they were there to kill ned honey and that they were ordered to do so ordered ed are you meg im neither insane nor addled im desperately glad you are here because we need your thinking and in a hurry but honey you have to be thinking not fighting us he hesitated meg i killed a wolf today in les alyscamps and it was going for our son it was given orders by a druid meg ned saw his mothers eyes widen oh my a real druid did he wave his mistletoe at you a small silence no her husband said he was killed when they attacked us he didnt say yet who had killed him meghan looked at ned again then at greg wounded greg shrugged i got in the way maam hes telling the truth aunt kim was still saying nothing it was hard to read her expression edward marriner stepped closer meg this isnt some grand conspiracy to make you revisit your family history somethings going on here and that may mean that more than you think went on back thenbut that isnt the point now please listen when i say this please look at me and believe me his wife stared at him her body was rigid with tension ned had never seen her like this she turned to her sister what have you done she said aunt kim stared back it occurred to ned after that if uncle dave had been beside them on the grass she might not have reacted as she did but he wasnt oh how perfect kimberly snapped a flawless question meg what comes next we revisit how i dyed my hair white to fool everyone how i got married and ran away just to reject you are you still a teenager meghan marriner didnt back down i never said me i said your mother too our mother and you know it our mother did a very good job of keeping close meghan to the end of her life she visited us and you know it we spoke all the time and wrote and visited you know that too you made a point of staying away when we did and she never ever told me she was hurt by anything id done youd expect her to say it mother oh come on kim you know better than i knew her as well as you did meghan and she understood me a whole lot better than you did i left because i couldnt pick up the life id lived i wanted to i thought i would i couldnt too much had happened you were the only person who mattered who didnt see that want to talk about hurting someone meg i came down here when i realized what had already happened to ned im trying to protect him and get melanie back this is not about you and me this is not just about the three of them the druid had said that at least twice he might even have been right just as aunt kim might be right or not because maybe this was in some hard way about the two sistersand him maybe there were places where the past didnt go away and maybe there were people for whom it stayed ned looked at his father edward marriner had the posture of a man desperate to say something but having no idea what words would do more good than harm which was pretty much how ned felt aunt kim was still angry he hadnt seen her this way yet either meg i said goodbye to my own mother in toronto a full month before she died i didnt go to her funeral because she asked me not to said it would be too hard for you if i were there you want to think about that hearing this ned was suddenly even more certain there was nothing heor anyonecould say he wasnt even sure he wanted to know any more about it greg looked stricken as if he very badly wanted to get away over by kate and steve at the drive way out of earshot ned watched his mother she looked shaken no i dont actually meghan marriner said not right now i dont want to think about that aunt kim shrugged you thought i just didnt bother to come that i didnt care enough of course i could be lying about this too the way i lied about my hair the way your husband and son are lying now about the wolves you could decide that meg neds mother shook her head false choice kim it doesnt have to be truth or lie for them people make mistakes people get misled mom honey that isnt meg why would i mislead them listen to yourself a silence as the three overlapping voices subsided meghan marriner looked from one to the other i feel like im being ganged up on you are ned said but mom dr m can i say one thing they all looked at greg with the blood on his arm i was clawed by a wolf just now and it was given orders by a little guy who was a druid i know that last for sure because of something he did to me last night and that same guy was killed about an hour ago and three of the wolves meghan marriner looked at greg for a long time that was more than one thing she said greg shrugged sorry ned was watching his mother struggle with something embedded in herself this was hard for him he couldnt imagine what it was like for her he said nothing he really truly didnt know what he could say she drew a breath finally all right fine meghan turned to her sister im too old i guess for a certain kind of fight im not very good with changes though too old for that too none of us are good with changes kimberly said quietly meghan looked at her youve grown into the white hair at least ned drew a breath he saw aunt kim close her eyes when she opened them they were suspiciously bright one sister might be the crying type i like that red on you she said his mother made a face once a month jeanluc on green avenue id be sad and grey without him she looked around at the others something had changed the rigidity was gone lets get greg cleaned up she said then youll tell me whats going on i need to know about melanie all right said kim but theres a lot to tell well need wine i can do that neds father said almost too brightly glancing across the grass ned saw kate wenger looking awkward and apprehensive as if she felt she didnt belong here he wanted to go reassure her but he couldnt not yet something else first can someone please ask verawhatever to boil water meghan marriner said i got that ned said he took the terrace steps two at a time inside he gave veracook the request and told her thered be two more for dinner then he went looking for his uncle he found him in the mainfloor ensuite off the bedroom kim and kate had shared melanies room he was shaving that was why he hadnt come out grey and brown hairs were in the sink and on the tiled floor martyniuk had laid down his scissors and was lathered up using a razor on the stubble that remained he was working too fast and had cut himself a couple of times you really think thatll do it ned asked from the bathroom doorway his uncle glanced at him from behind shaving cream we are all doomed if it doesnt right not me said ned you are i had zip to do with this one abandon me to my fate with my mother damn right what happened out there dave martyniuk was swooping the razor across his cheeks and neck ned hesitated so far okay better than i thought no explosion is better than i thought how do i look almost as bloody as greg ned said his uncle scowled at his reflection ill deal with that but do i look different enough ned nodded i think so give me five more minutes theyre boiling water to clean gregs wound slow down youll attract sharks his uncle grinned i like it i have a witty nephew he suspended the blade a moment only one ive got ned looked at him dont youi thought you had a brother and two nieces there older than you ned swallowed and you and aunt kim never dave martyniuk shook his head briskly no we never did is it too late for me to teach you a postup move to the hoop ned tried to smile he was old enough to know there was more to this im not tall enough perimeter game defence thats my thing his uncle shook his head again uhuh the good guards have to know how to postup when they get a mismatch well find a basketball net later i know where there are courts here martyniuk was shaving too rapidly again good he said then swore as the blade nicked his throat go on back ill be there in a few unrecognizable oh my god meghan marriner said she had looked up from where she was treating greg at the diningroom table ivorson what are you doing here i dont she stopped very abruptly ned could see her figuring it out already you could almost chase succeeding thoughts as they crossed her face dave martyniuk a dab of kleenex on each of two cuts that hadnt stopped bleeding paused in the doorway to the dining area aunt kim hurried over to him they hugged each other hard then she stepped back neds fathers introduction died on his lips greg was in a chair at the table meghan had been wrapping a bandage pots of boiled water stood on trivets beside clean cloths and white spools of gauze and tubes of antibiotics turning from beside her husband kimberly straightened her shoulders and looked at her sister as if ready for a blow ned with kate by the glass doors to the terrace felt a massive surge of anxiety they were a long way from being out of the woods on this he looked at his uncle unrecognizable yeah sure youre like sixfootthree with big shoulders and hands and blue eyes and you shave your beard and no one will know you from danny devito and neds mother was very very quick thats why theyd wanted her here in the first place one reason anyhow the other reason had to do with machetes and guns and bombs and they werent going to talk about that although it was also why his uncle had taken that fake nameivanson or whatever it wasand had been following her for years to places halfway around the world ned waited for the explosion it didnt come instead meghan marriner who never did began to cry oh meg her sister whispered oh honey meghan held up a quick hand to stop her ned saw kate wenger biting her lip beside him a gesture he knew pretty well by now his mother wiped at her eyes with the back of one hand she drew a breath and looked up she stared at martyniuk for a long moment three times she said finally he nodded sierra leone the gulf darfur thats where i saw you he cleared his throat ah four times actually being truthful i was in bosnia but just for a few daysit didnt end up looking too bad you may not have spotted me she was still staring still thinking you found out when i signed up for missions and you went there if you thought they were dangerous he nodded again dropped everything in your life took a false name false id in war zones thats about it martyniuk said it didnt happen often really four times you just said martyniuk nodded again he made a face damn looks like i just got rid of a beard i liked there was a short silence you look better without it meghan marriner said i tell him that too her sister murmured meg i again neds mother held up a hand im going to cry again if you talk so dont kim she still hadnt taken her eyes from the big capable figure of dave martyniuk in the doorway i need to be really clear on this you left your work in england your wife you put yourself in danger around the world you certainly broke laws with computers and a fake identity and why he leaned on the doorframe took his time an unhurried man ned thought we felt a sense of responsibility meghan closed her eyes for a second you thought i did these things because martyniuks expression was grave meghan sisterinlaw i learned a long time ago the hard way that people do things for an amazing variety of reasons some good some bad even heroic things sometimes we dont know all the reasons for what were doing id say we usually dont edward marriner said his wife looked at him you knew about this ed do i have to kill you too he shook his head but the threat the joke of it had already changed the mood ned could feel himself beginning to breathe properly again i heard about it two nights ago honey from the doorway martyniuk murmured if you want me dead just tell me to shave closer i seem to have lost the knack you were rushing ned said the adults turned to him all of them right nephew his uncle said the unchallenged expert of the family you shavewhat twice a week to show off he was grinning though well i know who isnt going to teach me his technique anyhow ned said listen to the lot of you bandage me already greg interjected is this how doctors treat wounded patients family arguments while we die on the table an underreported statistic kimberly said soberly ned was opening his mouth to make another joke out of sheer relief when he felt a flaring imperative presence inside himself awareness flashed in his aunts face in the same moment he saw her look past him he wheeled around and looking out through the glass doors he saw in the lateday sunlight a slender baldheaded man in a grey leather jacket step onto the terrace and stand there waiting patiently chapter xv he accepted a glass of wine from neds father at the table dealing easily with the scrutiny of a large number of people but ned could see how tightly wound the man was there was a sense that phelan was keeping himself under control but only just as before when hed seen this man had been with him the world suddenly felt more intense and how could that not be so ned thoughtwith what they knew about him ned glanced at his mother and saw meghan marriners alert appraising look at the newcomer she kept still watching shed finished with gregory wrapping his wound phelan saw that an injury how did this happen the low voice precise he had spoken to ned even with the adults present so ned answered in arles wolves cadell attacked you where why eyebrows raised control at the brink of violence he hasnt found her ned thought and he knows time is running he said the cemetery but no it was brys on his own a hard look on his own you are certain of that ned nodded yes what are you doing here the obvious question really he was pretty sure he knew the answer perhaps a proper introduction first his mother said her voice was cool but not hostile ive just arrived and im missing some critical information ned looked at kate the two of them were the only ones here whod ever seen phelan the romanthe greek the strangersmiled briefly at meghan marriner a wintry smile i fear that rude as it might seem there isnt time for proper introductions my name is phelan he looked briefly at kate this time aunt kim crossed her arms on her chest but it was protis wasnt it and she was gyptis a challenge in the words phelan looked at her a different expression no actually though the tale produced those names eventually it often happens that way but they were never ours he paused and then as if reluctantly and you are rude as it might seem kimberly murmured coldly there isnt time ned instinctively looked at uncle dave and saw his mouth tighten as if he was aware they were playing with danger i see said phelan after a silence he looked at her thoughtfully you have some power dont you some kimberly said enough to recognize it phelan nodded he glanced at ned you are related my sisters son kimberly gestured at meghan the man in the grey leather jacket sipped his wine again this begins to make more sense your presence among us he looked at ned again your presence among us doesnt yet said edward marriner and there is the matter of melanie wed very much appreciate they heard a knock at the front door ned looked quickly that way and swallowed hard he knew who this was who it had to be there had been no buzz to request admission from the locked gates steve who was nearest opened the door with no surprise at all ned saw cadell standing there he smiled cheerfully and entered dressed as he had been at the glanum ruins in the morning the two men looked across at each other one at the front entrance the other by the glass doors to the terrace ned tried againand failed againto get his head properly around how long theyd known each other and fought with each other for the woman hed seen between fires at entremont the past infusing the present here entering defining it it is not just about the three of them brys had said brys was dead neds uncle had killed him but perhaps it really was about the three of them ned thought and everything else was bound up in that am i too late for a glass of wine cadell said in that deep voice standing where dave martyniuk had been a moment before no one responded no one had time the blurred motion with which phelan drew the knife and threw it was quicker than any possible reply it was in that moment really that an answer to another unspoken question came to ned hed been wondering how phelan could ever have battled the other manso much larger so obviously a warrioron even terms in any sort of combat he ought to have remembered the smaller man spinning off the cloister roof flipping himself outwards and landing with so much grace speed and poise and effortless intelligence could serve in a fight as well as power he thought cadell swore an involuntary outburst ned heard kate cry out saw steve back away from the door at speed with greater speedalmost impossibly socadell took a step forward and seized a metal serving platter from the table he hurled it like a discus across the room phelan twisted urgently sideways and the plate whipped past his face to smash loudly against the wall putting a long jagged crack in it between the glass doors what the hell edward marriner exclaimed cadell had a hand to his left shoulder now the knife was embedded there ned had seen that knife before the cathedral very first moments he looked at kate shed remember it her face was pale phelans was white that plate had been moving fast enough to shatter his face kill him if it had hit his throat a mild precaution he said to keep you from being tempted again you dont do well with temptation do you hes been flying he explained looking around the room tracking me from the air thats how he came here as an owl she made him swear an oath not to fly when a man disregards a sworn promise he needs to have it enforced for him or chaos descends upon the world wouldnt you say it was a question but not addressed to anyone in particular he was looking at the celt cadells face had lost its colour as well i can kill you even with a wound you know phelan smiled thinly ice in his eyes you can say it theres a doctor here i believe shes finished with one injury two doctors kim said quietly as i understand it if youd killed him here youd have lost for this time and i have no interest in what you understand believe me if i had wanted to kill the blade would not be in his arm phelan said ned believed him cadell across the table was controlling his breathing as if stepping downcarefullyfrom a towering annihilating rage if aunt kim was right killing the other man with that discus would have cost him ysabel now and he had been throwing for the face cadell looked at greg after a moment he said again you seem inclined to injure yourself not before you guys showed up greg said who did this you really dont know phelan said i do not the celt turned to ned they kept doing that as if he had the answers here he cleared his throat i told you this morning that we were heading to arles remember brys was waiting at the cemetery or he followed us dont know which and he had the wolves go for me the othersgregdefended me cadells expression slowly changed he shook his head i told him to leave you i shall tell him again dont think you can ned said my uncle there killed him another silence phelan and cadell from across the room looked at each other this is truth phelan asked ned irritated said why would i lie just give us melanie back and well get out of this you know it and you know that cannot be done cadell said still holding his arm i told you this morning and last night in the road now i tell you a third time he paused he smiled why would i lie well i can think of reasons kate wenger said bravely you lied about flying didnt you we know that neither of you gives a damn about anything but ysabel youd do anything to get to her first everyone looked at her ned instinctively moved closer just about anything cadell agreed gravely it was hard ned thought to disconcert these two probably came with the territory if you had lived as many times as they had cadell turned to dave martyniuk standing not far away seeing them together made you realize just how big martyniuk was the celt was large broadshouldered rippling neck muscles and armsand uncle dave was a bigger man brys was a druid and a companion of sorts i should kill you for this i suppose the words lightly spoken hung in the air i suppose dave martyniuk agreed but as i told him you dont know nearly enough about me cadell did look surprised at that his head lifted as if to a challenge you are aware of how many times and through how many lives i have fought ive been briefed uncle dave nodded towards kim indeed said phelan from the other side of the table the logical one piecing things together he and kimberly exchanged a glance ned had never felt so many layers of tension in one place in his life he was almost sick with it on impulse he tried that inward search again he found the three auras right awayhis aunt both men and a fourtha pale soft hue it shocked him then he figured it out it was himself he was seeing his own existence in this other space still impulsively he reached within and tried to close his presence down screen it the way the others could it was gone ned swallowed hard he looked up and saw that aunt kim had now turned to him questioningly he managed a shrug what was he going to say it wasnt as if he had a clue really phelan reclaimed his wine he had put it down when the knock came at the door hed have known who was there who was about to come in of course cadell was still staring at dave martyniuk youre being reckless he said relying on my goodwill at the wrong time im not known for patience and i dislike your manner im sure you do but not enough to risk losing the woman i suspect and as i said youd need to know more about me before we fought the celt shook his head i have killed so many like you no you havent said dave martyniuk quietly then he added in that other tongue words that seemed to slice the air in the room the way phelans blade had and ned heard those names again cernunnos and the one that sounded like cenwin wherever you have fought his uncle added in english and however many times it was never where i did in the silence that followed this they heard phelan across the room say ah as if something important had been clarified for him maybe not for ned that was for damn sure cadell looked from dave across to the other man id call it interesting phelan said lightly i would he smiled again the same tightmouthed look ned tried to remember if hed seen joy or passion in this mans faceother than when ysabel had appeared up on the plateau he couldnt but it had been there at entremont you couldnt have missed it there i would be happy phelan added still looking at the goldenhaired celt to watch you fight this one i see nothing but diversion for me no one is fighting anyone especially not with a knife in his arm kimberly ford said a little too briskly she scowled at cadell you sit well deal with that we seem to be all set anyhow she gestured at the table ned saw uncle dave lean back casually against the wall by the computer table i do have a bad knee from this afternoon not moving all that well evens things out but the truth is your druid was attacking my nephewyoud expect me to deal with that and i didnt try to kill him why not cadell asked an odd question dave hesitated too final from what my wife said i told him all of them to let their spirits go back they shouldnt have been lingering after beltaine you know about that cadell said kimberly does i listen go on man sit down let her treat that wound your fight isnt with me his voice was relaxed steadying and by the way we honestly dont know where she is i assume thats why youre both here cadell stared at him another moment then turned to ned again phelan had already done that its true ned said were looking you know it we havent seen her he hesitated then decided not to tell about sensing her presence in the cemetery they were competing werent they this was a race of some kind though he had no idea at all what theyd do if they won it i thoughti felt something in the valley north of les baux well yes phelan said you would have but it is very old cadells mood seemed to have changed i dont think my flying here will matter to her as if he was pleading in a way ned said youre wrong itll matter to melanie she cares about things like that and shes in her they both stared at him he felt anger flare again well she is isnt she thats the whole point of this isnt it the summoning so ysabel changes a little each time and you never know who shell choose and dont he added glaring from one of them to the other say who are you again because i dont know nobody said it cadell abruptly sat down in the chair by aunt kim he looked steadily across at his enemy two millennia and more ned thought you could screw yourself up thinking about that tell me the celt murmured which oathbreaking will she count the greater flying to meet you here or your wounding me when she ruled we could not fight seeking the edge you so much need for later phelan didnt smile this time you really think that was it an advantage by the gods i do again ned didnt see the movement clearly he couldnt tell whether the second blade came from a boot top again or from inside the leather jacket sleeve as phelans arm swept downwards he saw the knife cadell sprang to his feet twisting chair scraping on floor tiles and then the blade was deep in phelans own shoulder hed driven it in exactly where hed struck the other man ned felt an overwhelming confusion of feelings it really was becoming way too much he heard kate stifle another cry then he heard laughter he looked across the table cadell had subsided into the chair again his head thrown back his laughter filled the room ned glanced at his mother she was staring at the smaller man who had just put a blade in his own arm she turned to ned and met his eyes he saw her nod acceptance finally this if nothing else had made her acknowledge that something entirely outside their understanding was unfolding here happening right now but also before this over and over and again when they were gonefrom provence or the world how very amusing cadell said looking across at phelan finally controlling his laughter it wasnt the word ned would have used i have my moments the other man replied quietly such a stoic roman said cadell mockingly i was greek when we met roman soon enough and then something else no never anything else the tone was blunt absolute phelan smiled mirthlessly how many years is one a stranger do the druids propose a number thats a roman question you live in a different world we all do now phelan said answer how long here a stranger some forever you are one of those the other man shrugged with one shoulder there was a knife in the other violence ned thought could come and be gone and leave only the memorythe blurred image of itbehind phelan looked at his left arm and made a face i am sorry about the jacket i like it then he clenched his teeth and pulled out the dagger that had to hurt ned thought blood followed the blade staining the grey leather phelan looked at his knife wiped it on his trouser leg and put it away it had been in the boot meghan marriner was staring at him i wont even pretend to understand either of you she said ned knew that voice she turned to her sister i assume it wouldnt help us with melanie if we let these two get infections lose a unit or two of blood die or something kim shook her head it might but probably not i think if theyre gone shes gone melanie ysabel but same thing now meghan took a deep breath youll explain there was a lot in that question ned thought twentyfive years worth there were different ways of measuring what could be called a really long time he saw his aunt nod once and then with a smooth straight movement draw the other dagger from cadells shoulder he showed no reaction at all all that this exercise in idiocy proves kim ford said grimly as she began using the same knife to cut away the celts shirtsleeve is that not even two thousand years and however many lives can make men halfway intelligent her sister laughed ned glanced sidelong at kate wenger they had walked around the far side of the pool to the lavender bushes in the last of the daylight no flowers there yet late june apparently the sun was gone purple and pink bands beginning to fade striped the sky above aix the moon was over the woods beyond the drive he heard birdsong it was chilly hed gone upstairs and found his hooded sweatshirt for kate the sleeves were too long her hands were inside like a little kids the cuffs dangling he remembered looking that way himself his mother used to buy him clothes a size too big cuff or doublecuff sleeves or trousers his mother was inside dressing a knife wound someone had tried to kill ned today it could have happened probably would have happened if his uncle had been later arriving he wondered if he would start reliving those moments tonight when he turned out the bedroom light kate looked over at him nice pool here really cold they dont heat them in france i know they wait till summer youve been in he remembered the ringtone war being thrown in there that made him think of melanie once was all he said then as that seemed inadequate steves the swimmer hes been doing laps has a trick knee thats his exercise small talk meaningless kate seemed to reach the same conclusion she said why do they keep thinking we knowyou knowwhere she is ysabel that was dumb toowho else could it be im not sure they do i think he stopped trying to phrase it right trying to think it right yes ned sighed i think they are trying for just anything they can we did get phelan to entremont you did that kate made a face i didnt do anything i just thought youd want to see it they started walking came to the western edge of the property across the wire fence he could see dugup earth black soil exposed wild boars rooting the neighbouring villa was some distance off mostly hidden among trees a little lower down lights were on there he saw they were alone here in the wind you going to tell me it was just an accident we went up he said well it was and the way you were before with me on the way she looked out across the fence that was completely an accident right it was mariechantal you were channelling her he shook his head kate these two guys dont think that way so we cant they think weve got some other kind of channel you do dont you he sighed again some i guess phelan was here to ask us or me and cadells kind of tracking him yeah he wasnt supposed to fly he wasnt supposed to throw a dagger at him they looked out over the valley at the city beyond and below lights coming on there too now it was pretty gorgeous in the twilight ned struggled to formulate a thought you think in the old days people would come out for a sunset kate shook her head sunrise maybe nightfall would scare them not something to enjoy time to get behind walls bar the door evil things abroad ned thought about it he remembered the round tower only a walk from here guarding against an attack people had been calling this place a paradise for a long time you fought wars for paradise and for a woman he was having a hard time keeping the image of ysabel from filling his thoughts shifting them men kneeling before her among torches he looked at kate beside him in his outsized sweatshirt so ordinary and they were so far from that ordinary world here he said you know occurs to me you cool staying with us i mean this is getting rough and itsit isnt your she looked at him trying to get rid of me he shook his head no and you know it but i have a feeling my moms going to say this is way too dangerous shellany bets shell want to call your mother or something kate smiled at the thought and tell her what exactly no effing idea butthere was a knife in there kate i saw two of them not thrown at me thats not the point bad pun ned thank you but its cool im still the only other person here who can recognize ysabel true sort of i think my aunt would probably know her you know inside if she wasnt screening herself then we can have three groups tomorrow with your uncles car now she was quick he hadnt thought that far ahead he had just figured out his own accidental pun maybe he said im not telling you what to do ned melanies where i was going to be you know it she looked out over the meadow again darkening to brown and grey in twilight i didnt sleep a lot last night thinking about that i cant walk away hed thought about this himself how hard it would be for her to have been inside and just leave he turned towards the field across the fence too okay he said im glad actually im glad youre here it seemed easier to say some things not looking at her fair warning about my mom though ill deal what did he meanphelanwhen he said of course youd have felt something by les baux ned shrugged no idea where was it just north on the way to those roman ruins glanum kates voice was resolute ill google it and check melanies notes tonight you do that he said prepare a memo with footnotes he looked at her amused despite everything dont you make fun of me kate said glaring i wasnt though he had been he hesitated youre pretty cool anyhow he managed to keep looking at her this time it was nearly dark which helped im not cool at all im a geek remember someone to get essays from ned shook his head no he left it at that turned away again after a moment she said in a different voice well thank you but dont you think this sweatshirt makes me look fat ned laughed aloud kate was grinning yeah mcgill hoodies tend to everyone knows that he took a chance i saw you last night remember all legs she chose to ignore that whats mcgill main university in montreal you going there might probably havent thought about it a lot thinking less about it just now yeah im sure they heard a sound to their right ned turned quickly in the fading light he saw an owl flying north along the upslope of the hill behind the house the bird was awkward labouring fighting to climb they watched it for no reason he could have explained ned felt a lump in his throat it was cadell of course defiantly forcing himself to take wing despite a wound refusing to acknowledge what had been done to him that it could change anything make him behave differently hellhes going to have to land kate said her voice was rough change back ned nodded i know hell wait till hes out of sight if it kills him they were silent watching the bird struggle they lost it then ned saw it again its left wing seemed to be hardly moving though it was difficult to see in the last light and that might just have been his knowing where the blade had gone after another moment the owl passed from sight cresting the hill he didnt have to do that kate wenger said softly yeah he did ned replied she glared at him again your aunt she said with more anger than seemed called for was right then men are idiots i try not to be ned said dont even start with me ned marriner a presence a voice behind them be fair he hasnt done too badly phelan walked up we didnt hear you kate said the man theyd first seen in the baptistry shrugged a shoulder the other would be bandaged ned knew under the jacket the jacket would be torn it was too dark to make that out ive had time to learn how not to be heard phelan said i came to say goodbye well brought up kate said once yes he hesitated in phocaia i know i looked it up eastern greece but your name wasnt protis he shook his head you can remember being young ned asked another hesitation he was being kind to them ned realized you never forget being young he said then do you have anything for me anything at all a great deal of pride being overcome to ask that ned shook his head id have told you both if i had he thought the other mans expression was pained but that was probably his imagination the bands of colour were almost gone in the west i thought you might be on your side phelan nodded you were in the café you didnt need me ned said you said i was stupid to come out remember i remember his teeth flashed briefly men are idiots yeah you heard that kate said he nodded again inside and out here a body of opinion it seems hows your shoulder kate asked same as his i imagine but you dont need to fly i dont no you do the screening thing though right ned said you told me about that then you did it at entremont i did learn it eventually yes as he learned the shapechanging why him not you a hint of impatience for the first time why did they have druids and keep their elders skulls and their enemies and believe the sky would fall to end the world ned said nothing why did we build aqueducts and cities and theatres and arenas and baths and the roads i get it why did you conquer them make them slaves that was kate why were we able to do that what are you saying different ideas of the world ned asked phelan nodded he turned to kate he isnt an idiot by the way never said he was she retorted phelan opened his mouth to reply but didnt he looked at ned again different ideas different avenues to power youve learned how to screen yourself ned nodded just now remember to let it go unless you need it youre still hidden you dont need to be it will kick back on you if you hold too long you can harm yourself i learned the hard way seriously dumb question phelan nodded it drains you takes a fair amount of energy though you dont even know it hesitantly ned closed his eyes looked within again saw the silver light that was the man he was talking to and the greengold of his aunt up in the house cadells presence was too far away now or blocked he released his own like opening fingers in his mind and saw his own pale hue reappear inside ah phelan said there you are ill leave now this ishe looked from one of them to the otherfarewell i suspect i will say that i am gratefulfor the café for entremont you saved us up there kate said he shook his head he was unlikely to have hurt you with ysabel watching the others might have and it was beltaine kate said stubbornly phelan shrugged again with one shoulder so be it i saved your lives doesnt make me a good man i know that ned said phelan looked at him for a long moment you must understand i haveno balancing in this he said quietly in the neardark the air i breathe is her or wanting her ned was silent he felt something pushing from inside himself a kind of wish longing last encounter an ending a world touched and receding he heard himself say i sensed her in the cemetery no idea from when it might have been long ago like the other place but i did feel her phelans attention was suddenly absolute ysabel herself not just a sensation ned nodded ysabel saying the name himself the mans head lifted he was looking down the valley as if trying to see as far as arles he was a grey shape in moonlight going away from them the villas lights were across the grass up the stone steps gleaming through windows far away from where they stood that would have been her now if so she knew les alyscamps we all did what does it tell you kate asked an edge in her voice she knows hes leaving too ned thought this world theyd found one thing or two phelan said he looked at ned thank you again im not sure why i did that neither am i phelan said because he cheated i cheat on things ned said i even took an essay from he didnt finish it seemed too dismally stupid a thought he saw white teeth in the darkness perhaps i charmed you with my sweetness phelan laughed he shook his head im away remember me if this is the end he turned and started back across the grass ned discovered he was unable to speak how are you going tohow did you get here kate again ned had a sensesame as in the cloisterthat she was trying to keep him here hold him with questions not release him into the night youll hear phelan said without turning back he hadnt turned back in the cloister either they watched him go past the pool and the lavender to the iron gates they were closed and locked the motion sensors kicked on as he approached so they had a sudden view as he put both armsone would be bandaged with a blade woundon the bars and then propelled himself over without fuss with an ease that seemed absurd in fact they stood listening a moment later there came a motorcycles snarl out on the dark road and then they heard it going down and away ned reached inside but eventually the silvertinted light there faded somewherehe guessednear the bottom of the lane where it met the main road and the streetlights ned kate you two okay his mother from the terrace he could see her in the glow there were fine mom come on in were going to eat something then talk coming his mom turned and went back in ned had an image like an old photo of himself as a child playing with friends at dusk in summer the light fading his mothers voicefaint but clearsummoning him home bath and bed why did you tell him kate asked softly dont know maybe because he cant fly cadell cant either now i know kate was quiet a moment i dont think youre an idiot by the way he looked at her i can be we all can kate wenger said and kissed him on the mouth in the windy dark ned closed his eyes but by then shed already stepped back he drew a breath um was that mariechantal you possessed again like before she hit him pretty hard on the chest dont you dare she said idiot we going through that again if we have to youyou taste of peppermint gum he said is that good his pulse was racing well id have to taste it again you know to give a proper opinion she laughed softly and turned away starting back up towards the villa over her shoulder she said the management has received your application and will consider it in due course ned had to smile before following he looked back out over the slanting field it was fully dark now the lights of aix gleamed sprinkled across the valley bowl above the city venus was brilliant low in the sky he turned back towards the house saw kate going up the stone steps to the terrace he shook his head mostly in wonder how did you move so fast from being uncertain and fearful about everything to this sudden feeling of happiness and then back because the image that came to him right then was of melanie on the shaded grass at the roman theatre in arles speaking of how hard it could be to find love he thought of her he thought of ysabel he went back up to the villa his mom had called him for supper chapter xvi i think said meghan marriner it is time for me to get up to speed here wholl start they had eaten the dishes were cleared veracook was at the sink washing up the kitchen doors were closed and they were speaking in english vera hadntapparentlyseen the knives earlier ned hadnt checked but it seemed that steve had hed gone towards the kitchen when the blade was thrown and closed those doors ned hadnt noticed any of that it would have been awkward to have their cook gossiping about weapons he thought gregs injuryscratched by an animalwas one kind of event in the countryside violence in the villa would be something else ned watched as his mother took some sheets of printer paper from beside the telephone and set them in front of her beside a cup of tea she had her reading glasses on he usually had a decent idea of what his mother was thinkingit was important in life to have a read on your motherbut this was all new terrain he kept glancing from her to his aunt the red hair and the white he saw his father doing the same thing which made him feel better sometimes he didnt think they looked so much alike then hed realize they did a lot meghan looked around the table now waiting ned cleared his throat its my story i guess mostly kate and aunt kim can help as i go kate was still wearing his sweatshirt and fiddling with a pen they hadnt called her mother in new york ned didnt know what shed said to his own momhed seen them talking before dinnerbut it had evidently been enough she was still here he saw aunt kim at the far end of the table from her sister smiling a little i remember that notetaking she said looking at meghan you had these green notebooks with you all the time blue someone meghan replied needs to be organized here melanie was greg said then ill try to be neds mother said so we can get her back she uncapped her pen ned started in he expected her to interrupt challenge him she didnt not at the skull and sculpted head not at the rose in the cloister or phelan jumping from the roof not when ned was sick by the mountain or fought the dogs outside the café she took notes she did look hard at her sister when ned told of his aunts phone call id driven to london and flown down that morning id become aware of ned the day before kimberly said in my garden nothing like that has ever happened before meg not even back when i knew who he was and where he was a kind of explosion in my head then he was gone but i was pretty certain what had just happened hed crossed into the space where i am she looked at ned then at her sister i thinki know it has to do with our family meg blood ties it cant be anything else your grandmother edward marriner asked quietly from the middle of the table opposite ned greatgrandmother if this means anything it was his wife who replied the story was she had the second sight and her father before her people in wales ireland the west of england they all tell those stories no one said anything go on meghan said to her son he told his own story his mother wrote neat handwriting straight lines on the unruled paper no challenges no comments he spoke of meeting his aunt by the roofless tower and cadell and the wolves attacking there what did you say to make them stop it was steve kimberly glanced at her husband some things about me a place id been when i was younger someone i knew and it scared him off didnt scare him made him think gave him a reason to back away he wanted ned out of the story didnt have any particular desire to kill him but he would have if he had to meghan looking at her sister kim said quietly these two have caused a lot of damage over the years honey collateral damage steve said thats about it dave martyniuk said its all about the two of them and ysabel brys didnt think so ned said back up ned youre still at that tower his mother looked at him ned backed up to the tower moved on towards entremont he was going to skip the walk up there but kate didnt let him she held up a hand like a good student in class and he stopped i was feeling weird all day she said like as soon as i woke up weird how meghan asked looking over the top of her reading glasses a doctor in her office kate flushed she lowered her gaze that gets embarrassing you dont have to ned began she held up her hand again i felt older anddarker stronger not dark as in bad dark as in she trailed off looked for help desire aunt kim said softly kate nodded staring down at the table ned saw kim exchange a glance with her husband i do know a little about that it was beltaine you were connecting through phelan and maybe ned why me ned asked his aunt smiled gently thats the hard question in this you know our family line back a long way were in this she looked at her sister thats what happened to me meg but i was never like this before ned protested everything starts somewhere dear you never shaved before this year either right uncle dave said helpfully his wife stared at him her eyes wide my goodness thank you so much for the clarification dear that she added is an amazingly silly analogy uncle dave looked abashed i uh have shaving on my mind i guess there was a brief silence no one laughed youre walking up to entremont meghan marriner said looking at her notes kates feeling strange go on forgot to say phelan had told me to keep away that night hed overheard kate and me planning the outing in the café told me not to go just before he left and then we fought the dogs he tried to warn you neds father looked thoughtful but not as if the thinking was getting him anywhere why did you go up steve asked fair question melanie was gone because theyd done it i made him kate said glumly called him a wimp and stuff oh well thatll do it greg said really i dig it you had no choice when a girl says that a couple of smiles around the table this time ned said it wasnt far it was just after five maybe a quarter after the place closed at sixthirty way before dark hed told me not to be there for beltaine and i figured it started at night it does kate said but it got dark too soon they shared the story tripping over each other a little the moon the fires the bull cadell and the druid and the spirits that came phelan appearing beside them ned phoning the villa melanie ysabel around the table there was silence as they spoke and when they were done i just had to fall asleep back here greg said bitterly first to break the stillness kate looked at him id be gone she said id be ysabel now if you had come she began to cry meghan pulled a handkerchief from her sleeve and passed it down she looked at ned and nodded calmly he carried on alone to cadell and brys in the laneway with the boar he kept the one thing back what hed done to cadells horns he told of brys attacking greg my first purple heart greg said my mom will be proud after that ned said looking at his own mother dad and the others came and got us and then we talked to you and i called dave said aunt kim kate had stopped crying she was still holding the handkerchief and dave was minding me in darfur we are going to have to talk about that meghan marriner said looking at her brotherinlaw i know said uncle dave will i get a blindfold and last cigarette doubt it meghan said ned youre up to this morning while i was flying here he finished taking her through glanum and the cemetery his father joined in there and then uncle dave as they were wrapping up laying the druid in his coffin the telephone rang it seemed an alien intrusive thing no one moved for a moment neds father finally got up to answer it at the desk oliver he said forcing cheerfulness how nice to hear from you no no no we ate early north americans what can i tell you whats up everyone around the table was looking at him in silence edward marriner said very little for a time really once and then that is extraordinary and then no no of course it is interesting thanks for calling ill be sure to tell the others and finally yes we might indeed think of a photograph he hung up looked at all of them it was just on local radio someone on a motorcycle dropped a heavy bag an hour ago in front of a café on the cours mirabeau in aix and tore off a bomb steve asked edward marriner shook his head they thought so obviously cleared the street but when the police and dogs came it turned out not to be he looked at ned it was the sculpted head and skull stolen from the museum motorcycle ned looked at kate he couldnt begin to think of what to say these are the two things ned saw under the cathedral his mother asked they have to be her husband said meghan sighed fine ive got a note for what its worth she looked at ned and then at kimberly is that it that takes us to this evening more or less ned said i mean im sure ill remember other things but his mother nodded but this is the story fine a couple of questions i knew thered be an exam he said trying to smile im the one writing it his mother said or it feels that way she looked at her notes wolves twice by that tower and in the cemetery but dogs in the city ned blinked what did that have to do with anything he nodded yeah thats right meghan turned to her sister im playing along here you understand dont imagine i am buying everything she waited for kim to nod then said do thesespirits change themselves into animals or take over real animals here kim thought about it i dont know i think they were dogs in aix because there are always dogs there and wolves would obviously cause an alarm yes i thought that but you dont know which they do change oroccupy kim shook her head her sister was still looking at her ysabel takes over someone right someone real melanie this time it would have been kate different women each time before kim nodded slowly i see where youre going good meghan removed her glasses and turned to greg whatever else happens young man we are going to the hospital first thing in the morning you and i rabies will kill you the treatments easy now but it must start quickly im not going to be argued with on this some things we may not be able to do anything about but simple medicine and common sense we can use if these celtic spirits entered an existing wild creature we have no idea what its condition was before greg opened his mouth meghan held up a finger gregory hush we will say you met an uncollared dog outside the locked cemetery gates you like dogs you knelt to pat it it clawed you and ran away end of story end of questions i show my médecins sans frontières id i sign all their forms and they give me the dosages to follow up they like msf here they founded it one immunoglobulin shot tomorrow morning and one vaccine five over the next month not even remotely complicated guaranteed prevention are we done discussing this yes maam greg said meekly ned would have said the same thing he felt an overwhelming sense of relief that his mom was here and not just because she wasnt where shed been yesterday meghan marriner made a precise tick mark on her first page of notes she put her glasses on again and studied the page a moment then looked up at her sister again same point if ysabel has become melanie or the other way round what do we know from that is melanie there in any way kim pursed her lips i think so she looked at her husband i think ned had it right beforethe men return as themselves but shes summoned into someone and shes a little different each time meghan nodded so if shes different its melanie thats the difference kate wenger finished that makes sense meghan marriner smiled a little i try but what do we know if we know that steve asked meghan took off her glasses again well for starters imagine she wanted to steer this to tell us something what does melanie know about provence about aix this whole area neds brief excitement faded he looked glumly at greg and steve and then his dad edward marriner sighed just about everything honey she spent half a year getting ready for this shes worse than kate mom shes worse than you ned said well really said his father halfheartedly i wouldnt go that far meghan raised an eyebrow at her son and then looked at her husband careful both of you you are both in potential trouble tonight why me i didnt compare the supernatural realm to an adolescent shaving edward marriner protested i still think that was a good metaphor uncle dave complained promptly that said kimberly just makes the point for us better to keep quiet nobody needs to know you still think that way the management is taking the entire question of male idiocy under advisement kate wenger said meghan grinned encouragement at her you said it girl ned carefully avoided looking at kate he knew exactly what she was doing with that phrase hed either redden or laugh if he caught her eye and neither would be useful just now he cleared his throat i hate to accuse my own mother of being frivolous but is this really the best time to get into sisterhood bonding it isnt such a bad time aunt kim murmured she was looking at meghan ned blinked moods could change pretty fast he thought meghan shook her head dont rush me kim she paused looked back down at her notes so you guys are saying we cant predict anything from melanie being part of this maybe we can kim said its a good thought meg i just dont know what yet steve lifted his hand they seemed to be copying kates goodstudent gesture here you know id bet a lot the reason theres a search and not a fight is melanie that makes sense too kate said they were really surprised by it they didnt like it at all why they want to kill each other ned said meghan hesitated then made another tick mark his mother had other notes and other questions none of them triggered anything close to a revelation she asked why phelan had been going under the baptistry in the first place what hed been looking for down there ned didnt know neither did aunt kim if i was guessing ned began might as well honey his mother said no marks deducted he said something about finding himthe other guyin time and never being able to do it the world will end hed actually said maybe he wanted to kill cadell before the summoning but then shed never appear his father said if i understand this at all i know ned said thats why im just guessing i thinki think hes really tired there was a short silence who could have foretold that the heart grows old aunt kim said then added thats yeats not me the air i breathe is her or wanting her that didnt sound like a wornout heart i think its really complicated ned said uhhuh ill buy that said greg neds mother made a dash this time on her sheet not a tick mark she asked about when the sculpture underground had been stolen and when it might have been made the theft they knew was recent the work they had no idea a tick mark a dash meghan wanted to know what had happened at béziers god will know his own kate answered that one good student another tick more questions varying marks on paper the moon rising outside ned felt a sudden rush of love for his mother against the weight of centuriesagainst druids and skulls and wolves rituals of blood fire and men who could grow horns from their heads like a forest god or flyshe was trying to bring order and clarity to bear he saw her put down her pen take off her glasses and fold them she rubbed her eyes this would have been he thought a long amazingly hard day for her kate excused herself to call mariechantals house and report she was spending another night away ned had the feeling they didnt worry a whole lot about their guest there but he didnt ask questions he was glad she was staying there wereby nowa variety of reasons in the absence of anything close to a better idea they decided to stay with todays plan do the same searching tomorrow kate had been rightthey arranged three groups i want to go back to aix ned said suddenly he hadnt planned to say that but it was interesting how everyone simply accepted it deferring to him even his mother that went beyond interesting and reached surreal actually veracook had gone home greg went into the kitchen to make another pot of tea kate and kim and uncle dave stayed at the table bent over a big map sorting out routes neds parents put on sweaters and went out on the terrace together he could see them through the glass doors their chairs close his mom touched his father on the shoulder once as ned watched steve had put on the television a soccer game ned went and joined him on the couch eventually greg brought his tea and sat with them on the screen one team got a corner kick and someone headed the ball into the net the player became very excited so did the announcers and the crowd when it was time for sleep things got interesting in another way since they were now short a bed ned had the two singles in his room but he somehow didnt think kate would switch up there good call on that one uncle dave came upstairs with ned kate stayed in the mainfloor bedroom with aunt kim ned thought he might talk with his uncle a little he had his own really long list of questions mostly about his family but he was also flatout exhausted and he fell asleep pretty much as soon as they turned out the light he woke in the middle of the night again not jet lag this time he felt disoriented afraid he sat straight up in bed his heart pounding after a minute he rose quietly and went to the window he looked out over the grass and pool nothing there that he could see he checked his watch it was past two in the morning ned what is it he hadnt been as quiet as hed thought dont know something woke me his head was hurting that was what made him do the inward search another good call he found his own aura and aunt kims downstairs but there was a third presence registering gold as well but shaded towards red nowand pulsing bright and dim bright and dim like a signal beacon i got it he said to his uncle in the dark room cadells out there not too far and i think hes calling why how would i know that was unfair even if he hated these questionsand then in fact he realized that he did know because he remembered something i bet hes hurt kate and i saw him trying to fly when he left his uncle stood up a large figure in the darkness ned he couldnt have hed had a knife in his shoulder muscle go tell him that there was a silence his uncle sighed all right said dave martyniuk lets do that you able to find him dont know but if hes actually calling me i have a guess why dowhy do we want to go out there he was scared hed admit it if asked his uncle was dressing because were adrift here no good ideas he is too thats why they came to us martyniuk shrugged sometimes the blind do lead the blind yeah said ned straight over cliffs but he started pulling on his jeans and a shirt we should bring aunt kim if im right hell need a doctor again kim and your mother his uncle said mom his eyes had adjusted enough that he could see his uncle nod she still feels outside all this afraid of it the story of your family the reason we never met before today you have to draw her in ned has to be you he hesitated you might not have thought about this yet but whats happened to you here isnt going to go away after we leave ned hadnt thought about that they went quietly down the hall and dave knocked softly on the master bedroom door his mother was a light sleeper what is it they heard we need you meghan im sorry can you come downstairs they went down without waiting same knock at the bedroom below a few moments later there were six of them in the kitchen with the stove light turned on for muted light ned had had a quick subversive thought that kate would come out all tshirt and legs again but shed pulled on jeans and his mcgill sweatshirt uncle dave briefed the others we can all get in the van neds father said ill drive dave martyniuk shook his head too many of us and no reason ill take ned and the doctors edward theres really nothing you can do up there and certainly not kate i did have four years of karate kate said optimistically till i was twelve ned smiled so did the others edward marriner looked as if he was about to protest aunt kim forestalled it actually she said dave can drive us but he stays by the car ned will take us up that makes no sense her husband said quickly kim his wife held up an index finger one you cant even walk properly cher ill wrap your knee again later that was a bad landing she lifted another finger two even with that you could very easily start or be provoked into a fight i saw the way you two were circling each other i was not circling her husband exclaimed i um have a bad knee his wife didnt laugh dave listen if he flew it was to be defiant show that phelan couldnt stop him and our orders not to didnt matter but the wound did stop him of course it did meghan said i know but y chromosome remember male idiocy and so he may be up there spoiling for a fight because hes had to ask for help perfect logic dave said so you leave me behind and he picks on ned he wont ned said again that new response after he spoke the unexpected deference ill get my bag his mother said briskly ned take a jacket itll be cold out there the kitchen emptied of adults kate lingered a moment want the sweatshirt back he managed a crooked smile whats under it me i guess but a tshirt too drat only reason i woke everyone was to see if youd flash your legs again i figured she cleared her throat id feel stupid saying be careful you know go ahead i wont tell anyone you scared yeah she looked at him be careful he nodded uncle dave parked the car where kim pointed by the barrier that separated the road from the jogging path he turned off the engine and they all got out keep your cellphones on he said im right here ready to limp to the rescue his wife said kim dont be funny she smiled at him the moonlight caught it ned saw his mother watching as aunt kim gave her husband a hug and lifted her face for a kiss sorry love she said but im right about this and you know i am dave still looked like he wanted to argue ned walked around the barrier with his mother and aunt following the beam of his flashlight down the path it was farther than he remembered the moon was ahead of them as they went clouds moved quickly obscuring and exposing it and stars none of them spoke this would be he realized the first time the two sisters had been together since his mother was a teenager in a way it made him wish he werent here then he realized something he didnt have to be there was nothing important he brought to this once hed woken up knowing that cadell was calling aunt kim could sense the man as easily as he could he was here as a buffer he decided to let them be together or maybe to hold a flashlight he kicked a pebble on the path heard it skitter away his aunt on his right side said quietly not usually a good idea to talk about kids when theyre there but i havent had a chance to tell you i really like my nephew his mother on neds other side made no reply ned kicked another stone it was quiet up here and cold he kept expecting to see the tower ahead round and roofless meghan said none of your own was that a choice something difficult seemed to have entered the night not directly his aunt said finally result of a different kind of choice back when i would have liked children so would dave teach them basketball whatever she was talking in a clipped way not her usual tone ned thought as if she was controlling her voice the silence that followed made him nervous he cleared his throat yeah postup moves and all that i guess thats it aunt kim said her voice was almost inaudible adoption was a no his mother asked another dozen steps ned played the beam ahead of them he really did wish he were somewhere else now his aunt sighed oh meg this was all so long ago it would have felt like dodging something sneaking around it what you thought you deserved to be childless his mothers voice was sharp i deserved something for a decision i made this was it and you know that kim you know thats why you couldnt oh sweetie meg yes i know it his mother swore in the darkness she didnt apologize either ned kept his mouth shut he heard a snorting scuffling sound to the right shone the beam quickly that way but there was scrub and brush off the path and he saw nothing he looked ahead again and there was the tower at the end of the path with the moon behind it and empty space beyond where the land fell away his mother stopped staring at that roofless ruin the ghostly solitude of it he and aunt kim had been here before she hadnt i could quote browning he heard his mom say i thought of that too meg first time his aunt murmured i didnt ned said mainly cause i have zero idea what youre talking about both of them smiled exchanging a glance you will one day his mother said it doesnt matter lets go she called cadells name loudly and walked straight up to the barrier that ringed the tower ned was wondering what theyd do if he wasnt here when a darkness on the far side moved and became a shape he saw the celt come over to them on the other side of the makeshift fence why here meghan marriner asked no other greeting cadell shrugged he was holding his left arm i thought id rest it is a place i know then i realized it could be a problem to go down into the city like this ned shone the beam on his shoulder and winced the bandage had ripped apart the shirt was soaked in blood there was blood on the hand holding his shoulder too his mother said nothing ned bring the light over youll have to hold it for me aunt kim sounded angry you on that rock sit down if i do this again you will undertake not to fly the big man looked down at her ned saw him smile he knew what was coming before the man spoke no cadell said i cant do that so we do this now and then do it again he stepped over the low fence and went to sit as instructed on the rock ned remembered wolves here the last time the celt said quietly i expect nothing of you i am grateful you came he looked at the three of them only the boy where is the warrior amusement in his voice dave waiting in the car cadell laughed aloud you feared for his life wise of you aunt kim had been reaching for his shirt she stopped truthfully my fear was that he would have killed you even if he tried not to and as i understand this wed have lost melanie when he did next comment she sounded like his mom ned thought really precise the man sitting on the boulder stared up at kim as if his eyes could penetrate thoughts through the dark ned kept the flashlight beam on his shoulder he found himself breathing faster you actually believe that what you said cadell murmured i do the celt seemed amused again you dont understand what youre dealing with yet do you i think i do i think we all do by now i think the failures yours she had taken a pair of scissors from her sisters hand and began cutting away the shirt uncle daves shirt this time cadells had been sliced away in the villa the first time this was done his deep voice was quiet not every man who fought at waterloo or crécy or pourrières was a warrior being at a battlefield doesnt mean anything in itself true you begin to sound less of an idiot kimberly said her hands were busy as she spoke there are even men i have knownthree or four of themwho could certainly best my husband but i am not persuaded you are one with a wrecked shoulder especially you make me want to test him for the joy of it i know i do thats why hes by the car this is about melanie melanie is gone cadell said you must accept that it is about ysabel everything always is no for you and the other one not for the rest of us meghan marriner said she handed kim sterile wipes to began cleaning the wound again were sure he missed the brachial neds mother asked her sister nodded he couldnt have moved the arm theres no major muscle implicated this is just an infection risk the knife was in his boot you up to date with your tetanus shots meghan said got your immunization record aunt kim laughed cadell said nothing ned watched his aunts hands moving quickly exposing the wound i cant suture out here obviously and i still dont think he needs it clean debride antibiotics yes cadell remained silent through all of this sitting very still moments passed the wind blew it really was cold then softly the man whod called them here said you have never seen her you have no way of realizing what this is what she is you will say you understand but you do not the boy knows the air i breathe is her or wanting her aunt kim looked at cadell she hesitated choosing words it seemed yours she said finally is not the first love i have known to last for lifetimes it isnt even the second you will forgive me if i value one of us more than your passion ned blinked it wasnt what hed expected cadell took a breath then the celt smiled again i begin to wonder if i should pity your husband hed say yes but i dont think he suffers so much kimberly replied her hands packing the wound with gauze she looked into her patients eyes again and he could give you the same answer i did ned watched cadell gaze at his aunt then the celt turned and stared at meghan and finally at ned himself aunt kim wrapped the wound in silence ned held his light steady and looked up above it at the tower and the stars impulsively he said why did you put that skull and the other thing under the cathedral cadell looked at him he actually seemed surprised why do you think i did i have no idea why you did it no i mean why do you think it was me ned felt himself flushing well i mean he told you i did this kept happening with these two he could never get his balance now he was trying to remember if phelan had actually said so in as many words he led us to think so and why would i have done something like that toto bait him because he was searching for you down there really ned swallowed theres been nothing there for a thousand years cadell said soso what would he have he wanted to bring you in obviously it isnt obvious at all of course it is but why he sensed you read you as someone linked to this world before i knew it myself cause i had never that can happen it was his aunt interjecting happened with me that way someone knew me before i understood anything but why would he want me ned protested cadells voice was surprisingly gentle he looks for ways to balance matters he threatened us with his knife one of his knives cadell said dryly he never once asked forhe never it was hard to form thoughts suddenly cause words to make sense he was trying to replay that first morning in his mind and he couldnt the roman ask for something cadell was still amused that he would never do he sets events in motion and takes what he can use he said you like to play games thats true enough he kept telling me to stay away that there was no role for me the smile remained do you know a better way to draw a young man to anything ned felt anger surge the dogs outside the café was that you that was me playing games i told you i didnt expect you to come out neither did he this makes no sense ned cried when would he have had time to steal those things and get them to the cathedral why did it look like him not difficult he made a bust of himself long ago for her you could have thought of thatwhich of us is the sculptor ned swallowed for the restwe both sensed you as soon as you arrived i was curious he was more than that it now seems he needed you more it wouldnt have been difficult to learn who your father wasand where he was going that morning ned first time hed ever used neds name i imagine if you bother to check youll find the two things were stolen from the museum storage the night before you found them he had them with him and was watching to see if you went inside the cathedral that morning if you hadnt hed have tried something else or not hell never have only one thought you know oh god ned said should we believe you meghan marriner asked quietly cadell looked at her youve given me a great deal coming here and im grateful a debt i have no reason to lie there was a silence the round tower rose above them a backdrop i told him something ned said when he left and that was cadells voice changed a rising note ned drew a breath i told him id sensed herysabelin the cemetery that tension again as if the air around them were a stringed instrument vibrating and now youre angry with him and telling me i feel cheated cadell shook his head he does what he can we dont fight the same way he cant fly or summon spirits kimberly murmured neither of those no and he has to be there when shes summoned the big man nodded hes at risk otherwise there have been times shes come to me simply because he wasnt there unfair meghan marriner said why would it be fair he turned to ned you must hear what i am trying to say everything else everyone else is insignificant it is about her it always has been since he came through the forest ned looked away fists clenched fine none of us matter a damn i get it well now ive told you both keeps it even he kept it even too kim said still quietly at the villa wounded himself cadell laughed the amusement angered ned now i wouldnt have done that i confess it hes a different man the celt stood up shirtless again the bandage white in the moonlight you were made aware of ease and power as he moved i must go does it matter what ned said about the cemetery kim asked of course it does a place shes been youll go there now cadell nodded i may even meet him there which would be amusing he glanced at ned ill tell him hes disappointed you you cant fight each other ned said quickly cadell smiled i know she forbade that didnt she he turned to go down the slope that would take him towards the city he stopped and looked back phelan hadnt done that move away from us cadell said let it go youll hurt yourself it doesnt have to happen then he went from them disappearing down the path neds mother packed her kit when she was done they started back the way theyd come ned didnt use the flashlight the moon seemed bright enough he walked ahead could hear his mother and aunt behind him you understand all this i guess his mother said aunt kim walked a few steps without answering some not the details but i know things like this can happen you know because of before of course and nedslike you his mothers voice was tentative not quite the same but yes you know the family stories meg you grew up with them i know i dont like them i know stars overhead and the wind ned put up his jacket hood he was still trying to deal with anger this new feeling of having been abused by phelan that first morning a con job a guy doing the shell game on a sidewalk table drawing him in with that underground deception then telling him to go away in the cloisterjust another way of luring him he remembered the mans fury coming down off the roof surely that had been real maybemaybe ned had moved faster ended up closer known more than phelan had expected right like he was going to figure this out however hard he worked at it he put his hands in his pockets tried to see it from the other mans point of view outnumbered by cadell who had the spirits with him beltaine coming far less power than them needing to know where the summoning would be and then this kid with a link to their world shows up ned sighed he could see it he just couldnt get past the anger this version of the story made him feel so naive so stupidly young he forced himself to remember phelan at entremont telling them how to leave and when to save their lives cadell wouldnt have killed them there but brys would have and he could have that night it was hard to stay angry and as hard to let go of it he heard his mother again kim do you have any idea how difficult this is for me of course i do i wonder i cant lose ned the way i lost you that got his attention after a few more steps his aunt said carefully meg i was changed i wasnt lost maybe it was my fault but i didnt have enough in me to make it easier for you by the time i did it was too late old story old story his aunt agreed he heard only their footsteps on the path for a while then his mother said quietly did they die your friends ned strained to hear this was all new to him aunt kim murmured one did a darling man saved everything really one stayed there onefound what she was and joy in the end dave and i came home and were punished oh meg dont lets go there i did something important you pay a price sometimes like you when you go to war zones its not the same thing nothing near near enough he heard his mother make a sound that could have been laughter or not youre being a big sister trying to make me feel better havent had much chance the same sound again i made it worse for you when you came back didnt i aunt kim said nothing she couldnt ned realized shed either have to lie or admit that it was true and she wouldnt want to do either he felt like an intruder again listening he quickened his pace moved farther ahead he took out his cellphone and dialed his uncle it was picked up first ring where are you on our way back its okay everyone were fine it was pretty intense his uncle said nothing honestly ned said were fine where are kim and your mom just behind me theyre talking oh well be there in a few im here his uncle said he hadnt been for all neds life it was a nice thing to hear he said we wont have a lot of time we have to focus now to get her back his math teacher talked about focusing all the time his uncle cleared his throat ned i was going to say this before we went to bed you need to think about the possibility that we wont well do what we can but it isnt always poss nope ned marriner said uhuh were getting her back uncle dave im getting her back he hung up he found himself walking faster the urgency inside him strong suddenly anger and fear he needed to run burn some of it off he heard a sound ahead of him same snuffling grunting as when theyd come this way he stopped dead breathing quietly his mother and aunt were well behind him now he was about to turn on the flashlight when he saw the boar in the moonlight it was as he remembered it huge palecoloured nearly white though that was partly the moon it was alone standing stockstill in his pathas it had the last time in the laneway below the animal returned his gaze he knew by now this wasnt a simple sanglier like those that had rooted up the field beside the villa there was an ache in his chest as if too many things were wanting release he said cadells gone he went down the other way sos brys the druid hes really gone im sorry theres just me he had no idea what he expected what happened was that after a moment the boar turned its back on him it turned and faced east as ned wasas if rejecting him and all hed said as if saying just me meant nothing to this creature or worse than nothing as if he didnt mean anything at all wasnt worth looking at it did look back once though then trotted awaysurprisingly agileinto the brush beside the path and was swallowed by the night and what the hell did that mean ned marriner said they came up beside him what is it his mother asked that boar same as before his aunt looked around its gone he nodded kimberly sighed lets go dear dont make yourself crazy trying to understand all this cant help it he said but he walked on with them and at the end of the path they turned right and came to the barrier and went around it dave was on the other side leaning against his car kim went forward and put her arms around him her head against his chest they heard her say i told him you could have taken him apart dave martyniuk chuckled you did good thing i stayed behind then isnt it you tired of me ready for widowhood he was trivializing you honey i didnt like it dave kissed the top of her head trivializing kim im a middleaged lawyer who plays sunday rugby for the district team and cant move for two days after ned heard his aunt laugh softly yeah so she said whats your point that does remind me neds mother said brightly i really need to review the quality of security being sent out with me what goods a gimpy rugby player in darfur anyhow dave martyniuk looked at her over top of kims head which was still against his chest he grinned fair question meghan shook her head no it isnt and you know it i know it too ned said i saw you this afternoon remember that was no weekend rugby thing you havent seen our team play his uncle said ned you want your uncle killed soon as you meet him ned shook his head not in a hurry for that no dave said the truth i do know how to fight ive made sure i still do but this oneboth of theseare in their own league their own world i talked a good game in the villa because i wanted them taking us seriously but id have died up there if he wanted me dead silence they were completely alone at the end of the road in the middle of a night whatd he wind up doing dave asked meghan said kim cleaned him up again then ned told him hed sensed ysabel in arles hes going there dave looked at ned why did you do that ned shrugged i told phelan when he said goodbye guess i was being fair think anyone else will be ned scuffed at the gravel maybe not kimberly let go of her husband stepped back a little her hair was very white in the moonlight ive decided not to like her she said uncle dave pretended to be startled he looked at meghan what after all these years kim punched him in the chest not my sister i adore my sister i havent deserved that a whole lot neds mother murmured not the point kim said shouldnt it be her sister shook her head no and the one i dont like is ysabel her husband laughed aloud startling ned oh god dont let her know he said youll completely ruin her life this time around if she finds out kim ford feels that way his wife hit him again be quiet you dave was quiet it was ned who said after a moment dont hate her dont even dislike her shes outside that even more than they are the other three looked at him cant help it his aunt said stubbornly the two of them play this game of hideandseek and then the loser gets killed for her i dont like it thats all you havent seen her ned said itmakes a difference its what theyre all about i dont think she has a lot of choice either hold on his mother said they turned to her the moonlight was on her face you didnt say one would be killed ned but i did he said thats what she he stopped his heart was suddenly hammering again you didnt dear his mother said very gently neither did kate i wrote it down they were staring at her meghan marriner looked at her son you said sacrificed chapter xvii sunrise the first gift in the world promise and healing after the hard transit of night after a darkness beset with beastsimagined and realand inner fears and untamed violent men after sightlessness that could lead one astray into ditch or bog or over cliff or into the clutch and sway of whatever spirits might be abroad bent on malice mornings pale light had offered an end to such fears for centuries millennia whatever dangers might come with the day shutters were banged open curtains drawn shop doors and windows were unlocked city gates unbarred swung wide as men and women made their way out into the offered day on the other hand in life there was almost always another hand daylight meant that intimacy privacy escape from the unwanted gaze silence for meditation the solace of unseen tears on a pillowor of secret love on that same pillow before or afterwere so much harder to claim rarer coinage in the clear light it is more difficultmuch more difficultto hide and not be found but she wants to be found that lies at the heart of this she is prepared to become angry that they have taken so long and she remains alone unfair perhaps for shes made this difficult but they are supposed to love her beyond words need her more than breath or light and she has spent a second night outside and solitary and it has been cold she is not unaccustomed to hardship but neither is she immune to longing seeing them both at entremont when she came through to the summons has kindled need desire memory she would not let them know this of course not yet and only one of them after but these sensations are within her now and lying awake watching stars traverse the open space to the south as if across a window she has been intensely painfully aware of them of lives lived and lost and of the two of them somewhere out there looking for her she isnt certain why shed said three days no need to have done so a small hard kernel of fear it is possible they might not find her in time she knows herself very well knows she will not back away from this is aware that having arrived now in this place she has chosen she will not go forth again will not make it easier for them or for herself if one of them needs her enough he will be here meghan marriner showing no signs of fatigue had taken greg to the hospital at first light shed said last night she was going to do it was not the sort to back away from that steve drove them in the van kate briefed over breakfast was at the diningroom table poring over melanies notes and the guidebooks shed accumulated ned at the computer was googling as fast as he could type and skim hed had about three hours sleep he was running on adrenalin aware that he was probably going to crash hard at some point they were looking for clues based on what his mother had realized by the car barrier last night kate had gone pale when shed woken in the morning and theyd asked her about it but shed remembered the words exactly as he had up at entremont setting the two men their task of finding her ysabel hadnt just spoken of killing shed said the loser would be sacrificed they had nothing else to go on had to treat this as what they needed it to be a clue to what might be happening ned typed a different search combination celts provence places of sacrifice he started finding things about fées and fairy mounds and even dragons dragons not much help though from where he sat he was a lot less inclined to dismiss all that than he would have been a week ago there really was too much junk online personal pages wiccan sites travel blogs stuff about witches and fairiesfolk beliefs from medieval days he skipped past those further back it looked like the celts had merged their own gods with the roman ones right conquered peoplewhat else were they going to do except they did believe in human sacrifice in worshipping skulls they hanged sacrifices from trees he readthat didnt help a lot trees were everywhere they performed rituals on hills high places which offered a little more but not a lot entremont had been such a place but theyd been back already and ned was certain ysabel wouldnt have returned to where shed been summoned there was that other ruined hill fortroquepertuse towards arlesbut kim and kate had gone there yesterday he clicked and typed and scrolled earth goddesses linked to water pools springsned had been at one of those and so had cadell at glanum nothing goddesses were associated with forestsall the deities were it seemed much good that did them he found another site read they usually began with a human sacrifice utilizing a sword spear a sicklelike knife ritual hanging impaling dismembering disembowelling drowning burning burial alive he shook his head looked away from the screen over his shoulder kate had melanies notes and books spread around her on the table was scribbling like a student with a teacher lecturing ned turned back to the computer the romans it seemed had been shocked and appalled by all of this had banned human sacrifice sure ned thought the romans who were so gentle and kind themselves he tried other word combinations found another site read a celtic oppidum must have been as gruesome as a dayak or solomon island village everywhere were stakes crowned with heads and the walls of houses were adorned with them poseidonius tells how he sickened at such a sight but gradually became more accustomed to it he didnt know what a dayak was entremont was an oppidum the word just meant a hill fort they were back to that he checked the top of the page for the source of this one some englishman in well what was he going to know a cup of tea with his pinky extended and opinions on two thousand years ago ned swore and gave up this wasnt his thing it was making him nervous and he didnt have a sense it was leading anywhere he scraped his chair back and went out on the terrace his father and uncle were sitting there coffee mugs on the small table his dad glanced up he looked worn out well im wasting time theres way too much i mean thats what they didsacrifices so it could be anywhere his uncle sighed yeah kim thinks so too get yourself a coffee you must be beat this morning ned shook his head im fine i just want to get going have to have destinations first dont you think the glass doors opened all right said kate wenger heres what i think theres no point checking every celtic site in the books tell me about it ned said i am listen if were right this whole findme thing instead of a fight is because melanies inside ysabel right i still dont know how thats possible edward marriner said it is uncle dave said go ahead kate kate was biting her lip fine well my point is if the search is happening because of melanie then the one thing we can do is focus on places she knows about for celtic sacrifices right the three of them looked at one another google is not my friend ned said no one laughed only if melanie googled something and made a note thats what im thinking kate said she had his mcgill sweatshirt on again over her brothers shirt and jeans neds father was nodding thats good kate it gives us something logical were they logical uncle dave asked melanie is edward marriner said and sos kate ned said so whats in her notes about celts and rituals or whatever i found two places we havent been to yet we have three cars dave martyniuk said only two give me one more ned cleared his throat im going back to aix he repeated hed told them last night why kate asked but softly ned shrugged to the cloister ill let you guys be logical i need to go there none of them said anything greg not evidently the worse for two rabies injections with more to come over the next while courtesy of dr meghan marriner found the name of one of the sites amusing like if the celts were illiterate or whatever whyd they name something fort books neds mother was in a mood ill make the next shot hurt if you dont cut the jokes gregory and i know how to do it he called pain de munition east of here painful munitions steve declared ratting me out greg said indignantly but he looked pleased to have it recalled fort de buoux apparently was about fortyfive minutes north a hilltop off a rough road nothing near it a walk and climb to ruinswith a sacrificial altar at the summit it sounded like a place where you could take an impressive photograph or hide the other site was farther north and west more touristy starred in all the guidebookssomething called the fontaine de vaucluse a place where water gushed out of a mountain cave at certain times of the year melanie had noted that oliver lee wrote a section for the book describing the place from ancient times through the nineteenth century up to how it looked today some italian poet had lived there in medieval times but it had also been a celtic holy site that figures ned thought having googled goddesses and springs of water caves and chasms in the earth im still going into aix he said again as uncle dave and his father started sorting out whod be in which car he was beginning to come to termsa littlewith the fact that the others would listen to him and do what he decided more or less not by yourself his mother said im not in danger mom brys is the one who was after me not by yourself meghan marriner repeated with a firmness that really was kind of impressive it wasnt a voice you could argue with it didnt actually occur to you to argue ned ended up in the city with his mom and dad dave was driving kate and steve to fort de buoux greg took aunt kim to the fountain the idea again was to be in touch by phone meet up if anyone found anything or come back here for midafternoon to figure a next step if nothing happened it could actually have been funny in a different time and space walking into town between his parents ned half felt like asking for an ice cream or a popsicle or a ride on the merrygoround near the biggest of the fountains the cathedral was open but the door out to the cloister was locked the guide who had the key and ran the halfhourly tours was coming in only after lunch ned didnt even think of having his dad try to pick the lock not here he wondered if his mom knew her husband could do that they went through the medieval streets back towards the main drag the cours mirabeau on the way they passed the café where hed gone with kate he saw the chair hed used to block the dog attacking him he didnt say anything to his parents about that his father was looking stressed enough on the mirabeau lined with cafés on one side and banks on the other shaded by enormous plane trees he stopped the feeling was becoming almost familiar shes been here he said how do you know that his mother demanded his logical mother exasperation in her voice jeez mom i have no idea i just do same way sort of that i knew cadell was at the tower last night i guess why sort of she didnt miss a lot ned fumbled for words looking at the tourists sitting at small outdoor tables they seemed to be enjoying themselves why not people dreamed of coming here didnt they of sitting at a café in the south of france in may it isnt exactly the same he said finally i dont get her as an aura like the other two or aunt kim or my own you can see your aunt inside he nodded if shes close enough and isnt screening herself same with them his mother sighed andysabel different i just have a feeling she was here like she was at the cemetery why jeez mom she frowned i take it that eloquent phrase means we lack an answer he nodded yeah we lack an answer maybe because of melanie his father said suddenly maybe youre picking up melanie not ysabel ed youre as bad as they are his father still looked strained lets have lunch his mother said after a moment ned saw her looking closely at his dad we have to wait anyhow they picked a café near the end of the street the inside looked flashy in an oldfashioned way lots of green and gold but on a day like this it was way nicer outdoors his father bought a newspaper next door he found a report on the return of the skull and the sculpted bust no details that seemed to matter the police hadnt any idea who had returned them other than that it had been a man in a black leather jacket on a motorcycle grey ned thought at some point his father said mostly to himself im going to have to call her family his mother looked at him again then she surprised ned a bit by reaching out and squeezing her husbands hand aunt kim called as they were finishing lunch the fontaine de vaucluse was jammed with tourists on a saturday morning in spring it was theoretically possible neds father relayed that ysabel might be hiding in a tourist shop among lavender sachets and olive oil samples but unlikely kim and greg were heading back to the villa they phoned dave he reported that the three of them were still climbing about and around fort de buoux no one else was there at all it was windy and there was a pretty compelling altar right at the top as advertised but the no one else there included any sign of a redhaired woman kate was supposed to recognize if she saw her they were about to work down the steeper wilder side of the hill to see if there were any caves or recesses where she might have ducked out of sight out of the wind theyd head back after that be careful neds father said to his brotherinlaw watch your knee he hung up he cant go clambering around rocks with that leg meghan said edward marriner shrugged what am i going to do if he cant he cant worry was written on his face he looked older ned didnt like seeing him like that it made ned feel fragile somehow they went back to the cathedral ned walked into the dimness and past the baptistry on their right he saw the grate covering the floor there he didnt stop nothing there now nothing to see it had been a trick anyhow items borrowed from the museum now returned the cloister door was open there were three people outside with a severelooking guide she had stopped in front of the squared corner pillar by the far door to the street she was lecturing and pointing the visitors holding cameras looked bored ned went left away from them towards ysabel he was beset with complicated feelings too many associations it was less than a week since hed first come here the rose was gone not a surprise but for some reason it disturbed him he wondered who would have taken it maybe just the gardener he wished suddenly hed thought to bring flowers his father had a small digital camera and was taking snaps of the cathedral walls and the roof where it came down towards the cloister a different sort of shot about lines and light ned was glad to see him working it was hard to see him so distressed so obviously helpless it made ned feel as if he was the one who was supposed to make everyone else feel better his mom had gone over to the tourist information on the wall shed put her glasses on and was reading ned remembered a diagram showing how the cathedral complex was laid on top of the roman forum another one identifying the figures on the columns here saint peter at one corner a bull an eagle david and goliath the queen of sheba he let himself slide slowly down back against the wall until he was sitting on the tile flooring in front of her he looked at the sculpture so little there so much implied a hint an echo he knew what his mother was going to say what else could she say reading what was posted on the opposite wall the queen of sheba it said he watched her coming over putting her reading glasses back in her purse taking out sunglasses her hair was really red in the sunlight darker when she crossed into shade she came up and stood beside ned and looked at the worn pale sculpture in front of them she shook her head and sat neatly down beside him legs extended crossed at the ankles she took off her sunglasses and looked some more she was beautiful she murmured he swallowed who ysabel she said ned began to cry she looked at him quickly honey what you dontyou dont think its the queen of sheba his mother handed him a kleenex ned dear with melanie gone and what ive seen in less than a day im not going to doubt you here honest she made a face dont fish child ned had to smile even as he struggled for control he wiped his eyes iit matters a lot to me that you believe me his mother didnt smile this time because i didnt believe your aunt partly that not all she touched his cheek someone still has to be logical here ned id volunteer his father said coming up the three tourists and the guide were still on the far side but im not sure where i parked my logic well find it his wife said i mean ned may be using some kind of intuition or psychic thing here but you and i cant we dont have it this cant just be about oracular pigs or reading bird entrails like the celts did romans did bird entrails too edward marriner said a whole class of priests was trained in it ned saw his mother stick out her tongue at his father he had never seen her do that fine be that way but they didnt do human sacrifice true enough other nasty bits im sure but we still have to try to bring something to this you and i we have to think ned does his thing whatever it is or kim does and we she stopped because ned had stood up he was replaying a phrase in his head over and over like a tape loop they didnt do human sacrifice and then like some kind of silent explosion in his mind he locked onto the other thing his mother had just said oracular pigs he felt himself starting to tremble the boar seen below the villa above it under the moon he saw it again in his mind turning away from him rejecting him but no not away turning for him the slow calm movement looking back both times at ned then ahead again before moving off he took a deep breath he looked at the sculpted column at ysabel then down at his hands we better get back to the house he said i know where she is they were waiting for him to speak assembled in the villa again ned felt shaky his hands were sweaty this was too large it felt massive but he was also sure of himself he was absolutely certain in fact go ahead his father said edward marriners voice was quiet his eyes calm he didnt look weary or worn down any more hed been like that since ned had spoken in the cloister and theyd started back for the van and home ned does his thing his mother had said she was looking at him from across the diningroom table hands in her lap no notebook just waiting he cleared his throat we werewe were really close to it last night mom was when she reminded us of the word ysabel used sacrifice uncle dave said he was sitting in the armchair by the piano leg up on a hassock an ice pack on the knee ned nodded yeah so we did the obvious thing and started thinking about celtic sacrifice places that melanie might have known about and that was close to being right what did we miss kate wenger asked she was still wearing his sweatshirt one thing and something else no one but me could have known no one missed that except me he looked at his mother aunt kim was leaning on the doorframe behind her where her husband had been the night before the romans did at least one human sacrifice here ned said and melanie knew it because she told me about it he looked at greg and then steve that time i was really sick when you two went up to the ambush site to look for a photo spot they both nodded said nothing ned took another breath let it out thats where she is ysabel melanie the mountain steve said yeah ned said shes up on saintevictoire its a big mountain ned his father said theres a lot of ground to cover up there and i ned held up both hands no dad i know exactly where because all of this all of this is about melanie now i think the changed rules searching instead of a fight they didnt expect that and shes hiding in a place she knows i know about we had to know too were putting a lot in the idea that melaniesspirit whatever is inside ysabel edward marriner said we can do that ed aunt kim murmured her arms were tightly crossed on her chest no one said anything for a moment all right fine you said you know the place ned where his mothers first words since theyd gathered back here she was gazing at him that calm attentive expression he knew so looking at her he said shes at some chasm melanie called it a garagai its somewhere near the top and shes there because it was almost as if this had become a dialogue between the two of them she used to quiz him like this for science or social studies tests when he was younger because she told me about it thats where the romans marius threw the celtic chieftains down a pit a place of sacrifice after the battle so they couldnt ever be reclaimed to be worshipped and help the tribes oh god said kate she put a hand to her mouth they even talked about that at entremont the three of them ned nodded his head yeah they did i thought about that too melanie knew we were there id called her remember is that the second thing his mother asked softly you said there were two no the garagai is in her notes the other thing was entirely me itwice at night i saw that boar when i was by myself and both times itboth times i think it was signalling me i didnt get it till just now till you said something in the cloister i dont know why it was doing that but im pretty sure his uncle sat up shifting his leg he had an odd expression on his face what kind of boar he asked huge one almost white greg saw it when brys stopped us on the road greg was nodding his head really big he said i could have wrecked the van hitting it go on ned uncle dave said ned looked at him i dont know if anyone will believe me but i think it was pointing to something both times it came out waited for me to see it then it turned around and faced the mountain and looked back at me and then it went off i didnt know what was going on andand this is weird but the first time was before beltaine before anything even happened i know that doesnt make sense time can be funny in these things his aunt said so you think shes by this chasm neds mother said calmly all right good thats our first stop tomorrow we get directions and go look ned shook his head his hands were trembling again mom no i have to go now one of thems going to figure this theyve had so much longer with her with ysabel they heard her say sacrifice too and they know that place ned his father began dad im really sure im shaking with it im so positive he held up his hands to show them his father looked at him thats not what i was going to say ned i believe you theres something else youre forgetting what ned said it was steve who answered him dude you cant go up that mountain i have to ned greg murmured we saw you there you looked like you were dying man i havent seen anyone throw up that hard sincesince whenever ned stopped he took a steadying breath he swore neither parent said a word he had forgotten or hed half remembered because he knew hed been sick when melanie told him about the garagai but hed blocked out what it would mean to go back there to climb even the recollection made him feel ill right here he shook his head doesnt matter i have to try i need to go like right now he was almost twitching with the need to be gone his fathers tone was gentle its past four oclock ned you cant do it in the dark wont be dark ill get my sweats and ill run im a runner dad i can do this and maybea sudden thoughtmaybe ill be better when i get higher up my problem was the battlefield i think he looked at greg and steve and maybe you wont greg said shaking his head dude steve began all of you listen ned said he heard his voice rising melanie is gone if we screw this up look ill take four advil or whatever and sunglasses and my phone and ill run please stop arguing we cant argue we need to move i have to know exactly where this place is kate wenger without a word got up and went to melanies mapsandbooks file on the computer table ned was looking at his mother he saw something in her eyes that went so far beyond concern he couldnt even put a word to it mom please he whispered i need your help i know meghan marriner said i just dont want to give it he looked at her she shook her head i cant begin to tell you how little i like this what do you plan to do when you get up there if you get up there no idea she let herself smile a little well thats honest im being honest mom meghan looked at him another moment then turned to her husband with a crisp nod ed get your two veras in here while kates looking for maps if they live here they may know her husband shook his head let me try something else first he crossed to the desk beside kate and checked a phone number on melanies corkboard then dialed ned found that he was breathing hard alreadyit looked amazingly as if they were going to help but he was remembering the mountain now pourrières and the worst feeling of his life that screen of blood filtering the world and the smell of it his choice here no one else to blame sometimes he thought life was easier when you had people to stop you maybe that was something parents were good for his father said oliver ed marriner am i interrupting anything he waited for whatever reply he got then said i wont keep you long before drinks the englishman answered something and neds father managed a fake laugh well if you have one already i neednt rush but i have a question thats come upsomething to photograph maybe do you know a place called the garagai up on saintevictoire another pause a longer one oliver lee was launching into a story ned guessed ned could picture him reading glasses on their chain over his chest drink in hand holding forth edward marriner opened his mouth to interrupt closed it then plunged in well yes ive read a bit about all that and i was thinking of going up to have a look he paused i know it is a climb yes ive heard it gets windy butoliver do you know where it is up there have you been the room fell silent edward marriner looked at his son his brow furrowed it never unfurrowed you havent so you wouldnt be able to give me directions he looked over at his wife yes of course well chase down a topographic map or i can call the mayors office theyve been helpful he stopped lee was saying something no no it is hardly a shocking confession oliver my people told me cézanne never climbed it either he paused again yes of course ill give your regards to melanie he looked at ned again no i think ill let you tell her that yourself oliver another small forced laugh he said goodbye and hung up ned looked across the room at his mother she was gazing at him staring at him really with an expression he couldnt remember seeing before as if he were a stranger it bothered him he tried to smile at her but didnt really succeed ned it was his aunt two things if youre right and theres urgency here its because one or both of them may get there first and they may do that by tracking you they were going to arles he said yesterday evening ned they both seem to think youre a key to this youll have to screen yourself when we leave here but you need to let it go at times you cant hold the screening too long he hesitated i was kind of counting on the screen to help me withmy problem there i thought you might be but you still need to let it go some of the time or youll make yourself ill he cleared his throat phelan told me that too last night kim what if theyre watching us from out there meghan gestured towards the windows her sister frowned i dont think she looked at uncle dave he shrugged might be they know where we are they know were looking either theyre tearing around searching everywhere or theyre checking us at intervals checking on ned to see if hes doing anything could they have anyone watching for them steve asked dont think so kim said but we arent sure said her sister briskly all right assume they are watching what do we do and first of all how do we find out where he has to go i can tell you that said a voice from the kitchen door they turned veracook in her usual black dress was standing there shed spoken in english youyou speak our language edward marriner said he looked a bit stunned as if too many things were happening too fast vera smiled a little the owners are american i learn a little but you never you always speak french she shrugged kimberly walked towards her do youdo you understand what were talking about here climbing the mountain a slight flicker of the eyes that and why kims voice was direct why we need to go up vera looked at her nodded her head her own voice was cold something happened on the fire night i had rowans by the windows to protect the house she should not have gone out she had to ned said they were speaking french again it was my fault but it was before sundown it shouldnt have been beltaine veracook crossed herself when he said the word how do you know about all this meghan asked she looked as unhappy as ned could remember again that shrug my grandmother she told us stories all of my family we put out rowan on that night and on the other night in autumn another grandmother it was dave who asked the question you said you can help you know where this garagai is vera nodded but it is a bad place and it is already late today neds father surprised him then itll be later if we hang around talking my understanding is we need to get up there fast please tell us how it is the girl melanie yes said edward marriner she is gone from the fire night a hesitation yes he said again another sign of the cross you should not go inside this then she said we are inside it mme lajoie neds father said please tell us what you know who will go she asked me said ned she looked at him you will take rowan for protection ill take anything you want me to take he said fervently she nodded grimfaced for the girl i will tell how you go it is not far from the cross at the top or the chapel but you must be careful it is easy to fall if there is wind oh wonderful said meghan marriner ned ignored that as best he could kate sat at the diningroom table with paper and pen and gestured for vera lajoie to sit beside her she did so then she proceeded to give extremely precise directions to the mountain chasm where marius of the romans had sacrificed a number of celtic chieftains twentyone hundred years ago ned was studying the directions in kates very neat handwriting he lifted his head saw his mother looking at him this she said is hard for me i really want to forbid you i know he said or i want to come he smiled a bit ill be running mom uncle dave has a bad leg steve cant run greg for sure cant i can said kate no said meghan and kim simultaneously dont even think it meghan marriner added kate bit her lip meghan looked at her sister kim can he even do anything aunt kim had her arms folded across her chest again honestly i dont know i dont think either of them mean him harm but you dont know we cant know meg even with what you her sister shook her head i have next to nothing here all i can tell you is that i do think melanies gone if one of them finds her and that ned is inside this somehow i accept that but im also his mother kim you cant imagine she stopped shook her head oh dear im sorry kimberlys eyes were bright dont be i have no children but i can imagine what it might be like to let him go ive seen it done lets do this ned said as confidently as he could he didnt think he was fooling anyone whos driving me hold it said greg if they might be tracking you we need to do this carefully ill screen myself ned said starting now and we go out in two cars even three but if theyre watching the house steve asked like dr marriner said theyll see you leave they dont care about the rest of us ned and i swap clothes kate wenger said suddenly they looked at her she stood up from the table what do you mean ned said you arent wearing anything that belongs to you anyhow kate made a face dont be funny i mean well hurry out to two cars but i dress like you you wear the mcgill thing thats my own sweatshirt but theyve seen me in it last night and today if they have been watching you wear my brothers white shirt under it i put on that uncool windbreaker of yours and your baseball cap it isnt uncool he protested hush shes right ned kim said it makes sense all right said dave one car goes west or north somewherethe one that looks like it has ned in itand the other takes him to the mountain he smiled at kate very good good she said tossing her head its heroic i never wear baseball caps neds father sighed he looked at his wife then at ned oliver said the same thing as vera you know its apparently dangerous off the paths ned falling off a mountain is the least of my worries ned said as to that said aunt kim heres one thing she took off the only bracelet she wore the silver one with the green stone i have no idea if this will help but theres a chance what is it it was meghan kim looked at her a gift a long time ago it connects to all this i guess you could say it may help with the sickness or not but it wont hurt ned took the bracelet and slipped it on he felt nothing though the metal was cool on his wrist he shrugged lets do this he said again vera came back from the kitchen she was holding leaves a bunch of them tied together gravely she gave them to ned thank you he said he wasnt about to say no was he he looked down at his aunts bracelet made a face i mean like what would have been wrong with a machine gun eh no one laughed his mother was staring at him that same expression as before as if meghan marriner were looking at her child and seeing someone she didnt quite know or else she was memorizing his face mom he began she shook her head go she said chapter xviii in the van wearing kates brothers shirt and his own mcgill hoodie over jeans ned did his best to focus he had his small runners pack with him would change into sweatpants and a tshirt as soon as they hit the road east hed screened himself before going out the door so had aunt kim checking within neither of them had sensed the presence of either of the two menwhich wasnt anywhere close to conclusive he knew hed taken three advil and brought half a dozen more and his sunglasses thinking now about how hed felt the last time they went past the mountain dragged his thoughts pretty conclusively away from the scent of kate wenger on the white shirt he felt scared katein his blueandwhite rugby shirt and the slandered windbreaker and retro expos baseball capwas with uncle dave and steve in the red car greg was driving the van neds father was up front and aunt kim was beside him in backbecause his aunt would be with kate not ned kate had worked this out too detail person geek long legs he had her writtenout directions in his backpack front flap pocket hed put the rowan leaves in there too neds mother had stayed in the villa he wasnt sure why but the hug shed given him at the door was fierce fierce enough to make him more afraid greg hit the remote control and led the other car through the gates they went down the roadway towards the street they would split after the first turn there the red car west and north to entremont the van to saintevictoire you have your phone his father said from the front seat hed asked that already in the house ned nodded got it dad yeah its charged yes dad youll call if anything comes up i will this wasnt the time ned thought to be hung up on sounding like an almostadult ned said his aunt listen to me if one of them gets to you either one and he orders you to stophoney you have to stop they wont be at their best if they decide shes up there dont assume youre safe he looked at her i wont he said wont be at their best one way to put it his father looking back at the two of them swore softly then a moment later for a different reason greg swore much more loudly and hammered the brakes ned looked back quickly but uncle dave wasnt tailgating he skidded the red car to a halt behind them ned leaned forward and looked out the front windshield oh god he said his aunt was already flipping open her cellphone speeddialing and then with more urgency than hed heard from her yet she snapped dave do not get out stay in your car he looked at her his father turned around no aunt kim said dave this is not for you stay there but by then ned had unlocked his own door slid it back and stepped into the road himself he was really really angry for an instant he wondered why it had been so important that his uncle stay in the car he wanted to ask but didnt have time it occurred to him that there were a lot of questions you might have and never learn the answers to he wasnt even sure why he was in the road himself with so much fury he heard his father shout his name from behind a long way behind it seemed he walked in front of the van hey you he yelled the boar blocking the road didnt move it didnt even look at him it was gazing past ned past the van off into the woods beside the road as if oblivious to his presence it really was massive the size of a small bear practically with short matted bristly hair more grey than white the tusks were curved and heavy there was mud on them and on the body caked and plastered to the hair the boar was dead centre in the road and there was no way around it get out of here ned shouted damn it youre the one who showed me where to go what are you doing the animal didnt move it didnt even seem to have heard him it was as if ned didnt exist for it as if ned was about to shout again but he didnt instead he took a deep breath then he released his screening when he did that the boar turned its head it looked straight at him the small bright eyes fixed on his ned swallowed im here he said not really knowing what he was saying i listened figured it out im going up let me go for a long moment it was very still on that country lane no sound from the cars behind ned no movement from the creature in front no movement they were stuck here blocked and ysabel might be up on the mountain and time mattered they needed to move feeling a hard white surge of anger ned brought his two hands up palms together extended he levelled them at the dirt road beside the animal he shivered a flash of light exploded from him and struck sparks from the ground spraying dust and gravel forward the boar looked at him another moment then it turned unhurried undisturbed and trotted through the ditch and the underbrush and into the trees sweet lord ned heard greg say behind him what is going on ned hustled back into the van he pushed his door shut drive he said fast greg i have a feeling it just let them know where i am maybe more than that he checked within for the presence of the two men found nothing he put his screening back on why would it do that his father said jesus ned and how did you i dont know questions no answers but i have to beat them there lets go does it serve them edward marriner asked there were deep parallel lines creasing his forehead not that creature aunt kim said then what dont know she replied go greg greg shifted into gear hit the gas he ran the stop sign at the bottom taking the corner hard to the left at the main crossroad he turned left again looking back ned saw uncle dave signal and turn the other way going just as fast ned pushed off his track shoes and undid his belt wriggling out of his jeans aunt kim handed him the sweats and he worked his way into them he put his shoes on again and laced them took a swig of water from his bottle he should stretch he knew but it wasnt going to happen he took off the mcgill sweatshirt and kates white shirt he pulled on his grateful dead tshirt maybe not the very best logo for today he thought he stuffed the hoodie into his pack vera had said it would be cold on the mountaintop where he was headed with the sun going down greg spotted the brown sign he slowed at a slight curve and then they saw cars in a lot beside the highway do it fast ned said tersely just slow down im going to jump out you keep going he was having trouble talking he was pretty sure he was about to be sick again wanted to get out of the van before that happenedand his father or his aunt stopped him from going advil rowan leaves a supernatural screening his aunts bracelet not a lot of good any of them or all of them together the world was tinged towards red again here by mont saintevictoire where two hundred thousand people had been slaughtered once upon a known time he took a breath and told himself it was not as bad as before that there probably was some benefit from the combination of things he was using enough to let him function he hoped he put his sunglasses on ned you okay aunt kim asked yeah he lied his father looked back at him edward marriners face was drawn and fearful neds heart hurt to see it im fine he lied again i can do this i have my phone cellphones solution to the problems of the world go greg said angling the van onto the shoulder just behind a parked citroën he pushed the doorlock button ned shoved his door back and jumped out with his pack shoved the door shut and scooted among the parked cars keeping low he had no idea why he was doing this as if someone might actually be spying on him here it felt ridiculous but on the other hand after that encounter with the boar he realizedmore than everthat he hadnt a clue how to deal with any of this he took a fast look at the big signboard showing the various mountain trails noted the symbol that marked the way to the cross at the summit and then he started running one thing he could do a thing he was good at he was on the crosscountry team he was keeping a training log here he could go fast for a long time assuming he didnt throw up from the pain behind his eyes its manageable he told himself run through it shes up there and theres no one else who can do this not that this meant that he could do it the trail began at a smooth slant upwards gravelled wide people were coming down some dressed for a picnic with packs and baskets others wearing serious hiking gear carrying sticks he saw some kids they looked pretty tired he glanced up a long way to the summit with its cross the chapel would be just below that and left he couldnt see it yet he settled in as best he could to his pace it was hard because he hadnt warmed up at all and because he felt dreadful the smell was the worst it was everywhere more than the pain or the sickly red hue the world had taken on david letterman should do this one he thought top ten reasons not to climb mont saintevictoire through everything there was fear a sense of urgency that kept pushing him to go faster he checked his watch it was supposed to be a twohour walkandclimb he was going to cut that in half or better or break himself trying unlucky thought pain lanced like a knitting needle behind his right eye ned cried out couldnt help it he staggered almost fell he twisted to the right off the wide path out of sight and was violently sick in the bushes behind a boulder and then again it felt as if his stomach were trying to force itself inside out he was on his knees leaning against the roughness of the big rock he forced himself to breathe slowly his forehead was clammy hed broken out in a sweat he was shivering another slow breath and with it through pain and nausea ned felt anger again hard as a weapon it was weird a little frightening how much rage he was feeling he shook his head in grim denial though there was no one to see no one to be denying uhuh he said aloud to the mountain and the sky no way not going to happen he wasnt leaving this time he wasnt going to call and have greg drive him back to take a shower and lie down and have everyone in the villa tell him at least hed tried hed done all he could it wasnt all he could he wouldnt let it be you could do more when it mattered enough you did more there were stories of mothers lifting cars off kids trapped under them not going to happen he said again he wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of one hand she was up there he knew it as surely as hed known anything and there was only him here ned marriner not his auntwhatever shed done once she couldnt do it now neither could his uncle his mom could treat refugees in the sudan but she couldnt get up this mountain in time or do anything at the top if she did ned was the one linked to all this seeing the blood smelling the memory of bloodshed you didnt ask for the roles you were given in life not always anyhow he realized that he was clenching his jaw he made himself relax you couldnt run that way and he had running to do he swung his pack off fished his ipod out and put the buds in his ears he dialed up coldplay maybe rock would do what bracelets and rowan leaves couldnt he shouldered the pack and stepped onto the path again he must have looked pretty alarming because two peoplea husband and wife it looked likestopped suddenly on their way down and stared at him with concern ned straightened managed a wan smile popped off his buds you are all right you should not be going up now the woman said in french with a german accent its fine ned said wiping at his mouth bit of a bug ive had worse i do this run all the time training he was surprised at how good hed become at lying it will be dark the man said shaking his head and the climb is harder above i know it said ned thanks though he put the earbuds back in turned up the volume he ran around a curve he reached back for his water bottle in the side pocket of the pack and rinsed his mouth then splashed some on his face without slowing down he spat into the bushes his head was still pounding not going to volunteer for an advil commercial he thought amused himself with that just a little he was in too much pain for more he wondered about the screening he was doingwhen the draining effect phelan and his aunt had warned about would kick in he had no idea he ran twisting through and past weekend climbers making their tired way down the mountain at days end above him way above he could see the big cross at the summit he was going there then left down a ridge up another down to the right or so veracook had said one woman looked at her watch as he approached and gave him an admonishing sideways shake of her finger that gesture the french loved his mother he thought should take that one up he knew it was late in the day he knew it was going to be windy and get darkthis wasnt being done for the joy of it maybe he should have printed leaflets to hand out to all the fingerwaggers he ran after almost thirty minutes on the steady upward slant he realized two things one was that he was feeling better he didnt have that overwhelming sense of the world rotting all around him hed hoped that getting above the level of the battlefield would help and it seemed to be doing that he felt like offering a prayer his head hurt the world was redtinted even behind sunglasses but he didnt feel any more as if he was going to empty his guts with pain in response to putrefaction the other thing less encouraging by a lot was that there was someone behind himand it was cadell the celt was just suddenly there when ned did one of his quick inward checks for an aura nothing nothing nothingthen there he was golden inside neds mind as in life and coming up the mountain they wont be at their best his aunt had said meaning something a lot worse than that she had ordered ned to stop if they came up to him either of them and told him to leave hed known she was right about that and he knew it now they might mean him no harm but that was only if he didnt get in their way they were alive in the world to do one thing only find her two hundred thousand people and more had died in a single battle between these two what was a canadian kid against that his heart was pounding for all the reasons that had to do with running as fast as he could up a mountain fighting pain and nausea and pursued by someone who had so many lifetimes of white and burning need to get to the chasm first it had been the boar that had called them he was certain of it thats how cadell was here he had no idea why the animal had done it you sure got a lot of questions in the world without exactly getting the same number of answers in fact there was a huge gap between the two numbers it made him angry again he needed that to fuel him drive him on push back fear he looked up again there was a wooden sign ahead symbols on it the sloped path gave out here to terraced switchbacked ridges vera had told him this it got harder angling back and forth because it was steeper now he saw people still coming down left and right left and right along the switchbacks it was going to be slower narrower hard to run through them he took the first cut to the right got out his water bottle again to drink his phone rang he fished in his pocket saw who it was on the readout dad he said quickly im okay im running cant talk he flipped the phone shut he was supposed to tell them cadell was behind him now was it a tough guess what theyd say it was pretty simple really way ned saw it if the big man didnt catch him he couldnt stop him or do anything to him right so you didnt let him catch you it didnt always have to be complicated he thought of letting his screening go but he didnt know what might hit himflatten himif he did how much the screen was protecting him from the mountain he couldnt afford to lose any time now and there was the other man too ned didnt for a second imagine phelan wasnt up here somewhere probably screened like ned cadell was announcing himself trying to frighten ned maybe warn him off phelan was justcoming could scare you more that thought it was still bright up here the sun setting to his right the wind picking up but blocked a little because he wasnt completely above the trees yet he looked back over his shoulder there was a lake or reservoir of some kind below glinting in the light and another one farther beyond he was high enough to see a long way the view was beautiful and he wasnt even halfway up there had been a fire on these slopes ned saw maybe more than one the mountain was more bare than it looked in those paintings cézanne had done time changed things even mountains even a hundred years could make changesor however long it was since cézanne painted this peak was that a long time or a blink of time he thought he knew what the two men and ysabel would say but he also remembered his mother and aunt on the path from the tower last night and it occurred to him that they might think of twentyfive years as heartbreakingly long he didnt have answers he amped up his music a little more and he ran zigzagging up the mountain as the day waned towards an ending after twenty minutes of laboured driving work back and forth along the terraced slope twisting his way through the last of the days descending climbers he smashed hard into the inner screening wall hed been warned about too soon he thought but even as the thought came his legs gave out and ned felt himself falling he didnt slide this was still more a steep hike than a climb but he lay in the middle of the narrow switchback exhausted drained and it felt for a long moment like he wasnt going to be able to get up and that wouldnt do with an effort he pulled his earbuds out and rolled to one elbow his small running pack felt massive a burden on his back he worked to shrug himself out of it there was a taste of dust in his mouth better than blood he thought then with apprehension coiling tightly within him he released the screen because there was nothing else he could do he cried out couldnt help it the immediate pain in his head was brutal a vise not knitting needles or a hammer hed been right not that it did him any good nowthe screening had been keeping at bay the full impact of where he was eyes tightly closed gasping for thin shallow breaths aware that there were tears on his face ned realized he was going to have to phone down after all he wasnt even sure he could stay conscious till someone got here to him he opened his eyes forced himself to look up from where he lay and facing east he saw the chapel below the summits great cross it wasnt even far hed gotten pretty damned close theyd have to give him credit for that wouldnt they there was nobody else up here no one had heard his cry every sane person had passed him already going down the long slope towards drinks and a shower sunset and dinner out of the wind that was blowing here ned felt something else then a pulse like a probe in his head he made himself moving very slowly sit up everything took so much appalling effort hurt so much he looked within himself cadells aura was still there and the pulse the signal was coming from him of course ned thought youre clueless marriner a loon hed been thinking of cadell as chasing him but hed been screened the celt hadnt been able to see ned any more than ned had spotted him down there cadell was just powering his way towards the summit not knowing if ned was ahead or behind or anywhere at all now though he realized it and he was making sure ned knew he was coming i should be afraid ned thought he actually felt too weak for fear as if all he wanted to do all he could do was sit here among dust and stones and scrubby little bushes and let the sun go down on these slopes and on him well he could make a phone call first someone would come his aunt was in the callback his dad was on autodial and so was greg well not really in fact melanie had done that very funny nineor tendigit autodial for greg on neds phone then ned had rigged their phones with ringtones in the middle of the night he could almost smile remembering when hed called her the next morning at the cathedral you will be made to suffer melanie had said but shed been laughing if they were understanding anything about this properly she was somehow up above him right now not that far he thought about her laughing that morning and something in him altered with the memory anger ned thought could drive you hard it could ruin you or make you like any other really strong feeling he guessed right now it pulled him to his feet he realized straightening carefully that he could handle this pain too it had been the contrast the shock of it when the screen went down that had flattened him but he was really high now far above the plain where the battle had been and he could hold it together for a bit longer the weakness in his legs was something else one more thing like he really really needed more he could almost hear his friend larry saying that the guys laughing cadell was coming and he was aware now that ned was ahead of him with an effort that cost him ned shouldered his pack again since when were these things so heavy his legs felt rubbery the way they could near the end of a crosscountry race but hed done those races for three years now he knew this feeling it was new and it wasnt you could build on what you had experienced and hed smashed into walls running before thats what it was all about the track coach had always told them you find where your wall is and you train to push it back but when you hit ityou go through if you can do that youre a runner ned could hear that voice too in his mind ned went through he was almost comically slow walking not running in places herehe was right below the chapel nowthere were loose rocks on the path that could send you tumbling he looked back and this time he saw someone coming already on the switchback section steady and strong and fast ned felt like crying which was really not going to help he looked ahead there were two zigzags left or he could climb he wasnt sure he had the strength for that but he was pretty certain he didnt have the time not to he clenched his jawan expression one or two people would have recognizedand left the path he bent to the slanting rock face using his hands now it wasnt alpine climbing or anything like that any normal time any normal condition he could have propelled himself up this slope easily he could have raced guys up here now two or three times he was sure he was going to fall his hands were sweaty and there was sweat in his eyes he took off the sunglasses they were sliding down his nose the light wasnt as strong now the sun low striking the mountain washing it in lateday colours he still saw too much red but not as badly as before this high up really high in fact he pushed himself feet and hands digging and pulling gasping with the effort it cost him his tshirt was plastered to his body his head hurt it was pulsing his legs felt as if he were wearing weights was this he thought what getting old was like when your body wouldnt do things you knew it had been able to do another essay topic idiot thought youre a loon he said aloud and made himself laugh the sound sudden and startling in that lonely windy place he took strength from it anger wasnt the only thing you could use and falling apart or not he was up he pushed with his right foot at a rock it slipped away tumbling down the slope but his hands were on the top now and he scrambled to the last plateau he was directly in front of the chapel he bent over catching his breath trying to control his trembling he was so weak there was a courtyard he saw through an arched opening a well a low stone wall on the far side overlooking the southern slopes the sea would be beyond some distance off but not all that far he glanced back again cadell was clearly visible goldenhaired cutting straight up across all the switchbacks hand over hand through scrub and bush disdaining the path he wouldnt need paths ned thought he wanted to hate this manand the other oneand knew he was never going to be able to do that he could beat them though it was easier here on the level ground just below the last steep ridge to the summit and cross he didnt have to go up there if veracook was rightand it occurred to him that if she wasnt he had done all this to no purpose at allhe had to head east not up he looked ahead and saw as shed said he would the mountain falling away to the south in a swooping sheet of stone just beyond the cross the view was spectacular in the light of the westering sun fast clouds overhead in the wind but that wasnt his route the garagai was farther along shed said up one more slope the one right in front of him and then down and right along the next rock face he looked back one more time cadell was moving ridiculously fast he saw the man lift his head and shout something he couldnt hear the wind was too strong it could blow you off the mountain ned thought if you were like a little kid or careless he dropped his pack against the stone wall of the chapel and pushed himself into a run a shambling dragging motion an embarrassment a joke and he couldnt even keep it going the slope of this ridge was upwards again and he was too drained too spent the wind from the north on his left kept pushing him towards the long slide south he did slip once banging his knee he thought he heard a shout behind him he didnt look back fighting for breath fighting his body he scrambled up the last ridge he had to go right here south and down he looked that way steep hed need to be careful he saw nothing but vera had said you couldnt that the cave was hidden until you were right on it the green land far below was the battlefield he knew the plain below the mountain all those dead all those years ago the man behind him had been there and the woman ahead if she really was here ned started down too fast he slipped and skidded almost immediately he steadied himself but was still moving too quickly he stumbled again leaning way backwards so as not to tumble and roll on the face of the mountain he banged an elbow and swore as he scrabbled on the seat of his pants dislodging pebbles he grabbed for a rock felt his palm tear and scrape but he stopped himself he saw the cave right beside him the gemstone of his aunts bracelet was bright on his wrist he didnt know what that was about when it had started he didnt have time to think about it he shifted along the rock face and saw that there was a last descenta short oneinto the cave there was light coming through it from another side south vera had said there were two openings and that the chasm was below it through the other entrance he was here ned went in turning his face to the rocks going hand and foot again he slid the last bit touched bottom turned and looked around he was still trembling his legs mostly his mouth was dry hed left the water bottle with his pack he was in a darkened space not too large sheltered from the wind level underfoot a rock roof disappeared into shadow above he didnt know what hed expected to see but he didnt see anything he turned to look south and his jaw dropped at the wonder of it the quiet beauty spread out through that wider opening as if it were a window onto glory the fields below a glinting line of river the land rising a very little and falling and then rising again across the river towards mountains in the distance shining in the late clear light and then the far blue of the sea he walked over and looked down another drop a trickier one because the shelf below was steep more a slope than a plateau really hed been warned it was dangerous im not going to fall off a mountain hed told his father he could fall off down there easily but on that slanting shelf to his right ned saw a cluster of dark green bushes against the sheer rock face they framed an emptiness a black a hole in the world the chasm was here he had arrived for what it was worth he was very much afraid he took a breath lifted his dirty hands and spat on them the way athletes did there was blood on one of them from grabbing at stone as he slid he wiped it on his sweats here goes nuthin he said little kids said things like that he was trying to be funny for himself you do not have to go down he heard behind him i am here chapter xix she came from the back of the cave from shadow and dream to where the light slanted through the wide window of that southern opening reaching her ned hadnt thought hed ever see her again her presence became a different kind of blow to the heart he wanted to kneel explain apologize he didnt know what to do he was here he had done it and he was empty of thought or any sense of how to act she walked towards him the auburn hair bright as the lateday sunlight touched her she was as tall as he was she stopped regarding him and smiled not unkindly it is difficult to stay down there she said there is too much wind it feels as if the mountain wants to throw you offor send you into the chasm he nodded jerkily he couldnt speak the sound of her voice undid him left him feeling bereft with the thought that he might be hearing it now and never again he thought of the sculpture in the cloister phelans offering showing her as half gone from the beginning even before time began its work eluding as she emerged he understood it now you saw ysabel as you stood before her heard that voice and you felt loss in the moment because you feared she might leave you because you knew she would she was gazing steadily at him appraising more curious than anything else her eyes were blue or green it was difficult to tell there were shadows behind her and above there was no malice no anger here though he couldnt see warmth either but why should he have expected that what could he possibly have expected how are you here she said that at least he should have been ready for but it was difficult to form thoughts that made sense stammering he said youyou said sacrifice at entremont not just killing amusement the eyebrows arched she was barefoot on the cold stone he saw wearing a long white cotton skirt and a blue blouse over it her hair was down along her back framing her face i did she agreed still studying him you were there he nodded unwise you might have died had they known it he nodded phelan had known it he didnt say that there are many places of sacrifice she said theyd figured that out too he said my mother got the sacrifice part when we told her anda boar gave me a clue he didnt tell about melanie the story shed told him of the battle below the sacrifice of the chieftains here he was going to need to speak of melanie he had no idea how her expression changed your mother gave you that she was pointing at the bracelet the stone was bright he shook his head my aunt her sister he hesitated it wasnt his but would you like it she smiled pleased but shook her head looking at him a long still moment quiet in the cave the wind blowing outside the sun going down the living world so far from where they were then ysabel smiled again but differently now i see she said and the tone had altered as well changes in her voice and face like ripples in water ned wasnt surehe wasnt sure of anythingbut he thought he heard sadness and maybe something else what is there to see she didnt answer she turned awayhe felt it as a woundthen she lifted a hand stilling him he heard it too and was looking towards the entrance through which hed come himself when cadell jumped down and in he landed noted neds presence then he turned to ysabel he didnt speak and the woman said nothing either absorbing accepting what was inescapable in his face there was nothing hidden in him nothing held back watching the two of them ned felt like the intruder he was excluded inappropriate trivial if he was right if he understood this at all cadell had died more than two thousand years ago in the chasm below this cave you have a wound she said speaking first a knife it is inconsequential indeed what would be of consequence ned remembered that ironic tone from beltaine after the fires and the bull he realized his hands were shaking again cadells deep voice carried a note that could only be called joy he said coming here to find the roman before me that would shatter this heart as much as would the sky falling at the end of days ah she said the poet returns he never left you you know that love i know very little she said in that voice that made a lie of the words you know that i am here and before your three nights have turned i remember this place but of course you do said another voice from behind ned and below they all wheeled but even as he did ned saw ysabels face and he realized she was unsurprised they watched as phelan pulled himself up from the slanting plateau below the opening to the south he stood unhurried brushing dust from his knees and the torn jacket using his right hand only then he in turn looked at the woman a wound said ysabel inconsequential ned saw the bald head the scar the grey cool eyes and thenwith surprisea smile you heard that she was smiling too it is my proof of being present love i need to have heard that or you might not believe me you would lie to me he shook his head never in any life but you have disbelieved before with cause phelan looked at her then shook his head again with a right to do so but not with cause the brief smile had gone there was hunger in his face and longing so fierce they were a kind of light you were below said cadell flatly a harder climb yes but i was south and had to come that way it doesnt matter you were not here phelan shrugged no tell me what did she ask the boy about his bracelet ned felt the weight of three gazes upon him he wanted to be invisible absent gone then he heard her laughter i see you will say that you did hear and so came to me first phelan was looking at the other man his eyes cold as wilderness waiting the light in his face was gone there was no reply from the celt phelan said precisely she asked him if his mother gave the bracelet to him shall i tell now his reply that you also did not hear wolf on a mountain peak cadells blue gaze returning was as hard though unyielding it never had yielded ned knew it makes no matter how and where you climbed or what you heard below you were not here to find her first a silence in that high place it felt like the last silence of the world ned marriner thought ysabel ended it ended more than stillness he was not it is true she murmured but neither were you my golden one alas that i am unloved but neither were you and as she stopped as that voice fell away the three of them turned to ned again it might have been the hardest thing hed yet done to stand straight not draw back face them breathing hard but controlling it he looked from one man to the other and ended with ysabel the long travel of her gaze how far it seemed to go to reach him he is not part of this cadell said untrue she said still softly did he not lead you here will you say he did not that you found me yourself the boar guided him phelan said the druids no fire or ice now a sudden intense gravity that was in its own way more frightening as if the stakes with what shed said had become too high for fury or flame it isnt the druids boar said cadell brys served it not the other way around i didnt know that phelan said i thought i know what you thought the beast is older than any of us phelans thin smile even us cadell nodded the light from the south caught his golden hair the woman remained silent letting them speak across her to each other and so it was the boarcaused this cadell shook his head it made this possible at best the boy could have died at entremont in alyscamps by the round tower i could have killed him in glanum where i killed you once his turn to smile lips closed you could have killed him many times is it not so phelan nodded i suppose i saw no reason to have him die i helped them get away when the needfires were lit perhaps a mistake the deep voice the other man shrugged i have made others he looked at ysabel and then at ned again his brow furrowed now cadell said we could have been here ahead of him i saw him fall twice the boar made this harder for him showing us where he was going and your meaning is cadells teeth flashed this time my thinking is too hard for you really you said the boar caused this it isnt so and still the woman did not speak she stood as if barely attending to them withdrawing even as she remained ned thought of the sculpture again sunlit in the sheltered cloister it was cold here now so far above the world phelan said there is another way to see it if you are rightthe animal bringing us both yes i also have that thought i killed you once here did i not with some others you know you did they were lost in the chasm not you they were lost cadell repeated quietly phelans wintry smile you cling to that among so many deaths it is more than dying there not for you with me alive to hold you to returning you would have known it even as you went down they didnt they were lost there yes not you so i owe you my life the bite of irony they actually smiled at each other in that moment ned would remember that as you said phelan murmured we could have arrived ahead of him as i said they both looked at ned again he said in a small voice im sorry i think cadell laughed aloud no you arent said phelan youve been refusing to leave this from the outset a small maybe a last flare within you dont know me well enough to say what i feel ned said a moment and then phelanstranger greek romannodded you are right forgive me it is entirely possible to need or want something and be sorry it is so he hesitated again it appears i did more than i intended when i brought you into this i could not say even now what made me do it what i saw no i can said ysabel breaking her stillness returning to them then she added with sudden passion look at him the two men did so again ned closed his eyes this time his mind racing lost he opened them and saw in both men at the same moment a dawning as of lightand then a setting of the sun neither spoke for a long time cadell made one quick outward gesture with his good hand that ned didnt understand then he pushed fingers through his long hair he drew a deep breath lifted the hand and let it fall again he turned to phelan you truly didnt know he said to the other man when you drew him in phelan hadnt moved or taken his gaze from ned he still didnt i knew something i said that not this how would i know this know what ned wanted to scream he was afraid to speak cadell quietly said we might have realized when we saw the mother and her sister phelan nodded i suppose he was whitefaced ned saw shaken to the core trying to deal with it cadell pushed a hand through his hair again he turned to ysabel she was standing very straight now extremely still gathered to herself a beauty near to stone it might seem but not truly so the big man looked at ned for a moment and then back to her he said wonderingly the deep voice soft the mother has your hair even near enough at which point finally very late overwhelmed as if to a cliffs edge of stupefaction feeling that waves were crashing there against his mind ned marriner understood who are you the repeated question over and again the one hed hated having no answer now he did ysabel had given it to the three of them the world rocked and spun unstable and impossible ned made a small helpless sound he couldnt stop himself this was too vast it meant too many things too many to get your head around he saw phelan looking at her the wide thin mouth quirked sideways when he whispered and then whose ned stopped breathing she smiled grave and regal not capricious or teasing now she shook her head slowly some things are not best told even in love perhaps especially in love is it not so more questions than answers in the world ned thought phelan lowered his head her smile changed a little you knew i would say that he looked up i never know what you will say never faint hint of irony but a sense she was reaching a long way for it almost never he amended i did not expect this none of this not the searching you decreed forbidding battle not the boy beingwhat you say he is love i am lost and i cadell said the other two turned to him you altered the story he led us here the boar guided him and us this means this means ysabel turned to ned the clear distant gaze the eyes were blue not green he saw and something was unmistakable now you would have to be blind or truly a child not to see it the sadness that had come she looked steadily at him and said more softly than any words yet spoken what must i answer him blood of my blood he didnt reply what could he possibly say but he saw nowhe did seean answer to the one question about his being here and his aunt and his mother and their mother and hers fathers or mothers back to a distant presence of light down a long tunnel from the past where the woman before him waited in a far faint brightness she turned from him not waiting for an answer looked to one man and then the other you know what it means she said you know what i said beside the animal that died to draw me into the world again neither of you found me first you know what follows the chasm is here it is still here what will follow you should not see phelan had said that to him at entremont but ned had stayed and seen and led them here to this you never said there was a child cadell murmured and ysabel quietly echoed him i never said there was a child only the one phelans eyes never left her now only the one ever one of you killed the other and then died himself too soon leaving me alone but not entirely so that time i was carrying a gift you do know what it will mean love if we go down together there both of us cadell the deep voice soft but unafraid making certain she inclined her head gravely we all know what it will mean but neither of you found me and the boy is in the story she had never seemed so much a queen as she did then ned thought staring at her the two men turnedhe would remember this tooto look at each other fire and ice subsumed in something he wasnt smart enoughhadnt lived nearly long enoughto name phelan turned back to her he nodded his head slowly i believe i see an ending love he hesitated past due must we say ysabel shook her head suddenly fierce in denial i will not say that i would never say that she turned to the bigger man one and then the other one and then the other ned wanted to back away against the cave wall feared to draw attention by moving she said to cadell do you still believe our souls find another home i always have though perhaps not all of us we have had a different arc we three i will not presume as to my soul not from that chasm you will search for me wherever i am if there is a way ned was crying now he did back up until he bumped into the cold stone wall by the opening to the south he could feel the wind here cadell said in that voice men and women might follow into war and across mountain ranges and through forests and into dark wherever you are until the sun dies and the last wind blows through the worlds need you ask me even now she shook her head again and ned heard her say no i didnt need to ask did i my shining one anwyll beloved cadell stood another moment looking at her memorizing her ned wanted to say it was and thennot reaching out not touching herhe said it is time to go then i believe he turned and came this way towards the opening at the edge of the drop he paused beside ned and laid a hand upon his shoulder no words nor for the other man though he did turn and they exchanged a glance grey eyes and blue ned weeping in silence felt as if he could hear his blood passing through the chambers of his heart blood of my blood cadell went down then jumping over the edge to the steeply sloped plateau ned saw him in the late suns shining the very last of the days light as he walked over to the low dark green bushes that surrounded the chasm that was a place of sacrifice said in the tales to be bottomless he did pause there but not in anything like fear nothing of that at all for when he looked up and back past the two men to the woman he was smiling again golden and at ease and that is how ned marriner last saw him through tears that would not stop when he took a final step and went over to his ending without a sound ned looked at emptiness where a man had been he turned his face away he saw a pair of birds wheeling to the south across the mountains side the sky was not falling though this was a time and place where you could imagine it doing so he turned back to phelan that one stood another moment looking down at the chasm then he came forward towards the drop to the plateau he passed close as cadell had he didnt touch ned though instead he slipped out of his grey leather jacket and laid it lightly on neds shoulders it will be cold when the sun goes down he said there is a tear im afraid in one shoulder perhaps it can be repaired ned couldnt speak his throat was aching and his heart tears made it difficult to see phelan looked at him another moment as if he would say something else but he didnt he went over the edge lightly down as always landing easily and he went to the chasms brink as the other man had done ned heard ysabel behind him he didnt turn he was afraid to look at her the man below them did though he did look anwyll ned heard her say again the man so addressed smiled then standing on a mountain so far from the world into which he had been born claimed there by sunlight which had not changed in all the years he looked past ned to where she would be he spoke her name every breath he said to her at the end every day each and every time then he stepped over the rim and down into the dark after a few moments motionless against the cave wall ned had to sit down he lowered his legs over the edge of the drop looking out on the end of day and at the slanting ledge where no one stood any more he hadnt known it was possible to feel this much sorrow so hard and heavy an awareness of time until the sun dies the sun was going down would rise in the morningpeople had to make themselves believe that it would each time nightfall came he remembered kate wenger only last night talking of how sunset had never been a moment of beauty or peace in the past men and women fearing that the dark might come and not end he had stopped crying he was drained of tears he wiped at his cheeks felt the bite of wind swirling two more birds or the same ones wheeled down and east and out of sight again phelans jacket lay across his shoulders he looked over at the chasm half hidden by bushes he wished he knew a prayer to speak or even think he heard a sound behind him but didnt turn he was afraid too achingly aware of what role hed played here he didnt think he could look at what would be in her face his mother cadell had said had her hair her greatgrandmother was said to have had the second sight there were family stories further back and his aunt ned sighed it seemed to come from so deep inside it felt bottomless he had been in this after all it was his family and phelan seemed to have been aware of somethingwithout knowing what from that beginning in the cathedral first day ysabel stepped nearer more a presence than a sound he was painfully conscious of her the two of them alone now she would be looking down and remembering two thousand six hundred years how did you come to terms with something ending after so long who had ever had to deal with that because it was over ned knew it as keenly as the three of them had they had collided with a wallwith himand the intricate spinning had come to a close on this mountain he shook his head so many ways it might have been otherwise brys had tried to kill him in the cemetery he could have been too sick to climb when he got here either of the two men might have been quicker than ned both had said these things it was not preordained what had just happened not compelled did that mean he had killed them or set them free did the choice of words make a difference did words matter at all here oh god ned you did it were the words he heard they mattered they mattered so much they powered him to his feet whirling around melanie stood in front of him with her black hair and the green streak in it and a smile so wide through tears it seemed it could light the shadows of that cave i dont believe it he said itsheyoure back and ysabel was gone he had been right then to see her as going away even as she stood there joy now fierce and searingly bright mixed with something that might never leave him someone returned was rescued someone was gone was this the way it always was she said you brought me back ive never been so glad to see someone in my life is that so she said and he heard a note of irony that echoed someone else not melanie he couldnt speak he was stunned buffeted she stepped close and put her hands behind his head lacing her fingers there and she kissed him standing on the edge of the plateau in the wind she didnt actually rush it there was a scent to her he couldnt remember from before it was dizzying she stepped back looked at him her eyes were unnaturally bright maybe with the tears i probably shouldnt be doing that he was still having some trouble breathing only reason i came to france he managed she laughed kissed him again lightly this time it felt impossibly as if it was melanie doing that but also not quite melanie or maybe it wasnt impossible not after what had happened here he suddenly remembered kate walking up to entremont the change in her with beltaine coming on thank you melanie said still very close well yeah he said lightheaded from the feel of her and her scent and the strangeness of his thoughts then something else registered really belatedly he stepped to one side looking more closely at her he felt himself beginning to grin despite everything oh lord he said melanie looked suddenly awkward uncertain more like herself what is it he started to laugh couldnt help himself melanie jeez you are at least three inches taller look at yourself what that cant beand i cant look at myself then trust me come back stand close she did it was as hed said at least three inches she came up to his nose now and no way shed been even close to that before holymoly ned i grew sure looks like it no one else hed ever known said holymoly can that happen he was thinking about his aunt her hair turning white all at once what his mother had refused to believe for twentyfive years i guess it can was all he said we dont know a whole lot about any of this i grew she said again in wonder youre going to be dangerous he said she flashed a smile that evoked someone else who was gone you have no idea ned marriner someone returned someone went away forever he hesitated melanie were you aware of anything when you were the smile faded she looked through the opening to the south plateau and plain river more mountains the sea just at the beginning she said quietly and even then it was difficult whenwhen i started changing i could feel it happening but i couldnt do anything about it i couldnt stop walking i could see out through her eyes at first and hear things but it got hard like pushing a weight up a big boulder with my head my shoulders trying to look out from beneath and then it started to be too heavy and after a while i couldnt she was still gazing out so you dont know what happened here just now youll tell me what i know butdid you make her change things have them look for her and pick this place she had started to cry again she nodded i did do that i could doi knew from inside her what was supposed to happen and that i was gone if one of them killed the other and claimed her so i pushed the only idea i had which was trying to get her to come here instead and hope someone would remember it she looked at him you actually ned i didnt think anyone else could you understood what might happen if they all came here i knew what she knew she wiped at her cheeks ned i was her and still me a little then it got too hard and i could only wait underneath you knew i was there at entremont a flash of the old melanie in her eyes well thats a dumb question what was i doing there in the first place he felt stupid hed called her right sorry her expression changed dont ever say sorry to me ned not after this he tried to make it a joke thats a risky thing to tell a guy she shook her head not this time it isnt his turn to look away out over so much darkening beauty we should get down this isnt a normal place neither are we said melanie normal are we he hesitated i think we mostly are he said we will be can you walk like that she looked at her bare feet not down a mountain ned and itll be dark he thought theres a chapel i saw just below the peak not far we may not be able to get inside but theres a courtyard some shelter i can call down from there autodial greg it was melanie again taller but this was her he smiled happiness was possible it was almost here very funny he said another thought greg was pretty amazing you know youll have to tell me youre right though we should go im cold ysabel waspretty tough i guess ysabel had been many things he thought he took off the leather jacket and gave it to her whered you get this she said slipping her arms into the sleeves it was big on her she looked like an urchin in it ill tell you that too we go they left through the eastern opening the way ned had come in melanie winced a couple of times barefoot on stones ned stopped just outside and looked back standing where hed skidded to a stop sliding down he could see the rock hed grabbed it was dark inside the cave now towards the back the light didnt reach that far there was nothing really that you could see melanie was looking at him wearing phelans jacket youve changed too you know she said three inches taller no you have ned he nodded come on its just up here then to the left when they topped the ridge and looked west towards the cross and chapel standing utterly alone on the mountain the sun was ahead of them very low lighting clouds the sunset was glorious a gift they lived in an age ned marriner thought when it was possible to think that way his pack was where hed left it against the stone wall he pulled on his sweatshirt it was bitingly cold now in the evening wind the chapel was locked so was the other long low room off the courtyard with a padlock the courtyard itself offered some protection from the swirling gusts ill give you my socks he said or youre going to freeze melanie nodded never thought id be happy about that kind of offer shed zipped the jacket all the way up to her nose but that wouldnt help enough if she was barefoot here you have a pocket knife she asked yeah she held out a hand he dug into his pack and handed her his swiss army blade then sat on a stone bench against the building and began pulling off his running shoes to give her the socks they arent the height of fashion he began when he had them off and the shoes back on but theyll he stopped she was standing at the entrance to the flatroofed building beside the chapel and the door was open howd you do that he said walking over i have skills you dont yet know about ned marriner that note in her voice it was there again he might have changed but he sure wasnt the only one my dad picked a lock couple of days ago like that a grin i taught him how what she looked really happy he saw me do it once when we were shooting in peru and got jealous he made me show him how you he said are a criminal mastermind heres the socks she took them and went inside he got his pack and followed there was no electricity up here and the long narrow room was dark ned threw open the shutters to the courtyard while melanie put on his socks he saw a fireplace with wood stacked beside it the place had probably been a dormitory or dining room for the chapel once now it looked like an overnight place for hikers think theyll arrest us if we start a fire i could handle that melanie said if they bring shoes that reminded him he flipped open his phone and dialed his father one ring ned he felt himself smiling despite exhaustion a surge of emotion before he spoke fighting it he said yeah its me dad i got her what got her back were both fine oh dear god he heard his father say and then he became aware that his dad was crying he heard him relay the words then ned nedheres your mother honey he heard youre really okay im great mom we both are its going to be a really long story can you get down not now mom its almost dark and melanie has no shoes i think you guys have to come get us in the morning with stuff for her where are you now in this building beside the chapel we got in theres a fireplace its fine were cool overnight can you meet us here first thing of course we can ned put melanie on your father wants to talk to her ill bet he was still smiling as he handed her the phone boss there was a silence melanie brushed at her eyes thank you sir she said quietly thanks all of you im all right i really am youll see i do need some things if you can put dr marriner on she walked towards a window ned went outside again into the courtyard he crossed to the low southern wall past the well he looked out on the darkened land lights were coming on below in houses farms country restaurants he saw headlights on the roads he saw what had to be the highway eastwest the riviera resorts were only an hour from here bars and cafés and yachts along the coast of the sea glittering with light he imagined a ship sailing here from greece a really long time ago passing dark forbidding forests and mountain ranges that hid whatever was inland from view leaving it shrouded and mysterious he imagined them finding a harbour west of here those strangers from far away then their first encounter with a tribe wondering if what theyd come all this way to find was death far from home or something else he imagined those native warriors with their druids and rituals and forest gods and goddesses of still pools pictured them coming through the woods to see these strangers wondering what they were what they had brought here with them his heart was full sorrow and joy taking all it could hold right to the brim he looked at the lights below with the sun gone now he saw the moon to his left towards where the resorts would be playgrounds of the world he knew he knew another world now had touched it would walk in both in a way for the rest of his life he thought of the boar hands flat on the low stone wall in the wind he thought of ysabel as the night drifted down come on he heard from behind him i found matches weve got a fire did you bring anything someone could call food he turned back to melanie to the world veracook packed me some stuff god bless her melanie said in the doorway he walked over followed her in the fire was going nicely shed lit candles too there are blankets in those cupboards she said lots of them good well be okay melanie grinned at him sailor she said you might even be better than okay that predictably got his heart beating faster he cleared his throat as an image inescapable inserted itself in his awareness melanie my mothers there shell be coming up tomorrow and looking me in the eye good point and i work for your dad dont i i might have trouble facing them if we you he said you might have trouble you know my mother you think i can get away with pretending we played twenty questions animal vegetable mineral she laughed softly only if we play twenty questions not why i joined the navy melanies expression altered she looked at him a moment you know you really have changed well so have you i guess she smiled at him she looked older he thought but didnt say she lifted a hand and touched his cheek her eyes seemed darker so did her voice somehow ned i have a pretty good idea what you did today i remember what this place was like for you when we drove here andthis wont be the only night of our lives he cleared his throat again thats a pretty hot thing to say uhhuh i know your birthdays in july he nodded it was hard to speak again women could do this to you ill have to try hard to remember that melanie said now lets see what vera put in there for you she went over to his pack he stood where he was he could remember the feel of her lips in the cave and there was that scent he hadnt ever been aware of before um the fifteenth he said suddenly july fifteenth she was rummaging baguette pâté cheese apples veras a treasure she said then looked at him over her shoulder a smile i have the date in my pda meanwhile come by the fire lets eat and her voice deepened again im thinking of something animal oh god he said she laughed aloud outside the night deepened and gathered boars which fed at sunrise and at dusk came cautiously out of woods below owls lifted from trees to hunt moonlight found ancient towns and the ruins of towers triumphal arches and sacred pools graveyards and vineyards and lavender bushes one by one stars emerged in the dark blue dusk in a sky that had not yet fallen in the brightness of morning they were waiting outside by the wall they saw the others coming up along the switchbacks of the northern ridge theyd have had to start before sunrise ned thought in darkness to be here by now it was harder to feel sorrow in the morning he thought seeing his father lift his hat in one hand and wave it melanie stood up and waved back with both hands over her head you can allow yourself joy he thought and even pride he didnt feel ill any more he hadnt since hed entered the cave since finding ysabel theyd all come up he saw counting even greg and uncle dave who probably shouldnt be doing twohour climbs his mother and his aunt were walking beside each other red hair and white like a fairy tale it wasnt though this was his family and he had a different kind of tale for them he swallowed hard seeing the two of them like that bright against the green of the trees and the blue lakes in the distance below they came zigzagging with the trail he remembered late yesterday being pursued cutting across these last switchbacks up the rock face to get here they didnt have to do that he stood up beside melanie and waited for the others to reach them along the last inclination just before they did she looked at him and smiled it was more like four inches he decided he grinned back wonder if you could slamdunk now feels like she said then she started running in his socks and the white skirt and blue shirt ysabel had worn ned saw his father open his arms and hug her close as if she were a lost child returned greg and steve stopped beside them waiting their turn his mother and uncle and aunt kept coming towards ned he saw kate wenger hanging back suddenly shy yo mom he said you bring croissants his mother who was not much of a hugger didnt answer she just enfolded him and didnt let go whoa ned said no whoa she murmured gripping tightly no way eventually she stepped back looking at him his aunt was smiling yo nephew she said want us to tell you how scared we were i can guess no you cant said meghan marriner shaking her head you cant come close he looked at her i have a few things to tell you guys he said about us our family the sisters glanced at each other which of them was the father kim asked neds jaw dropped jeez he said we were talking most of the night his mother said fitted a few guesses together like a jigsaw a jigsaw he repeated stupidly uncle dave laughed at his expression ned he said believe me it was scary listening to them we can start being afraid around now ned didnt feel afraid it didnt look like his uncle did either his mother and aunt were looking at him waiting he cleared his throat she didnt tell he said quietly they asked meghan said but we were right ned nodded looked over at his uncle aha they werent sure were still okay barely said dave martyniuk this is just a beginning they looked back at the others edward marriner led them up greg and steve were grinning like kids melanie had her oversized tote now and her cellphone and straw hat meghan went over and kissed her on both cheeks ned looked at his dad hi he said hello son his father smiled take a good look around morning light i dont think you can go wrong up here a lot of options youll want to go look south too other side of this courtyard here you shoot from cézannes mountain not up to it his father nodded had that thought climbing up i had that thought a week ago said melanie oh of course you did said greg steve snorted and walked away towards where kate was still hanging back he was dialing his phone ned wondered who was left at the villa to call a moment later the sounds of the wedding march were heard in the high clear spaces at the summit of saintevictoire dammit said melanie reddening she stabbed for the answer button on her phone i took that ringtone off steve had turned back to them he was laughing so was greg so actually was ned did you have to be mature all the time steve sketched an oriental bow to melanie little bird learn lesson of life that which is changed can be changed back in fullness of time he bowed again hands pressed together you are in so much trouble the two of you she said i am really really happy to hear you say that said greg he looked at her and frowned hey did you like grow or something she smiled it just about lit the mountainside melanie went back inside to change clothes neds father was eyeing the view all directions ned knew that expression the appraising look later edward marriner said catching neds glance ill come back he laid a hand on his sons shoulder and squeezed melanie came out seeing her in her own clothes and running shoes was a kind of shock this was entirely her now his fathers assistant hyperorganized ringtone warrior someone else even farther away now it made him thoughtful he let the others go down first said he wanted a moment to himself his mother looked at him then started back along the path with the rest ned found a boulder and sat down his back against it looking east to the sunrise towards the last ridge hed climbed yesterday up along it then down to the right there was a cave he took a deep breath was it all going to recede would what had happened slip and drift like memories did become something you thought of at times and then less often as years went by a story your history as you were carried forward into other stories and other moments that became your life other people he heard a footfall someone kicked a pebble you um sleep with her last night kate wenger asked she came up beside him she took off her sunglasses her expression was cool what kind of a question is that he said looking up

the riviera italy the sun the land below them to the south had been a battlefield once probably more than once he thought it was bathed in a long mild morning glory kate extended her hands come on well get too far behind whats wrong with that he asked looking up at her she smiled again nothing i guess he gave her both his hands and let her help him rise never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one john berger acknowledgments laura and sybil as always on both sides of the atlantic ysabel was written largely in the countryside near aixenprovence and so it is proper

leslieellen ray shared a professionals approach to photographing aixs cathedral at the university of aixmarseille gilles dorival offered suggestions answered questions arranged access to the
