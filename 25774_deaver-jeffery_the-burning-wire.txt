jeffery deaver the burning wire the ninth book in the lincoln rhyme series for editor extraordinaire marysue rucci hell there are no rules here were trying to accomplish something thomas alva edison on creating the first electric grid thirtyseven hours until earth day i the troubleman from his neck down a man is worth a couple of dollars a day from his neck up he is worth anything that his brain can produce thomas alva edison chapter sitting in the control center of algonquin consolidated power and lights sprawling complex on the east river in queens new york the morning supervisor frowned at the pulsing red words on his computer screen critical failure below them was frozen the exact time am he lowered his cardboard coffee cup blue and white with stiff depictions of greek athletes on it and sat up in his creaky swivel chair the power company control center employees sat in front of individual workstations like air traffic controllers the large room was brightly lit and dominated by a massive flatscreen monitor reporting on the flow of electricity throughout the power grid known as the northeastern interconnection which provided electrical service in new york pennsylvania new jersey and connecticut the architecture and decor of the control center were quite modernif the year were the supervisor squinted up at the board which showed the juice arriving from generating plants around the country steam turbines reactors and the hydroelectric dam at niagara falls in one tiny portion of the spaghetti depicting these electrical lines something was wrong a red circle was flashing critical failure whats up the supervisor asked a grayhaired man with a taut belly under his shortsleeved white shirt and thirty years experience in the electricity business he was mostly curious while criticalincident indicator lights came on from time to time actual critical incidents were very rare a young technician replied says we have total breaker separation mhtwelve dark unmanned and grimy algonquin consolidated substation located in harlemthe mh for manhattanwas a major area substation it received volts and fed the juice through transformers which stepped it down to percent of that level divided it up and sent it on its way additional words now popped onto the big screen glowing red beneath the time and the stark report of the critical failure mh offline the supervisor typed on his computer recalling the days when this work was done with radio and telephone and insulated switches amid a smell of oil and brass and hot bakelite he read the dense complicated scroll of text he spoke softly as if to himself the breakers opened why the loads normal another message appeared mh offline rr to affected service area from mh mh mh nj weve got load rerouting somebody called unnecessarily in the suburbs and countryside the grid is clearly visiblethose bare overhead hightension wires and power poles and service lines running into your house when a line goes down theres little difficulty finding and fixing the problem in many cities though like new york the electricity flows underground in insulated cables because the insulation degrades after time and suffers groundwater damage resulting in shorts and loss of service power companies rely on double or even triple redundancy in the grid when substation mh went down the computer automatically began filling customer demand by rerouting the juice from other locations no dropouts no brownouts another tech called electricity in the grid is like water coming into a house from a single main pipe and flowing out through many open faucets when one is closed the pressure in the others increases electricitys the same though it moves a lot more quickly than waternearly million miles an hour and because new york city demanded a lot of power the voltagesthe electrical equivalent of water pressurein the substations doing the extra work were running high but the system was built to handle this and the voltage indicators were still in the green what was troubling the supervisor though was why the circuit breakers in mh had separated in the first place the most common reason for a substations breakers to pop is either a short circuit or unusually high demand at peak timesearly morning both rush hours and early evening or when the temperature soars and greedy air conditioners demand their juice none of those was the case at am on this comfortable april day get a troubleman over to mhtwelve could be a bum cable or a short in the just then a second red light began to flash critical failure nj offline another area substation located near paramus new jersey had gone down it was one of those taking up the slack in manhattans absence the supervisor made a sound half laugh half cough a perplexed frown screwed into his face what the hells going on the loads within tolerances sensors and indicators all functioning one technician called scada problem the supervisor called algonquins power empire was overseen by a sophisticated supervisory control and data acquisition program running on huge unix computers the legendary northeast blackout the largest ever in north america was caused in part by a series of computer software errors todays systems wouldnt let that disaster happen again but that wasnt to say a different computer screwup couldnt occur i dont know one of his assistants said slowly but id think itd have to be diagnostics say theres no physical problem with the lines or switchgear the supervisor stared at the screen waited for the next logical step letting them know which new substationor stationswould kick in to fill the gap created by the loss of nj but no such message appeared the three manhattan substations and continued alone in providing juice to two service areas of the city that would otherwise be dark the scada program wasnt doing what it should have bringing in power from other stations to help now the amount of electricity flowing into and out of each of those three stations was growing dramatically the supervisor rubbed his beard and after waiting futilely for another substation to come online ordered his senior assistant manually move supply from qfourteen into the eastern service area of mhtwelve yessir after a moment the supervisor snapped no now hm im trying trying what do you mean trying the task involved simple keyboard strokes the switchgears not responding impossible the supervisor walked down several short steps to the technicians computer he typed commands he knew in his sleep nothing the voltage indicators were at the end of the green yellow loomed this isnt good somebody muttered thiss a problem the supervisor ran back to his desk and dropped into his chair his granola bar and greek athlete cup fell to the floor and then another domino fell a third red dot like a bullseye on a target began to throb and in its aloof manner the scada computer reported critical failure mh offline no not another one somebody whispered and as before no other substation stepped up to help satisfy the voracious demands of new yorkers for energy two substations were doing the work of five the temperature of the electric wires into and out of those stations was growing and the voltage level bars on the big screen were well into the yellow mh offline nj offline mh offline rr to affected service areas from mh mh the supervisor snapped get more supply into those areas i dont care how you do it anywhere a woman at a nearby control booth sat up fast ive got forty k im running through feeder lines down from the bronx forty thousand volts wasnt much and it would be tricky to move it through feeder lines which were meant for about a third that much voltage somebody else was able to bring some juice down from connecticut the voltage indicator bars continued to rise but more slowly now maybe they had this under control more but then the woman stealing power from the bronx said in a choking voice wait the transmissions reduced itself to twenty thousand i dont know why this was happening throughout the region as soon as a tech was able to bring in a bit more current to relieve the pressure the supply from another location dried up and all of this drama was unfolding at breathtaking speeds million miles an hour and then yet another red circle another bullet wound critical failure mh offline a whisper this cant be happening mh offline nj offline mh offline mh offline rr to affected service areas from mh this was the equivalent of a huge reservoir of water trying to shoot through a single tiny spigot like the kind that squirts cold water out of a refrigerator door the voltage surging into mh located in an old building on west fiftyseventh street in the clinton neighborhood of manhattan was four or five times normal load and growing the circuit breakers would pop at any moment averting an explosion and a fire but returning a good portion of midtown to colonial times north seems to be working better try the north get some juice from the north try massachusetts ive got some fifty sixty k from putnam good and then oh jesus lord somebody cried the supervisor didnt know who it was everybody was staring at their screens heads down transfixed what he raged i dont want to keep hearing that kind of thing tell me the breaker settings in manhattanten look the breakers oh no no the circuit breakers in mh had been reset they would now allow through their portal ten times the safe load if the algonquin control center couldnt reduce the pressure of the voltage assaulting the substation soon the lines and switchgear inside the place would allow through a lethally high flood of electricity the substation would explode but before that happened the juice would race through the distribution feeder lines into belowground transformer boxes throughout the blocks south of lincoln center and into the spot networks in office buildings and big highrises some breakers would cut the circuit but some older transformers and service panels would just melt into a lump of conductive metal and let the current continue on its way setting fires and exploding in arc flashes that could burn to death anybody near an appliance or wall outlet for the first time the supervisor thought terrorists its a terror attack he shouted call homeland security and the nypd and reset them goddamn it reset the breakers theyre not responding im locked out of mhten how can you be fucking locked out i dont is anybody inside jesus if they are get them out now substations were unmanned but workers occasionally went inside for routine maintenance and repairs sure okay the indicator bars were now into the red sir should we shed load grinding his teeth the supervisor was considering this also known as a rolling blackout shedding load was an extreme measure in the power business load was the amount of juice that customers were using shedding was a manual controlled shutdown of certain parts of the grid to prevent a larger crash of the system it was a power companys last resort in the battle to keep the grid up and would have disastrous consequences in the densely populated portion of manhattan that was at risk the damage to computers alone would be in the tens of millions and it was possible that people would be injured or even lose their lives nineoneone calls wouldnt get through ambulances and police cars would be stuck in traffic with stoplights out elevators would be frozen thered be panic muggings and looting and rapes invariably rose during a blackout even in daylight electricity keeps people honest sir the technician asked desperately the supervisor stared at the moving voltage indicator bars he grabbed his own phone and called his superior a senior vice president at algonquin herb we have a situation he briefed the man howd this happen we dont know im thinking terrorists god you called homeland security yeah just now mostly were trying to get more power into the affected areas were not having much luck he watched the indicator bars continue to rise through the red the vice president asked okay recommendations we dont have much choice shed load a good chunk of the cityll go black for at least a day but i dont see any other options with that much juice flowing in the stationll blow if we dont do something his boss thought for a moment theres a second transmission line running through manhattanten right the supervisor looked up at the board a highvoltage cable went through the substation and headed west to deliver juice to parts of new jersey yes but its not online its just running through a duct there but could you splice into it and use that for supply to the diverted lines manually i suppose but but that would mean getting people inside mhten and if we cant hold the juice back until theyre finished itll flash thatll kill em all or give em thirddegrees over their entire bodies a pause hold on im calling jessen algonquin consolidateds ceo also known privately as the allpowerful as he waited the supervisor stared at the techs surrounding him he kept staring at the board too the glowing red dots critical failure finally the supervisors boss came back on his voice cracked he cleared his throat and after a moment said youre supposed to send some people in manually splice into the line thats what jessen said another pause yes the supervisor whispered i cant order anybody in there its suicide then find some volunteers jessen said you are not understand me not to shed load under any circumstances chapter the driver eased the m bus through traffic toward the stop on fiftyseventh street near where tenth avenue blended into amsterdam he was in a pretty good mood the new bus was a kneeling model which lowered to the sidewalk to make stepping aboard easier and featured a handicapped ramp great steering and most important a rumpfriendly drivers seat lord knew he needed that spending eight hours a day in it no interest in subways the long island railroad or metro north no he loved buses despite the crazy traffic the hostility attitudes and anger he liked how democratic it was to travel by bus you saw everybody from lawyers to struggling musicians to delivery boys cabs were expensive and stank subways didnt always go where you wanted to and walking well this was manhattan great if you had the time but who did besides he liked people and he liked the fact that he could nod or smile or say hello to every single person who got on his vehicle new yorkers werent like some people said unfriendly at all just sometimes shy insecure cautious preoccupied but often all it took was a grin a nod a single word and they were your new friend and he was happy to be one if only for six or seven blocks the personal greeting also gave him a chance to spot the wackos the drunks the cluckheads and tweakers and decide if he needed to hit the distress button this was after all manhattan today was beautiful clear and cool april one of his favorite months it was about am and the bus was crowded as people were heading east for lunch dates or errands on their hour off traffic was moving slowly as he nosed the huge vehicle closer to the stop where four or five people stood beside a bus stop sign pole he was approaching the stop and happened to look past the people waiting to get on board his eyes taking in the old brown building behind the stop an early twentiethcentury structure it had several gridded windows but was always dark inside hed never seen anybody going in or out a spooky place like a prison on the front was a flaking sign in white paint on a blue background algonquin consolidated power and light company substation mh private property danger high voltage trespass prohibited he rarely paid attention to the place but today something had caught his eye something he believed out of the ordinary dangling from the window about ten feet off the ground was a wire about a half inch in diameter it was covered with dark insulation up to the end there the plastic or rubber was stripped away revealing silvery metal strands bolted to a fitting of some kind a flat piece of brass damn big hunk of wire he thought and just hanging out the window was that safe he braked the bus to a complete stop and hit the door release the kneeling mechanism engaged and the big vehicle dipped toward the sidewalk the bottom metal stair inches from the ground the driver turned his broad ruddy face toward the door which eased open with a satisfying hydraulic hiss the folks began to climb on board morning the driver said cheerfully a woman in her eighties clutching an old shabby henri bendel shopping bag nodded back and using a cane staggered to the rear ignoring the empty seats in the front reserved for the elderly and disabled how could you not just love new yorkers then sudden motion in the rearview mirror flashing yellow lights a truck was speeding up behind him algonquin consolidated three workers stepped out and stood in a close group talking among themselves they held boxes of tools and thick gloves and jackets they didnt seem happy as they walked slowly toward the building staring at it heads close together as they debated something one of those heads was shaking ominously then the driver turned to the last passenger about to board a young latino clutching his metrocard and pausing outside the bus he was gazing at the substation frowning the driver noticed his head was raised as if he was sniffing the air an acrid scent something was burning the smell reminded him of the time that an electric motor in the wifes washing machine had shorted out and the insulation burned nauseating a wisp of smoke was coming from the doorway of the substation so thats what the algonquin people were doing here thatd be a mess the driver wondered if it would mean a power outage and the stoplights would go out thatd be it for him the crosstown trip normally twenty minutes would be hours well in any event hed better clear the area for the fire department he gestured the passenger on board hey mister i gotta go come on get on as the passenger still frowning at the smell turned around and stepped onto the bus the driver heard what sounded like pops coming from inside the substation sharp almost like gunshots then a flash of light like a dozen suns filled the entire sidewalk between the bus and the cable dangling from the window the passenger simply disappeared into a cloud of white fire the drivers vision collapsed to gray afterimages the sound was like a ripping crackle and shotgun blast at the same time stunning his ears though belted into his seat his upper body was slammed backward against the side window through numb ears he heard the echoes of his passengers screams through halfblinded eyes he saw flames as he began to pass out the driver wondered if he himself might very well be the source of the fire chapter i have to tell you he got out of the airport he was spotted an hour ago in downtown mexico city no lincoln rhyme said with a sigh closing his eyes briefly no amelia sachs sitting beside rhymes candy apple red storm arrow wheelchair leaned forward and spoke into the black box of the speakerphone what happened she tugged at her long red hair and twined the strands into a severe ponytail by the time we got the flight information from london the plane had landed the womans voice blossomed crisply from the speakerphone seems he hid on a supply truck snuck out through a service entrance ill show you the security tape we got from the mexican police ive got a link hold on a minute her voice faded as she spoke to her associate giving him instructions about the video the time was just past noon and rhyme and sachs were in the groundfloor parlor turned forensic laboratory of his townhouse on central park west what had been a gothic victorian structure in which had possibly residedrhyme liked to thinksome very unquaint victorians tough businessmen dodgy politicians highclass crooks maybe an incorruptible police commissioner who liked to bang heads rhyme had written a classic book on oldtime crime in new york and had used his sources to try to track the genealogy of his building but he could find no pedigree the woman they were speaking with was in a more modern structure rhyme had to assume three thousand miles away the monterey office of the california bureau of investigation cbi agent kathryn dance had worked with rhyme and sachs several years ago on a case involving the very man they were now closing in on richard logan was they believed his real name though lincoln rhyme thought of him mostly by his nickname the watchmaker he was a professional criminal one who planned his crimes with the precision he devoted to his hobby and passionconstructing timepieces rhyme and the killer had clashed several times rhyme had foiled one of his plans but failed to stop another still lincoln rhyme considered the overall score a loss for himself since the watchmaker wasnt in custody rhyme leaned his head back in his wheelchair picturing logan hed seen the man in person up close body lean hair a dark boyish mop eyes gently amused at being questioned by the police never revealing a clue to the mass murder he was planning his serenity seemed to be innate and it was what rhyme found to be perhaps the most disturbing quality of the man emotion breeds mistake and carelessness and no one could ever accuse richard logan of being emotional he could be hired for larceny or illegal arms or any other scheme that needed elaborate planning and ruthless execution but was generally hired for murderkilling witnesses or whistleblowers or political or corporate figures recent intelligence revealed hed taken a murder assignment in mexico somewhere rhyme had called dance who had many contacts south of the borderand who had herself nearly been killed by the watchmakers associate a few years earlier given that connection dance was representing the americans in the operation to arrest and extradite him working with a senior investigator of the ministerial federal police a young hardworking officer named arturo diaz early that morning theyd learned the watchmaker would be landing in mexico city dance had called diaz who scrambled to put extra officers in place to intercept logan but from dances latest communication they hadnt been in time you ready for the video dance asked go ahead rhyme shifted one of his few working fingersthe index finger of his right handand moved the electric wheelchair closer to the screen he was a c quadriplegic largely paralyzed from the shoulders down on one of the several flatscreen monitors in the lab came a grainy nightvision image of an airport trash and discarded cartons cans and drums littered the ground on both sides of the fence in the foreground a private cargo jet taxied into view and just as it stopped a rear hatch opened and a man dropped out thats him dance said softly i cant see clearly rhyme said its definitely logan dance reassured they got a partial printyoull see in a minute the man stretched and then oriented himself he slung a bag over his shoulder and crouching ran toward and hid behind a shed a few minutes later a worker came by carrying a package the size of two shoe boxes logan greeted him swapped the box for a lettersize envelope the worker looked around and walked away quickly a maintenance truck pulled up logan climbed into the back and hid under some tarps the truck disappeared from view the plane he asked continued on to south america on a corporate charter the pilot and copilot claim they dont know anything about a stowaway of course theyre lying but we dont have jurisdiction to question them and the worker sachs asked federal police picked him up he was just a minimumwage airport employee he claims somebody he didnt know told him hed be paid a couple of hundred us to deliver the box the money was in the envelope thats what they lifted the print from what was in the package rhyme asked he says he doesnt know but hes lying tooi saw the interview video our dea peoplere interrogating him i wanted to try to tease some information out of him myself but itll take too long for me to get the okay rhyme and sachs shared a look the teasing reference was a bit of modesty on dances part she was a kinesics expertbody languageand one of the top interrogators in the country but the testy relationship between the sovereign states in question was such that a california cop would have plenty of paperwork to negotiate before she could slip into mexico for a formal interrogation whereas the us drug enforcement agency already had a sanctioned presence there rhyme asked where was logan spotted in the capital a business district he was trailed to a hotel but he wasnt staying there it was for a meeting diazs men think by the time theyd set up surveillance he was gone but all the law enforcement agencies and hotels have his picture now dance added that diazs boss a very senior police official would be taking over the investigation its encouraging that theyre serious about the case yes encouraging rhyme thought but he felt frustrated too to be on the verge of finding the prey and yet to have so little control over the case he found himself breathing more quickly he was considering the last time he and the watchmaker had been up against each other logan had outthought everybody and easily killed the man hed been hired to murder rhyme had had all the facts at hand to figure out what logan was up to yet hed misread the strategy completely by the way he heard sachs ask kathryn dance how was that romantic weekend away this had to do it seemed with dances love interest the single mother of two had been a widow for several years we had a great time the agent reported where did you go rhyme wondered why on earth sachs was asking about dances social life she ignored his impatient glance santa barbara stopped at the hearst castle listen im still waiting for you two to come out here the children really want to meet you wes wrote a paper about forensics for school and mentioned you lincoln his teacher used to live in new york and had read all about you yes thatd be nice rhyme said thinking exclusively about mexico city sachs smiled at the impatience in his voice and told dance they had to go after disconnecting she wiped some sweat from rhymes foreheadhe hadnt been aware of the moistureand they sat silent for a moment looking out the window at the blur of a peregrine falcon sweeping into view it veered up to its nest on rhymes second floor though not uncommon in major citiesplenty of fat tasty pigeons for mealsthese birds of prey usually nested higher but for some reason several generations of the birds had called rhymes townhouse home he liked their presence they were smart fascinating to watch and the perfect visitors not demanding anything from him a male voice intruded well did you get him who rhyme snapped and how artful a verb is get thom reston lincoln rhymes caregiver said the watchmaker no grumbled rhyme but youre close arent you asked the trim man wearing dark slacks a businessmans starched yellow shirt and a floral tie oh close rhyme muttered close thats very helpful next time youre being attacked by a mountain lion thom how would you feel if the park ranger shot really close to it as opposed to oh say actually hitting it arent mountain lions endangered thom asked not even bothering with an ironic inflection he was impervious to rhymes edge hed worked for the forensic detective for years longer than many married couples had been together and the aide was as seasoned as the toughest spouse ha very funny endangered sachs walked around behind rhymes wheelchair gripped his shoulders and began an impromptu massage sachs was tall and in better shape than most nypd detectives her age and though arthritis often plagued her knees and lower extremities her arms and hands were strong and largely painfree they wore their working clothes rhyme was in sweatpants black and a knit shirt of dark green she had shed her navy blue jacket but was wearing matching slacks and a white cotton blouse one button open at the collar pearls present her glock was high on her hip in a fastdraw polymer holster and two magazines sat side by side in holsters of their own along with a taser rhyme could feel the pulsing of her fingers he had perfect sensation above where hed sustained a nearly fatal spinal cord fracture some years ago the fourth cervical vertebra although at one point hed considered risky surgery to improve his condition hed opted for a different rehabilitative approach through an exhausting regimen of exercise and therapy hed managed to regain some use of his fingers and hand he could also use his left ring finger which had for some reason remained intact after the subway beam broke his neck he enjoyed the fingers digging into his flesh it was as if the small percentage of remaining sensation in his body was enhanced he glanced down at his useless legs he closed his eyes thom now looked him over carefully you all right lincoln all right aside from the fact that the perp ive been searching for for years slipped out of our grasp and is now hiding out in the secondlargest metropolitan area in this hemisphere im just peachy thats not what im talking about youre not looking too good youre right actually i need some medicine medicine whisky id feel better with some whisky no you wouldnt well why dont we try an experiment science cartesian rational who can argue with that i know how i feel now then ill have some whisky and ill report back to you no its too early thom said matteroffactly its afternoon by a few minutes goddamn it rhyme sounded gruff as often but in fact he was losing himself in sachss massage a few strings of red hair had escaped from her ponytail and hung tickling against his cheek he didnt move away since hed apparently lost the singlemalt battle he was ignoring thom but the aide brought his attention around quickly by saying when you were on the phone lon called he did why didnt you tell me you said you didnt want to be disturbed while you were talking with kathryn well tell me now hell call back something about a case a problem really the watchmaker case receded somewhat at this news rhyme understood that there was another source of his bad mood boredom hed just finished analyzing the evidence for a complicated organized crime case and was facing several weeks with little to do so he was buoyed by the thought of another job like sachss craving for speed rhyme needed problems challenges input one of the difficulties with a severe disability that few people focus on is the absence of anything new the same settings the same people the same activities and the same platitudes the same empty reassurances the same reports from unemotional doctors what had saved his life after his injuryliterally since hed been considering assisted suicidewere his tentative steps back into his prior passion using science to solve crimes you could never be bored when you confronted mystery thom persisted are you sure youre up for it youre looking a little pale havent been to the beach lately you know all right just checking oh and arlen kopeski is coming by later when do you want to see him the name sounded familiar but it left a vaguely troubling flavor in his mouth who hes with that disability rights group its about that award youre being given today rhyme had a fuzzy recollection of some phone calls if it wasnt about a case he rarely paid much attention to the noise around him you said today you said youd meet with him oh i really need an award what am i going to do with it paperweight does anybody you know ever use paperweights have you ever used a paperweight lincoln its being given to you for inspiring young people with disabilities nobody inspired me when i was young and i turned out all right which wasnt completely truethe inspiration partbut rhyme grew petty whenever distractions loomed especially distractions involving visitors a half hour is a half hour i dont have too late hes already in town sometimes it was impossible to win against the aide well see kopeskis not going to come here and cool his heels like some courtier waiting for an audience with the king rhyme liked that metaphor but then all thoughts of awards and royalty vanished as rhymes phone blared and detective lieutenant lon sellittos number showed up on caller id rhyme used a working finger on his right hand to answer lon linc listen heres the thing he was harried and to judge from the surroundsound acoustics piping through the speaker apparently driving somewhere quickly we may have a terrorist situation going on situation thats not very specific okay hows this somebody fucked with the power company shot a fivethousanddegree spark at a metro bus and shut down the electric grid for six square blocks south of lincoln center that specific enough for you chapter the entourage arrived from downtown homeland securitys representative was a typically young but senior officer probably born and bred among the country clubs of connecticut or long island though that was for rhyme merely a demographic observation and not necessarily a fault the mans shine and sharp eyes belied the fact that he probably wouldnt quite know where he fit in the hierarchy of law enforcement but that was true of nearly everybody who worked for hs his name was gary noble the bureau was here too of course in the incarnation of a special agent whom rhyme and sellitto worked with frequently fred dellray fbi founder j edgar hoover would have been dismayed at the africanamerican agent only partly because his roots were clearly not in new england rather the consternation would come from the agents lack of ninth street style a reference to fbi headquarters in washington dc dellray donned a white shirt and tie only when his undercover assignments called for such an outfit and he treated the garb like any other costume in his players wardrobe today he was wearing authentic dellray a dark green plaid suit the pink shirt of a devilmaycare wall street ceo and an orange tie that rhyme couldnt have thrown out fast enough dellray was accompanied by his newly named bossassistant special agent in charge of the new york office of the fbi tucker mcdaniel whod begun his career in washington then taken assignments in the middle east and south asia the asac was compactly built with thick dark hair and a swarthy complexion though with bright blue eyes that focused on you as if you were lying when you said hi it was a helpful expression for a law enforcement agent and one that rhyme affected himself as the occasion merited the nypds chief presence was stout lon sellitto in a gray suit and unusual for him powder blue shirt the tiesplotchy by design not spillagewas the only unwrinkled article of clothing swathing the man probably a birthday present from livein girlfriend rachel or his son the major cases detective was backed up by sachs and ron pulaski a blond eternally youthful officer from patrol who was officially attached to sellitto but who unofficially worked mostly with rhyme and sachs on the crime scene side of investigations pulaski was in a standard dark blue nypd uniform tshirt visible in the v at his throat both of the feds mcdaniel and noble had heard about rhyme of course but neither had met him and they exuded various degrees of surprise sympathy and discomfort seeing the paralyzed forensic consultant who tooled around the lab deftly in his wheelchair the novelty and uneasiness soon wore off though as they usually did with all but the most ingratiating guests and soon they were struck by the more bizarre presence here a wainscoted crownmolded parlor chockablock with equipment that a crime scene unit in a mediumsized town might envy after introductions noble took the point position homeland security carting the bigger umbrella mr rhyme lincoln he corrected rhyme grew irritated when anyone deferred to him and he considered the use of his surname a subtle way of patting him on the head and saying poor thing sorry youre confined to a wheelchair for the rest of your life so well be extraspecial polite sachs caught the weight behind his correction and rolled her eyes in a gentle arc rhyme tried not to smile sure lincoln then noble cleared his throat heres the scenario what do you know about the gridthe electricity grid not much rhyme admitted hed studied science in college but never paid much attention to electricity other than electromagnetics appearance in physics as one of the four fundamental forces in nature along with gravity and the weak and the strong nuclear forces but that was academic on a practical level rhymes main interest in electricity involved making sure enough of it got pumped into the townhouse to power the equipment in his lab here it was extremely thirsty and hed twice had to have the place rewired to bring in additional amperage to support the load rhyme was very aware too that he was alive and functioning now solely because of electricity the ventilator that had kept oxygen pumping through his lungs right after the accident and now the batteries in his wheelchair and the current controlled by the touchpad and voiceactivated ecu his environmental control unit the computer too of course he wouldnt have had much of a life without wires probably no life at all noble continued the basic scenario is our unsub got into one of the power companys substations and ran a wire outside the building unknown subject singular rhyme asked we dont know yet wire outside okay and then got into the computer that controls the grid he manipulated it to send more voltage through the substation than it was meant to handle noble fiddled with cuff links in the shape of animals and the electricity jumped the fbis mcdaniel put in it was basically trying to get into the ground its called an arc flash an explosion like a lightning bolt a degree spark the asac added its so powerful it creates plasma thats a state of matter that isnt gas liquid or solid rhyme said impatiently exactly a fairly small arc flash has the explosive power of a pound of tnt and this one wasnt small and the bus was his target rhyme asked seems so sellitto said but they have rubber tires vehicles are the safest place to be in a lightning storm i saw that someplace some show true mcdaniel said but the unsub had it all figured out it was a kneeling bus either he was counting that the lowered step would touch the sidewalk or hoping somebodyd have one foot on the ground and one on the bus thatd be enough for the arc to hit it noble again twisted a tiny silver mammal on his cuff but the timing was off or his aim or something the spark hit the sign pole next to the bus killed one passenger deafened some people nearby and dinged a few with glass started a fire if itd hit the bus directly the casualties wouldve been a lot worse half of them dead id guess or with thirddegree burns lon mentioned a blackout rhyme said mcdaniel eased back into the conversation the unsub used the computer to shut down four other substations in the area so all the juice was flowing through the one on fiftyseven street as soon as the arc happened that substation went offline but algonquin got the others up and running again right now about six blocks in clinton are out didnt you see it on the news i dont watch much news rhyme said sachs asked mcdaniel the driver or anybody see anything nothing helpful there were some workers there theyd gotten orders from the ceo of algonquin to go inside and try to reroute the lines or something thank god they didnt go in before the arc happened there was nobody inside fred dellray asked the agent seemed a bit out of the loop and rhyme guessed there hadnt been time for mcdaniel to fully brief his team no substationsre mostly just equipment nobody inside except for routine maintenance or repairs how was the computer hacked lon sellitto asked sitting noisily in a wicker chair gary noble said we arent sure were running the scenarios now our white hat hackersve tried to run a mock terrorist scenario and they cant get inside but you know how it works the bad guysre always one step ahead of ustechwise ron pulaski asked anybody take credit not yet noble replied rhyme asked then why terrorism im thinking its a good way to shut down alarms and security systems any murders or burglaries reported not so far sellitto pointed out a couple of reasons we think its terrorists mcdaniel said our obscurepatternandrelationshipprofile software suggests so for one thing and right after it happened i had our people go through signals from maryland he paused as if warning that nobody here should repeat what he was about to say rhyme deduced the fbi man was referring to the netherworld of intelligencegovernment snooping agencies that might not technically have jurisdiction in the country but who can maneuver through loopholes to keep on top of possible malfeasance within the borders the national security agencythe worlds best eavesdroppershappened to be in maryland a new sigint system came up with some interesting hits sigint signal intelligence monitoring cell phones satellite phones email seemed an appropriate approach when confronted with somebody using electricity to stage an attack picked up references to what we think is a new terror group operating in the area never cataloged before who sellitto asked the name starts with justice and has the word for in it mcdaniel explained justice for sachs asked nothing else no maybe justice for allah justice for the oppressed anything we dont have a clue the words in english though rhyme asked not arabic or somali or indonesian right mcdaniel said but im running multilanguage and dialect monitoring programs on all communications we can pick up legally noble added quickly that we can pick up legally but most of their communications take place in the cloud zone mcdaniel said he didnt explain this uhm whats that sir ron pulaski asked a variation of what rhyme was about to though in a much less deferential manner cloud zone the asac responded the phrase comes from the latest approach to computingwhere your data and programs are stored on servers elsewhere not on your own computer i wrote an analysis paper on it im using the term to mean new communications protocols theres very little standard cell phone and email use among the negative players people of interest are exploiting new techniques like blogs and twitter and facebook to send messages also embedding codes in music and video uploads and downloads and personally i think theyve got some new systems altogether different types of modified phones radios with alternative frequencies the cloud zone negative players why do you think justice for is behind the attack sachs asked we dont necessarily noble said mcdaniel filled in just there were some sigint hits about monetary dispersals over the past few days and about some movement of personnel and the sentence its going to be big so when the attack happened today we thought maybe and earth days coming up noble pointed out rhyme wasnt exactly sure what earth day wasand didnt have an opinion about it one way or the other except recognizing with some petulance that it was like other holidays and events crowds and protesters clogging the streets and depleting the resources of the nypd which he might otherwise need to run cases noble said might be more than a coincidence attack on the grid the day before earth day the presidents taking an interest the president sellitto asked right hes at some renewable energy summit outside of dc sellitto mused somebody making a point ecoterror you didnt see much of that in new york city logging and stripmining werent big industries here justice for the environment maybe sachs suggested but mcdaniel said theres another wrinkle one of the sigint hits correlated justice for with the name rahman no family name weve got eight unaccountedfor rahmans on our islamist terror watch list could be one of them were thinking but we dont know which one noble had abandoned the bears or manatees on his cuffs and was now playing with a nice pen we were thinking at homeland that rahman could be part of a sleeper cell thats been here for years maybe from around the time of nineeleven staying clear of an islamist lifestyle sticking with moderate mosques avoiding arabic mcdaniel added ive got one of my t and c teams up from quantico t and c rhyme asked peeved tech and communications to run the surveillance and warrant specialists to get taps if we need them two doj lawyers and were getting two hundred extra agents rhyme and sellitto glanced each others way this was a surprisingly substantial task force for a single incident that wasnt part of an ongoing investigation and mobilized with incredible speed the attack had happened less than two hours ago the bureau man noticed their reaction were convinced theres a new profile to terrorism so weve got a new approach to fighting it like the drones in the middle east and afghanistan you know the pilots are next to a strip mall in colorado springs or omaha the cloud zone now t and cs in place so well be able to hook more signals soon but well still need traditional approaches a look around the lab meaning forensics rhyme supposed and then the asac looked toward dellray and streetlevel work though fred tells me he hasnt had much luck dellrays talent as an undercover op was exceeded only by his skills as a handler of confidential informants since hed curried favor with a large group of cis in the islamic community and taught himself arabic indonesian and farsi he worked regularly with the nypds impressive antiterror unit but the agent confirmed his bosss comment grimfaced he said havent heard anything about justice for or rahman ran it past my boys in brooklyn jersey queens manhattan just happened sellitto reminded right mcdaniel said slowly of course something like this wouldve been planned for what would you guess a month noble said id imagine at least see thats this damn cloud zone rhyme could also hear mcdaniels criticism of fred dellray the point of informants was to learn about things before they happened well keep at it fred mcdaniel said youre doing a good job sure tucker noble had given up fidgeting with the pen he was consulting his watch so homelandll coordinate with washington and the state department embassies too if we need to but the police and the bureaull run the case like any other now lincoln everybody knows your expertise with crime scene work so were hoping youll work point on analysis of the trace were assembling a cs team now they should be on location at the substation in twenty minutes thirty tops sure well help rhyme said but we run the entire scene entrance to exit and all secondary scenes not just trace the whole ball of string he glanced at sellitto who nodded firmly meaning im backing you up in the ensuing awkward moment of silence everybody was aware of the subtext who would ultimately be in charge of the investigation the nature of police work nowadays was such that whoever controlled the forensics basically ran the case this was a practical consequence of the advancements in crime scene investigative techniques in the past ten years simply by searching the scenes and analyzing what was found forensic investigators had the best insights into the nature of the crime and possible suspects and were the first to develop leads the triumviratenoble and mcdaniel on the federal side and sellitto for the nypdwould be making strategic decisions but if they accepted rhyme as key in the crime scene operation he would be in effect the lead investigator this made sense hed solved crimes in the city longer than any of them had and since there were no suspects or other significant leads at this point other than evidence a forensic specialist was the way to go most important rhyme wanted the case bad the boredom factor okay some ego too so he offered the best argument he could he said nothing just settled his eyes on the face of the homeland security man gary noble mcdaniel fidgeted a bitit was his crime scene people who would be demotedand noble lobbed a glance toward him asking what do you think tucker i know mr rhymes i know lincolns work i dont have a problem with him running the scene provided theres one hundred percent coordination with us of course and weve got somebody present and we get the findings as soon as possible he looked into rhymes eyes not at his body the most important thing is fast response time meaning rhyme suspected can somebody in your condition deliver sellitto stirred but this wasnt a crip putdown it was a legitimate question one that rhyme himself would have asked he answered understood good ill tell my evidence response people to help however you want the asac assured him noble said now for the press were trying to downplay the terror angle at this point well be making it sound like an accident but the news leaked that it may be more than that people are freaked out ill say they are mcdaniel nodded ive got monitors in my office checking internet traffic huge increases in hits in search engines for electrocution arc flash and blackouts youtube viewings of arc flash videos are through the roof i went online myself theyre scary as hell one minute therere two guys working on an electric panel then all of a sudden theres a flash that fills the whole screen and a guys on his back with half his body on fire and noble said peoplere real nervous that arc flashes might happen someplace other than a substation like their houses and offices sachs asked can they mcdaniel apparently had not learned all there was to know about arc flashes he admitted i think so but im not sure how big the current has to be his eyes strayed to a v outlet nearby well i think we better get moving rhyme said with a glance at sachs she headed for the door ron come with me pulaski joined her a moment later the door closed and soon he heard the big engine of her car fire up now one thing to keep in mind one scenario we ran on the computers mcdaniel added was that the unsub was just testing the waters checking out the grid as a possible terror target it was pretty clumsy and only one person died we fed that into the system and the algorithms are suggesting that they might try something different next theres even a potential that this was a singularity a rhyme asked exasperated at the language singularitya onetime occurrence our threat analysis software assigned a fiftyfive percent nonrepeatability factor to the incident thats not the worst in the world rhyme said but isnt that just another way of saying theres a fortyfive percent chance that somebody else somewhere in new york citys going to get electrocuted and it could be happening right now chapter algonquin consolidated power substation mh was a miniature medieval castle in a quiet area south of lincoln center it was made of unevenly cut limestone dingy and pitted from decades of new york city pollution and grime the cornerstone was worn but you could easily read it was just before pm when amelia sachs skidded her maroon ford torino cobra up to the curb in front of the place behind the ruined bus the car and its bubbling exhaust drew glances of curiosity or admiration from bystanders cops and firemen she climbed out of the drivers seat tossed an nypd placard on the dash and stood with hands on hips surveying the scene ron pulaski exited from the passenger door and slammed it with a solid clunk sachs regarded the incongruity of the setting modern buildings at least twenty or so stories high bracketed the substation which for some reason had been designed with turrets the stone was streaked with white thanks to the resident pigeons a number of which had returned after the excitement the windows were of jaundiced glass and covered with bars painted black the thick metal door was open and the room inside was dark with a bleat of an electronic siren a rapid response vehicle from the nypd crime scene unit eased into the area the rrv parked and three technicians from the main operation in queens climbed out sachs had worked with them on a number of occasions and she nodded to the latino man and the asian woman under the direction of a senior officer detective gretchen sahloff sachs nodded to the detective who waved a greeting and with a somber look at the front of the substation walked to the rear of the large van where the newly arrived officers began to unload equipment sachss attention then moved to the sidewalk and street cordoned off with yellow tape beyond which a crowd of fifty or so watched the action the bus that had been the object of the attack sat in front of the substation empty lopsided the right tires were deflated near the front the paint was scorched half the windows were gray and opaque an ems medic approached a stocky africanamerican woman and nodded sachs said hi the woman gave a tentative nod of greeting med techs had witnessed just about all the carnage you could see but she was shaken detective you better take a look sachs followed her to the ambulance where a body lay on a gurney waiting transport to the morgue it was covered with a dark green waxy tarp was the last passenger looks like we thought we could save him but we only got him this far electrocuted you better see she whispered and lifted the covering sachs froze as the smell of burned skin and hair rose and she gazed at the victim a latino in a business suitor what was left of one his back and much of the right side of his body was a mix of skin and cloth from the burn she guessed second and third degree but that wasnt what unsettled her so much shed seen bad burns accidental and intentional in her line of work the most horrifying sight was in his flesh exposed when the ems team had cut away the cloth of his suit she was looking at dozens of smooth puncture wounds which covered his body it was as if hed been hit by a blast from a huge shotgun most of them the medic said entrance and exit they went all the way through whatd cause that dont know never seen anything like it all my years and sachs realized something else the wounds were all distinct and clearly visible theres no blood whatever it was cauterized the wounds thats why her voice went soft thats why he stayed conscious for as long as he did sachs couldnt imagine the pain how she asked half to herself and then she got the answer amelia ron pulaski called she glanced toward him the bus sign pole take a look brother jesus she muttered and walked closer to the edge of the crime scene tape about six feet from the ground a hole had been blasted clean through the metal pole five inches wide the metal had melted like plastic under a blowtorch she then focused on the windows of the bus and a delivery truck parked nearby shed thought the glass was frosted from the fire but no small bits of shrapnelthe same that had killed the passengerhad hit the vehicles the sheetmetal skins were also punctured look she whispered pointing at the sidewalk and the facade of the substation a hundred tiny craters had been dug into the stone was it a bomb pulaski asked maybe the respondings missed it sachs opened a plastic bag and removed blue latex gloves pulling them on she bent down and collected a small disk of metal shaped like a teardrop at the base of the post it was so hot it softened the glove when she realized what it was she shivered whats that pulaski asked the arc flash melted the pole she looked around and saw a hundred or more drops on the ground or sticking to the side of the bus buildings and nearby cars thats what had killed the young passenger a shower of molten metal drops flying through the air at a thousand feet a second the young officer exhaled slowly getting hit by something like that burning right through you sachs shivered againat the thought of the pain and at the thought of how devastating the results of the attack might have been this portion of street was relatively empty had the substation been closer to the center of manhattan easily ten or fifteen passersby would have died sachs looked up and found herself staring at the unsubs weapon from one of the windows overlooking fiftyseventh street about two feet of thick wire dangled it was covered in black insulation but the end was stripped away and the bare cable was bolted to a scorched brass plate it looked industrial and mundane and not at all the sort of thing that could have produced such a terrible explosion sachs and pulaski joined the cluster of two dozen homeland security fbi and nypd agents and officers at the fbis command post van some were in tactical gear some in crime scene coveralls others just suits or regulation uniforms they were dividing up the labor theyd be canvassing for witnesses and checking for postincident bombs or other booby traps a popular terrorist technique a solemn leanfaced man in his fifties stood with his arms crossed staring at the substation he wore an algonquin consolidated badge on a chain around his neck he was the senior company representative here a field supervisor in charge of this portion of the grid sachs asked him to describe what algonquin had learned about the event in detail and he gave her an account which she jotted into her notebook security cameras the skinny man replied sorry no we dont bother the doors are multiple locked and theres nothing inside to steal really anyways all that juice its sort of like a guard dog a big one sachs asked how do you think he got in the door was locked when we got here theyre on numberpad locks who has the codes all the employees but he didnt get in that way the locks have a chip that keeps records of when theyre opened these havent been accessed for two days and thathe pointed to the wire dangling from the windowwasnt there then he had to break in some other way she turned to pulaski when youre finished out here check around back the windows and roof she asked the algonquin worker underground access the field supervisor said not that i know of the electric lines into and out of this station come through ducts nobody could fit in but there could be other tunnels i dont know about check it out anyway ron sachs then interviewed the driver of the bus whod been treated for glass cuts and a concussion his vision and hearing had been temporarily damaged but hed insisted on staying to help the police however he could which wasnt very much the round man described being curious about the wire protruding from the window hed never seen it before smelling smoke hearing pops from inside then the terrifying spark so fast he whispered never seen anything that fast in my life hed been slammed against the window and woke up ten minutes later he fell silent gazing at his destroyed bus his expression reflecting betrayal and mourning sachs then turned to the agents and officers present and said she and pulaski were going to run the scene she wondered if word really had come down from the fbis tucker mcdaniel that this was kosher it wasnt unheard of for senior people in law enforcement to smilingly agree with you and then intentionally forget the conversation had ever taken place but the federal agents had indeed been told some seemed irritated that the nypd was taking this pivotal role but othersthe fbis evidence response team mostlydidnt seem to mind and indeed regarded sachs with admiring curiosity she was after all part of the team headed up by the legendary lincoln rhyme turning toward pulaski she said lets get to work sachs walked toward the rrv binding her crimson hair into a bun to suit up pulaski hesitated and glanced at the hundred dots of cooling metal disks on the sidewalk and lodged against the front of the building then at the stiff wire hanging from the window they did shut the power off in there didnt they sachs just motioned him to follow her chapter wearing drab dark blue algonquin consolidated power worker overalls a baseballstyle cap without logo and safety glasses the man busied himself at the service panel in the back of the health club in the chelsea district of manhattan as he did his workmounting equipment and stripping connecting and snipping wires he thought about the attack that morning the news was all over the incident one man was killed and several injured this morning when an overload in a power company substation in manhattan produced a huge spark that jumped from the station to a bus sign pole narrowly missing an mta bus it was like you know a lightning bolt one witness a passenger on the bus reported just filled the whole sidewalk it blinded me and that sound i cant describe it it was like this loud growl then it exploded im afraid to go near anything thats got electricity in it im really freaked out i mean anybody who saw that thing is freaked out youre not alone the man thought people had been conscious ofand awed and frightened byelectricity for more than five thousand years the word itself came from the greek for amber a reference to the solidified tree resin that the ancients would rub to create static charges the numbing effects of electricity created by eels and fish in the rivers and off the coasts of egypt greece and rome were described at length in scientific writings well before the christian era his thoughts turned to water creatures at the moment since as he worked he furtively watched five people swimming slow laps in the clubs pool three women and two men all of retirement age one particular fish hed come to be fascinated with was the torpedo ray which gave its name to the weapons fired by submarines the latin word torporeto stiffen or paralyzewas the source of the name the ray had in effect two batteries in its body made up of hundreds of thousands of gelatinous plates these generated electricity which a complicated array of nerves transported through its body like wires the current was used for defense but also offensively for hunting rays would lie in wait and then use a charge to numb their next meal or sometimes kill it outrightlarger rays could generate up to two hundred volts and deliver more amps than an electric drill pretty fascinating he finished rigging the panel and regarded his job like linemen and master electricians all over the world he felt a certain pride at the neatness hed come to feel that working with electricity was more than a trade it was a science and an art closing the door he walked to the far side of the clubnear the mens locker room and out of sight he waited like a torpedo ray this neighborhoodthe far west sidewas residential no workers were getting their jogs or swims or squash games in now early afternoon though the place would fill up after working hours with hundreds of locals eager to sweat away the tensions of the day but he didnt need a large crowd not at the moment that would come later so people would think he was simply another worker and ignore him he turned his attention to a fire control panel and took the cover off examining the guts without much interest thinking again about electric rays those that lived in salt water were wired in parallel circuits and produced lower voltage because seawater was a better conductor than fresh and the jolt didnt need to be so powerful to kill their prey electric rays that inhabited rivers and lakes on the other hand were wired in series and produced higher voltage to compensate for the lower conductivity of freshwater this to him was not only fascinating but was relevant at the momentfor this test about the conductivity of water he wondered if hed made the calculations right he had to wait for only ten minutes before he heard footsteps and saw one of the lap swimmers a balding man in his sixties padding by on slippers he entered the showers the man in the overalls snuck a peek at the swimmer turning the faucet on and stepping under the stream of steaming water unaware that he was being studied three minutes five lathering washing growing impatient because of the risk of detection gripping the remote controlsimilar to a large carkey fobthe man in the overalls felt his shoulder muscles stiffening torpore he laughed silently and relaxed finally the club member stepped out of the shower and toweled off he pulled his robe on and then stepped back into the slippers he walked to the door leading to the locker room and took the handle the overalls man pressed two buttons on the remote simultaneously the elderly man gave a gasp and froze then stepped back staring at the handle looking at his fingers and quickly touching the handle once more foolish of course youre never faster than electricity but there was no shock this time and the man was left to consider if maybe it was a burr of sharp metal or maybe even a painful jolt of arthritis in his fingers that hed felt in fact the trap had contained only a few milliamps of juice he wasnt here to kill anyone this was simply an experiment to tell two things first would the remote control switchgear hed created work at this distance through concrete and steel it had fine and second what exactly was the effect of water on conductivity this was the sort of thing that safety engineers talked and wrote about all the time but that no one had ever quantified in any practical sensepractical meaning how little juice did one need to stun somebody wearing damp leather footgear into fibrillation and death the answer was pretty damn little good freaked me out the man in the overalls headed down the stairwell and out the back door he thought again about fish and electricity this time though not the creation of juice but the detection of it sharks in particular they had literally a sixth sense the astonishing ability to perceive the bioelectrical activity within the body of prey miles away long before they could see it he glanced at his watch and supposed the investigation at the substation was well under way it was unfortunate for whoever was looking into the incident there that human beings didnt have a sharks sixth sense just as it would soon be unfortunate for many other people in the poor city of new york chapter sachs and pulaski dressed in hooded baby blue tyvek jumpsuits masks booties and safety glasses as rhyme had always instructed they each wrapped a rubber band around the feet to make differentiating their footprints from the others easier then encircling her waist with a belt to which were attached her radiovideo transmitter and weapon sachs stepped over the yellow tape the maneuver sending some jolts of pain through her arthritic joints on humid days or after a bout of running a tough scene or a foot pursuit the knees or hips screaming she harbored secret envy of lincoln rhymes numbness shed never utter the thought aloud of course never even gave the crazy idea more than a second or two in her mind but there it was advantages in all conditions she paused on the sidewalk all by herself within the deadly perimeter when rhyme had been head of investigation resourcesthe outfit at nypd in charge of crime sceneshe ordered his forensic people to search alone unless the scene was particularly large he did this because you tended psychologically to be less conscientious with other searchers present since you were aware there was always a backup to find something you missed the other problem was that just as criminals left behind evidence crime scene searchers however swaddled in protective gear did too this contamination could ruin the case the more searchers the greater that risk she looked into the gaping black doorway smoke still escaping and then considered the gun on her hip metal the linesre dead well get going she told herself the sooner you walk the grid after a crime the better the quality of the evidence dots of sweat full of helpful dna evaporated and became impossible to spot valuable fibers and hairs blew away and irrelevant ones floated into the scene to confuse and mislead she slipped the microphone into her ear inside the hood and adjusted the stalk mike she clicked the transmitter at her side and heard rhymes voice through the headset you there sachs are okay youre online was wondering whats that he asked he was seeing the same things she was thanks to a small highdefinition video camera on a headband she realized she was unintentionally looking at the hole burned into the pole she explained to him what had happened the spark the molten raindrops rhyme was silent for a moment then he said thats quite a weapon well lets get going walk the grid there were several ways to search crime scenes one popular approach was to begin in the outside corner and walk in an increasingly smaller concentric circle until you reached the center but lincoln rhyme preferred the grid pattern he sometimes told students to think of walking the grid as if mowing a lawnonly doing so twice you walked along a straight line down one side of the scene to the other then turned around stepped a foot or so to the left or right and went back in the direction youd just come then once youd finished you turned perpendicular to the lines you first walked and started all over again doing the same backandforth rhyme insisted on this redundancy because the first search of a scene was crucial if you did a cursory examination initially you subtly convinced yourself that there was nothing to be found subsequent searches were largely useless sachs reflected on the irony she was about to walk the grid in part of a very different grid shed have to share that with rhymebut later now she needed to concentrate crime scene work was a scavenger hunt the goal was simple to find something anything left behind by the perpand something would have been left behind the french criminalist edmond locard nearly a hundred years earlier had said that whenever a crime occurred there was a transfer of some evidence between the perpetrator and the crime scene or the victim it might be virtually impossible to see but it was there to find if you knew how to look and if you were patient and diligent amelia sachs now began this search starting outside the substation with the weapon the dangling cable looks like he or they rhyme corrected through the headset if justice for is behind this they might have a sizeable membership good point rhyme he was making sure she didnt fall into the numberone problem crime scene searchers suffered from failure to keep an open mind a body blood and a hot pistol suggested that the victim was shot to death but if you got it into your head that that was the case you might miss the knife that was actually used she continued well he or they rigged it from inside but id think he had to be outside here on the sidewalk at some point to check distances and angles to aim it at the bus exactly okay keep goingthe sidewalk then she did staring at the ground cigarette butts beer caps nothing near the door or the window with the cable though dont bother with them hes not going to be smoking or drinking on the job hes too smartconsidering how he put this whole thing together but thered be some trace where he stood close to the building theres a ledge see it she was looking down at a low stone shelf about three feet above the sidewalk the top was set with spikes to keep pigeons and humans from perching there but you could use it as a step if you wanted to reach something in the window got some footprints on the ledge not enough for electrostatic lets see she bent her head down and leaned forward he was looking at what she was shapes that could be toe marks of shoes close to the building you cant get prints no not clear enough but looking at them id say theyre probably mens wide square toes but thats all i can see no soles or heels but it tells us that if theres a they involved it was probably just a he rigging the trap outside she continued to examine the sidewalk and found no items of physical evidence that seemed relevant get trace sachs and then search inside the substation at her instruction the other two techs from queens set up powerful halogen lights just inside the door she took pictures and then collected trace on the sidewalk and the ledge near the cable and dont forget rhyme began substrata ah one step ahead of me sachs not really she reflected since hed been her mentor for years and if she hadnt picked up his procedures for walking the grid by now she had no business in crime scene work she now moved to an area just outside the perimeter and took a second rollingsubstrata control samples to compare to the first any difference between what was collected at some distance from the scene and at the spot where the unsub was known to have stood might be unique to him or his dwelling might not of course but that was the nature of crime scene work nothing was ever certain but you did what you could you did what you had to sachs handed off the bagged evidence to the technicians she waved to the algonquin supervisor shed spoken to earlier the field supervisor just as solemn as before hurried over yes detective im going to search inside now can you tell me exactly what to look forhow he rigged the cable i need to find where he stood what he touched let me find somebody who does regular maintenance here he looked over the workers then he called to another man in dark blue algonquin consolidated power overalls a yellow hardhat the worker tossed aside his cigarette and joined them the field supervisor introduced them and told him sachss request yes maam he said his eyes leaving the substation for an excursion across sachss chest even though her figure was largely hidden by her billowy blue tyvek jumpsuit she thought about glancing down at his excessive belly but of course she didnt dogs pee where you dont want them to you cant correct them all the time she asked ill be able to see where he attached the cable to the power source everythingll be in the open yeah the man told her id think hed connect close to the breakers theyre on the main floor thatll be on the right side when you get in there ask him if the line was live when the unsub rigged it rhyme said into her ear thatll tell us something about the perps skill she did oh yeah he tapped into a hot line sachs was shocked how could he do that wore ppepersonal protective equipment and made sure he was insulated pretty damn good on top of that rhyme added ive got another question for him ask him how he gets any work done if he spends so much time staring at womens breasts she stifled a smile but as she walked toward the entrance traipsing along the sidewalk over the molten dots all humor vanished she paused turned back to the supervisor just confirming one last time no power right she nodded at the substation the lines are dead oh yeah sachs turned then he added except for the batteries batteries she stopped and looked back the supervisor explained thats what operates the circuit breakers but theyre not part of the grid they wont be connected to the cable okay those batteries could they be dangerous the image of the polkadot wounds covering the passengers body kept surfacing well sure this was apparently a naive question he added but the terminalsre covered with insulated caps sachs turned and walked back to the substation im going inside rhyme she approached noting that for some reason the powerful lights made the interior even more ominous than when it was dark the door to hell she was thinking im getting seasick sachs whatre you doing what she was doing she realized was hesitating looking around focusing on the gaping doorway she realized that though rhyme couldnt see it she was also rubbing her finger compulsively against the quick of her thumb sometimes she broke the skin doing this and surprised herself by finding dots or streaks of blood that was bad enough but she sure didnt want to break through the latex glove now and contaminate the scene with her own trace she straightened her fingers and said just checking it out but theyd known each other too long for any bullshit he asked whats wrong sachs took a deep breath finally she answered little spooked got to say that arc thing the way the vic died it was pretty bad you want to wait call in some experts from algonquin they can walk you through it she could tell from his voice a tone a pacing of his words that he didnt want her to it was one of the things she loved about himthe respect he showed by not coddling her at home at dinner in bed they were one thing here they were criminalist and crime scene cop she thought of her personal mantra inherited from her father when you move they cant getcha so move no im fine amelia sachs stepped into hell chapter can you see okay yes rhyme responded sachs had clicked on the halogen lamp affixed to her headband small but powerful it shined a fierce beam throughout the dim space even with the halogens there were many shadowy crevices the substation was cavernous inside though from the sidewalk it had seemed smaller narrow and dwarfed by the buildings on either side her eyes burned and nose stung from the smoke residue rhyme insisted that anyone searching scenes smell the air scents could tell you a great deal about the perp and the nature of the crime here though the only odor was a sour perfume a burnedrubber metallic oily odor reminding her of car engines she flashed on memories of herself and her father spending sunday afternoons backs aching hunched over the open hood of a chevy or dodge muscle car coaxing the mechanical nervous and vascular systems back to life more recent memories too sachs and pammy the teenager whod become a surrogate niece together tuning the torino cobra as pammys small dog jackson sat patiently on the tool bench and watched the surgeons at work swinging her head to train her miners light around the hazy area she noticed large banks of equipment some beige or gray and relatively newlooking some dating back to the last century dark green and labeled with metal plaques offering the manufacturer and city of origin some she noted had addresses with no zip codes revealing the distant era of their birth the main floor of the station was circular overlooking the open basement twenty feet below visible over a pipe railing up here the floor was concrete but some of the platforms and the stairs were steel metal one thing she knew about electricity was that metal was a good conductor she located the unsubs cable running from the window about ten feet to a piece of equipment that the worker had described she could see where the suspectd had to stand to string the wire she began walking the grid at that spot rhyme asked whats that on the floor shiny looks like grease or oil she said her voice falling some of the equipment ruptured in the fire or maybe there was a second arc here she noted burned circles a dozen of them which seemed to be where sparks had slammed into the walls and surrounding equipment good what his footprintsll come through nice and clear this was true but as she looked down at the greasy residue on the floor she was thinking was oil like metal and water a good conductor too and where are the fucking batteries she did indeed find some good footprints near the window in which the perp had knocked a hole to feed the deadly wire outside and near where hed bolted it to the algonquin line couldve been left by the workers she said of the prints when they came in after the spark well just have to find out wont we she or ron pulaski would take prints of the workers footgear to compare with these to eliminate them as suspects even if justice for was ultimately responsible there was no reason why they couldnt recruit an insider for their terrorist plans though as she laid down numbers and photographed the sole marks she said i think theyre our unsubs rhyme theyre all the same and the toes similar to what was on the ledge excellent rhyme breathed sachs then took electrostatic impressions of them and put the sheets near the door she looked over the cable itself which was thinner than she expected only about a half inch in diameter it was covered with black insulation of some kind and was made of silvercolored strands woven together it wasnt she was surprised to see copper about fifteen feet long in total it was joined to the algonquin main line by two wide brass or copper bolts with threequarterinch holes in them so thats our weapon rhyme asked thiss it heavy she hefted it gripping the rubbery insulation no its aluminum it was troubling to her that like a bomb something so small and light could cause such mayhem sachs looked over the hardware and judged what shed need from her tool kit to dismantle it she stepped outside to retrieve the bag from her cars trunk her own tools which she used on her car and for home repair were more familiar to her than the ones in the crime scene unit rrv they were like old friends hows it going pulaski asked its going she muttered you find how he got in i checked the roof no access whatever the algonquin people said im thinking it has to be underground im going to check out nearby manholes and basements therere no obvious routes but thats the good news i guess he mightve been feeling pretty cocky if were lucky we might find something good rhyme constantly urged officers under him to remember that one crime always had multiple scenes associated with it there was yes perhaps just one location where the actual offense had occurred but therere always entrance and exit routes to considerand those might be two different paths or more if multiple perps were involved there could be staging areas there could be rendezvous locations and there could be the motel where they got together to gloat and share the loot afterward and nine times out of ten its those scenesthe secondary or tertiarywhere the perps forgot to wear gloves and clean up trace sometimes they even left their names and addresses lying around through sachss microphone rhyme had heard the comment and said good call rookie only lose the luck yessir and lose the smug grin too i saw that pulaskis face went still hed forgotten rhyme was using amelia sachs for his eyes as well as ears and legs he turned and walked off to continue his search for the perps access to the substation returning inside with her tools sachs wiped them down with adhesive pads to remove any contaminating trace she walked up to the circuit breaker the spot where the attackers cable was mounted with the bolts she started to reach for the metal portion of the wire involuntarily her gloved hand stopped before she touched it she stared at the raw metal gleaming under the beam of her helmet light sachs rhymes voice startled her she didnt answer saw in her mind the hole in the pole the deadly bits of molten steel the holes in the young victim the lines are dead but what if she got her hand on the metal and somebody two or three miles away in a comfy little control room decided to make it undead hit a switch not knowing about the search and where the fuck are those damn batteries we need the evidence back here rhyme said right she slipped a nylon cover over the end of her wrench so that any distinctive marks on her tools wouldnt transfer to the nuts or bolts and be confused with marks left by the perps she leaned forward and with only a moment of hesitation fitted the wrench onto the first bolt with some effort she loosened it working as quickly as she could expecting to feel a searing burn at any moment though she supposed with that much voltage she wouldnt feel anything at all as she was electrocuted the second fixture was undone a moment later and she pulled the cable free coiling it she wrapped the wire in plastic sheeting the bolts and nuts went into an evidence bag she set these outside the substation door for pulaski or the technicians to collect and returned to continue her search looking at the floor she saw more footsteps that seemed to match what she thought were the unsubs cocking her head youre making me dizzy sachs she asked herself as much as rhyme what was that you hear something yes cant you if i could hear it i wouldnt be asking it seemed to be a tapping of some sort she walked to the center of the substation and looked over the railing into darkness below her imagination no the sound was unmistakable i do hear it rhyme said its coming from downstairs the basement a regular beat not like a human sound a timed detonator she wondered and thought again about a booby trap the perp was smart hed know that a crime scene team would spare no effort to search the substation hed want to stop them she shared these thoughts with rhyme he replied but if hed put together a trap why hadnt he done it near the wire they came to the same conclusion simultaneously but he voiced the thought because theres some greater threat to him in the basement rhyme then pointed out if the powers off whats making the noise it doesnt sound like onesecond intervals rhyme it might not be a timer she was gazing over the railing careful not to touch the metal he said its dark i cant see much im going to find out and then she started down the spiral staircase the metal staircase ten feet fifteen twenty random shafts of light from the halogens hit portions of the walls down here but only the upper portions below that everything was murky the smoke residue thick her breaths were shallow and she struggled not to choke as she approached the bottom two full stories below the main floor it was hard to see anything the miners light reflected back into her eyes still it was the only illumination she had she swung her head with the light from side to side taking in the myriad boxes and machinery and wires and panels covering the walls she hesitated tapped her weapon and stepped off the bottom of the stairs and gasped as a jolt pierced her body sachs what sachs had missed the fact that the floor was covered in two feet of freezing brackish water she couldnt see it with the smoke water rhyme i wasnt expecting it and look she focused ten feet or so over her head at a pipe that was leaking that was the sound not a click but dripping water the idea of water in an electrical substation was so incongruousand so dangerousthat it hadnt occurred to her that this could be the source of the noise because of the blast no he drilled a hole rhyme i can see it two holes waters also flowing down the wallthats whats filling up the room wasnt water as good an electrical conductor as metal sachs wondered and she was standing in a pool of it right next to an array of wires and switches and connections above a sign danger volts rhymes voice startled her hes flooding the basement to destroy evidence right sachs whats that i cant see it clearly that box the big one look to the right yes there what is it ah finally its the battery rhyme the backup battery is it charged they said it was but i dont she waded closer and looked down a gauge on the battery showed that it was indeed charged in fact to sachs it looked like it was overcharged the needle was past percent then she remembered something else the algonquin workers had said not to worry because it was sealed with insulated caps except that it wasnt she knew what battery caps looked like and this unit had none two metal terminals connected to thick cables were exposed the waters rising itll hit the terminals in a few minutes is there enough current to make one of those arc flashes i dont know rhyme there has to be he whispered hes using an arc to destroy something thatll lead us to him something he couldnt take with him or destroy when he was there can you shut the water off she looked quickly no faucets that i can see hold on a minute sachs continued to study the basement i dont see what he wants to destroy though but then she spotted it right behind the battery about four feet off the ground was an access door it wasnt largeabout eighteen inches square thats it rhyme thats how he got in must be a sewer or utility tunnel on the other side but leave it pulaski can trace it from the street just get out no rhyme look at itits really tight hed have to squeeze through its got some good trace on it has to fibers hair maybe dna why else would he want to destroy it rhyme was hesitating he knew she was right about preserving the evidence but didnt want her caught in another arc flash explosion she waded closer to the access door but as she approached a tiny wake rose from the disturbance of her legs and the waves nearly crested the battery she froze sachs shhh she had to concentrate by moving a few inches at a time she was able to keep the waves below the top of the power source but she could see she had no more than one or two minutes until the water hit the leads with a straightbladed screwdriver she began to remove the frame holding the access door the water was now nearly to the top of the battery every time she leaned forward to get leverage to unscrew the paintstuck hardware another small tide rose and the murky water sloshed up onto the top of the battery before receding the batterys voltage was certainly smaller than the hundredthousandvolt line that had produced the arc flash outside but the unsub probably didnt need to cause that much damage his point was to create a big enough explosion to destroy the access door and whatever evidence it contained she wanted the damn door sachs rhyme whispered ignoring him and ignoring the image of the cauterized holes in the smooth flesh of the victim the molten teardrops finally the last screw came out old paint held the door frame in place she jammed the tip of the screwdriver into the edge and slammed her hand onto the butt of the tool with a crack the metal came away in her hands the door and frame were heavier than shed thought and she nearly dropped it but then she steadied herself without sending a tsunami over the battery in the opening she saw the narrow utility tunnel that the suspect would have used to sneak into the substation rhyme whispered urgently into the tunnel itll protect you hurry im trying except the access door wouldnt fit through the opening even diagonally because the frame was attached cant do it she said explaining the problem ill go back up the stairs no sachs just leave the door get out through the tunnel its too good a piece of evidence clutching the access door she began her escape wading toward the stairs glancing back from time to time to keep an eye on the battery she moved agonizingly slowly even so every step sent another wave cresting to the edge of the battery terminals whats going on sachs im nearly there she whispered as if too loud a voice would create more turbulence in the water she was halfway to the steps when the water rose in tiny eddies and swirled around first one terminal then the next no arc flash nothing her shoulders sagged heart thumping its a dud rhyme we didnt have to worr a burst of white light filled her vision accompanied by a huge cracking roar and amelia sachs was flung backward under the surface of the grim ocean chapter thom the aide hurried into the room looking rhyme over carefully whats wrong howre you feeling its not me his boss snapped eyes wide nodding his head at the blank screen amelia she was at a scene a battery another arc flash the audio and video are out call pulaski call somebody thom restons eyes narrowed with concern but he had practiced the art of caregiving for a long time no matter what the crisis he would coolly go about his necessary tasks he calmly picked up a landline phone regarded the number pad nearby and hit a speeddial button panic isnt centered in the gut and it doesnt trickle down the spine like well electricity in an energized wire panic rattles the body and soul everywhere even if youre numb otherwise rhyme was furious with himself he should have ordered sachs out the instant they saw the battery the rising tide he always did this got so focused on the case the goal finding the tiny fiber the fragment of friction ridge print anything that moved him closer to the perp that he forgot the implications he was playing with human lives why look at his own injury hed been a captain in the nypd the head of investigation resources and was searching a crime scene himself crouching to pick up a fiber from a body when the beam tumbled from above and changed his life forever and now that same attitudewhich hed instilled in amelia sachsmight have done even worse she could now be dead thom had gotten through on the line who rhyme demanded glaring at the aide whore you talking to is she all right thom held up a hand what does that mean what could that possibly mean rhyme felt a trickle of sweat down his forehead he was aware his breath was coming faster his heart was pounding though he sensed this in his jaw and neck not his chest of course thom said its ron hes at the substation i know where the fuck he is whats going on theres been an incident thats what theyre saying incident wheres amelia theyre checking therere some people inside they heard an explosion i know there was an explosion i fucking saw it the aides eyes swiveled toward rhyme are you how are you feeling quit asking that whats going on at the scene thom continued to scan rhymes face youre flushed im fine the criminalist said calmlyto get the young man to focus on his phone call really then the aides head tilted sideways and to rhymes horror he stiffened his shoulders rose slightly no okay thom said into the phone okay what the criminalist snapped thom ignored his boss give me the information and cradling the phone between neck and shoulder he began to type on the keyboard of the labs main computer the screen popped to life rhyme had lost the pretense of calm and was about to lose his temper when on the screen up came the image of an apparently uninjured though very wet amelia sachs strands of her red hair were plastered around her face like seaweed on a surfacing scuba diver sorry rhyme lost the main camera when i went under she coughed hard and wiped at her forehead examined her fingers with a look of distaste the motion was jerky relief immediately replaced panic though the angerat himselfremained sachs was staring back somewhat eerily her eyes focused only in his general direction im on one of the algonquin workers laptops its got a camera set up on it can you see me okay yes yes but youre all right just took in some pretty disgusting water through my nose but im okay rhyme was asking what happened the arc flash it wasnt an arc the battery wasnt rigged for that the algonquin guy told me there wasnt enough voltage what the unsub did was make a bomb apparently you can do that with batteries you seal the vents and overcharge it that produces hydrogen gas when water hits the terminals it shortcircuits and the spark ignites the hydrogen thats what happened and have the medics looked you over no no need the bang was loud but it wasnt that big i got hit by some bits of plastic from the housing didnt even bruise me the impact knocked me down but i kept the access door above the water i dont think its contaminated too bad good ame his voice braked to a halt for some reason years ago theyd settled on an unspoken superstition they never used their first names he was troubled that he nearly had good so thats how he got in had to be it was then that he was aware of thom walking toward the wall the aide grabbed the blood pressure monitor and wrapped it around rhymes arm dont do that quiet thom barked silencing rhyme youre flushed and youre sweating because we just had a fucking incident at a crime scene thom you have a headache he did he said no dont lie a little one its nothing thom slapped the stethoscope against his arm sorry amelia i need him quiet for thirty seconds sure rhyme started to protest again but then he decided that the sooner his blood pressure was taken the sooner he could get back to work without sensation he watched the cuff inflate and thom listened as he let the air out of the sphygmomanometer he ripped off the velcro noisily its high i want to make sure it doesnt get any higher im going to take care of some things now a polite euphemism for what rhyme bluntly called the piss and shit detail sachs asked whats going on there thom everything okay yes rhyme was struggling to keep his voice calm and to obscure the fact that he felt oddly vulnerable though whether it was her near miss or his troubled condition he couldnt say he was embarrassed too thom said hes had a spike in blood pressure i want him off the phone now well bring back the evidence rhyme be there in a half hour thom was starting forward to disconnect the call when rhyme felt a tap in his headit was cognitive not physical he barked wait meaning the command for both thom and sachs lincoln his aide protested please thom just two minutes its important though clearly suspicious of the polite appeal thom nodded reluctantly ron was searching for the place the perp got into the tunnel right yes is he there her jerky grainfilled image looked around yes get him on camera he heard sachs call the officer over a moment later he was seated staring out of the monitor yessir you find where he got into the tunnel behind the substation yep yep you sound like a dog rookie yip yip sorry yes i did where theres a manhole in an alley up the street algonquin power it was for access to steam pipes it didnt lead to the substation itself but about twenty feet inside maybe thirty i found a grating somebodyd cut an opening into it big enough to climb through theyd stuck it back up but i could see itd been cut recently right because there was no rust on the cut edges yeah i mean yes it led to this tunnel it was really old mightve been for delivering coal or something a long time ago thats what went to the access door that amelia got i was at the end of the tunnel and i saw the light when she took the door off and i heard the battery blow and her scream i got to her right away through the tunnel the gruffness fell away thanks pulaski an awkward moment rhymes compliments were so rare hed found that people didnt quite know what to do with them i was careful not to contaminate the scene too much though to save lives contaminate to your hearts content remember that sure the criminalist continued you walked the grid at the manholeand where he cut through the grating and the tunnel yessir anything jump out just footprints but ive got trace well see what it says thom whispered firmly lincoln just a minute more now i need you to do something else rookie you see that restaurant or coffee shop across the street from the power station the officer looked to his right ive got it wait howd you know there was one there oh from one of my neighborhood strolls rhyme said chuckling i the young man was flustered i know because there has to be one our unsub wanted to be able to see the substation for the attack he couldnt watch from a hotel room because hed have to register or an office building because it would be too suspicious hed be someplace where he could sit at his leisure oh i get it you mean psychologically he gets off on watching the fireworks the time for compliments was over jesus christ rookie thats profiling how do i feel about profiling uhm youre not exactly a big fan lincoln rhyme caught sachs in the background smiling he needed to see how the device was working hed created something unique his arc flash gun isnt the sort of thing he could testfire at a rifle range he had to make adjustments to the voltage and the circuit breakers as he went along he had to make sure it discharged at the exact moment when the bus was there he started manipulating the grid computer at eleventwenty and in ten minutes it was all over go talk to the manager at the restaurant coffee shop of the coffee shop and see if anybody was inside near a window for a while before the explosion he wouldve left right after before police and fire got there oh and find out if they have broadband and whos the provider thom now in rubber gloves was gesturing impatiently the piss and shit detail pulaski said sure lincoln and then the young officer interrupted seal off the restaurant and walk the grid where he was sitting exactly right rookie then both of you get the hell back here asap with a flick of one of his working fingers rhyme ended the call beating thoms own digit to the button by a millisecond chapter the cloud zone fred dellray was thinking recalling when assistant special agent in charge tucker mcdaniel newly on board in the fbis new york office had gathered the troops and given in lecture form a talk similar to what hed just delivered at rhymes a few hours earlier about the new methods of communication the bad guys were using about how the acceleration of technology was making it easier for them and harder for us the cloud zone dellray understood the concept of course you couldnt be in law enforcement now and not be aware of mcdaniels hightech approach to finding and collaring perps but that didnt mean he liked it not one bit largely because of what the phrase stood for it was an emblem for fundamental maybe cataclysmic changes in everyones life changes in his life too heading downtown on a subway on this clear afternoon dellray was thinking about his father a professor at marymount manhattan college and a writer of several books about africanamerican philosophers and cultural critics the man had eased into academia at the age of thirty and hed never left he died at the same desk hed called home for decades slumping forward on proofs of the journal hed founded when martin luther kings assassination was still fresh in the worlds mind the politics had changed drastically during his fathers lifetimethe death of communism the wounding of racial segregation the birth of nonstate enemies computers replaced typewriters and the library cars had airbags tv channels propagated from fourplus uhfto hundreds but very little about the mans lifestyle had altered in a core way the elder dellray thrived in his enclosed world of academia specifically philosophy and oh how he had wanted his son to settle there too examining the nature of existence and the human condition hed tried to fill his son with a love of the same to some extent he was successful questioning brilliant discerning young fred did indeed develop a fascination with humankind in all its incarnations metaphysics psychology theology epistemology ethics and politics he loved it all but it took only one month as a graduate assistant to realize hed go mad if he didnt put his talents to practical use and never one to pull back he sought out the rawest and most intense practical application of philosophy he could think of he joined the fbi change his father reconciled himself to his sons apostasy and they enjoyed coffee and long walks in prospect park during which they came to understand that although their laboratories and techniques were different their outlooks and insights were not the human condition observed and written about by the father and experienced firsthand by the son in the unlikely form of undercover work freds intense curiosity about and insights into the nature of life made him a natural everyman unlike most undercover cops with their limited acting skills and repertoires dellray could truly become the people he played once when dellray was in disguise as a homeless man on the streets of new york not far from the federal building the then assistant special agent in charge of the manhattan office of the fbidellrays boss in effectwalked right past and dropped a quarter into his cup never recognizing him one of the best compliments dellray ever received a chameleon one week a scorchedbrain tweaker desperate for meth the next a south african envoy with nuclear secrets to sell then a somalian imams lieutenant lugging around a hatred of america and a hundred quotations from the koran he owned dozens of outfits purchased or hacked together by himself which now clogged the basement of the townhouse he and serena had bought a few years ago in bkbrooklyn hed advanced in his career which was inevitable for someone with his drive skill and absolute lack of desire to stab fellow workers in the back now dellray primarily ran other undercover fbi agents and civilian confidential informantsaka snitchesthough he still got into the field occasionally and loved it just as much as he ever had but then came the change cloud zone dellray didnt deny that both the good guys and the bad guys were getting smarter and more techsavvy the shift was obvious humintthe fruits of intelligence gathering from humantohuman contactwas giving way to sigint but it was a phenomenon that dellray simply wasnt comfortable with in her youth serena had tried to be a torch singer she was a natural at all forms of dance from ballet to jazz to modern but she just didnt have the skill to sing dellray was the same with the new law enforcement of data numbers technology he kept running his snitches and he kept going undercover himself and getting results but with mcdaniel and his t and a teamoh scuse me tuckerhis tech and com team oldschool dellray was feeling well old the asac was sharp a hard workerputting in sixtyhour work weeksand an infighter hed stand up for his agents against the president if he needed to and his techniques had worked last month mcdaniels people had picked up sufficient details from encrypted satellite phone calls to pinpoint a fundamentalist cell outside milwaukee the message to dellray and the older agents was clear your times passing he still stung from the dig possibly inadvertent delivered at the meeting in rhymes lab well keep at it fred youre doing a good job meaning i didnt even expect you to come up with any leads to justice for and rahman maybe mcdaniel was right to criticize after all dellray had as good a network of cis in place as you could hope for to track terrorist activities he met with them regularly he worked them all hard doling out protection to the fearful kleenex to the weteyed guilty cash to the ones who informed as a livelihood and painful squeezes to the shoulders and psyches of those whod gotten as dellrays grandmother said too big for their britches but of all the information hed gathered about terrorist plots even embryonic ones thered been nothing about rahmans justice for or about a big fucking spark and here mcdaniels people had made an id and defined a real threat by sitting on their asses like the drones in the middle east and afghanistan you know the pilots are next to a strip mall in colorado springs or omaha dellray had another concern too one that had arisen around the same time as youthful mcdaniel appeared maybe he just wasnt as good as he used to be rahman mightve been right under his nose cell members in justice for mightve been studying electrical engineering in bk or new jersey the same way the nineeleven hijackers had studied flying then something else he had to admit hed been distracted lately something from his other life he called it his life with serena which he kept as separate from the street as youd keep flame from gasoline and that something was pretty significant fred dellray was now a father serena had had a baby boy a year ago theyd talked about it beforehand and shed insisted that even after their child was born dellray wouldnt change his job one bit even if it involved running dangerous undercover sets she understood that his work defined him the way dancing defined her it would be more dangerous to him ultimately to move behind a desk but was being a father altering him as an agent dellray looked forward to taking preston to the park or a store with him feeding the boy reading to him serena had come by the nursery laughed and gently taken kierkegaards existentialist manifesto fear and trembling from dellrays lengthy hand and replaced it with goodnight moon dellray hadnt realized that even at that young age words count the subway now stopped in the village and passengers rustled aboard instinctively the undercover operative within him immediately spotted four people of note two almostguaranteedtobe pickpockets one kid who was carrying a knife or box cutter and a young sweaty businessman pressing a protective hand against a pocket so hard that hed split open the bag of coke if he wasnt careful the street how fred dellray loved the street but these four had nothing to do with his mission and he let them fade from his consciousness as he told himself okay you fucked up you missed rahman and you missed justice for but the casualties and damage were minimal mcdaniel was condescending but hasnt made you a scapegoat not yet which somebody else mightve done in a heartbeat dellray could still find a lead to their unsub and stop him before another of those terrible attacks happened dellray could still redeem himself at the next subway stop he climbed out and began his trek east eventually he came to bodegas and tenements and old dark social clubs rancidsmelling diners radio taxi operations whose signs were in spanish or arabic or farsi no fastmoving professionals like in the west village here people werent moving around much at all but merely sittingmen mostlyon rickety chairs or on doorsteps the young ones slim the old round they all watched with cautious eyes this was where the serious work of the street got done this was fred dellrays office he strode up to a coffee shop window and looked insidewith some difficulty since the glass hadnt been cleaned for months ah yeah there he spotted what would either be his salvation or his downfall his last chance tapping one ankle against the other just to make sure the pistol strapped there hadnt shifted he opened the door and stepped inside chapter how are you feeling sachs asked walking into the lab rhyme said stiffly im fine wheres the evidence sentences spoken without discernible punctuation the techs and ron are bringing it i took the cobra by myself meaning he supposed shed driven home like a crazy woman and how are you thom asked wet which went without saying her hair was drying but the clothes were still drenched her condition wasnt an issue they knew she was fine theyd established that earlier rhyme had been shaken at the time but now she was all right and he wanted to get on with the evidence but isnt that just another way of saying theres a fortyfive percent chance that somebody else somewhere in new york city s going to get electrocuted and it could be happening right now well where are what happened she asked thom a glance toward rhyme i said i was fine im asking him sachss own temper flared a bit blood pressure was high spiking and now its not high thom is it lincoln rhyme said testily its nice and normal thats sort of like saying the russians sent missiles to cuba that was tense for a while but since miami isnt a radioactive crater i guess that problem sorted itself out now didnt it its in the past call pulaski call the techs from queens i want the evidence his aide ignored him and said to sachs didnt need medicine but im keeping an eye on it she gave rhyme another visual examination then said she was going upstairs to change there a problem asked lon sellitto whod arrived from downtown a few minutes before arent you feeling good linc oh jesus christ rhyme spat out is everybody deaf is everybody ignoring me then he glanced into the doorway ah at last another country heard from goddamn pulaski at least youre being productive what do we have the young cop back in uniform was carting in milk crates that the crime scene officers usually used for transporting evidence bags a moment later two techs from the queens crime scene hq brought in a bulky plasticwrapped object the wire the strangest weapon rhyme had ever seen in a case and one of the deadliest they also had the access door from the substation basement similarly wrapped in plastic pulaski the coffee shop you were right ive got some things here sir a lifted eyebrow from the criminalist reminded the officer the appellation wasnt necessary the criminalist was a retired captain of the nypd he didnt have any more right to a formal title or sir than anybody else on the street and hed been trying to break pulaski of his wispy insecuritiesthey were due to youth of course but there was more to it hed sustained a serious head injury on the first case theyd worked together it had nearly ended his career in law enforcement but hed stayed on the force despite the injury and the resulting bouts of confusion and disorientation that occasionally still plagued him his determination to remain a cop had been inspired largely by rhymes decision to do the same in furthering his cause to make pulaski a top crime scene officer one of the most important things rhyme needed to instill was a bulletproof ego you could have all the skills in the world but they were useless if you didnt have the balls to back them up before he died he wanted to see pulaski move up high in the ranks of crime scene in new york city he knew it could happenhe had a brief image of a hope of his pulaski and sachs running the unit together rhymes legacy he thanked the cs technicians as they left with respectful nods and expressions that suggested they were memorizing what the lab looked like not many people made it over here from headquarters to see rhyme in person he occupied a special place in the hierarchy of the nypd there had been a recent turnover and the head of forensics had gone to miamidade county several senior detectives were now running the operation until a permanent head could be appointed there was even some talk of hiring rhyme back to run crime scene once more when the deputy commissioner had called about this rhyme had pointed out that he might have a few problems with the jstthe nypd job standard test portion of the requirements the physical fitness exam required candidates to complete a timed obstacle course sprint to a sixfoothigh barrier and jump over it restrain a fake bad guy race up stairs drag a pound mannequin to safety and pull the trigger of a weapon sixteen times with ones dominant hand fifteen with the other rhyme demurred explaining to the nypd official who came to see him that he could never pass the test he could probably clear only a fivefoot barrier but he was flattered by the interest sachs returned downstairs wearing jeans and a light blue sweater tucked in her hair washed and lightly damp pulled back into a ponytail once more bound with a black rubber band at that moment thom went to answer the doorbell and another figure stepped into the doorway the slim man whose retiring demeanor suggested he was a middleaged accountant or shoe salesman was mel cooper in rhymes opinion one of the best forensic lab people in the country with degrees in math physics and organic chemistry and a senior official in both the international association for identification and international association of blood pattern analysis he was constantly in demand at crime scene headquarters but since rhyme was responsible for kidnapping the tech from a job in upstate new york years ago and getting him to the nypd it was understood that cooper would drop what he was doing and head to manhattan if rhyme and sellitto were running a case and they wanted him mel glad you were available hm available didnt you call my lieutenant and threaten him with all sorts of terrible things if he didnt release me from the hanoversterns case i did it for you mel you were being wasted on insider trading and i thank you for the reprieve cooper nodded a greeting to those in the room knuckled his harry potter glasses up on his nose and walked across the lab to the examination table on silent brown hush puppies shoes though by appearances the least athletic man rhyme had ever seen apart from himself of course mel cooper nonetheless moved with the grace of a soccer player and rhyme was reminded that he was a champion ballroom dancer lets hear the details rhyme said turning to sachs she flipped through her notes and explained what the power company field executive had told her algonquin consolidated power provides electricitythey call it juicefor most of the area pennsylvania new york connecticut new jersey thats the smokestacks on the east river thats right she said to cooper their headquarters is there and they have a steam and electricity generation plant now what the algonquin supervisor said was that the unsub couldve broken into the substation at any time in the last thirtysix hours to rig the wire the substations are generally unmanned a little after eleven this morning he or they got into the algonquin computers kept shutting down substations around the area and rerouted all that electricity through the substation on fiftyseven when voltage builds up to a certain point it has to complete a circuit you cant stop it it either jumps to another wire or to something thats grounded normally the circuit breakers in the substation would pop but the perp had reset them to take ten times the load so it was sitting in thatshe pointed to the cablewaiting to burst like a dam the pressure built up and the juice had to go someplace heres how the grid works in new york one of the workers drew this for me and it was helpful sachs pulled out a piece of paper on which was a diagram she stepped to a whiteboard and with a dark blue marker transferred the writing power generation plant or incoming supply v through high tension cables transmission substation steps v down to v through area transmission lines area substation steps v down to v through distribution feeder lines spot networks in major commercial buildings steps v down to v or streetlevel transformers steps v down to v through incoming service lines households and offices v sachs continued now mhten the substation on fiftyseven is an area substation the line coming in was high voltage he couldve rigged the cable anywhere on an area transmission line but thats real tricky i guess because the voltage is so high so he was working on the output side of the area substation where the voltage is only thirteen thousand eight hundred phew sellitto muttered only then when it was rigged he set the circuit breakers higher and flooded the station with incoming juice and it blew rhyme said she picked up an evidence bag containing teardropshaped bits of metal and then it blew she repeated these were all over the place like shrapnel what are they sellitto asked molten droplets from the bus sign pole blew them everywhere nicked the concrete and went right through the sides of some cars the vic was burned but thats not what killed him her voice grew soft rhyme noticed it was like a big shotgun blast cauterized the wounds she grimaced that kept him conscious for a while take a look a nod at pulaski the officer plugged the flash cards into a nearby computer and created files for the case a moment later photos popped up on the highdef monitors nearby after years and years in the crime scene business rhyme was largely inured to even the most horrific images these though troubled him the young victims body had been riddled by the dots of metal there was little blood thanks to the searing heat of the projectiles had the perp known thats what his weapon would do sealing the punctures keeping his victims conscious to feel the pain was this part of his mo rhyme could understand now why sachs was so troubled christ the big detective muttered rhyme shook aside the image and asked who was he name was luis martin assistant manager in a music store twentyeight no record no connection to algonquin mta any reason anybodyd want him dead none sachs said wrong time wrong place sellitto summarized rhyme said ron the coffee shop whatd you find a man in dark blue overalls came into the place about ten fortyfive he had a laptop with him he went online blue overalls sellitto asked any logo id nobody saw but the algonquin workers there their uniforms were the same dark blue get a description the rumpled cop persisted probably white probably forties glasses dark cap couple people said no glasses and no cap blond hair red hair dark hair witnesses rhyme muttered disparagingly you could have a shooter naked to the waist kill somebody in front of ten witnesses and each one would describe him as wearing ten different colored tshirts in the past few years his doubt about the value of eyewitnesses had tempered somewhatbecause of sachss skill in interviewing and because of kathryn dance whod proved that analyzing body language was scientific enough in most cases to produce repeatable results still he could never completely shake his skepticism and what happened to this guy in the overalls rhyme asked nobodys really sure it was pretty chaotic all they knew was that they heard this huge bang the whole street went white with the flash and then everybody ran outside nobody could remember seeing him after that he took his coffee with him rhyme asked he loved beverage containers they were like id cards with the dna and fingerprint information they contained along with trace that adhered because of the sticky nature of milk sugar and other additives afraid he did pulaski confirmed shit whatd you find at the table this pulaski pulled a plastic envelope out of a milk crate its empty sellitto squinted and teased his imposing belly maybe scratching an itch maybe absently dismayed that his latest fad diet wasnt working but rhyme looked at the plastic bag and smiled good job rookie good job the lieutenant muttered theres nothing there my favorite sort of evidence lon the bits thatre invisible well get to that in a minute im wondering about hackers rhyme mused pulaski what about wireless at the coffee shop i was thinking about it and im betting they didnt have it youre right howd you know he couldnt take the chance that itd be down hes probably logging in through some cell phone connection but we need to find out how he got into the algonquin system lon get computer crimes on board they need to contact somebody in internet security at algonquin see if rodneys available the nypd computer crimes unit was an elite group of about thirty detectives and support staff rhyme worked with one of them occasionally detective rodney szarnek rhyme thought of him as a young man but in fact he had no idea of his age since he had the boyish attitude sloppy dress and tousled hair of a hackeran image and avocation that tend to take years off people sellitto placed the call and after a brief conversation hung up reporting that szarnek would call algonquins it team immediately to see about hacking into the grid servers cooper was looking reverently at the wire so thats it then lifting another of the bags that contained misshapen metal disks the shrapnel he added lucky nobody was walking by if thisd happened on fifth avenue there could be two dozen people dead ignoring the techs unnecessary observation rhyme focused on sachs he saw that her eyes had gone still as she looked at the tiny disks in a voice perhaps harsher than necessary to shake her attention away from the shrapnel he called come on people lets get to work chapter easing into the booth fred dellray found himself looking at a pale skinny man who could have been a wasted thirty or a preserved fifty the guy was wearing a sports jacket that was too big its source either a very lowend thrift shop or a coat rack when nobody was looking jeep uhm thats not my name anymore not your name like nacho cheese then whose cheese is it i dont get whatcha name now dellray asked frowning deeply playing a particular role one he generally slipped into with people like this jeep or not jeep had been a sadistic junkie the fbi agent had collared in an undercover set that required dellray to laugh his way through the mans graphic depiction of torturing a college kid whod reneged on a drug payment then came the bust and after some negotiation and time served the man became one of dellrays pets which meant a tight leash that had to be jerked occasionally it was jeep but i decided to change it im jim now fred changes the magic word of the day oh oh speakin of names fred fred im your buddy im your best friend i didnt remember those introductions signing your dance card meetin the parents sorry sir tell ya what stick with fred dont believe you when you say sir the man was a disgusting morsel of humanity but dellray had learned you had to walk a fine line never contempt yet never hesitate to dig in a knuckle or two the pressure of fear fear breeds respect just the way of the world now heres what were doing thiss important you got a date coming up im recalling a hearing about leaving the jurisdiction dellray didnt care about losing him jeeps usefulness was pretty much gone that was the nature of cis they have a shelf life of fresh yogurt jeepjim was going to appeal to the new york state parole board about permission to move to georgia of all places if youd put in a word fred sir thatd be great and he turned big soupy eyes the agents way wall street should take a lesson from the confidential informant world no derivatives no default swaps no insurance no cooking the books it was simple you gave your snitch something of x value and he gave you something equally important if he didnt produce he was out if you didnt pay you got shit and all so very transparent okay dellray said whatchu wants on the table now bout what i want and what i have to say up front is its time sensitive you know what that means jim somebodys gonna get fucked and pretty soon rightiero now listen close i need to find brent a pause william brent why would i know where to find him jeepjim slimjim asked this with too much rise in his voice telling dellray that the snitch had at least some idea where to find the man dellray sang georgia s on my mind a full sixty seconds passed while jeep did some negotiating with himself i mean maybe i could the thing is theres a possibility you gonna finish those sentences or can i eat em lemme check something jeepjamesjim rose and walked into the corner of the place and began texting leaving dellray amused at the paranoia about overhearing a text message jeepy boy would probably do well in georgia dellray sipped water the waiter had brought he hoped the skinny guys mission would be successful one of the agents biggest successes was running william brent a middleaged white guy unathletic and looking like a walmart checker hed been key in bringing down a very nasty conspiracy a domestic terrorist groupracists and separatistshad a plan to blow up a number of synagogues on a friday evening and blame islamic fundamentalists for it they had money but not the means so they turned to a local organized crime family who also had no love of either jews or muslims brent had been hired by the family to help and hed fallen for dellrays twitchy characteran arms dealer from haiti selling rocketpropelled grenades brent got collared and dellray turned him surprising everyone he took to confidential informing as if hed studied all his life for the job brent infiltrated high up in both the racist group and the family and brought down the conspiracy his debt to society paid brent nonetheless went on to work with dellray in various personasa meanass hired killer a jewelry and bank heist mastermind a radical antiabortion activist he proved to be one of the sharpest cis the agent had ever run and a chameleon in his own right he was the flip side of fred dellray some years ago it was even suspected but never proven that brent had run a network of his own snitchesinside the nypd itself dellray ran him for a year until he got overexposed and brent retired into the comfy quilt of witness protection but word was that in one of his new personas he remained well connected a player on the street since none of dellrays usual sources had come up with anything about justice for or rahman or the grid attack the agent thought of william brent jimmyjeep returned and sat down on the squeaking bench i think i can make it happen but whats this about man i mean i dont want him to clip me which was dellray reflected one fairly significant difference between wall street and the ci business he said no no jimmy boy youre not hearing me im not asking you tturn inta a little fly on the wall im asking you to play matchmaker is all you get me a sitdown and youll be eating peaches down in georgia in no time dellray slid forward a card that contained only a phone number thiss what he should call go make it happen now now jeep nodded toward the kitchen but my lunch i didnt eat yet what kinda place is this dellray barked suddenly looking around horrified what do you mean fred you cant get food to go chapter five hours had passed since the attack and the tension was climbing in rhymes townhouse none of the leads was panning out the wire he snapped urgently whered it come from cooper shoved his thick glasses up on his nose again he pulled on latex examining gloves but before touching the evidence he cleaned his hands with a pet hair roller and discarded the tape rhyme had been instructing his team to do this ever since hed analyzed a case for the new jersey state police and found that some fiber evidence had come not from the suspect in custody but from the inside pocket of a detectives jacket the investigator had stuffed a wad of loose rubber gloves there after seeing some cop on a popular crime scene tv show do the same the odds of contamination were slim but a forensic detectives job was only partly to find and analyze the evidence they had to make sure it remained pristine enough to convict the bad guys in a courtroom filled with sharp defense lawyers after the infamous new jersey fiber case he insisted his people roll gloves after donning them if they hadnt been in contaminationfree bags or boxes using surgical scissors cooper cut the plastic wrapper off and exposed the wire it was about fifteen feet long and most of it was covered with black insulation the wire itself wasnt solid but comprised many silvercolored strands at one end was bolted the thick scorched brass plate attached to the other end were two large copper bolts with holes in the middle theyre called split bolts the algonquin guy told me sachs said used for splicing wires thats what he used to hook the cable to the main line she then explained how hed hung the plateit was called a bus bar the worker had also explainedout the window it was attached to the cable with two quarterinch bolts the arc had flashed from the plate into the nearest ground source the pole rhyme glanced at sachss thumb ragged and dark with a bit of dried blood she tended to chew her nails and worry digits and her scalp tension built up in her like the voltage in the algonquin substation she dug into her thumb again and thenas if forcing herself to stoppulled on latex gloves of her own lon sellitto was on the phone with the officers canvassing for witnesses up and down fiftyseventh street rhyme gave him a fast questioning glance but the detectives grimacedeeper than the one that usually graced his featuresexplained that the efforts so far were unfruitful rhyme turned his attention back to the wire move the camera over it mel rhyme said slowly using a handheld video unit the tech scanned the wire from top to bottom turned it over and went back the other way what the camera saw was broadcast in high definition on the large screen in front of rhyme he stared intently he muttered bennington electrical manufacturing south chicago illinois model ammvsixty zero gauge rated up to sixty thousand volts pulaski gave a laugh you know that lincoln whered you learn about wires its printed on the side rookie oh i didnt notice obviously and our perp cut it to this length mel what do you think not machine cut id agree using a magnifying glass cooper was examining the end of the metal cable that had been bolted to the substation wire he then focused the video on the cut ends amelia their resident mechanic looked it over hand hacksaw she offered the split bolts were unique to the power industry it turned out but they could have come from dozens of sources the bolts affixing the wire to the bus bar were similarly generic lets get our charts going rhyme then said pulaski wheeled several whiteboards forward from the corner of the lab on the top of one sachs wrote crime scene algonquin substation manhattan west th street on the other was unsub profile she filled in what theyd discovered so far did he get the wire at the substation rhyme asked no there wasnt any stored there the young man said then find out where he did get it call bennington right okay rhyme continued weve got metalwork and hardware that means tool marks the hacksaw lets look at the wire closely cooper switched to a largeobject microscope also plugged into the computer and examined where the wire had been cut he used low magnification its a new saw blade sharp rhyme gave an envious glance toward the techs deft hands moving the focus and the geared stage of the scope then he returned to the screen new yes but theres a broken tooth near the handle right before people began to saw they generally rested the blade on what they were about to cut three or four times doing this especially in soft aluminum like the wire could reveal broken or bent saw teeth or other unique patterns that could link tools found in the perps possession to the one used in a crime now the split bolts cooper found distinctive scratch marks on all the bolts suggesting that the perps wrench had probably left them love soft brass rhyme muttered just love it so hes got wellused tools more and more looking like hes an insider sellitto disconnected his call nothing maybe somebody saw somebody in a blue jumpsuit but it mightve been an hour after it happened when the whole friggin block was crawling with algonquin repair crews wearing friggin blue jumpsuits whatve you found out rookie rhyme barked i want sources for the wire im on hold tell em youre a cop i did tell em youre the chief cop the big cheese i but rhymes attention was already on something else the iron bars forming the grate that barred entrance to the access tunnel how hed cut through them mel a careful look revealed he hadnt used a hacksaw but a bolt cutter cooper examined the ends of the bars through a microscope fitted with a digital camera and took pictures he then transferred the shots to the central computer and assembled them onto one screen any distinctive marks rhyme asked as with the broken hacksaw tooth and scratches on the bolts and nuts any unusual marking on the cutter would link its owner to the crime scene hows that one cooper asked pointing at the screen there was a tiny crescent of scratch in roughly the same position on the cut surfaces of several of the bars thatll do good then pulaski cocked his head and readied his pen as somebody at bennington wire picked up the phone to speak to the young cop in his new capacity as the emperor of the new york city police department after a brief conversation he hung up what the hells with the cable pulaski first of all that model cables real common they how common they sell millions of feet of it every year its mostly for mediumvoltage distribution sixty thousand volts is medium i guess so you can buy it from any electrical supply wholesaler but he did say that algonquin buys it in bulk sellitto asked who there would order it technical supplies department ill give em a call sellitto said he did so and had a brief conversation he disconnected theyre going to check to see if anythings missing from inventory rhyme was gazing at the grating so he climbed through the manhole earlier and into the algonquin work space under the alley sachs said he mightve been down the steam pipe manhole to do some work and seen the grating that led to the tunnel definitely suggests its an employee rhyme hoped this was the case inside jobs made cops work a lot easier lets keep going the boots she said similar boot prints in both the access tunnel and near where the wire was rigged inside the substation and any prints from the coffee shop that one pulaski responded as he pointed to an electrostatic print under the table looks like the same brand to me mel cooper examined it and concurred the young officer continued and amelia had me check the boots of the algonquin workers who were there they were all different rhyme turned his attention to the boot whats the brand do you think mel cooper was browsing through the nypds footwear database which contained samples of thousands of shoes and boots the vast majority of which were mens shoes most serious felonies involving physical presence at the scene were committed by men rhyme had been instrumental in creating the expanded shoe and boot database years ago he worked out voluntary arrangements with all the major manufacturers to have scans of their lines sent into the nypd regularly after returning to forensic work following his accident rhyme had stayed involved in maintaining the departments product and materials databases including this one after working on a recent case involving data mining hed come up with an idea that was now used in many police departments around the country hed recruited well bullied the nypd into hiring a programmer to create computer graphics images that depicted the sole of each shoe in the database in different stages of wearnew after six months one year and two years and then to show images of the soles of shoes worn by people who had splayed feet or were pigeontoed hed also gotten the computer guru to indicate wear patterns as a function of height and weight the project was expensive but took surprisingly little time to get online and resulted in nearly instantaneous answers to the questions of the brand and age of shoe and the height weight and stride characteristics of the wearer the database had already helped in the identification of three or four perps his fingers flying over the keys cooper said got a match albertsonfenwick boots and gloves inc model e he perused the screen not surprising theyve got special insulation theyre for workers who have regular contact with live electrical sources they meet astm electrical hazard standard f thesere size eleven rhyme squinted as he looked them over deep treads good this meant they would retain significant quantities of trace material cooper continued theyre fairly new so therere no distinctive wear marks that tell us much about his height weight or other characteristic id say he walks straight though agree rhyme was looking at the prints on his screen broadcast from a camera over the examining table yes sachs wrote this on the board good sachs now rookie whats the invisible evidence you found gazing at the plastic envelope labeled coffee shop opposite blasttable where suspect was sitting cooper was examining it blond hair one inch long natural not dyed rhyme loved hair as a forensic tool it could often be used for dna samplingif the bulb was attachedand it could reveal a lot about the suspects appearance through color and texture and shape age and sex could also be reckoned with more or less accuracy hair testing was becoming more and more popular as a forensic and an employment tool since hair retained traces of drugs longer than urine or blood an inch of hair held a twomonth history of drug use in england hair was frequently used to test for alcohol abuse were not sure its his sellitto pointed out of course not rhyme muttered were not sure of anything at this point but pulaski said its pretty likely though i talked to the owner he makes sure the busboys wipe the table down after every customer i checked and nobodyd wiped it after the perp was there because of the explosion good rookie cooper continued speaking of the hair no natural or artificial curves its straight no evidence of depigmentation so id put him under fifty years old i want a toxchem analysis asap ill send it to the lab a commercial lab rhyme ordered wave a lot of money at them for fast results sellitto grumbled we dont have a lot of money and weve got our own perfectly good lab in queens its not perfectly good if they dont get me the results before our perp kills somebody else lon hows uptown testing cooper asked good remember wave money jesus the city doesnt revolve around you linc it doesnt rhyme asked with surprise in his eyes that was both feigned and genuine chapter with the semedsthe scanning electron microscope and energydispersive xray spectroscopemel cooper analyzed the trace evidence sachs had collected where the unsub had rigged the wire ive got some kind of mineral different from the substrata around the substation whats it made up of its about seventy percent feldspar then quartz magnetite mica calcite and amphiboles some anhydrite too curious large percentages of silicon rhyme knew the geology of the new york area well when mobile hed strolled around the city scooping up samples of dirt and rock and creating databases that could help him match perp and locale but this combination of minerals was a mystery to him it certainly wasnt from around here we need a geologist rhyme thought for a moment and made a call with speed dial hello a mans soft voice answered arthur rhyme said to his cousin who lived not far away in new jersey hey how are you rhyme reflected that it seemed everybody was asking about his health today though arthur was just making conversation good it was nice seeing you and amelia last week rhyme had recently reconnected with arthur rhyme whod been like a brother to him and with whom hed grown up outside chicago though the criminalist was hardly one for weekends in the country hed astonished sachs by suggesting that the two of them take up an invitation to visit art rhyme and his wife judy at their small vacation house on the shore arthur revealed that hed actually built a wheelchair ramp to make it accessible theyd gone out to the place along with thom and pammy and her dog jackson for a couple of days rhyme had enjoyed himself while the women and canine hiked the beach he and arthur had talked science and academia and world events their opinions growing inarticulate in direct proportion to the consumption of single malt scotch arthur like rhyme had a pretty good collection youre on speaker here art with well a bunch of cops ive been watching the news youre running this electricity incident ill bet terrible the press is saying its probably an accident but he gave a skeptical laugh no not accidental at all we dont know whether its a disgruntled employee or a terrorist anything i can do to help arthur was a scientist too and somewhat more broadbased than rhyme actually yes ive got a fast question for you well i hope its fast we found some trace at the crime scene and it doesnt match any substrata nearby in fact it doesnt match any geologic formation in the new york area im familiar with ive got a pen give me what you found rhyme recited the results of their tests arthur was silent rhyme pictured his cousin lost in thought as he gazed at the list hed jotted his mind running through possibilities finally he asked how big are the particles mel hi art its mel cooper hi mel been dancing lately we won the long island tango competition last week were going to regionals on sunday unless im stuck here of course mel rhyme urged particles yes very small about point two five millimeters okay im pretty sure its tephra what rhyme asked arthur spelled it volcanic matter the words greek for ash in the air after its blown out of the volcano its pyroclastbroken rockbut on the ground its called tephra indigenous rhyme asked in an amused voice arthur said its indigenous somewhere but you mean around here not anymore you could find a very minuscule trace amount in the northeast given a major eruption on the west coast and strong prevailing winds but there havent been any lately in those proportions id say most likely the source was the pacific northwest maybe hawaii so however this got to a crime scene it would have been carried there by the perp or somebody thatd be my call well thanks well talk to you soon oh and judy said shes going to email amelia that recipe she wanted rhyme hadnt heard that part of the conversation during the weekend out of town it mustve occurred on one of the beach walks sachs called no hurry after they disconnected rhyme couldnt help but look at her with a raised eyebrow youre taking up cooking pammys going to teach me she shrugged how hard can it be i figure its just like rebuilding a carburetor only with perishable parts rhyme gazed at the chart tephra so maybe our perps been to seattle or portland recently or to hawaii i doubt that much trace would travel very well though im betting he was in or near a museum school geologic exhibit of some kind do they use volcanic ash in any kind of business maybe polishing stones like carborundum cooper said thiss too varied and irregular to be milled commercially too soft too id think hm how about jewelry do they make jewelry out of lava none of them had ever heard of that though and rhyme concluded that the source had to be an exhibit or display that the perp had attended or that was near where he lived or where a future target was mel have somebody in queens start callingcheck out any exhibits traveling or permanent displays in the area that have anything to do with volcanoes or lava manhattan first he gazed at the access door wrapped in plastic now lets look at what amelia went swimming with your turn at bat rookie make us proud chapter cleaning his latex gloves with the pethair rollerand drawing an approving look from rhymethe young officer hefted the access door and surrounding frame still connected the door was about eighteen inches square and the frame added another two or so inches it was painted dark gray sachs was right it was a tight fit the unsub very likely would have sloughed off something from his body as he entered the substation the door opened with four small turn latches on both sides they would have been awkward to loosen with a gloved hand so there was a chance hed used bare fingers especially since hed planned on blowing up the door with the battery bomb and destroying evidence fingerprints fell into one of three categories visible the sort left by a bloody thumb on a white wall impressible left in pliable material like plastic explosive and latent hidden to the unaided eye there were dozens of good ways to raise latent prints but one of the best on metal surfaces was simply to use storebought super glue cyanoacrylate the object would be put in an airtight enclosure with a container of the glue which would then be heated until it turned gaseous the vapors would bond with any number of substances left by the fingeramino and lactic acids glucose potassium and carbon trioxideand the resulting reaction created a visible print the process could work miracles raising prints that were completely invisible before except not in this case nothing pulaski said discouraged peering at the access door through a very sherlock holmesian magnifier only glove smudges not surprising hes been fairly careful so far well collect trace from the inside of the frame where he made contact pulaski did this using a soft brush over the newsprint examination sheets and taking swabs he placed whatever he foundto rhyme it seemed like very littleinto bags and organized them for cooper to analyze sellitto took a call and then said hold on youre being speakered hello came the voice rhyme glanced at sellitto who he whispered szarnek the nypd computer crimes expert what do you have for us rodney rock music clattered around in the background i can almost guarantee that whoever played with the algonquin servers had the pass codes up front in fact i will guarantee that first of all we found no evidence of any attempted intrusion no brute force attack no shredded code of rootkits suspicious drivers or kernel modules or just the bottom line you dont mind okay what im saying is we looked at every port he hesitated at rhymes sigh ah bottom line it was and wasnt an inside job which means rhyme grumbled the attack was from outside algonquins physical building we know that but the perp had to get the codes from inside headquarters in queens either him or an accomplice theyre kept in hard copies and on a random code generator thats isolated from networks so the criminalist summarized just to make sure no outside hackers domestic or international next to impossible im serious lincoln not a single rootkit got it rodney any trace on his line from the coffee shop prepaid cell connecting through a usb port went through a proxy in europe rhyme was tech enough to know that this meant the answer to his question was no thanks rodney how do you get any work done with that music the man chuckled call me anytime the raucous hammering disappeared with the disconnecting click cooper too was on the phone he hung up and said ive found somebody in materials analysis at hq shes got a geology background she knows a lot of the schools that have regular exhibits for the public shes checking on volcanic ash and lava pulaski poring over the door squinted got something here i think he pointed to a portion of the door near the top latch it looks like he wiped it off he grabbed the magnifying glass and theres a burr of metal sharp i think he cut himself and bled really rhyme was excited theres nothing like dna in forensic work sellitto said but if he cleaned it off does it still do us any good before rhyme could offer anything pulaski still hunched over his find mused but what would he have to clean it off with maybe spit thats as good as blood this was going to have been rhymes conclusion use the als alternative light sources can reveal bodily fluids like traces of saliva semen and sweat all of which contain dna all law enforcement agencies were now taking samples of dna of suspects in certain types of offensessex crimes for instanceand many were going further than that if their unsub had committed a swabbable offense hed be in the combined dna index system database codis a moment later pulaski wearing goggles paused the wand over a portion of the access door where hed spotted the smear there was a tiny yellowish glow he called yessir got something not much rookie you know how many cells are in the human body well no i dont over three trillion thats a lot of and do you know how many are needed for a successful dna sample he said according to your book lincoln about a hundred rhyme lifted an eyebrow impressive then he added you think you have a hundred cells there in that massive smear probably i would think you sure do sachs looks like your swimming expedition wasnt in vain if the battery had blown it would have destroyed the sample okay mel show him how to collect it pulaski ceded the tricky task to cooper str rhyme asked the tech or is the sample degraded the polymerase chain reaction short tandem repeat method was the standard dna test in criminal cases it was fast and the most reliable system with at least a billion to one accuracy it could also determine the sex of the person from whom the sample came but while the sample could be very small it had to be in good shape if it had been damaged by the water or heat in the substation a different testmitochondrial dnawould have to be used a technique that took longer i think itll be fine the tech collected the dna and called the lab for pickup i knowasap he told rhyme just as the criminalist had been about to crack the whip and spare no expense that coming out of your fee linc sellitto grumbled i give you my best customer discount lon and a good find pulaski thanks i having delivered enough compliments for the time being rhyme moved on what about the trace from the inside of the door mel you know were not moving very quickly here cooper took the samples and looked them over on the examining sheet or under the microscope nothing that doesnt match the samplars and substrata except this it was a tiny pink dot gc it rhyme ordered a short time later mel was reading results from the gas chromatograph the mass spectrometer and several other analyses weve got an acidic phabout twoand citric acid and sucrose then well ill put it up on the screen the words appeared quercetin orutinosideoglucoside and chrysoeriol dicglucoside stellarin fine rhyme said impatiently fruit juice with that ph its probably lemon pulaski couldnt help but laugh how did you know that im sorry how did you know you only get out of a task what you bring to it rookie do your homework remember that he turned back to cooper then vegetable oil of some sort lots of salt and some compound that eludes me completely made up of what its protein rich the amino acids are arginine histidine isoleucine lysine and methionine also plenty of lipids mostly cholesterol and lecithin then vitamin a vitamins b b b niacin pantothenic acid and folic acid large amounts of calcium magnesium phosphorus potassium tasty rhyme said cooper was nodding its food sure but what though his sensations of taste hadnt changed after the accident food was to lincoln rhyme essentially fuel and he didnt get much pleasure out of it unlike of course whisky thom there was no response so he took a deep breath before he could call again the aide stuck his head in the door everything okay why do you keep asking that what do you want lemon juice vegetable oil and egg youre hungry no no no what would those ingredients be found in mayonnaise rhyme lifted an eye to cooper who shook his head lumpy and kind of pinkish the aide reconsidered then id go with taramasalata what is that a restaurant thom laughed its a greek appetizer a spread caviar right you eat it with bread thom replied to sachs well it is fish eggs but cod not sturgeon so its not technically caviar rhyme was giving a nod ah the elevated saline fish sure is it common in greek restaurants and grocery stores and delis is there anyplace more common than others a greek area of the city queens pulaski said who lived in the borough astoria lots of greek restaurants there can i get back now thom asked yes yes yes thanks sachs called the aide waved a gloved hand playtex yellow and disappeared sellitto asked maybe hes been staking out someplace in queens for the next attack rhyme shrugged one of the few gestures he could still perform he reflected the perp would have to prepare the location that was true still he was leaning in a different direction sachs caught his eye youre thinking algonquins headquartersre in astoria right exactly and everythings pointing to it being an inside job he asked whos in charge of the company ron pulaski said hed had a conversation with the workers outside the substation they mentioned the president and ceo the names jessen andy jessen everybody seemed a little afraid of him rhyme kept his eyes on the charts for a moment and then said sachs howd you like to go for a drive in your fancy new wheels you bet she called and arranged with the ceos assistant for a meeting in a half hour it was then that sellittos cell rang he pulled it out and took a look at caller id algonquin he hit a button detective sellitto rhyme noticed his face went still as he listened then he said youre sure okay whod have access thanks he disconnected son of a bitch what that was the supply division supervisor he said one of the algonquin warehouses in harlem was burglarized last week hundred and eighteen street they thought it was an employee pilfering perp used a key it wasnt broken into pulaski asked and whoever it was stole the cable sellitto nodded and those split bolts but rhyme could see another message in the detectives round face how much he asked his voice a whisper how much wire did he steal you got it linc seventyfive feet of cable and a dozen bolts what the hell was mcdaniel talking about a onetime thing thats bullshit this unsubs going to keep right on going crime scene algonquin substation manhattan west th street victim

references to monetary disbursements personnel movements and something big chapter looming that was the word that came to mind as amelia sachs climbed out of her torino cobra in the parking lot of algonquin consolidated power and light in astoria queens the facility covered a number of blocks but it was anchored by a complicated soaring building made of grim red and gray panels that rose two hundred feet into the air the massive edifice dwarfed the employees now leaving at the end of the day walking through dollhouse doorways in the panoramic sheets of the walls pipes evacuated the building in dozens of places and as shed expected there were wires everywhere only wires didnt quite suit these were thick and inflexible cables some insulated some silver gray bare metal glistening under security lights they must have carried hundreds of thousands of volts from the guts of the building through a series of metallic and she supposed ceramic or other insulated fittings into even more complicated scaffoldings and supports and towers they divided and ran in different courses like bones extending from the arm to the hand to the fingers tilting her head back she saw high above her the four towers of the smokestacks also grimy red and sooty gray blinking with warning lights bright in the hazy dusk shed been aware of the stacks for years of course no one whod been to new york even once missed them the dominant feature of the bland industrial shore of the east river but shed never been this close and they now captivated her piercing the dull sky she remembered in winter seeing exhaust of smoke or steam but now there was nothing escaping except heat or invisible gas distorting with ripples the smooth plain of the heavens above sachs heard some voices and looked over the parking lot to see a crowd of maybe fifty protesters standing in a large cluster posters were held aloft and there was a little amiable chanting probably complaining about the big bad wolf of the oilguzzling power company they didnt notice that shed arrived here in a car that used five times as much black gold as one of their priuses underneath her feet she believed she could feel a rumbling like massive nineteenthcentury engines groaning away she heard a low hum she closed the car door and approached the main entrance two guards were watching her they were clearly curious about the tall redhead curious about her arrival in an old ruddy muscle car but they also seemed amused at her reaction to the building their faces said yeah its really something isnt it after all these years here you never get over it then with her id and shield flashed their expressions became alert andapparently expecting a cop though not in this packagethey ushered her immediately through the halls of what was the executive headquarters portion of algonquin consolidated unlike the slick office building in midtown of a massive data mining company involved in a case shed recently worked algonquin seemed like a museum diorama of life in the s blond wood furniture framed gaudy photographs of the facility and transmission towers brown carpet the clothing of the employeesnearly all of them menwas ultraconservative white shirts and dark suits they continued down the boring halls decorated with pictures of magazines that featured articles about algonquin power age electricity transmission monthly the grid the time was nearly sixthirty and yet there were dozens of employees here ties loosened sleeves rolled up faces troubled at the end of the corridor the guard delivered her to the office of a r jessen although the drive here had been eventfulinvolving speeds close to seventy on one stretch of highwaysachs had managed to do a bit of research jessen was not an andy but an andi for andrea sachs always made it a point to do homework like this learn what she could about the principals it was important in maintaining control of interviews and interrogations ron had assumed that the ceo was a man she imagined how her credibility would have fallen had she arrived and asked for mr jessen inside sachs paused just inside the doorway of the anteoffice a secretary or personal assistant in a tight black tank top and wearing bold high heels rose on precarious toes to dig into a filing cabinet the blonde in her early forties or late thirties sachs reckoned was frowning frustrated at being unable to find something her boss wanted in the doorway to the main office stood an imposing woman with saltandpepper hair and wearing a severe brown suit and highneck blouse she frowned as she watched the file cabinet excavation and crossed her arms im detective sachs i called earlier she said when the dour woman turned her way it was then that the younger woman plucked a folder from the cabinet and handed it to the older then said i found it rachel my mistake i filed it when you were at lunch if you could make five copies id appreciate it yes ms jessen she said and stepped to a copier the ceo strode forward on the dangerous heels looked up into sachss eyes and shook her hand firmly come on inside detective she said looks like we have a lot to talk about sachs glanced over at the brownsuited personal assistant and followed the real andi jessen into her office so much for homework she reflected ruefully chapter andrea jessen seemed to catch on to the near faux pas im the second youngest and the only woman head of a major power company in the country even with me having the final say on hiring algonquin has a tenth the women as in most other big companies in the united states its the nature of the industry sachs was about to ask why jessen had gone into the field when the ceo said anticipating her my father was in the business the detective nearly told her that she was a cop exclusively because of her own father a portable or foot patrolman with the nypd for many years but she refrained jessens face was angular with the slightest dusting of makeup wrinkles were present but subdued radiating timidly from the corners of her green eyes and bland lips otherwise the skin was smooth this was not a woman who got outside much she in turn examined sachs closely then nodded toward her large coffee table surrounded by office chairs the detective sat while jessen grabbed the phone excuse me for a moment her manicured but unpolished nails clacked against the number pad she called three different peopleall about the attack one to a lawyer the detective could tell one to the public relations department or an outside pr firm she spent most of the time on the third call apparently making sure extra security personnel were on site at all the companys substations and other facilities jotting tiny notes with a goldplated pencil jessen spoke in clipped tones using staccato words with not a single filler like i mean or you know as jessen rattled off instructions sachs took in the office noting on the broad teak desk a picture of a teenage andi jessen and her family she deduced from the series of photos of the children that jessen had one brother a few years younger they resembled each other though he was brownhaired and she blonde recent pictures showed him to be a handsome fit man in an army uniform there were other pictures of him on travels occasionally with his arm around a pretty woman different in every shot there were no pictures of jessen with any romantic partners the walls were covered with bookcases and pictures of oldtime prints and maps that might have come out of a museum display about the history of power one map was labeled the first grid and showed a portion of lower manhattan around pearl street she saw in legible script thomas a edison and she guessed that was the inventors actual signature jessen hung up and sat forward elbows on her desk eyes bleary but jaw and narrow lips firm its been over seven hours since the incident i was hoping youd have somebody in custody i guess if youd caught them she muttered i wouldve had a phone call not a visit in person no im here to ask you some questions about things that have come up in the investigation again a careful appraisal ive been talking with the mayor and the governor and the head of the fbis new york office oh homeland security too i was expecting to see one of them not a police officer this wasnt a putdown not intentionally and sachs took no offense nypd is running the crime scene portion of the case my questions have to do with that that explains it her face softened slightly woman to woman i get a bit defensive i was thinking the big boys werent taking me seriously a faintly conspiratorial smile it happens more than youd think i understand that i imagine you do a detective hm thats right then sachs feeling the urgency of the case asked we get to those questions of course the phone kept ringing but according to jessens instructions to her pa whod returned to the anteoffice a moment ago the unit chirped only once and fell silent as the woman fielded the calls first of all just a preliminary matter have you changed the access codes to the grid software a frown of course thats the first thing we did didnt the mayor or homeland security tell you no they hadnt sachs reflected jessen continued and weve put in an extra set of firewalls the hackers cant get in any longer its probably not hackers jessen cocked her head but this morning tucker mcdaniel was saying that it was probably terrorists the fbi agent we have more recent information how else could it have happened somebody from the outside was rerouting the supply and altering the circuit breakers at mhtenthe substation on fiftyseventh street but were pretty sure he got the codes from the inside thats impossible it has to be terrorists thats definitely a possibility and i want to ask you about that but even if so they were using an insider an officer in our computer crimes division had a conversation with your it people he said there was no evidence of independent hacking jessen fell silent and examined her desk she didnt seem happybecause of this news about the insider or because somebody in her company was talking to the police without her knowing she jotted a note and sachs wondered if it was to remind herself to reprimand the technology security man sachs continued the suspect was seen in an algonquin uniform or at least blue coveralls that were very similar to what your employees wear suspect a man was spotted in a coffee shop around the time of the attack across from the substation he was seen with a laptop did you get any details about him white male forties probably nothing else well about the uniform you could buy one or make one yes but theres more the cable he used to rig the arc flash it was bennington brand thats what your company regularly uses yes i know most power companies do too last week seventyfive feet of bennington cable the same gauge was stolen from one of your warehouses in harlem along with a dozen split bolts theyre used for splicing i know what theyre used for the wrinkles in jessens face grew severe whoever broke into the warehouse he used a key to get in he also got into the access tunnel under the substation through an algonquin steam pipe manhole jessen said quickly meaning he didnt use the electronic keypad to get into the substation no so theres some evidence that its not an employee its a possibility like i said but theres something else sachs added that theyd found traces of greek food suggesting a nearby connection seemingly bewildered at the extent of their knowledge the ceo repeated with exasperation taramasalata there are five greek restaurants within walking distance of your headquarters here and twentyeight within a tenminute cab ride and since the trace was fairly recent it makes sense that hes a current employee or at least got the codes from a current employee maybe they met at a restaurant nearby oh please there are plenty of greek restaurants around the city lets just assume the computer codes came from inside whod have access to them sachs asked thats really the threshold issue very limited and very tightly controlled she said fast as if she were on trial for negligence the line seemed rehearsed who i do a half dozen senior staff thats all but detective thesere people whove been with the company for years they wouldnt possibly do this inconceivable you keep the codes separate from the computers i understand a blink at this knowledge too yes theyre set randomly by our senior control center supervisor and kept in a safe file room next door id like names and to find out if theres been any unauthorized access to that room jessen was clearly resistant to the idea that the perp was an employee but she said ill call our security director he should have that information and ill need the names of any workers in the past few months who were assigned to repair steam lines in that manhole across from the substation its in an alleyway about thirty feet north of the station the ceo picked up the phone and asked her pa to summon two employees to her office the request was polite while some people in this position would have barked the order jessen remained in control and reasonable which to sachs made her seem all the harder it was the weak and insecure who blustered happened in the policing business all the time just a moment after she hung up one of the men shed asked to join them arrived his office mightve been next door to hers he was a stocky middleaged businessman in gray slacks and a white shirt andi anything new a few things sit down then she turned to sachs this is bob cavanaugh senior vp of operations detective sachs they shook hands he asked sachs any headway any suspects before the detective could answer andi jessen said stoically they think its somebody inside bob inside thats what its looking like sachs said and explained what theyd learned so far cavanaugh too seemed dismayed that their company might possibly be harboring a traitor jessen asked could you find out from steam maintenance whos been assigned to inspect the pipes down the manhole near mhten for how long back two three months sachs said i dont know if well have the assignment sheets but ill see he made the call and requested the information then he turned back to the women sachs said now lets talk a little more about the terrorist connection i thought you were accusing an employee its not unusual for a terror cell to recruit an insider should we look at muslim employees cavanaugh asked i was thinking of the protesters outside sachs said what about ecoterrorism cavanaugh shrugged algonquins been criticized in the press for not being green enough he said this delicately not looking jessens way this was apparently a familiar and tedious issue jessen said to sachs we have a program for renewable energy were pursuing it but were being realistic about the subject not wasting our time its politically correct to wave the renewables flag but most people dont know the first thing about it she waved her hand dismissively thinking of the severity of some ecoterror incidents in the recent past sachs asked her to elaborate it was as if shed pushed an on button hydrogen fuel cells biofuels wind farms solar farms geothermal methane generation ocean wave generators you know how much they produce less than three percent of all the energy consumed in the country half the electrical service supply in the united states comes from coal algonquin uses natural gas thats twenty percent nuclears about nineteen hydros seven percent sure the renewables will be growing but very very slowly for the next hundred years theyll be a drop in the bucket of juice if i can quote myself the president was growing even angrier the startup costs are obscene the gadgets to create the juice are ridiculously expensive and unreliable and since the generatorsre usually located away from major load centers transportation is another huge cost take solar farms the wave of the future right do you know theyre one of the biggest users of water in the power business and where are they located where theres the most sun and therefore the least water but say that out loud and you get jumped by the media and by washington and albany too you hear about those senators coming to town for earth day no jessen continued theyre on the joint energy resources subcommittee working with the president on environmental issues theyll be at that big rally in central park thursday night and whatll they be doing beating us up oh they wont mention algonquin by name but i guarantee one of themll point our way you can see the smokestacks from the park im convinced thats why the organizers put the stage where it is all right thosere my views but is that enough to make algonquin a target i just dont see it some political or religious fundamentalists going after the american infrastructure sure but not eco cavanaugh agreed ecoterror never had any problems that i can remember and ive been here for thirty yearsi worked with andis father when he ran the place we burned coal back then we were always expecting greenpeace or some liberals to sabotage us but nothing jessen confirmed no we tend to get boycotts and protesters cavanaugh gave a sour smile and they dont see the irony that half of them took a subway over here from the new energy expo at the convention center courtesy of algonquingenerated current or made their little posters last night by the light provided by us forget irony hows hypocrisy sachs said until we get some communication from somebody though or learn more id still like to consider ecoterrorists have you heard anything about a group that starts with the words justice for for what cavanaugh asked we dont know well i never have jessen said cavanaugh hadnt either but he said hed check with the regional offices of algonquin to see if they had heard anything he took a call he lifted his eyes to andi jessen he listened then disconnected and said to sachs no service in the steam access manhole for over a year those linesre shut down okay sachs was discouraged at the news cavanaugh said if you dont need me ill go check with the regional offices now after he left a tall african american appeared in the doorwaythe second of the men shed summonedand jessen motioned him to sit she introduced them security director bernard wahl was sachs realized the only nonwhite shed seen in the company not in workers overalls the strongly built man was draped in a dark suit and white shirt heavily starched his tie was red his head was shaved and glistened in the overhead lights glancing up sachs saw that every other lightbulb was missing from the ceiling fixtures an economy move or given her antigreen stance had jessen decided that reducing energy use would be advantageous from a public relations standpoint wahl shook sachss hand and snuck a glimpse at the bulge on her hip where her glock resided somebody whod come out of policing would not have any interest in her piece which was just a tool of the trade like cell phones or ballpoint pens it was the amateur cops who were fascinated with armament andi jessen briefed him and asked about access to the codes for the computers the codes thats just a few people i mean theyre very senior you ask me itd be too obvious you sure we werent hacked those kidsre real smart nowadays ninetynine percent sure sachs said bernie have somebody check on access to the safe file room beside the control center wahl pulled out his mobile phone and placed a call told an assistant to handle the request he disconnected and then added ive been waiting for a terrorist announcement but youre thinking its from the inside we think it was either inside or with the help of somebody inside but we did want to ask about ecoterror threats not in my four years here just protesters a nod out the window have you ever heard of a group called justice for something having to do with environmental issues no maam wahl was placid exuded no emotion whatsoever sachs continued any problems with employees whove been fired recently whove had complaints with the company with the company wahl asked they tried to take out a city bus it wasnt the company they were after jessen said our stocks down eight percent bernie oh sure i didnt think about that therere a few ill get the names sachs continued id also like any information you have about employees with mental issues anger management problems or whove shown some instability wahl said security doesnt generally get their names unless its serious some risk of violence to themselves or others i cant think of anybody off the top of my head but ill check with hr and our medical department some detailsll be confidential but ill get you the names you can go from there thanks now we think he mightve stolen the cable and hardware from an algonquin warehouse the one on a hundred and eighteenth street i remember that wahl said a grimace on his face we looked into it but the loss was only a few hundred dollars and there were no leads whod have the keys theyre standard all our field workers have a set in the region eight hundred people plus the supervisors any employees fired or under suspicion of pilfering or stealing recently he glanced at jessen to make sure he should be answering the questions he got the subtle message that he should no not that my departments been aware of his cell phone chirped and he looked at the screen excuse me wahl here sachs watched his face as he took in some troubling news he looked from one to the other then disconnected he cleared his throat in a baritone rumble its possibleim not surebut its possible we had a security breach what jessen snapped face reddening the login records of nine east he looked at sachs the wing where the control center and the safe file room are and jessen and sachs asked simultaneously theres a security door between the control room and the safe files it should close on its own but the smart lock records show it was open for about two hours a couple of days ago a malfunction or it got jammed somehow two hours unsupervised andi jessen was furious thats right maam he said lips taut he rubbed his glistening scalp but it wasnt like anybody from the outside could get in there was no breach in the lobby sachs asked security tapes we dont have them there no anybody sitting near the room no it opens on an empty corridor its not even marked for security how many people couldve gotten into the room as many as had clearance to nine through eleven east which is a lot he admitted eyes downcast discouraging news though sachs hadnt expected more can you get me the list of anybody who had access that day he made another call while jessen herself picked up the phone and raised hell about the breach a few minutes later a young woman in a lavish gold blouse and teased hair stepped shyly into the doorway she glanced once at andi jessen and then offered sheets of paper to wahl bernie ive got those lists you wanted the one from hr too she turned and was happy to flee the lionesss den sachs looked at wahls face as he reviewed the list apparently the task of compiling it hadnt taken long but the results werent good fortysix people he explained would have had access to the room fortysix oh christ jessen slumped staring out the window all right what we need to find out is who among them gesturing at the access listhad alibis and who had the skill to reroute the computer and rig the wire at the bus stop jessen stared at her immaculate desktop im not a technical expert i got my fathers talent for the business side of the power industrygeneration transportation brokering she thought for a moment but i know somebody who could help she made another phone call then looked up he should be here in a few minutes his office is on the other side of the burn the the turbine room a gesture outside the window at the portion of the building from which the smokestacks blossomed where we produce the steam for the generators wahl was looking over the shorter list employees weve had to discipline or let go for various problems over the past six monthssome mental problems a few drug test failures drinking on the job only eight jessen said was there pride in her voice sachs compared the two lists none of those on the shorter onethe problem employeeshad access to the computer codes she was disappointed shed hoped it would pay off jessen thanked wahl anything else i can do detective just call me she too thanked the security chief who left then she said to jessen id like copies of their résumés everybody on the list or if you have employee profiles cvs anything yes i can arrange for that she asked her assistant to make a copy of the list and pull together personnel information for everybody on it another man slightly out of breath arrived in jessens office midforties sachs estimated he was a little doughy and had unruly brown hair mixed with gray cute seemed to fit there was a boyish quality about him sachs decided sparkling eyes and raised eyebrows and a fidgety nature the sleeves of his wrinkled striped shirt were rolled up food crumbs it seemed dusted his slacks detective sachs jessen said this is charlie sommers special projects manager he shook the detectives hand the president looked at her watch stood and donned a suit jacket shed selected from a large closet of clothes sachs wondered if she pulled allnighters jessen brushed at skin flakes or dust on the shoulders i have to meet with our pr firm and then hold a press conference charles could you take detective sachs back to your office shes got some questions for you help her however you can sure be happy to jessen was looking out the window at her dynastythe massive building the superstructure of towers and cables and scaffolding with the fastflowing east river glistening in the background she seemed like the captain of a huge ship the woman was obsessively rubbing her right thumb and forefinger together a gesture of stress that sachs recognized immediately since she often did the same detective sachs how much wire did he use for that attack sachs told her the ceo nodded and kept looking out the window so hes got enough left for six or seven more if we cant stop him andi jessen didnt seem to want a response she didnt even seem to be speaking to the other people in the room chapter after work a different social tone emerged in tompkins square park in the east village young couples some in brooks brothers some pierced and sporting tats strolling with their toddlers musicians lovers clusters of twentysomethings headed home from despised day jobs and filled with expanding joy at what the night might hold the smells here were hot dog water pot curry and incense fred dellray was on a bench near a large spreading elm tree hed glanced at the plaque when hed arrived and learned this was where the founder of the hari krishna movement had chanted the groups mantra in for the first time outside india hed never known that dellray preferred secular philosophy to theology but had studied all major religions and he knew that the hari krishna sect included four basic rules in order to follow dharma the righteous path mercy selfcontrol honesty and cleanliness of body and spirit he was reflecting on those qualities and how they were figured in todays new york city versus south asia when feet scuffed behind him his hand hadnt even made it halfway to his weapon when he heard the voice fred it troubled dellray deeply that hed been caught off guard william brent wasnt a threat but he easily could have been another sign of losing his touch he nodded to the man to sit wearing a black suit that had seen better days brent was nondescript a little jowly with direct eyes under sweptback hair sprayed into place he wore steelrimmed glasses that had been out of style when dellray had been running him but they were practical typical of william brent the ci crossed his legs and glanced at the tree he wore argyle socks and scuffed penny loafers been well fred okay busy you always were dellray didnt bother to ask what brent had been up to or what his present name was for that matter or career it would have been a waste of energy and time jeep strange creature isnt he is dellray agreed how long you think hell live dellray paused but then answered honestly three years here but if atlanta works out hed probably last for a while if he doesnt get stupid dellray was encouraged by the extent of his knowledge even dellray hadnt known exactly where jeep was going so fred you know im a working man now legitimate whatm i doing here because you listen listen why i liked running you you always listened you heard things got this feeling you hear things still this about that explosion at the bus stop uhhuh some electrical malfunction brent smiled the news said that ive always wondered about this obsession we have with the media why should i believe anything they tell us that untalented actors and twentynineyearold pop stars with excessive tits and cocaine problems behave badly why does that merit more than a millisecond of our consciousness that bus stop fred something else happened there something else happened dellray had been assuming one role with jeep that was a madefortv movie melodramatic but here with william brent he was a method actor subtle and real the lines had been written over the years but the performance came from his heart i really need to know what i liked working with you fred you were difficult but you were always honest so im one quarter of the way to dharmic enlightenment the agent said are we going to keep going here im retired being a snitch can be detrimental to your health people come outa retirement all the time economys fucked their social security checks dont go as far as they thought dellray repeated we going to keep going here brent stared at the elm tree for a long long fifteen seconds well keep going give me some deets and ill see if its worth my time and the risk to both of us to both of us dellray wondered then continued we dont have many details but theres maybe a terror group called justice for we dont know what the leader might be somebody named rahman they were behind it the bus stop possibly and somebody who might be connected with the company no id yet man woman we dont know what exactly happened that they arent saying a bomb no the perp manipulated the grid brents eyebrow rose behind the archaic glasses the grid electricity think about it thats worse than an ied with the grid the explosives already there in everybodys house in everybodys office all he has to do is pull a few switches im dead youre dead and not a pretty way to go why im here justice for something any idea whats on their todo list no islamic aryan political domestic foreign eco we dont know whered the name come from translated no was intercepted that way justice and for in english other words too but they didnt get em they brent gave a furrow of a smile and dellray wondered if he knew exactly what dellray was doing here that hed been tweaked aside by the brave new world of electronics sigint anybody take credit the man asked in his soft voice not yet brent was thinking hard and it would take a whole lot of planning to put something like this together lot of strands to get woven would sure and a flutter of muscles in brents face told dellray that some pieces were falling together he was thrilled to see this but of course revealed nothing brent confirmed in a whisper i have heard something yes about somebody doing some mischief tell me trying not to sound too eager theres not enough to tell its smoke he added and the people who can tell me i cant let you contact them directly could it be terror related i dont know which means you cant say it isnt true dellray felt an uneasy clicking in his chest hed run snitches for years and he knew he was close to something important if this group or whoever it is keeps going a lot of people could be hurt hurt really bad william brent made a faint candleextinguishing noise which meant that he didnt care one bit and that appeals to patriotism and what was right were a waste of breath wall street should take a lesson dellray nodded meaning the negotiation was under way brent continued ill give you names and locations whatever i find you get it but i do the work unlike jeep brent had himself displayed several qualities of dharmic enlightenment when dellray had been running him selfcontrol cleanliness of spiritwell body at least and the allimportant honesty dellray believed he could trust him he snared him in a tight gaze here it is i can live with you doing the work i can live with being cut out what i cant live with is slow brent said thats one of the things youd be paying for fast answers which brings us to dellray had no problem paying his snitches he preferred to bargain favorsreducing sentences cutting deals with parole board case officers dropping charges but money worked too paying value getting value william brent said the worlds changing fred oh were back to that dellray mused to himself and ive got some new prospects i need to pursue but whats the problem whats always the problem money of course dellray asked how much one hundred thousand up front and you have a guarantee i will get you something dellray coughed a laugh hed never paid more than five large to a snitch in all his years running them and that princely sum had bought them indictments in a major dockside corruption case one hundred thousand dollars its just not there william he said not thinking about the name which brent probably hadnt used in years thats more than our entire snitch bag put together thats more than everybodys snitch bag put together hm brent said nothing which is exactly what fred dellray himself would have done had he been on the other side of the negotiation the agent sat forward his bony hands clasped give me a minute like jeep in the stinky diner earlier dellray rose and walked past a skateboarder two giggling asian girls and a man handing out fliers looking surprisingly rational and cheerful considering his cause was the end of days near the dharma tree he pulled out his phone and made a call tucker mcdaniel was the clipped greeting its fred you got something the asac sounded surprised maybe a ci of mine from the day nothing concrete but hes been solid in the past only he wants some money how much how much we got mcdaniel paused not a lot whats he got thats gold nothing yet names places acts numbers scraps anything like a computer rattling off data in a list no tucker nothing yet its like an investment finally the asac said i could do six eight thousand probably thats all how the hell much does he want were negotiating fact is weve had to adjust bottom lines for this one fred took us by surprise you know mcdaniels reluctance to spend was suddenly clear hed moved all the money in the bureau operating accounts to the sigint and t and c teams naturally one of the first places hed raided was the snitch fund start with six see the merchandise if its meaty maybe i could go nine or ten even thats pushing it i think he could be on to something tucker well lets see some proof hold on okay fred its t and c on the other line i better go click dellray snapped the phone shut and stood for a moment staring at the tree he heard she was hot you know but there was this one thing didnt seem right no its the mayan calendar i mean maybe nostradamus thats totally fucked up yo where you been dog but what he was really hearing was his partner in the fbi some years ago saying no problem fred ill take it and going on a trip that dellray had been scheduled to handle and then hearing the voice of his special agent in charge of the new york office two days later that voice choking telling dellray that the partner had been one of the people killed in a terrorist bombing in the oklahoma city federal building the man had been in the conference room that dellray should have been occupying at that moment fred dellray in a comfortable airconditioned conference room of his own many miles from the smoking crater had decided that a priority in his law enforcement career from then on would be to pursue terrorists and anyone else who killed the innocent in the name of ideas whether political or religious or social yes he was being marginalized by the asac he wasnt even being taken seriously but what dellray was about to do had very little to do with vindicating himself or striking a blow for the old ways it was about stopping what he thought was the worst of evils killing innocents he returned to william brent sat down he said okay one hundred thousand they exchanged numbersboth cold phones prepaid mobiles that would be discarded after a day or so dellray looked at his watch he said tonight washington square near the law school by the chess boards nine brent asked make it ninethirty dellray rose and according to the tradecraft of the ci world left the park alone with william brent remaining behind to pretend to read the paper or contemplate the krishna elm or figure out how to spend his money but the ci was soon lost to thought and fred dellray was considering how best to plan the set what part the chameleon should now play how to cast his eyes how to convince and wheedle and call in favors he was pretty sure he could pull it off these were skills hed honed for years hed just never thought hed ever be using his talents to rob his employerthe american government and the american peopleof chapter as amelia sachs followed charlie sommers to his office on the other side of the burn in algonquin consolidated she was aware that the heat was rising along the complicated route he was taking and the rumble filling the halls was getting louder with every step she was totally lost up stairways down stairways as she followed him she sent and received several text messages on her blackberry but as they moved lower and lower she had to concentrate on where she was walking the hallways became increasingly visitorhostile cell reception finally turned to dust and she put her phone away the temperature rose higher sommers stopped at a thick door beside which were a rack of hard hats you worried about your hair he asked his voice rising since the rumbling from the other side of the door was very loud now i dont want to lose it she called back but otherwise no just getting mussed a bit this is the shortest way to my office shorters better im in a hurry she grabbed a hat and squashed it onto her head ready i guess whats through there exactly sommers thought for a moment and said hell and nodded her forward she recalled the seared polkadot wounds that covered luis martin her breath was coming fast and she realized that her hand moving toward the door handle had slowed she gripped and pulled the heavy steel portal open yep hell fire sulfur the whole scene the temperature in the room was overwhelming well over a hundred degrees and sachs felt not only a painful prickle on her skin but a curious lessening of the pain in her joints as the heat deadened her arthritis the hour was lateit was close to eight pmbut there was a full staff at work in the burn the hunger for electricity might ebb and flow throughout the day but never ceased completely the dim space easily two hundred feet high was filled with scaffolding and hundreds of pieces of equipment the centerpiece was a series of massive light green machines the largest of them was long with a rounded top like a huge quonset hut from which many pipes and ducts and wires sprouted thats mom sommers called pointing to it mom midwest operating machinery gary indiana they built her in the s this was all shouted with some reverence sommers added that she was the biggest of the five electrical generators here in the queens complex he continued explaining that when first installed mom was the biggest electrical generator in the country in addition to the other electrical generatorsthey were only numbered without nameswere four units that provided superheated steam to the new york city area amelia sachs was indeed captivated by the massive machinery she found her step slowing as she gazed at the huge components and tried to figure out the parts fascinating what the human mind could put together what human hands could build thosere the boilers he pointed to what seemed to sachs to be a separate building within a building they mustve been ten or twelve stories tall they produce steam over three thousand pounds per square inch he drew a breath it goes into two turbines a highpressure and a lowpressure one he pointed to part of mom then into the generator shes got a continuous outputthirtyfour thousand amps eighteen thousand volts but its stepped up once it gets outside for transport to over three hundred thousand despite the squashing heat she felt a shiver hearing those figures and flashing on the memory of luis martin his skin punctured by hot metal raindrops sommers added with some pride it seemed to sachs that the output of the entire queens facilitymom plus several other turbineswas close to megawatts about percent of the citys entire usage he pointed to a series of other tanks thats where the steam is condensed to water and pumped back to the boilers starts all over again proudly he continued shouting shes got three hundred and sixty miles of tubes and pipes a million feet of cable but then despite her fascination and the massive scale sachs found herself gigged in the belly by her claustrophobia the noise was relentless the heat sommers seemed to understand come on he gestured her to follow and in five minutes they were out the other door and hanging up their hats sachs was breathing deeply the corridor while still warm was blessedly cool after her minutes in hell it gets to you doesnt it does you all right she diverted a tickling stream of sweat and nodded he offered her a paper towel from a roll kept there for mopping faces and necks it seemed and she dried off come on this way he led her down more corridors and into another building more stairs and finally they arrived at his office she stifled a laugh at the clutter the place was filled with computers and instruments she couldnt recognize hundreds of bits of equipment and tools wires electronic components keyboards metal and plastic and wood items in every shape and color and junk food tons of junk food chips and pretzels and soda ding dongs and twinkies and hostess powdered sugar doughnuts which explained the dandruff on his clothes sorry its the way we work in special projects he said shoveling aside computer printouts from an office chair for her to sit in well the way i work at least what exactly do you do he explained somewhat abashedly that he was an inventor i know sounds either very nineteenth century or very infomercial but thats what i do and im the luckiest guy in the world i do for a living exactly what i wanted to when i was a kid and building dynamos motors lightbulbs you made your own lightbulbs only set fire to my bedroom twice well three times but we only had to call the fire department twice she looked at a picture of edison on the wall my hero sommers said fascinating man andi jessen had something about him on her wall too a photo of the grid its thomas alvas original signature but jessens more samuel insull id say who edison was the scientist insull was a businessman he headed consolidated edison and created the first big monopolistic power utility electrified the chicago trolley system practically gave away the first electrical applianceslike ironsto get people addicted to electricity he was a genius but he ended up disgraced this sound familiar he was way overleveraged and when the depression came the company went under and hundreds of thousands of shareholders lost everything little like enron you want to know some trivia the accounting firm arthur andersen was involved with both insull and enron but me i leave the business to other people i just make things ninetynine percent amounts to nothing but well ive got twentyeight patents in my name and ive created nearly ninety processes or products in algonquins some people sit in front of the tv or play video games for fun i well invent things he pointed to a large cardboard box brimming with squares and rectangles of paper thats the napkin file the what im out at starbucks or a deli and i get an idea i jot it down on a napkin and come back here to draw it up properly but i save the original toss it in there so if theres ever a museum about you therell be a napkin room it has occurred to me sommers was blushing from forehead to ample chin what exactly do you invent i guess my expertise is the opposite of what edison did he wanted people to use electricity i want people not to does your boss know thats your goal he laughed maybe i should say i want people to use it more efficiently im algonquins negawatt maven thats nega with an n never heard about that a lot of people havent which is too bad it came from a brilliant scientist and environmentalist amory lovins the theory is to create incentives to reduce demand and use electricity more efficiently rather than trying to build new power plants to increase supply your typical power station wastes nearly half of the heat generatedright up the smokestack half think about that but weve got a series of thermal collectors on the stacks and cooling towers here at algonquin we lose only twentyseven percent ive been coming up with ideas for portable nuclear generatorson barges so they can be moved around from region to region he leaned forward eyes sparkling again and the big new challenge storing electricity its not like food you cant make it and put it on the shelf for a month you use it or lose itinstantly im creating new ways to store it flywheels air pressure systems new battery technology oh and lately ive been spending half my time traveling around the country linking up small alternative and renewable companies so they can get onto the major grids like the northeastern interconnectionthats oursand sell juice to us rather than us selling to small communities i thought andi jessen wasnt very supportive of renewables and alternative energy no but shes not crazy either its the wave of the future i think we just disagree about when that futures going to arrive i think sooner a whimsical smile of course you did notice that her office is the size of my entire department and its on the ninth floor with a view of manhattan im in the basement his face grew solemn now what can i do to help sachs said i have a list of people at algonquin who mightve been behind the attack this morning somebody here he appeared dismayed its looking that way or at least they were working with the perp now hes probably a man though he could be working with a woman he or she had access to the computer codes that let them get into grid control software he kept shutting down substations so that the electricity was rerouted into the substation on fiftyseventh street and he reset the circuit breakers higher than they should have been so thats how it happened his face was troubled the computers i wondered i didnt know the details some of them will have alibiswell take care of checking that out but i need you to give me some idea of whod have the ability to reroute the electricity and rig the arc flash sommers seemed amused im flattered i didnt know andi even knew much about what happens down here then the cherubic look was gone replaced by a wry smile am i a suspect shed spotted his name when jessen had first mentioned him she held his eye youre on the list hm youre sure you want to trust me you were on conference call from tenthirty until nearly noon today when the attack happened and you were out of town during the window when the perp could have gotten the computer codes the key data shows you didnt log into the safe file room at any other time sommers was lifting an eyebrow she tapped her blackberry thats what i was texting about on the way here i had somebody in the nypd check you out so youre clean she supposed she sounded apologetic for not trusting him but sommers said his eyes sparkling thomas edison would have approved what do you mean he said a genius is just a talented person who does his homework chapter amelia sachs didnt want to show sommers the list itself he might know some of the employees and be inclined to dismiss the possibility of their being suspects or on the other hand he might call her attention to somebody simply because he thought they were otherwise suspicious she didnt explain her reluctance but said simply she just wanted a profile of somebody who could have arranged the attack and used the computer he opened a bag of doritos offered sachs some she declined and he chomped down a handful sommers didnt seem like an inventor he seemed more like a middleaged advertising copywriter with his tousled hair and slightly untucked blueandwhitestriped shirt bit of a belly his glasses were stylish though sachs suspected that on the frames were the words made in preceding some asian rim country only up close could you see the wrinkles near his eyes and mouth he washed the food down with soda and said first rerouting the juice to get it to the substation on fiftyseventh street thatll narrow things down not everybody who works here could do it not many people could at all in fact theyd need to know scada thats our supervisory control and data acquisition program it runs on unix computers hed also probably have to know empenergy management programs ours is enertrol its unixbased too unix is a pretty complicated operating system its used in the big internet routers its not like windows or apple you couldnt just look up online how to do it youd need somebody whod studied scada and emp taken courses in it or at the very least apprenticed in a control room for six months a year sachs jotted notes then asked and about the arc flash whod know about rigging that tell me how he did it exactly sachs explained about the cable and the bus bar he asked it was aimed out the window like a gun she nodded sommers went silent for a moment he focused elsewhere that couldve killed dozens of people and the burns terrible who could do it sachs persisted sommers was looking off again which he did a lot shed noticed after a moment i know youre asking about algonquin employees but you ought to know that arc flashes are the first thing that all electricians learn about whether theyre working as licensed tradesmen in construction for manufacturing companies the army or navy any field at all as long as theyre around electrical service lines with enough juice for arcs to be a problem theyll learn the rules so you mean that anybody who knows how to avoid arcs or prevent them knows how to create them exactly another note in her quick handwriting then she looked up but lets just talk for the moment about employees okay who here could rig something like that thered be live wire work involved so itd have to be somebody who is or has been a licensed master electrician in private contracting or been a lineman or a troubleman for a utility a what troubleman sommers laughed great job title hm thosere supervisors who arrange for the repairs when a line goes down or theres a short circuit or other problem and remember that a lot of the senior people here have risen through the ranks just because they do energy brokerage now and sit behind a desk doesnt mean they cant rewire a threephase service panel in their sleep and make an arc flash gun exactly so you should be looking for somebody with computer training in unix control and energy management programs and somebody with a career as a lineman or troubleman or in the contracting trades military too army navy and air force produce a lot of electricians appreciate this a knocking on the door frame intruded a young woman stood there with a large redweld expanding envelope in her arms ms jessen said you wanted these from human resources sachs took the résumés and employee files and thanked the woman sommers had dessert a hostess cupcake then its twin he sipped more soda want to say something she lifted an eyebrow can i give you a lecture lecture safety lecture i dont have much time itll be quick but its important i was just thinking youre at a big disadvantage going after this whatd you call him we say perp for perpetrator perp sounds sexier say youre going after your usual perp bank robbers hitmen you know that they might have a gun or knife youre used to that you know how to protect yourself youve got procedures on how to handle them but electricity as a weapon or a booby trap whole different ball game the thing about juice its invisible and its all over the place i mean everywhere she was recalling the bits of hot metal the horrid round holes in luis martins tan skin sachs had a scent memory of the scorch at the crime scene she shivered in disgust sommers gestured toward a sign on his wall remember national fire protection association guideline read it learn it nfpa can save your life she felt an urgency to get on with the case but she also wanted to hear what he had to say i dont have much time but please go ahead first you have to know how dangerous electricity is and that means knowing about amperage or current you know what that is i sachs had thought she did until she realized she couldnt define it no lets compare an electric circuit to a plumbing system water pumped through pipes water pressure is created by the pump which moves a certain amount of water through the pipes at a certain speed it moves more or less easily depending on the width and condition of the pipes now in an electrical system its the same thing except you have electrons instead of water wires or some conductive material instead of pipes and a generator or battery instead of the pump the pressure pushing the electrons is the voltage the amount of electrons moving through the wire is the amps or current the resistancecalled ohmsis determined by the width and nature of the wires or whatever the electronsre flowing through so far so good that makes sense never heard it put that way before now were talking about amps remember the amount of moving electrons good how much amperage does it take to kill you at a hundred milliamps of ac current your heart will fibrillate and youll die thats one tenth of one amp your typical rite aid hair dryer pulls ten amps ten sachs whispered yes maam a hair dryer ten amps which by the way is all you need for an electric chair as if she werent uneasy enough he continued electricity is like frankensteins monsterwho was animated with lightning by the way its stupid and its brilliant stupid because once its created it wants to do only one thing get back to the ground brilliant because it instinctively knows the best way to do that it always takes the path of least resistance you can grab on to a hundredthousandvolt line but if its easier for the electricity to get back through the wire youre perfectly safe if youre the best conductor to the ground his pointed nod explained the consequences now for your lesson my three rules for dealing with juice first avoid it if at all possible this guy is going to know youre after him and he might be rigging traps with live lines stay away from metalhandrails doors and doorknobs uncarpeted flooring appliances machinery wet basements standing water have you ever seen transformers and switchgear on the street no yes you have but youre not aware of them because our city fathers hide and disguise them the working parts of transformersre scary and ugly in the city theyre underground or in innocuous buildings or neutralpainted enclosures you could be standing right next to a transformer taking in thirteen thousand volts and not know it so keep an eye out for anything that says algonquin on it and stay away if you can now you have to remember that even if you think youre avoiding it you could still be in danger theres something called islanding islanding say the grid is down in some part of town like happened today you think all the circuitsre dead right of course youre safe well maybe and maybe not andi jessen would like algonquin to be the only game in town but were not power nowadays is supplied through whats called distributed generation where smaller energy producers pump juice into our grid islanding would happen when the algonquin supply is offline but some smaller source is still supplying juice to the gridan island of electricity in the void then theres backfeed you cut the breakers on a line and go to work but the lowvoltage lines downstream may start feeding juice back into the transformer sachs understood and the transformer steps it back up exactly and the line you thought was dead is alive really alive with enough juice to hurt you oh yeah and then theres induction even if youre sure you shut off the circuitsits completely dead and theres no islanding or backfeed possiblethe wire youre working on can still become charged again with deadly voltage if theres another live wire nearby thats because of induction the current in one wire can energize another even a dead one if its close enough so rule one avoid the juice whats rule two if you cant avoid it protect yourself against it wear ppe personal protective equipment rubber boots and gloves and not those sissy little ones they wear on that csi tv show thick industrial rubber work gloves use insulated tools or even better a hot stick theyre fiberglass like hockey sticks with tools attached to the end we use them for working live lines protect yourself he repeated remember the pathofleastresistance rule human skin is a pretty poor conductor if its dry if its wet especially with sweat because of the salt resistance drops dramatically and if youve got a wound or a burn skin becomes a great conductor dry leather soles of your shoes are fairly good insulators wet leathers like skinespecially if youre standing on a conductive surface like damp ground or a basement floor puddles of water uhoh so if you have to touch something that could be livesay opening a metal doormake sure youre dry and wearing insulated shoes or boots use a hot stick or an insulated tool if you can and use only one handyour right since its slightly farther from the heartand keep your other hand in your pocket so you dont touch anything accidentally and complete a circuit watch where you put your feet youve seen birds sitting on uninsulated hightension wires they dont wear ppe how can they roost on a piece of metal carrying a hundred thousand volts why dont we have roast pigeons falling from the skies they dont touch the other wire exactly as long as they dont touch a return or the tower theyre fine they have the same charge as the wire but theres no currentno ampsgoing through them youve got to be like that bird on the wire which to sachs made her sound pretty damn fragile take off all metal before you work with juice jewelry especially pure silver is the best conductor on earth copper and aluminum are at the top too gold isnt far behind at the other end are the dielectricsinsulators glass and teflon then ceramic plastics rubber wood bad conductors standing on something like that even a thin piece could mean the difference between life and death thats rule number two protection sommers continued finally rule three if you cant avoid juice and cant protect yourself against it cut its head off all circuits big or small have a way to shut them down they all have switches they all have breakers or fuses you can stop the juice instantly by flipping the switch or the breaker off or removing a fuse and you dont even need to know where the breaker is to pop it what happens if you stick two pieces of wire into the holes in a household outlet and touch the ends the circuit breaker pops exactly you can do the same thing with any circuit but remember rule number two protect yourself when you do that because at bigger voltages touching the two wires will produce one hell of a spark and it could be an arc flash sommers was on to another junk food course pretzels he washed down the noisy bite with more soda i could go on for an hour but thosere the basics you get the message i do thiss really helpful charlie i appreciate it his advice sounded so simple but though sachs had carefully listened to everything sommers had told her she couldnt escape the fact that this particular weapon was still very alien to her how could luis martin have avoided it protected himself against it or cut the beasts head off the answer was he couldnt if you need me for anything else technical just give me a call he gave her two cell phone numbers and oh hold on here he handed her a black plastic box with a button on the side and an lcd screen at the top it looked like an elongated cell phone one of my inventions a noncontact current detector most of them only register up to a thousand volts and you have to be pretty close to the wire or terminal for it to read but this goes to ten thousand and its very sensitive itll sense voltage from about four or five feet away and give you the level thanks thatll be helpful she gave a laugh examining the instrument too bad they dont make these to tell you if a guy on the streets carrying a gun sachs had been joking but charlie sommers was nodding a glaze of concentration on his face he seemed to be considering her words very seriously as he said goodbye to her he shoved some corn chips into his mouth and frantically began drawing a diagram on a slip of paper she noticed that a napkin was the first thing hed grabbed chapter lincoln this is dr kopeski thom was standing in the doorway of the lab with a visitor lincoln rhyme looked up absently the time was now about pm and though the urgency of the algonquin case was pulsing through the room there was little he could do until sachs returned from meeting the power company executive so hed reluctantly agreed to see the representative from the disability rights group giving rhyme his award kopeskis not going to come here and cool his heels like some courtier waiting for an audience with the king call me arlen please the softspoken man in a conservative suit and white shirt a tie like an orange and black candy cane walked up to the criminalist and nodded no vestigial offer of a handshake and he didnt even glance down at rhymes legs or at the wheelchair since kopeski worked for a disability rights organization rhymes condition was nothing to him an attitude that rhyme approved of he believed that we were all disabled in one way or another ranging from emotional scar tissue to arthritis to lou gehrigs disease life was one big disability the question was simple what did we do about it rhyme rarely dwelt on the subject hed never been an advocate for disabled rights that struck him as a diversion from his job he was a criminalist who happened to be able to move with less facility than most he compensated as best he could and got on with his work rhyme glanced at mel cooper and nodded toward the den across the foyer from the lab thom ushered kopeski inside with rhyme following in his chair and eased the pocket doors partially together he disappeared sit down if you like rhyme said the last clause offered to temper the first hoping that the man would remain standing get to business and get out he was carrying a briefcase maybe the paperweight was in there the doc could present it get a photo and leave the whole matter would be put to rest the doctor sat ive followed your career for some time have you are you familiar with the disability resources council thom had briefed him rhyme remembered little of the monologue you do some very good work good work yes silence if we could move this along rhyme glanced out the window intently as if a new assignment were winging its way toward the townhouse like the falcon earlier sorry have to go duty calls ive worked with many disabled people over the years spinal cord injuries spina bifida als a lot of other problems cancer too curious idea rhyme had never thought about that disease being a disability but he supposed some types could fit the definition a glance at the wall clock ticking away slowly and then thom brought in a tray of coffee and oh for christs sake cookies the glance at the aidemeaning this was not a fucking tea partyrolled past like vapor thank you kopeski said taking a cup rhyme was disappointed that he added no milk which would have cooled the beverage so he could drink it and leave more quickly for you lincoln im fine thank you he said with a chill that thom ignored as effectively as he had the searing glance a moment ago he left the tray and scooted back to the kitchen the doctor eased down into the sighing leather chair good coffee im so very pleased a cock of the head youre a busy man so ill get to the point id appreciate that detective rhyme lincoln are you a religious man the disability group must have a church affiliation they might not want to honor a heathen no im not no belief in the afterlife i havent seen any objective evidence that one exists many many people feel that way so for you death would be equal to say peace depending on how i go a smile in the kind face i misrepresented myself somewhat to your aide and to you but for a good reason rhyme wasnt concerned if the man had pretended to be somebody else to get in and kill me id be dead now a raised eyebrow meant fine confess and lets move forward im not with drc no no but i sometimes say im with one group or another because my real organization sometimes gets me kicked out of peoples homes jehovahs witnesses a chuckle im with die with dignity its a euthanasia advocacy organization based in florida rhyme had heard of them have you ever considered assisted suicide yes some years ago i decided not to kill myself but you kept it as an option doesnt everybody disabled or not a nod true rhyme said its pretty clear that im not getting an award for picking the most efficient way of ending my life so what can i do for you we need advocates people like yourself with some public recognition factor who might consider making the transition transition now theres a euphemism for you you could make a video on youtube give some interviews we were thinking that someday you might decide to take advantage of our services he withdrew from his briefcase a brochure it was subdued and printed on nice card stock and had flowers on the front not lilies or daisies rhyme noticed roses the title above the flora was choices he set it on the table near rhyme if youd be interested in letting us use you as a celebrity sponsor we could not only provide you with our services for free but thered be some compensation as well believe it or not we do okay for a small group and presumably they pay up front rhyme thought i really dont think im the man for you all youd have to do is talk a bit about how youve always considered the possibility of assisted suicide wed do some videos too and a voice from the doorway startled rhyme get the fuck out of here he noticed kopeski jump at the sound thom stormed into the room as the doctor sat back spilling coffee as he dropped the cup which hit the floor and shattered wait i the aide usually the picture of control was redfaced his hands were shaking i said out kopeski rose he remained calm look im having a conversation with detective rhyme here he said evenly theres no reason to get upset out now i wont be long youll leave now thom rhyme began quiet the aide muttered the look from the doctor said you let your assistant talk to you like that im not going to tell you again ill leave when ive finished kopeski eased closer to the aide the doctor like many medical people was in good shape but thom was a caregiver which involved getting rhymes ass into and out of beds and chairs and exercise equipment all day long a physical therapist too he stepped right into kopeskis face but the confrontation lasted only a few seconds the doctor backed down all right all right all right he held his hands up jesus no need to thom picked up the mans briefcase and shoved it into his chest and led him out the door a moment later the criminalist heard the door slam pictures on the wall shook the aide appeared a moment later evidently mortified he cleaned up the broken china mopped the coffee im sorry lincoln i checked it was a real organization i thought his voice cracked he shook his head the handsome face dark hands shaking as rhyme wheeled back toward the lab he said its fine thom dont worry and theres a bonus the man turned his troubled eyes toward rhyme to find his boss smiling i dont have to waste time writing an acceptance speech for any goddamn award i can get back to work chapter electricity keeps us alive the impulse from the brain to the heart and lungs is a current like any other and electricity kills too at pm just nine and a half hours after the attack at algonquin substation mh the man in the darkblue algonquin consolidated overalls surveyed the scene in front of him his killing zone electricity and death he was standing in a construction site out in the open but no one paid him any attention because he was a worker among fellow workers different uniforms different hard hats different companies but one thing tied them all together those who made a living with their hands were looked down on by real people the ones who relied on their services the rich the comfortable the ungrateful safe in this invisibility he was in the process of installing a much more powerful version of the device hed tested earlier at the health club in the nomenclature of electrical service high voltage didnt begin until you hit v for what he had planned he needed to be sure all the systems could handle at least two or three times that much juice he looked over the site of tomorrows attack one more time as he did he couldnt help but think about voltage and amperage and death thered been a lot of misreporting about ben franklin and that insane keyinthethunderstorm thing actually franklin had stayed completely off damp ground in a barn and was connected to the wet kite string with a dry silk ribbon the kite itself was never actually struck by lightning it simply picked up static discharge from a gathering storm the result wasnt a real bolt but rather elegant blue sparks that danced from the back of franklin s hand like fish feeding at the surface of a lake one european scientist duplicated the experiment not long afterward he didnt survive from the earliest days of power generation workers were constantly being burned to death or having their hearts switched off the early grid took down a number of horses thanks to metal shoes on wet cobblestones thomas alva edison and his famous assistant nikola tesla battled constantly over the superiority of dc direct current edison versus ac alternating current tesla trying to sway the public by horror stories of danger the conflict became known as the battle of the currents and it made frontpage news regularly edison constantly played the electrocution card warning that anyone using ac was in danger of dying and in a very unpleasant way it was true that it took less ac current to cause injury though any type of current powerful enough to be useful could also kill you the first electric chair was built by an employee of edison s rather tactically using teslas alternating current the first execution via the device was in under the direction not of an executioner but a state electrician the prisoner did die though the process took eight minutes at least he was probably unconscious by the time he caught fire and then there were always stun guns depending on who was getting shot and in what part of the body they could be counted on for the occasional death and the fear of everyone in the industry arc flashes of course like the attack hed engineered this morning juice and death he wandered through the construction site feigning endofday weariness the site was now staffed by a skeleton crew of nightshift workers he moved closer and still no one noticed him he was wearing thickframed safety glasses the yellow algonquin hard hat he was as invisible as electricity in a wire the first attack had made the news in a big way of course though the stories were limited to an incident in a midtown substation the reporters were abuzz with talk of short circuits sparks and temporary power outages there was a lot of speculation about terrorists but no one had found any connection yet at some point somebody would have to consider the possibility of an algonquin power worker running around rigging traps that resulted in very very unpleasant and painful deaths but that hadnt happened he now left the construction site and made his way underground still unchallenged the uniform and the id badge were like magic keys he slipped into another grimy hot access tunnel and after donning personal protective gear continued to rig the wiring juice and death how elegant it was to take a life this way compared say with shooting your victim at five hundred yards it was so pure and so simple and so natural you could stop electricity you could direct it but you couldnt trick it once juice was created it would instinctively do whatever it could to return to the earth and if the most direct way was to take a human life in the process it would do so in literally a flash juice had no conscience felt no guilt this was one of the things hed come to admire about his weapon unlike human beings electricity was forever true to its nature chapter the city came alive at this time of night nine pm was like a green flag for a car race the dead time in new york wasnt night it was when the city was spiritually numb ironically when it was at its busiest rush hour midmorning and afternoon only now were people shedding the workaday numbness refocusing coming alive making allimportant decisions which bar which friends which shirt bra no bra condoms and then out onto the street fred dellray now loped through the cool spring air sensing the energy rise like what was humming through the electrical cables beneath his feet he didnt drive much didnt own a car but what he was feeling now was akin to punching the accelerator and burning gas in a frenzy as the power flung you toward your fate two blocks from the subway three four and something else burned the in his pocket as he moved along the sidewalk fred dellray couldnt help but thinking have i ruined it all yes im doing the morally right thing id risk my career id risk jail if this thin thread of a lead ultimately revealed the perp whether it was justice for or anyone else anything to save the lives of citizens of course the was nothing to the entity hed taken it from and the cash might thanks to bureaucratic myopia never be missed but even if it wasnt and even if william brents lead blossomed and they were successful in stopping more attacks would dellrays malfeasance gnaw at him the guilt growing larger and larger like a spiky tumor would he fall into such guilt that his life would be altered forever turned gray turned worthless change he was close to turning around and returning to the federal building putting the money back but no he was doing the right thing and hed live with the consequences whatever they were but goddamn william you better come through for me dellray now crossed the street in the village and wandered right up to william brent who blinked in faint surprise as if hed believed dellray wouldnt come they stood together this wasnt a setan undercover operationand it wasnt a recruiting session it was just two guys meeting on the street to conduct business behind them an unclean teenage boy strumming a guitar and bleeding from a recent lip piercing moaned out a song dellray motioned brent along the sidewalk the smell and the sound faded the agent asked you found anything more have yes what once again trying not to sound desperate it wouldnt do any good to say at this point its a lead to a lead ill guarantee you something by tomorrow guarantee not a word you heard often in the snitch business but william brent was your armani of cis besides dellray had no choice say brent said casually you through with the paper sure keep it and handed the foldedup new york post to brent theyd done this all before of course a hundred times the ci slipped the newspaper into his attaché case without even feeling for the envelope inside much less opening it up and counting the money dellray watched the money disappear as if he were watching a coffin submerge into a grave brent didnt ask the source of the cash why should he it wasnt relevant to him the ci now summarized half musing white male a lot of mediums employee or inside connection justice for something rahman terrorism possibly but it could be something else and he knows electricity and significant planning thats all we have for now i dont think i need anything else brent said without a hint of ego dellray took the words and this attitude as encouragement normally even parting with a typical snitch gratuity or sohe felt like he was getting robbed now he had a gut sense that brent would deliver dellray said meet me tomorrow carmellas the village know it i do when noon brent further wrinkled his wrinkled face five three okay dellray was about to whisper please which he didnt think hed ever said to a ci he canned the desperation but had a tough time keeping his eyes off the attaché case whose contents might just be the ashes of his career and for that matter his entire life an image of his sons ebullient face rose he forced it away pleasure doing business with you fred brent smiled and nodded a farewell the streetlight glinted off his oversized glasses and then he was gone chapter thats sachs the deep bubble of a car engine sounded outside the window and fell to silence rhyme was speaking to tucker mcdaniel and lon sellitto both of whom had arrived not long beforeindependentlyaround the time the death doctor had exited so abruptly sachs would be throwing the nypd official business placard on the dash and heading toward the house and yes a moment later the door opened and her footsteps spaced far apart because of her long legs and because of the urgency she wore like her weapon resounded on the floor she nodded to those present and spent a second longer examining rhyme he noted the expression tenderness blended with the clinical eye typical of those in relationships with the severely disabled shed studied quadriplegia more than he had she could handle all the tasks involved in his intimate daytoday routine and did occasionally rhyme was at first embarrassed by this but when she pointed out with humor and maybe a little flirtation hows it different from any other old married couple rhyme hed been brought up short good point was his only response which didnt mean her doting like anyone elses didnt rankle occasionally and he glanced at her once and then turned to the evidence charts sachs looked around wheres the award there was an element of misrepresentation involved what do you mean he explained to her about dr kopeskis bait and switch no rhyme nodded no paperweight you threw him out that was thom and a very fine job he did of it but i dont want to talk about that now we have work to do he glanced at her shoulder bag so what do we have pulling several large files out she said got the list of people who had access to the algonquin computer pass codes and their résumés and employee files what about disgruntled workers mental problems none thatre relevant she gave more details of her meeting with andi jessen there was no record of employees in the steam tunnel work area near the substation on fiftyseventh street there had been no obvious terrorist threats but an associate was looking into the possibility now i spoke to somebody who works in the special projects divisionthats alternative energy basically charlie sommers good guy he gave me the profile of the sort of person who could rig an arc flash a master electrician military electrician a power company lineman or troubleman now thats a job description for you sellitto remarked its really troubleshooter a foreman basically you need onthejob experience to make one of these arc flashes happen you cant just look it up on the internet rhyme nodded at the whiteboard and sachs wrote her summary she added as for the computer youd need to have classroom training or a fair amount of training on the job thats pretty tricky too she explained about the scada and emp programs that the unsub would have to be competent in she added these details to the chart too sellitto asked how manyre on the list over forty ouch mcdaniel muttered rhyme supposed that one of the names on the list could be the perps and maybe sachs or sellitto could narrow it down to a more reasonable number but what he wanted at the moment was evidence of which there was very little at least little that was productive nearly twelve hours had elapsed since the attack and they were no closer to finding the man whod been in the coffee shop or any other suspect the lack of leads was frustrating but more troubling was a simple entry in the unsubs profile chart possibly same person who stole feet of similar bennington cable and split bolts more attacks in mind was he rigging something right now thered been no warning about the bus attack maybe that was the mo for his crimes any moment the networks could report a story that perhaps dozens of people had been killed in a second arc flash explosion mel cooper made a copy of the list and they divided up the names sachs pulaski and sellitto took half mcdaniel the rest for his federal agents to follow up on sachs then looked through the personnel files shed gotten at algonquin and kept the ones that corresponded to the names theyd selected gave the others to mcdaniel this sommers you trust him rhyme asked yes he checked out and he gave me this she whipped out a small black electronic device and pointed it toward a wire near rhyme she pressed a button and read a screen hm two hundred forty volts and how about me sachs am i fully charged she laughed playfully aimed it at him then lifted what he thought was a seductive eyebrow his way her phone buzzed and she glanced at the screen answered she had a brief conversation and hung up that was bob cavanaugh the operations vice president he was the one checking out terrorist connections at the company branches around the region no evidence of ecoterror groups threatening algonquin or attacking their power plants but there was a report of infiltration in one of the companys main philadelphia substations white male in his forties got inside nobody knows who he was or what he was doing there no security tape and he got away before the police arrived this was last week race sex and age thats our boy but what did he want no other intrusions in the companys facilities was the perps mission to get information about the grid the security in substations rhyme could only speculate and accordingly filed the incident away for the time being mcdaniel got a phone call he stared absently at the evidence chart whiteboards then disconnected t and cs had more chatter about the justice for terrorist group what rhyme asked urgently nothing big but one thing interesting theyre using code words thatve been used in the past for largescale weapons paper and supplies were the ones our algorithms isolated he explained that underground cells often did this an attack in france was averted recently when chatter among known negatives included the words gâteau farine and beurre french for cake flour and butter they really referred to a bomb and its ingredients explosives and detonator the mossads reported that hezbollah cells sometimes use office supplies or party supplies for missiles or high explosives now we also think that two people in addition to rahman have been involved man and a woman the computers telling us rhyme asked have you told fred good idea mcdaniel pulled out his blackberry and made a speakerphone call fred its tucker youre on speaker at rhymes you had any luck my cis on it following up on some leads following up nothing more concrete than that a pause dellray said i dont have anything more not yet well t and cs found a few things he updated the agent on the code words and the fact that a man and woman were likely involved dellray said hed report that to his contact mcdaniel asked so he was willing to work within the budget thats right i knew he would these peoplell take advantage of you if you let them fred thats the way cis work happens dellray said somberly stay in touch mcdaniel disconnected stretched this damn cloud zone were not hoovering up nearly as much as wed like hoovering sellitto tapped the stack of personnel files from algonquin ill go downtown get people started on them brother its going to be a long night the time was now eleventen it was rhyme reflected for him too particularly because there wasnt much for him to do at this point but wait oh how he hated waiting eyes straying to the skimpy evidence boards he thought were moving too damn slow and here we are trying to find a perp who attacks with the speed of light unsub profile male s probably white possibly glasses and cap possibly with short blond hair dark blue overalls similar to those worn by algonquin workers knows

the path of least resistance someday man will harness the rise and fall of the tides imprison the power of the sun and release atomic power thomas alva edison on the future of producing electricity chapter eight am low morning light poured into the townhouse lincoln rhyme blinked and maneuvered out of the blinding stream as he steered his storm arrow wheelchair out of the small elevator that connected his bedroom with the lab below sachs mel cooper and lon sellitto had assembled an hour earlier sellitto was on the phone and said okay got it he crossed through another name he hung up rhyme couldnt tell if hed changed clothes maybe hed slept in the den or downstairs bedroom cooper had been home at least for a time and sachs had slept beside rhymefor a portion of the night she was up at fivethirty to keep reviewing employee files and narrowing the list of suspects where are we rhyme now asked sellitto muttered just talked to mcdaniel theyve got six and weve got six you mean were down to twelve suspects lets uhm no linc weve eliminated twelve sachs said the problem is that a lot of the employees on the list are senior they didnt put their early careers on their résumés or all of the continuing education computer courses we have to do a lot of digging to find out if they had the skill to manipulate the grid and rig the device where the hells the dna rhyme snapped shouldnt be long cooper said theyre expediting it expediting was rhymes sour muttered response the new tests generally could be done in a day or two unlike the old rfpl tests which could take a week he didnt understand why the results werent back already and nothing more about justice for sellitto said our peopleve been through all their files mcdaniels too and homeland security and atf and interpol nothing on them or rahman zip fucking creepy that cloud zone thing sounds like something out of a stephen king novel rhyme started to call the lab running the dna analysis but just as he flicked a finger to the touchpad to make a call the phone buzzed he lifted an eyebrow and instantly hit answer call kathryn morning youre up early it was am in california a bit anything more logan was spotted againnear where hed been seen before now i just talked to arturo diaz the law enforcer was up early too a good sign his boss is on the case now the one i mentioned rodolfo luna luna was it turned out very senior indeed the second in command of the mexican ministerial federal police the equivalent of the fbi though burdened with the overwhelming task of running drug enforcement operationsand rooting out corruption in government agencies themselvesluna had eagerly taken over the chance to apprehend the watchmaker dance explained a threat of another killing in mexico wasnt much news and hardly required someone as high up as luna but he was ambitious and hed be thinking that his cooperation with the nypd would pay dividends with mexicos tenuous allies to the north hes larger than life drives around in his own lexus suv carries two guns a real cowboy sort but is he honest arturo was telling me that he plays the system but yes hes honest enough and hes good hes a twentyyear veteran and sometimes goes into the field himself to work a case he even collects evidence on his own rhyme was impressed hed done the same when he was an active captain on the force and working as head of investigation resources he remembered many times when a young technician was startled to turn around at the sound of a voice and see his bosss bosss boss holding a pair of tweezers in gloved hands as he examined a fiber or hair hes made a name for himself cracking down on economic crimes and human trafficking and terrorism put some big people behind bars and hes still alive rhyme said he wasnt being flippant the head of the mexico city police force had been assassinated not long ago he does have a huge security detail dance explained then added hed like to talk to you give me the number dance did slowly shed met rhyme and knew about his disability he moved his right index finger over the special touchpad and typed the numbers they appeared on the flat screen in front of him she then said that the dea was continuing its interview with the man whod delivered a package to logan hes lying when he says he doesnt know what was inside i watched the video and gave the agents some advice on how to handle the interrogation the worker wouldve thought drugs or cash and taken a fast look the fact he didnt steal it means that it wasnt those two things theyre about to start with him again rhyme thanked her oh one thing yes dance gave him a url of a website this too rhyme slowly typed into his browser go to that site i thought youd like to see rodolfo i think its easier to understand someone when you can picture them rhyme didnt know if that was the case or not in his line of work he tended not to see many people at all the victims were usually dead and the ones whod killed them were long gone by the time he got involved given his druthers hed rather not see anyone after disconnecting though he called the site up it was a mexican newspaper story in spanish about a huge drug bust rhyme deduced the officer in charge was rodolfo luna the photo accompanying the story showed a large man surrounded by fellow federal policemen some wore black ski masks to hide their identities others had the grim vigilant look of people whose jobs turned them into marked men luna was a broadfaced darkcomplexioned man he wore a military cap but it seemed that he had a shaved head underneath his olive drab uniform was more military than police and he was decked out with plenty of shiny gingerbread on the chest he had a bushy black mustache surrounded by jowl lines frowning with an intimidating visage he was holding a cigarette and pointing toward something to the left of the scene rhyme placed the call to mexico city again using the touchpad he could have used the voice recognition system but since hed regained some motion in his right hand he tended to prefer to use the mechanical means placing the call took only a country codes extra effort and soon he was talking to luna who had a surprisingly delicate voice with only a slight and completely unrecognizable accent he would be mexican of course but his vowels seemed tinged with french ah ah lincoln rhyme this is very much a pleasure ive read about you and of course i have your books i made sure they were in the course curriculum for my investigators a moments pause he asked forgive me but are you going to update the dna section rhyme had to laugh hed been considering doing exactly that just a few days ago im going to as soon as this case is finished inspector are you an inspector inspector im sorry said the goodnatured voice but why does everybody think that officers in other countries than the united states are inspectors the definitive source for law enforcement training and procedures rhyme said movies and tv a chuckle what would we poor police do without cable but no im a commander in my country the army and the police were often interchangeable and you are a captain ret i see from your book does that mean resident expert technician i was wondering rhyme laughed aloud no it means im retired really and yet here you are working indeed i appreciate your help with this case this is a very dangerous man im pleased to be of assistance your colleague mrs dance shes been very helpful in getting some of our felons extradited back to our own country when there was considerable pressure not to yes shes good he got to the meat of his question i understand youve seen logan my assistant arturo diaz and his team have spotted him twice once yesterday in a hotel and then not long ago nearbyamong office buildings on avenue bosque de reforma in the business district he was taking pictures of the buildings that aroused suspicionthey are hardly architectural marvelsand a traffic officer recognized logans picture arturos men got there quickly but your mr watchmaker vanished before backup arrived hes very elusive that describes him pretty well who are the tenants in the offices he was taking pictures of dozens of companies and some small government ministries satellite offices transport and commerce operations a bank on the ground floor of one would that be significant hes not in mexico for a robbery our intelligence is that this is a murder hes planning were looking into the personnel and the purposes of all the offices right now to see if there might be a likely victim rhyme knew the delicate game of politics but he had no time for finesse and he had a feeling luna didnt either you have to keep your teams out of sight commander you must be much more careful than usual yes of course this man has the eye does he the eye like second sight kathryn dance was telling me hes like a cat he knows when hes in danger no rhyme thought hes just very smart and can anticipate exactly what his opponents are likely to do like a master chess player but he said thats it exactly commander rhyme stared at the picture of luna on his computer dance was right conversations seemed to have more to them when you could visualize the person you were speaking with we have a few of those down here too another chuckle in fact im one of them its why im still alive when so many of my colleagues are not we will continue the surveillancesubtly when we capture him captain perhaps you would like to come for the extradition i dont get out much another pause then a somber ah forgive me i forgot about your injury the one thing rhyme reflected with equal sobriety that he himself never could he said no apologies are necessary luna added well we are verywhat do you sayaccessible here in mexico city you would be welcome to come and very comfortable you could stay at my house and my wife will cook for you i have no stairs to trouble you perhaps we have very good food and i am a collector of mescal and tequilas in that case a celebration dinner might be in order rhyme said to placate him i will earn your presence by capturing this man and perhaps you could lecture to my officers now rhyme laughed to himself he hadnt realized theyd been negotiating rhymes appearance in mexico would be a feather in this mans cap it was one of the reasons hed been so cooperative this was probably the way all businesswhether it was law enforcement or commerceworked in latin america it would be a pleasure rhyme glanced up and saw thom gesturing to him and pointing to the hallway commander i have to go now im grateful you contacted me captain i will be in touch as soon as i learn anything even if it seems insignificant i will absolutely call you chapter thom led trim energetic assistant special agent in charge tucker mcdaniel into the lab again he was accompanied by an associate spiffy and young and compensating whose name rhyme immediately forgot he was easier to think of as the kid capital k anyway he blinked once at the quadriplegic and looked away the asac announced weve eliminated a few more names from the list but theres something else weve got a demand letter who from lon sellitto asked from an examination table where he sat wrinkled as a deflated ball terrorists anonymous and unspecified mcdaniel said pronouncing every syllable primly rhyme wondered if he disliked the man as much as he thought he did partly it was how hed treated fred dellray partly it was just his style and sometimes of course you just didnt need a reason cloud zone the agent continued sounds mostly like a crank eco issues but who knows what its a front for sellitto continued we sure its him after an apparently motiveless attack it wasnt unusual for a number of people to take credit for it and threaten to repeat the incident if some demands werent met even though they themselves had nothing to do with it mcdaniel said in a stiff voice he confirmed details of the bus attack of course we checked that the condescension explained some of rhymes distaste who received it and how rhyme asked andi jessen ill let her give you the details i wanted to get it to you as fast as possible at least the fed wasnt fighting a turf war the dislike eased a bit ive told the mayor washington and homeland security we conferenced about it on the way over though without our presence rhyme noted the fed opened his briefcase and took out a sheet of paper in a clear plastic envelope rhyme nodded to mel cooper who in gloved hands removed the sheet and placed it on an examining table first he photographed it and an instant later the handwritten text appeared on the computer screens around the room to andi jessen ceo and algonquin consolidated power at around am yesterday morning there was an arc flash incident at the mh substation on w street in manhattan this happened by securing a bennington cable and bus bar to a postbreaker line with two split bolts by shutting down four substations and raising the breaker limit at mh an overload of close to two hundred thousand volts caused the flash this incident was entirely your fault and due to your greed and selfishness this is typical of the industry and it is reprehensable enron destroyed the financial lives of people your company destroys our physical lives and the life of the earth by exploiting electricity without regard for its consequences you are destroying our world you insideously work your way into our lives like a virus until we are dependent on what is killing us people must learn they do not need as much electricity as you tell them they do you have to show them the way you are to execute a rolling brownout across the new york city service grid todayreduce levels to fifty per cent of offpeak load for a half hour starting at if you dont do this at pm more people will die rhyme nodded toward the phone and said to sachs call andi jessen she did and a moment later the womans voice came through the speaker detective sachs have you heard yes im here with lincoln rhyme and some people from the fbi and the nypd theyve brought the letter rhyme heard exasperation and anger as the woman said whos behind it we dont know sachs said you have to have some idea mcdaniel identified himself and said the investigations moving along but we dont have a suspect yet the man in the uniform at the coffee shop yesterday morning by the bus stop we dont have his identity were going through the list you gave us but nobodys a clear suspect yet ms jessen this is detective sellitto nypd can you do it do what what hes asking for you know reduce the power rhyme didnt see any problem playing games with the bad guys if a little negotiation gave extra time to analyze the evidence or run surveillance on a terrorist but it wasnt his call this is tucker again ms jessen we strongly recommend against negotiating in the long run that just encourages them to up their demands his eyes were on the large detective who stared right back sellitto persisted it could buy us some breathing room the asac was hesitating perhaps debating the wisdom of not presenting a united front still he said i would firmly recommend against it andi jessen said its not even an issue a citywide fifty percent decrease below offpeak load its not like turning a dimmer switch it would throw off the load patterns throughout the northeast interconnection wed have dropouts and blackouts in dozens of places and weve got millions of customers with onoff systems thatd shut down cold with that drop in power thered be data dumps and resetsd go to default you cant just turn them back on again it would take days of reprogramming and a lot of data would be lost altogether but worse some of the lifecritical infrastructure has battery or generator backup but not all of it hospitals have only so much and some of those systems never work right people will die as a result of it well thought rhyme the writer of the letter had one point right electricity and algonquin and the power companies have indeed worked their way into our lives were dependent on juice there you have it said mcdaniel it cant be done sellitto grimaced rhyme looked toward sachs parker she nodded and scrolled through her blackberry to find the number and email of parker kincaid in washington dc he was a former fbi agent and now a private consultant the best document examiner in the country in rhymes opinion ill send it now she dropped into a chair in front of one of the workstations wrote an email scanned the letter then sent them on their way sellitto snapped open his phone and contacted nypd antiterror along with the emergency service unitthe citys version of swatand told them that another attack was planned for around pm rhyme turned to the phone ms jessen lincoln again that list you gave detective sachs yesterday the employees yes can you get us samples of their handwriting everybody as many as you can as soon as you can i suppose we have signed confidentiality statements from just about everybody probably health forms requests expense accounts rhyme was somewhat skeptical of signatures as representative of handwriting though he was no document examiner you cant be the head of a forensics unit without developing some knowledge of the subject he knew that people tended to scrawl their names carelessly very bad practice hed also learned since a sloppy signature was easier to forge than a precise one but people wrote memos and took notes in a more legible way which was more indicative of how they wrote in general he told this to jessen and she responded that shed put several assistants on the job of finding as many nonsignature examples of handwriting as she could she wasnt happy but seemed to be softening her position that an algonquin employee couldnt be involved rhyme turned away from the phone and called sachs is he there is parker there whats going on she nodded hes at some function or something im getting patched through kincaid was a single father of two children robby and stephanie and he carefully balanced his personal and professional liveshis commitment to his kids was why hed quit the fbi to become like rhyme a consultant but rhyme knew too that for a case like this kincaid would get on board instantly and do what he could to help the criminalist turned back to the phone ms jessen could you scan them and send them to an eyebrow raised toward sachs who called out parker kincaids email address ive got it jessen said those are terms in the business i assume rhyme asked rolling brownout shedding load service grid offpeak load thats right does that give us any details about him not really theyre technical aspects of the business but if he could adjust the computer and rig a flash arc device then hed know those too anybody in the power industry would know them how did you get the letter it was delivered to my apartment building is your address public im not listed in the phone book but i suppose it wouldnt be impossible to find me rhyme persisted how exactly did you receive it i live in a doorman building upper east side somebody rang the back delivery bell in the lobby the doorman went to go see when he got back the letter was at his station it was marked emergency delivery immediately to andi jessen is there video security rhyme asked no who handled it the doorman just the envelope though i had a messenger from the office pick it up he would have touched it too and i did of course mcdaniel was about to say something but rhyme beat him to it the letter was time sensitive so whoever left it knew you had a doorman so that it would get to you immediately mcdaniel was nodding apparently that would have been his comment the brighteyed kid nodded as well like a bobblehead dog in the back window of a car after a moment i guess thats right the concern was obvious in her voice so that means he knows about me maybe knows a lot about me do you have a bodyguard sellitto asked our security director at work bernie wahl you met him detective sachs hes got four armed guards on staff each shift but not at home i never thought well get somebody from patrol stationed outside your apartment sellitto said as he made the call mcdaniel asked what about family in the area we should have somebody look out for them momentary silence from the speaker then why he might try to use them as leverage oh jessens otherwise rugged voice sounded small at the implications those close to her being hurt but she explained my parents are in florida sachs asked you have a brother dont you didnt i see his picture on your desk my brother we dont stay in touch much and he doesnt live here another voice interrupted her jessen came back on the line look im sorry the governors calling hes just heard the news with a click she disconnected so sellitto lifted his palms his eyes grazed mcdaniel but then settled on rhyme this makes it all pretty fucking easy easy asked the kid yeah sellitto nodded at the digital clock on a nearby flatscreen monitor if we cant negotiate all we gotta do is find him in under three hours piece of cake chapter mel cooper and rhyme were working on the analysis of the letter ron pulaski had arrived too a few minutes earlier lon sellitto was speeding downtown to coordinate with esu in the event they could either id a suspect or find his possible target tucker mcdaniel looked over the demand letter as if it were some type of food hed never encountered rhyme supposed this was because handwriting on a piece of paper didnt fall into cloud zone law enforcement it was the antithesis of hightech communications his computers and sophisticated tracing systems were useless against paper and ink rhyme glanced at the script he knew from his own training as well as from working with parker kincaid that handwriting doesnt reveal anything about the personality of the writer whatever the grocery store checkoutstand books and news pundits suggested analysis could be illuminating of course if you had another identified sample to compare it with so you could determine if the writer of the second document was the same as the one who wrote the first parker kincaid would be doing this now running a preliminary comparison with known handwriting samples of terror suspects and comparing them with the writing of those algonquin employees who were on the company list handwriting and content could also suggest right or lefthandedness level of education national and regional upbringing mental and physical illnesses and intoxication or drugimpaired states but rhymes interest in the note was more basic the source of the paper source of the ink the fingerprints and trace embedded in the fibers all of which after coopers diligent analysis added up to a big fat nothing the sources for both paper stock and ink were genericthey could have come from one of thousands of stores andi jessens prints were the only ones on the letter and those on the envelope were from the messenger and the doorman mcdaniels agents had taken samples of their prints and forwarded them to rhyme useless rhyme reflected bitterly the only deduction was that the perp was smart and had a great sense of survival but ten minutes later they had a breakthrough of sorts parker kincaid was on the line from his document examination office in his house in fairfax virginia lincoln parker whatve we got kincaid said first the handwriting comparison the control samples from algonquin itself were pretty sparse so i couldnt do the complete analysis i would have liked i understand that but ive narrowed it down to twelve employees twelve excellent here are the names ready rhyme glanced at cooper who nodded the tech jotted them down as kincaid dictated now i can give you a few other things about him first hes righthanded then i picked some characteristics from the language and word choice go ahead at rhymes nod cooper walked to the profile board hes a product of high school and probably some college and it was an american education there are a few spelling grammatical and punctuation mistakes but mostly with more difficult words or constructions i put those down to the stress of what hes doing he was probably born here i cant say for sure that he isnt of foreign extraction but english is his first and im almost positive only language cooper wrote this down kincaid continued hes also pretty clever he doesnt write in the first person and avoids the active voice rhyme understood he never says anything about himself exactly suggesting there could be others working with him its a possibility also theres some variation on ascenders and descenders you get that when a subject is upset emotional theyre writing in anger or distress and broader strokes tend to be emphasized good rhyme nodded at cooper who jotted this too onto the profile board thanks parker well get to work they disconnected twelve rhyme sighed he looked over the evidence and profile chart then the names of the suspects dont we have any way to narrow it down faster he asked bitterly watching his clock advance one more minute toward the approaching deadline crime scene

construction master electrician military profile from parker kincaid re handwriting righthanded high school education at least probably college american educated english first and probably only language writes with passive voice to keep from giving away accomplices could match one of algonquin employees emotional angry distressed writing the letter chapter mel cooper in front of his computer sat up quickly i think ive got one one what rhyme asked acerbically a way to narrow down the list cooper sat up straighter yet and shoved his glasses higher onto the bridge of his nose as he read an email the hair that we got from the coffee shop across from the substation no bulb so theres no dna rhyme pointed out abruptly he was still irritated that the analysis wasnt ready yet i dont mean that lincoln ive just got the toxchem screening from the hair itself vinblastine and prednisone in significant quantities and traces of etoposide cancer patient rhyme said leaning his head forwardhis version of coopers own posture adjustment hes on a chemotherapy regimen has to be the young fbi protégé of mcdaniels barked a laugh how do you know that then to his boss thats pretty good youd be surprised ron pulaski said rhyme ignored them both call algonquin and see if any of the twelve on the list made health claims for cancer treatment in the past five or six months sachs called algonquin andi jessen was on the phoneprobably with the governor or mayorand sachs was transferred to the companys security chief bernard wahl through speakerphone the deep africanamericaninflected voice reassured them that hed look into it immediately it wasnt quite immediate but it was good enough for rhyme three minutes later wahl came back on the line therere six cancer patients on the original listof the fortytwo but only two on the list of the twelve the ones whose handwriting could match the demand letter one of those is a manager in the energy brokerage department he was supposedly flying into town from a business trip at the time of the attack wahl gave the relevant information mel cooper took it down and at a nod from rhyme called the airline to check transportation security had become an unwitting partner in general law enforcement because identification requirements were now so stringent that the whereabouts of people flying could be verified easily he checks out what about the other one yessir well hes a possibility raymond galt forty hes made health claims for leukemia treatment over the past year rhyme shot a glance to sachs who knew instinctively what the look meant they communicated this way often she dropped into a chair and began keyboarding his history rhyme said wahl answered started with a competitor in the midwest and then joined algonquin competitor he paused well not really competitor like carmakers are thats just how we refer to other power companies what does galt do for you now hes a troubleman wahl said rhyme was staring at the profile on his computer screen a troubleman would have enough experience to put together an arc flash weapon like the sort at the substation according to charlie sommers he asked mel take a look at galts file would he know scada and the energy management program cooper opened the mans personnel file doesnt say specifically just that hes taken a lot of continuing education courses mr wahl is galt married single rhyme asked the security chief single lives in manhattan you want his address sir yes wahl gave it to them this is tucker mcdaniel what about whereabouts mr wahl mcdaniel asked urgently thats the thing he called in sick two days ago nobody knows where he is any chance hes done some traveling lately maybe to hawaii or oregon someplace where theres a volcano volcano why struggling to be patient rhyme asked just has he traveled according to his time sheets no hes taken a few days medicali guess for the cancer treatmentbut he hasnt been on a vacation since last year could you check with his fellow employees and see if they know about places he goes friends outside of the company any groups hes in yessir thinking of the greek food connection rhyme asked and anybody he goes to lunch with regularly yessir mr wahl what about galts next of kin mcdaniel asked wahl reported that galts father was dead but his mother and a sister lived in missouri he recited the names addresses and phone numbers rhymeand mcdaniel toocould think of nothing else to ask the security chief the criminalist thanked him and they disconnected mcdaniel instructed his underling to contact the fbis resident agency in cape girardeau missouri and have them start surveillance probable cause to get a tap the kid asked doubt it but push for one get a pen register at least im on it rhyme sachs called he looked up at the screen which revealed the fruits of sachss frantic keyboarding the dmv picture showed a pale man gazing unsmiling at the camera he was blond hair trimmed short about an inch long so mcdaniel said weve got a suspect good job lincoln well congratulate ourselves when hes in custody he then squinted at the dmv information which confirmed the address his place is on the lower east side not many colleges or museums there i think the volcanic ash mustve come from the place hes going to attack maybe the next target and hed want a public location lots of people lots of victims a glance at the clock it was tenthirty mel check again with your geology person at hq we need to move im on it mcdaniel said ill call a magistrate for a warrant and get a tac team ready to hit galts place rhyme nodded and called sellitto still en route to city hall the detectives voice rattled from the speaker ive just blown through about five hundred traffic lights linc im thinking if this asshole shuts down the grid and the lights go were fucked no way to rhyme cut him off lon listen weve got a name raymond galt hes a troubleman at algonquin not absolute but it looks likely mels going to email you the particulars cooper juggling the phone call about the lava search began typing the relevant information about the suspect into a text ill get esu down there now sellitto called were sending our tac team mcdaniel said quickly like schoolkids rhyme thought whoever it is i dont think matters but the point is now via speaker conference the detective and the agent agreed to taskforce the raid and each arranged to assemble and deploy teams rhyme then warned were getting close to the deadline so he probably wont be there if not then i want only my person running the scene at galts apartment no problem mcdaniel said me sachs lifted an eyebrow no if we get any leads to the next attack i want you there he glanced at pulaski me same pronoun different tone get going rookie and remember i know pulaski said those arc thingsre five thousand degrees fahrenheit ill be careful rhyme grunted a laugh what i was going to say was dont fuck up now move chapter plenty of metal metal everywhere ron pulaski glanced at his watch eleven am two hours until another attack metal wonderfully conductive and possibly connected to wires that ran to one of the invisible sources of juice in the bowels of the lousy apartment building he was standing in armed with a warrant the fbi and esu teams had foundto everyones disappointment but no ones surprisethat galt wasnt there pulaski then shooed the officers out and was now surveying the dim apartment the basement unit in an old decrepit brownstone on the lower east side he and three tactical officers had cleared the placeonly the four of them as rhyme had ordered to minimize contamination of the scene the team was now outside and pulaski was examining the small place by himself and seeing a lot of metal that could be rigged the way the battery was rigged in the substationthe trap that had nearly killed amelia also picturing the metal disks on the sidewalk seeing the scars in the concrete and in the body of poor young luis martin and he recalled something else too something even more troubling amelia sachss eyes looking spooked which they never did if this electricity crap could scare her last night after his wife jenny had gone to bed ron pulaski went online to learn what he could about electricity if you understand something lincoln rhyme had told him you fear it less knowledge is control except with electricity with power with juice that wasnt quite the case the more he learned the more uneasy he grew he could grasp the basic concept but he kept coming back to the fact it was so damn invisible you never knew exactly where it was like a poisonous snake in a dark room he then shook himself out of these thoughts lincoln rhyme had entrusted the scene to him so get to work on the drive here hed called in and asked if rhyme wanted him to hook up via radio and video and walk him through the scene like he sometimes did with amelia rhyme had said im busy rookie if you cant run a scene by now theres no damn hope for you click which to most people wouldve been an insult but it put a big grin on pulaskis face and he wanted to call his twin brother a uniform down in the sixth precinct and tell him what had happened he didnt of course hed save that for when they went out for beers this weekend and so solo he started the search pulling on the latex gloves galts apartment was a cheesy depressing place clearly the home of a bachelor who cared zero about his environment dark small musty food half fresh and half old some of it way old clothes piled up the immediate search as rhyme had impressed on him was not to gather evidence for trialthough he better not fuck up the chain of custody cardsbut to find out where galt might be going to attack again and what if any connection he had with rahman and justice for presently he was searching fast through the unsteady scabby desk and the battered filing cabinets and boxes for references to motels or hotels other apartments friends vacation houses a map with a big red x and a note attack here but of course there wasnt anything that obvious in fact there was very little helpful at all no address books notes letters the call log in and out on the phone had been wiped and hitting redial he heard the electronic voice ask what city and state he needed a number for galt had taken his laptop with him and there was no other computer here pulaski found sheets of paper and envelopes similar to what had been used for the demand note a dozen pens too he collected these and bagged them when he found nothing else helpful he began walking the grid laying the numbers photographing and collecting samples of trace he moved as quickly as he could though as often wrestling with the fear which was always with him afraid that hed get hurt again which made him timid and want to pull back but that in turn led to another fear that if he didnt do percent he wouldnt live up to expectations hed disappoint his wife his brother amelia sachs disappoint lincoln rhyme but it was so hard to shake the fear his hands started to quiver breath came fast and he jumped at the sound of a creak calming remembering his wifes comforting voice whispering youre okay youre okay youre okay he started again he located a back closet and was about to open it but he noted the metal handle he was on linoleum but he didnt know if that was safe enough he was too spooked to open the door even with the cs latex gloves he picked up a rubber dish mat and used that to grip the knob he opened the door and inside was proof positive that ray galt was the perp a hacksaw with a broken blade the bolt cutter too he knew his job here was only to walk the grid and collect evidence but he couldnt help pulling a small magnifier from his pocket and looking over the tool noting that it had a notch on the blade that could have left the distinctive mark on the grating bar hed collected at the substation scene near the bus stop he bagged and tagged them in another small cabinet he discovered a pair of albertsonfenwick boots size his phone trilled startling him it was lincoln rhyme on caller id pulaski answered at once lincoln i you find anything about hideyholes rookie vehicles he mightve rented friends he might be staying with anything at all about target locations no hes kind of sanitized the place i found the tools and boots though its definitely him i want locations addresses yessir i click pulaski snapped the phone shut and carefully bagged the evidence hed collected so far then he went through the entire apartment twice including the refrigerator the freezer all the closets even food cartons large enough to hide something nothing now the fear was replaced by frustration hed found evidence that galt was the attacker but nothing else about him where he might be what his target was then his eyes settled on the desk again he was looking at a cheap computer printer on the top a yellow light was blinking he approached it the message was clear jam what had galt been printing the cop carefully opened the lid and peered into the guts of the machine he could see the tangle of paper he could also see a sign that warned danger electric shock risk unplug before clearing jam or servicing presumably there might be other pages in the queue something that could be helpful maybe even key but if he unplugged the unit the memory would dump the remaining pages of the job he started to reach in carefully then he pictured the molten bits of metal again five thousand degrees a glance at his watch shit amelia had told him not to go near electricity with anything metallic on hed forgotten about it goddamn head injury why couldnt he think straighter he pulled the watch off put it in his pocket jesus our lord what good is that going to do he put the seiko on the desk far away from the printer one more attempt but the fear got to him again he was furious with himself for hesitating shit he muttered and returned to the kitchen he found some bulky pink playtex gloves he pulled them on and looking around to make sure no fbi agents or esu cops were peering in at the ridiculous sight walked back to the printer he opened the evidence collection kit and selected the best tool to clear the jam and get the printer working again tweezers they were of course metal ones just the ticket to make a nice solid connection to any exposed electric wires galt had rigged inside the printer he glanced at his watch six feet away less than an hour and a half until the next attack ron pulaski leaned forward and eased the tweezers between two very thick wires chapter news stations were broadcasting galts picture former girlfriends were being interviewed as was his bowling team and his oncologist but there were no leads hed gone underground mel coopers geology expert at queens cs had found twentyone exhibits in the new york metropolitan area that might involve volcanic ash including an artist in queens who was using lava rock to make sculpture cooper muttered twenty thousand dollars for something the size of a watermelon which is what it looks like by the way rhyme nodded absently and listened to mcdaniel now back at federal plaza explain on speakerphone that galts mother hadnt heard from him for a few days but that wasnt unusual hed been upset lately because hed been sick rhyme asked you get a title three on them the agent explained testily that the magistrate hadnt been persuaded to issue a wiretap on galts family members but weve got a pen a pen register phone tap wouldnt allow agents to listen to the conversation but would reveal the numbers of anyone who called them and of anybody they phoned those could then be traced impatient rhyme had contacted pulaski again whod responded immediately and with a shaking voice saying the buzzing phone had scared the you know what out of me the young officer told rhyme he was extracting information from raymond galts computer printer jesus rookie dont do that yourself its okay im standing on a rubber mat i dont mean that only let experts go through a computer there could be datawipe programs no no theres no computer just the printer its jammed and im nothing about addresses locations of the next attack no call the minute call the second you find something i click the joint task force had had little luck in canvassing people on fiftyseventh street and in ray galts neighborhood the perpno longer an unsubhad gone underground galts mobile was dead the battery had been removed so it couldnt be traced his service provider reported sachs was on her own phone head down listening she thanked the caller and disconnected that was bernie wahl again he said hed talked to people in galts departmentnew york emergency maintenanceand everybody said he was a loner he didnt socialize nobody regularly had lunch with him he liked the solitude of working on the lines rhyme nodded at this information he then told the fbi agent about the sources for the lava weve found twentyone locations were twentytwo cooper called on the phone with the cs woman in queens brooklyn art gallery on henry street mcdaniel sighed that many afraid so then rhyme said we should let fred know mcdaniel didnt respond fred dellray your employee rhyme added silently he should tell his ci about galt right hold on ill conference him in there were some clicks and a few heartbeats of silence then they heard lo thiss dellray fred tucker here with lincoln on conference weve got a suspect who mcdaniel glanced at rhyme who explained about ray galt we dont have a motive but its pointing to him you found him no hes mia weve got a team at his apartment the deadlines still a go mcdaniel said we have no reason to think otherwise you found anything fred my cis got some good leads im waiting to hear anything you can share the asac asked pointedly not at this point im meeting him at three he tells me hes got something ill call him and give him galts name maybe thatll speed things up they disconnected only a moment later rhymes phone rang again is this detective rhyme a woman asked yes thats me its andi jessen algonquin consolidated mcdaniel identified himself then have you heard anything more from him no but theres a situation i have to tell you about her husky urgent voice got rhymes full attention go ahead like i told you we changed the computer codes so he couldnt repeat what happened yesterday i remember and i ordered security around all the substations twentyfourseven but about fifteen minutes ago a fire started in one of our uptown substations one in harlem arson rhyme asked thats right the guards were in front it looks like somebody threw a firebomb through the back window or something the fires been extinguished but it caused a problem destroyed the switchgear that means we cant manually take that substation offline its a runaway theres no way to stop the electricity flowing through the transmission lines without shutting down the entire grid rhyme sensed she was concerned but he didnt grasp the implications he asked her to clarify she said i think hes done something thats pretty crazyhe cut directly into an area transmission line running from the substation that burned thats nearly a hundred and fifty thousand volts how could he do it rhyme asked i thought he used the substation yesterday because it was too dangerous to splice into a main line true but i dont know maybe hes developed some kind of remote switchgear to let him rig a splice then activate it later mcdaniel asked any idea where the line im thinking of is about threequarters of a mile long it runs under central and west harlem to the river and you absolutely cant shut it down not until the switchgears repaired in the burned substation thatll take a few hours and this arc flash could be as bad as yesterdays rhyme asked at least yes okay well check it out detective rhyme tucker her voice was less brittle than earlier it was the fbi agent who said yes im sorry i think i was being difficult yesterday but i honestly didnt believe that one of my employees would do this i understand mcdaniel said at least weve got the name now if were lucky well stop him before more people get hurt as they disconnected rhyme was shouting mel you get that uptown morningside heights harlem museum sculptor whatever now find me a possible target rhyme then called the temporary head of the crime scene unit in queens the man with his former joband asked him to send a team to the substation closed because of the arson and have them bring back whatever they find stat got a possibility cooper called tilting his head away from the phone columbia university one of the biggest lava and igneous rock collections in the country rhyme turned to sachs she nodded i can be there in ten minutes they were both glancing at the digital clock on rhymes computer screen the time was chapter amelia sachs was on the columbia university campus morningside heights in northern manhattan she had just left the earth and environmental science department office where a helpful receptionist had said we dont have a volcano exhibit as such but we have hundreds of samples of volcanic ash lava and other igneous rock whenever some undergrads come back from a field project theres dust all over the place im here rhyme she said into the mike and told him what shed learned about the volcanic ash he was saying ive been talking to andi jessen again the transmission line goes underground basically all the way from fifth avenue to the hudson it roughly follows a hundred and sixteen street but the lava dust means the arc is rigged somewhere near the campus whats around there sachs just classrooms mostly administration the target could be any of them sachs was looking from right to left a clear cool spring day students meandering or jogging sitting on the grass the library steps i dont see a lot of likely targets though rhyme the schools old mostly stone and wood it looks like no steel or wires or anything like that i dont know how he could rig a large trap here to hurt a significant number of people then rhyme asked which way is the wind blowing sachs considered this to the east and northeast it looks like logically what would you think dust wouldnt blow that far maybe a few blocks id think thatd put him in morningside park rhyme told her ill call andi jessen or somebody at algonquin and find out where the transmission lines are under the park and sachs what he hesitated she guessedno knewthat he was going to tell her to be careful but that was an unnecessary comment nothing he said and disconnected abruptly amelia sachs walked out one of the main gates in the direction the wind was blowing she crossed amsterdam and headed down a street in morningside heights east of the campus toward dunshaded apartments and dark row houses solidly built of granite and brick when her phone trilled she glanced at caller id rhyme what do you have i just talked to andi she said the transmission line jogs north around a hundred seventeenth then runs west under the park im just about there rhyme i dont see oh no what sachs ahead of her was morningside park filled with people as the hour approached lunchtime children nannies businesspeople columbia students musicians hundreds of them just hanging out enjoying the beautiful day people on the sidewalks too but the number of targets was only part of what dismayed sachs rhyme the whole west side of the park morningside drive what theyre doing construction replacing water mains theyre big iron pipes god if hes rigged the line to them rhyme said then the flash could hit anywhere on the street hell it could even get inside any building office dorm a store nearby or maybe miles away ive got to find where he connected it rhyme she slipped her phone into its holster and jogged to the construction site chapter sam vetter had mixed feelings about being in new york the sixtyeightyearold had never been here before hed always wanted to make the trip from scottsdale where hed lived for percent of those years and ruth had always wanted to see the place but their vacations found them in california or hawaii or on cruises to alaska now ironically his first business trip after her death had brought him to new york all expenses paid happy to be here sad ruth couldnt be he was having lunch sitting in the elegant muted battery park hotel dining room chatting with a few of the other men who were here for the construction finance meeting sipping a beer businessman talk wall street team sports some individual sports talk too but only golf nobody ever talked about tennis which was vetters game sure federer nadal but tennis wasnt a war story sport the topic of women didnt much enter into the discussion these men were all of an age vetter looked around him through the panoramic windows and worked on his impression of new york because his secretary and associates back home would want to know what he thought so far really busy really rich really loud really grayeven though the sky was cloudless like the sun knew that new yorkers didnt have much use for light mixed feelings part of which was a little guilt about enjoying himself he was going to see wicked to see if it stacked up to the phoenix version and probably billy elliott to see if it stacked up to the trailers of the movie he was going to have dinner in chinatown with two of the bankers hed met that morning one based here and one from santa fe maybe there was a hint of infidelity about the whole enjoyment thing of course ruth wouldntve minded but still vetter also had to admit he was feeling a little out of his element here his company did general construction specializing in the basics foundations driveways platforms walkways nothing sexy but necessary and ohsoprofitable his outfit was good prompt and ethical in a business where those qualities were not always fully unfurled but it was small the other companies that were part of the joint venture were bigger players they were more savvy about business and regulatory and legislative matters than he was the conversation at the lunch table kept slipping from the diamondbacks and the mets to collateral interest rates and hightech systems that left vetter confused he found himself looking out the windows again at a large construction site next to the hotel some big office building or apartment going up as he watched one worker in particular caught his eye the man was in a different outfitdark blue overalls and yellow hard hatand was carrying a roll of wire or cable over his shoulder he emerged from a manhole near the back of the job site and stood looking around blinking he pulled out a mobile phone and placed a call then he snapped it closed and wandered through the site and instead of leaving walked toward the building next door to the construction he looked at ease walking with a bounce in his step obviously he was enjoying whatever he was doing it was all so normal that guy in the blue could have been vetter thirty years ago he could have been any one of vetters employees now the businessman began to relax the scene made him feel a lot more at homewatching the guy in the blue uniform and the others in their carhartt jackets and overalls carrying tools and supplies joking with one another he thought of his own company and the people he worked with who were like family the older white guys quiet and skinny and sunburned all of them looking like theyd been born mixing concrete and the newer workers latino who chatted up a storm and worked with more precision and pride it told vetter that maybe new york and the people he was doing this deal with were in many ways similar to his world and those who inhabited it relax then his eyes followed the man in the blue overalls and yellow hard hat as he disappeared into a building across from the construction site it was a school sam vetter noted some signs in the window pogo stick marathon fundraiser may jump for the cure crossgendered students dinner may sign up now the earth sciences department presents volcanoes up close and personal april may its free and its fiery open to the public okay he admitted with a laugh maybe new york is a little different from scottsdale after all chapter rhyme continued to look over the evidence trying desperately to find in the seemingly unrelated bits of metal and plastic and dust that had been collected at the scenes some connection to spark his imagination and help sachs figure out where exactly galt had rigged the deadly cable to the water line running through morningside heights and harlem if thats in fact what hed done spark his imagination bad choice of word he decided sachs continued to search morningside park looking for the spliced wire running from the transmission cable to the pipes he knew shed be uneasythere was no way to find the wire except to get close to it to find where it had been attached to the water pipes he recalled the tone of her voice her hollow eyes as shed described the shrapnel from the arc flash yesterday peppering luis martins body there were dozens of uniformed officers from the closest precinct clearing morningside park and the buildings in the vicinity of the water pipe project but couldnt the electricity follow a castiron pipe anywhere couldnt it produce an arc flash in a kitchen a mile away in his own kitchen where thom was now standing at the sink rhyme glanced at the clock on his computer screen if they didnt find the line in sixty minutes theyd have their answer sachs called back nothing rhyme maybe im wrong and i was thinking at some point the line has to cross the subway what if hes rigged it to hit a car ill have to search there too were still on the horn with algonquin trying to narrow it down sachs ill call you back he shouted to mel cooper anything the tech was speaking with a supervisor in the algonquin control center following andi jessens orders he and his staff were trying to find if there had been any voltage fluctuation in specific parts of the line this might be possible to detect since sensors were spaced every few hundred feet to alert them if there were problems with insulation or degradation in the electric transmission line itself there was a chance they could pinpoint where galt had tapped into the line to run his deadly cable to the surface but from cooper nothing sorry rhyme closed his eyes briefly the headache hed denied earlier had grown in intensity he wondered if pain was throbbing elsewhere there was always that concern with quadriplegia without pain you never know what the rebellious bodys up to a tree falls in the forest of course it makes a sound even if nobodys there but does pain exist if you dont perceive it these thoughts left a morbid flavor rhyme realized and he understood too that hed been having similar ones lately he wasnt sure why but he couldnt shake them and even stranger unlike his jousting with thom yesterday at this same time of day he didnt want any scotch was nearly repulsed by the idea this bothered him more than the headache his eyes scanned the evidence charts but they skipped over the words as if they were in a foreign language hed studied in school and hadnt used for years then they settled on the chart again tracing the flow of juice from power generation to household in decreasing voltages one hundred and thirtyeight thousand volts rhyme asked mel cooper to call sommers at algonquin special projects charlie sommers thats right this is lincoln rhyme i work with amelia sachs oh sure she mentioned you in a soft voice he said i heard it was ray galt one of our people is that true looks that way mr sommers hey call me charlie i feel like im an honorary cop okay charlie are you following whats happening right now ive got the grid on my laptop screen right here andi jessenour presidentasked me to monitor whats going on how close are they to fixing the whats it called switchgear in the substation where they had that fire two three hours that lines still a runaway nothing we can do to shut it down except turn off the switch to most of new york city is there anything i can do to help yes i need to know more about arc flashes it looks like galts spliced into a major line a transmission level line and hooked his wire to the water main then no no he wouldnt do that why not its a ground itd short out the instant it touched rhyme thought for a minute then another idea occurred to him what if he was just hinting at tapping into the transmission line maybe he actually rigged a smaller trap someplace else how much voltage would you need for an arc a hundred and thirty thousand is your arc flash of mass destruction but sure you can have one with a lot less juice the key is that the voltage exceeds the capacity of the line or terminal thats carrying it the arc jumps from that to another wirethats phase to phase or to the ground phase to ground with house current youll get a spark but not an arc flash thats at most about two hundred volts when youre closer to four hundred yes a small arc is possible over six hundred its a strong possibility but youre not going to see any serious length until you get into medium to high voltages so a thousand volts could do it if the conditions were right sure rhyme was staring at the map of manhattan focusing on where sachs was at the moment this news exponentially increased the number of places where galt might have planned his attack but whyre you asking about arcs sommers wondered because rhyme said absently galts going to kill somebody with one in less than an hour oh did galts note say something about an arc rhyme realized that it didnt no so youre just assuming thats what hed do rhyme hated the word assumption and all its derivatives he was furious with himself wondering if theyd missed something important go on charlie an arc is spectacular but its also one of the least efficient ways to use electricity as a weapon you cant control it very well youre never sure where its going to end up look at yesterday morning i mean galt had a whole bus for a target and he missed you want to know how id kill somebody with electricity lincoln rhyme said quickly yes i very much would and tilted his head to the phone to listen with complete concentration chapter thomas edison introduced overhead transmission those ugly towers in new jersey in but the first grid ran beneath the streets of lower manhattan starting from his generating station on pearl street he had a grand total of fiftynine customers some linemen hated the underground gridthe dark grid as it was sometimes calledbut joey barzan loved it down here hed been with algonquin power for only a couple of years but had been in the electrical trades for ten years since hed started working at eighteen hed worked private construction before joining the company moving his way up from apprentice to journeyman he was thinking of going on and becoming a master electrician and he would someday but for now he liked working for a big company and what bigger outfit could he find than algonquin consolidated one of the top companies in the country a half hour earlier he and his partner had gotten a call from his troubleman that thered been a curious fluctuation in power in the supply to a subway system near wall street some of the mta lines had their own power plants miniature versions of algonquins mom but this line the one rumbling nearby right now was powered purely by algonquin juice the company transmitted volts from queens to substations along the line which stepped it down and converted it to volts dc for the third rails a gauge in a nearby mta substation reported that for a fraction of a second thered been a dropout not enough to cause any disruption of subway service but enough to be concernedconsidering the incident at the bus station early yesterday and damn an algonquin employee was the one behind it ray galt a senior troubleman in queens barzan had seen arc flasheseveryone in the business had at one time or anotherand the spectacle of the burning lightning the explosion the eerie hum was enough to make him promise himself hed never take a chance with juice ppe gloves and boots insulated hot sticks no metal on the job a lot of people thought they could outthink juice well you cant and you cant outrun it either nowhis partner up top brieflybarzan was looking for anything that mightve caused the current to dip it was cool here and deserted but not quiet motors hummed and subways shook the ground like earthquakes yep he liked it here among the cables and the smell of hot insulation rubber oil new york city is a ship with as much structure under the surface as above and he knew all the decks as well as he knew his neighborhood in the bronx he couldnt figure out what had caused the fluctuation the algonquin lines all seemed fine maybe he paused seeing something that made him curious what is that he wondered like all linemen whether up top or in the dark grid he knew his territory and at the dim end of the tunnel was something that wasnt right a cable was spliced to one of the breaker panels feeding the subway system for no logical reason and instead of running down into the ground to reach the subway this went up and ran across the ceiling of the tunnel it was well splicedyou judged a linemans skill by how well he joined linesso itd been done by a pro but who and why he stood and started to follow it then gasped in fright another algonquin worker was standing in the tunnel the man seemed even more surprised to run into somebody in the dimness barzan didnt recognize him hi there barzan nodded neither shook hands they were wearing ppe gloves bulkythick enough for livewire work provided the rest of the dielectric was adequate the other guy blinked and wiped sweat didnt expect anybody down here me either you hear about the fluctuation yeah the man said something else but barzan wasnt really listening he was wondering what the guy was doing exactly looking at his laptopall linemen used these of course everything on the grid being computerized but he wasnt checking voltage levels or switchgear integrity on the screen was a video image it looked like the construction site that was pretty much overhead like what youd see from a security camera with good resolution and then barzan glanced at the guys algonquin id badge oh shit raymond galt senior technical service operator barzan felt his breath hiss from his lungs recalling the supervisor that morning calling in all the linemen and explaining about galt and what hed done he now realized that the spliced cable was rigged to create another arc flash be cool he told himself it was pretty dark down here and galt couldnt see his face very well he mightve missed barzans surprised reaction and the company and the police had made the announcement only a little while ago maybe galt had been down here for the past couple of hours and didnt know the cops were looking for him well lunchtime im starving barzan started to pat his stomach and then decided that was overacting better get back upstairs my partnerll be wondering what im doing down here hey take care galt said and turned back to the computer barzan too turned to head toward the closest exit stifling the urge to flee he should have given into it he quickly realized the instant barzan turned he was aware of galt reaching down fast and lifting something from beside him barzan started to run but galt was even faster and glancing back barzan had only a brief image of a linemans heavy fiberglass hot stick swinging in an arc into his hard hat the blow stunned him and sent him tumbling to the filthy floor he was focused on a line carrying v six inches from his face when the stick slammed into him once more chapter amelia sachs was doing what she did best perhaps not best but doing what she loved most what made her feel the most alive driving pushing metal and flesh to its limits speeding fast along city streets seemingly impossible routes considering the dense traffic human and vehicular weaving skidding when you drove fast you didnt ease the vehicle along the course you didnt dance you pounded the car through its moves you slammed and jerked and slugged these were called muscle cars for a reason the model year ford torino cobra heir to the fairlane pushed out horsepower with a nifty foot pounds of torque sachs had the optional fourspeed transmission of course which she needed for her heavy foot the shifter was tough and sticky and if you didnt get it right youd have adjustments aplenty which might include flushing gear teeth out of the reservoir it wasnt like todays forgiving sixspeed syncromeshes made for midlifecrisis businessmen with bluetooths stuck into their ear and dinner reservations on their mind the cobra wheezed growled whined it had many voices sachs tensed she gave a touch of horn but before the sound waves made it to the lazy driver about to change lanes without looking she was past him sachs admitted that she missed her most recent car a chevy camaro ss the one she and her father had worked on together it had been a victim of the perp in a recent case but her father had reminded her it wasnt wise to put too much person into your car it was part of you but it wasnt you and it wasnt your child or your best friend the rods wheels the cylinders the drums the tricky electronics could turn indifferent or lazy and strand you they could also betray and kill you and if you thought the conglomeration of steel and plastic and copper and aluminum cared you were wrong amie a car has only the soul you put into it no more and no less and never forget that so yes she regretted the loss of her camaro and always would but she now drove a fine vehicle that suited her and that incongruously sported as a steering wheel ornament the camaros insignia a present from pammy whod removed it reverently from the chevys corpse for sachs to mount on the ford pound on the brake for the intersection heeltoe downshift to rev match check left check right clutch out and rip up through the gears the speedometer hit fifty then kissed sixty seventy the blue light on the dashboard which she hardly even saw flashed as fast as a pounding heart sachs was presently on the west side highway venerable route a having made the transition from the henry hudson several miles behind her heading south she streaked past familiar sights the helipad hudson river park the yacht docks and the tangled entrance to the holland tunnel then with the financial center buildings on her right she hurried on past the massive construction site where the towers had been aware even at this frantic time that if ever a void could cast a shadow it was here a controlled skid angled the cobra onto battery place and sachs flew east into the warren of lower manhattan she had the tip of the ear bud inserted and a crackling sound interrupted her concentration as she deftly skidded around two cabs noting the shocked expression below the sikhs turban sachs what rhyme where are you almost there she lost rubber on all four tires as she made a ninetydegree turn and inserted the ford between curb and car one needle never below the other never below she was making for whitehall street near stone rhyme had had a conversation with charlie sommers and it had yielded unexpected results the special projects man had speculated that galt might try something other than an arc flash sommers was betting the man would simply try to electrify a public area with enough voltage to kill passersby hed turn them into part of the circuit and run juice through them somehow it was easier and more efficient the man had explained and you didnt need nearly as much voltage rhyme had concluded that the fire in the uptown substation was really a distraction to keep them focused away from galts attack on the real location probably downtown hed looked over the list of lava and volcano exhibits and found the one that was the farthest away from harlem where everybody was looking amsterdam college it was a community college specializing in office skills and associate degrees in the business professions but their liberal arts division was having a show on geologic formations including an exhibit about volcanoes im here rhyme sachs skidded the torino to a stop in front of the school leaving twin tails of black on the gray asphalt she was out of the car before the tire smoke from the wheel wells had dissipated the smell ominously reminded her of algonquin substation mh and though she tried to avoid it a repeat image of the blackandred dots in the body of luis martin as she jogged toward the schools entrance she was for once thankful that a jolt of arthritic pain shot through her knees partially taking her attention off the harsh memories im looking the place over rhyme its big bigger than i expected sachs wasnt searching a scene so shed foregone the video uplink youve got eighteen minutes until the deadline she scanned the sixstory community college from which students professors and staff were leaving quickly uneasiness on their faces tucker mcdaniel and lon sellitto had decided to evacuate the place they hurried outside clutching purses and computers and books and moved away from the building almost everyone looked up at one point in their exodus always in a post world looking up another car arrived and a woman in a dark suit climbed out it was a fellow detective nancy simpson she jogged up to sachs what do we have amelia galts rigged something in the school we think we dont know what yet im going inside and looking around could you interview thema nod at the evacueesand see if anybody spotted galt you have his picture on my pda sachs nodded and turned to the front of the school once more uncertain how to proceed recalling what sommers had said she knew where a bomb might be set where a sniper would position himself but the threat from electricity could come from anywhere she asked rhyme what exactly did charlie say galt might rig the most efficient way would be to use the victim like a switch hed wire door handles or stair railings with the hot source and then the floor with the return or the floor might just be a natural ground if it was wet the circuits open until the vic touches the handle or railing then the current flows through them it wouldnt take much voltage at all to kill somebody the other way is to just have somebody touch a live source with two hands that could send enough voltage through your chest to kill you but its not as efficient efficient sick word to use under the circumstances sirens chirped and barked behind her fire nypd emergency service unit and medical personnel had begun to arrive she waved a greeting to bo haumann the head of esu a lean grizzled former drill sergeant he nodded back and began deploying his officers to help get the evacuees to safety and to form into tactical response teams searching for raymond galt and any accomplices hesitating then pushing on the glass portion of the door rather than the metal handle she walked into the lobby of the school against the crowd she wanted to call out to everyone not to touch any metal but was afraid if she did that shed start a panic and people would be injured or killed in a crush besides they still had fifteen minutes until the deadline inside there were plenty of metal railings knobs stairs and panels on the floor but no visual clues about whether or not they were connected to a wire somewhere i dont know rhyme she said uncertainly theres metal sure but most of the floors carpeted or covered with linoleum thats gotta be a bad conductor was he just going to start a fire and burn the place down thirteen minutes keep looking sachs she tried charlie sommerss noncontact current detector and it gave occasional indications of voltage but nothing higher than house current and the source wasnt in the places that would be the most likely to kill or injure anyone through the window a flashing yellow light caught her eye it was an algonquin consolidated truck with a sign on the side reading emergency maintenance she recognized two of the four occupants bernie wahl the security chief and bob cavanaugh the operations vp they ran up to a cluster of officers including nancy simpson it was as she was looking through the plate glass at the three of them that sachs noticed for the first time what was next door to the school a construction site for a large highrise the crews were doing the ironwork bolting and welding the girders into place she looked back to the lobby but felt a slam in her gut she spun back to gaze at the job site metal the entire structure was pure metal rhyme she said softly i dont think its the school at all what do you mean she explained steel sure sachs it makes sense try to get the workers down ill call lon and have him coordinate with esu she pushed out the door and ran toward the trailer that was the general contractors office for the highrise construction she glanced up at the twenty twentyfive stories of metal that were about to become a live wire on which easily two hundred workers were perched and counted only two small elevators to carry them down to safety the time was ten minutes until one pm chapter whats going on sam vetter asked the waiter in the hotel dining room he and his fellow lunchers were staring out the window at what seemed to be an evacuation of both the school and the construction site between the college and the hotel police cars and fire trucks were pulling up its safe isnt it a patron asked here i mean oh yessir very safe the waiter assured vetter knew the man didnt have a clue what was safe and what wasnt and being in the construction business vetter immediately checked out the ratio of emergency exits to occupancy one of the businessmen at his table the man from santa fe asked you hear about that thing yesterday the explosion at the power station maybe its related to that they were talking terrorists vetter had heard a news story or two but only in passing what happened some guy doing something to the grid you know the electric company the man nodded out the window maybe he did the same thing at the school or the construction site but not us another patron worried not at the hotel no no not us the waiter smiled and vanished vetter wondered which exit route he was presently sprinting down people were rising and walking to the windows from here the restaurant offered a good view of the excitement vetter heard naw its not terrorists its some disgruntled worker like a lineman for the company they showed his picture on tv then sam vetter had a thought he asked one of his fellow businessmen you know what he looks like just hes in his forties and is maybe wearing company overalls and a yellow hard hat the overallsre blue oh my god i think i saw him just a little while ago what i saw a worker in blue overalls and a yellow hard hat he had a roll of electrical cable over his shoulder you better tell the cops vetter rose he started away then paused reaching into his pocket he was worried that his new friends might think he was trying to stiff them for the bill hed heard that new yorkers were very suspicious of people and he didnt want his first step into the world of bigcity business to be marred by something like that he peeled off a ten for his sandwich and beer then remembered where he was and left twenty sam dont worry about it hurry he tried to remember exactly where the man had climbed from the manhole and where hed stood to make his phone call before walking into the school if he could recall the time of the call more or less maybe the police could trace it the cell company could tell them who hed been talking to vetter hurried down the escalator two steps at a time and then ran into the lobby he spotted a police officer who was standing near the front desk officer excuse me but i just heard youre looking for somebody who works for the electric company that man who was behind that explosion yesterday thats right sir do you know anything about it i think i mightve seen him i dont know for sure maybe its not him but i thought i should say something hold on the man lifted his bulky radio and spoke into it this is portable seven eight seven three to command post i think ive got a witness mightve seen the suspect k roger clattering from the speaker hold on k all right seven eight send him outside stone street detective simpson wants to talk to him k roger seven eight out turning to vetter the cop said go out the front doors and turn left theres a detective there a woman nancy simpson you can ask for her hurrying through the lobby vetter thought maybe if the man is still around theyll capture him before he hurts anybody else my first trip to new york and i might just make the newspapers a hero what would ruth have said chapter amelia nancy simpson shouted from the sidewalk ive got a witness somebody in the hotel next door sachs hurried up to simpson who said hes coming out to see us sachs via the microphone relayed this information to rhyme where was galt seen the criminalist asked urgently i dont know yet were going to talk to the wit in a second together she and simpson hurried to the entrance of the hotel to meet the wit sachs looked skyward at the steel superstructure of the building under construction workers were leaving fast only a few minutes remained until the deadline then she heard officer a mans voice called from behind her detective she turned and saw algonquin vice president bob cavanaugh running toward her the large man was breathing heavily and sweating as he pulled up his expression said sorry i forgot your name amelia sachs bob cavanaugh she nodded i heard that youre clearing the construction site thats right we couldnt find anywhere hed attack in the school its mostly carpet and but a job site makes no sense cavanaugh said gesturing frantically toward it well i was thinking the girders the metal whos there sachs rhyme broke in the operations director of algonquin he doesnt think the attacks going to be at the job site she asked cavanaugh why not look he said desperately pointing to a cluster of workers standing nearby what do you mean their boots she whispered personal protective equipment theyd be insulated if you cant avoid it protect yourself against it some were wearing gloves too and thick jackets galt would know theyre in ppe the operations man said hed have to pump so much juice into the superstructure to hurt anybody that the gridd shut down in this part of town rhyme said well if its not the school and its not the job site then whats his target or did we get it wrong in the first place maybe its not there at all there was another volcano exhibit then cavanaugh gripped her arm and gestured behind them the hotel jesus sachs muttered staring at the place it was one of those minimalist chic places filled with stark stone marble fountains and metal lots of metal copper doors and steel stairs and flooring nancy simpson too turned to gaze at the building what rhyme asked urgently in her ear its the hotel rhyme thats what hes attacking she grabbed her radio to call esus chief she lifted it to her mouth as she and simpson sprinted forward bo its amelia hes going after the hotel im sure of it its not the construction site get your people there now evacuate it roger that amelia ill but sachs didnt hear the rest of his transmission or rather whatever he said was lost completely to her as she stared through the hotels massive windows though it was before the deadline one oclock a half dozen people inside the battery park hotel stopped in their tracks their animated faces instantly went blank they became doll faces they were caricatures grotesques spittle appeared in the corners of lips taut as ropes fingers feet chins began quivering onlookers gasped and then screamed in panic at the otherworldly sighthumans turned to creatures out of a sick horror film zombies two or three were caught with their hands on the push panels of revolving doors jerking and kicking in the confined spaces one mans rigid leg kicked through the door glass which severed his femoral artery blood sprayed and smoked another man young student age was gripping a large brass door to a function room and bent forward urinating and shivering there were two others their hands on the rails of the low steps to the lobby bar frozen shaking as the life evaporated from their bodies and even outside sachs could hear an unearthly moan from deep in the smoldering throat of a woman caught in midstep a heavyset man plunged forward to save a guestto push him away from the elevator panel the smoking victims hand was frozen to the good samaritan may have believed he could bodyslam the poor guy away from the panel but he hadnt reckoned on the speed and the power of juice the instant he contacted the victim he too became part of the circuit his face twisted into a mass of wrinkles from the pain then the expression melted into that of an eerie doll and he began the terrible quivering too blood ran from mouths as teeth cut into tongues and lips eyes rolled back into sockets a woman with her fingers around a door handle must have made particularly good contact her back arched at an impossible angle her unseeing eyes gazing at the ceiling her silver hair burst into flames sachs whispered rhyme oh its bad real bad ill have to call back she disconnected without waiting for a response sachs and simpson turned and began beckoning the ambulances forward sachs was horrified by the spectacle of arms and legs convulsing muscles frozen muscles quivering veins rising spittle and blood evaporating on faces from the blisteringly hot skin cavanaugh called weve got to stop them from trying to get out they cant touch anything sachs and simpson ran to the windows and gestured people back from the doors but everyone was panicked and continued to stream for the exits stopping only when they saw the terrible scene cut its head off she spun to cavanaugh crying how can we shut the current off here the operations vp looked around we dont know what hes rigged it to around here weve got subway lines transmission lines feeders ill call queens ill cut everything off in the area itll shut down the stock exchange but we dont have any choice he pulled out his phone but itll take a few minutes tell people in the hotel to stay put not to touch anything sachs ran close to a large sheet of plate glass and gestured people back frantically some understood and nodded but others were panicking sachs watched a young woman break free from her friends and race for the emergency exit door in front of which lay the smoking body of a man whod tried to exit a moment before sachs pounded on the window no she cried the woman looked at sachs but kept going arms outstretched no dont touch it the woman sobbing sped onward ten feet from the door five feet no other way the detective decided nancy the windows take em out sachs drew her glock checked the backdrop and firing high used six bullets to take out three of the massive windows in the lobby the woman screamed at the gunshots and dove to the ground just before she grabbed the deadly handle nancy simpson blew out the windows on the other side of the doors both detectives leapt inside they ordered people not to touch anything metal and began organizing the exodus through the jagged window frames as smoke unbelievably vile filled the lobby chapter bob cavanaugh called powers off sachs nodded and directed emergency workers to the victims then scanned the crowds outside looking for galt detective amelia sachs turned a man in an algonquin consolidated uniform was running in her direction seeing the dark blue outfit worn by a white male she thought immediately that it might be galt the witness in the hotel had apparently reported that the suspect was nearby and the police had only a bad dmv picture of the attacker to identify him but as the man approached it was clear that he was much younger than galt detective he said breathlessly that officer there said i should talk to you theres something i thought you should know his face screwed up as he caught a whiff of the smoke from inside the hotel go on im with the power company algonquin look my partner hes in one of our tunnels underneath us nodding toward amsterdam college ive been trying to reach him but hes not responding only the radiosre working fine underground where the electric service was i was thinking this raymond galt guy maybe he was down there and joey ran into him you know im worried about him sachs called two patrolmen to join her they and the algonquin worker hurried to the school we have an easement through the basement its the best way to get down to the tunnel so thats how galt had picked up the volcanic ash trace slipping through the exhibit hall of the college sachs called rhyme and explained what had happened then added im going tactical rhyme he might be in the tunnel ill call you when i know something you found anything else in the evidence that might help nothing more sachs im going in now she disconnected before he responded and she and the officers followed the worker to the door that led to the basement the electricity was off in the building but emergency lights glowed like red and white eyes the worker started for the door no sachs said you wait here okay you go down two flights and youll see a red door itll say algonquin consolidated on it thatll lead to stairs going down to the service tunnel heres the key he handed it to her whats your partners name joey joey barzan and where was he supposed to be at the bottom of the access stairs turn left he was working about a hundred feet hundred and fifty away itd sort of be under where the hotel is whats visibility down there even with the juice off therell be some work lights on battery power battery great but its really dark we always use flashlights are there live lines there yeah its a transmission tunnel the feeders here are off now but othersre live are they exposed he gave a surprised blink theyve got a hundred and thirty thousand volts no theyre not exposed unless galt had exposed them sachs hesitated then swept the voltage detector over the door handle drawing a glance of curiosity from the algonquin worker she didnt explain about the invention but merely gestured everybody back and flung the door open hand on her weapons grip empty sachs and the two officers started down the murky stairwellher claustrophobia kicked in immediately but at least here the disgusting smell of burned rubber and skin and hair was less revolting sachs was in the lead the two patrolmen behind she was gripping the key firmly but when they got to the red door giving access to the tunnel she found it was partially open they all exchanged glances she drew her weapon they did the same and she gestured the patrolmen to move forward slowly behind her then eased the door open silently with her shoulder in the doorway she paused looked down shit the stairs leading to the tunnelabout two stories it seemedwere metal unpainted her heart tripping again if you can avoid it if you cant do that protect yourself against it if you cant do that cut its head off but none of charlie sommerss magic rules applied here she was now sweating furiously she remembered that wet skin was a far better conductor than dry and hadnt sommers said something about salty sweat making it even worse you see something detective a whisper you want me to go the second officer asked she didnt respond to the questions but whispered back dont touch anything metal sure why not a hundred thousand volts thats why oh sure she plunged down the stairs half expecting to hear a horrific crack and see her vision fill with a blinding burst of spark down the first flight of stairs then down the second one the estimate was wrong the journey was down three very steep flights as they approached the bottom they heard rumbling and hums loud it was also twenty degrees hotter down here than outside and the temperature was rising with every step of the descent another level of hell the tunnel was bigger than she expected about six feet across and seven high but much dimmer many of the emergency lighting bulbs were missing to the right she could just make out the end of the tunnel about fifty feet away there were no doors galt could have escaped through no places to hide to the left though where joey barzan was supposed to be the corridor disappeared in what seemed to be a series of bends sachs motioned the other two to stay behind her as they moved to the first jog in the tunnel there they stopped she didnt believe galt was still herehe would get as far away as he couldbut she was worried about traps still it was a belief not a certainty that hed fled so when she looked around the bend she was crouching and had her glock ready though not preceding her where galt might knock it aside or grab it nothing she looked down at the water covering the concrete floor water naturally plenty of conductive water she glanced at the wall of the tunnel on which were mounted thick black cables danger high voltage call algonquin consolidated power before working she remembered the algonquin workers comment a moment ago about the voltage clear she whispered and motioned the officers along behind her hurrying she certainly was concerned about the algonquin worker joey barzan but more important she hoped to find some clues as to where galt mightve gone but could they these tunnels would go on for miles she guessed they would have been a perfect route by which to escape the floors were dirt and concrete but no footprints were obvious the walls were sooty she could collect trace evidence for days and not come up with a single thing that might yield a clue as to where hed gone maybe a scraping sound she froze where had it come from were there side passages where he might be hiding one of the officers held up a hand he pointed at his own eyes and then forward she nodded though she thought the military signal wasnt really necessary here but whatever makes you comfortable in situations like this though not much was making sachs comfortable at the moment again the bullets of molten metal zinged hissing through her minds eye still she couldnt pull back another deep breath another look again the stretch of tunnel ahead of them was empty it was also dimmer than the other and she saw why most of the lightbulbs were missing here too but these had been broken out a trap she sensed they had to be directly beneath the hotel she figured when they came to a ninetydegree turn to the right again she took a fast look but this time it was hard to see anything at all because of the greater darkness here then she heard noises again one patrolman eased close a voice she nodded keep low she whispered they eased around the corner and made their way up the tunnel crouching then she shivered it wasnt a voice it was a moan a desperate moan human flashlight she whispered as a detective she wore no utility belt just weapons and cuffs and she felt the painful blow as the officer behind her shoved the light into her side sorry he muttered get down she told the patrolmen softly prone be prepared to fire but only on my command unless he takes me out first they eased to the filthy floor guns pointed down the tunnel she aimed in that direction too holding the flashlight out to her side at arms length so she wouldnt present a vitalzone target she clicked it on the blinding beam filling the grim corridor no gunshots no arc flashes but galt had claimed another victim about thirty feet away an algonquin worker lay on his side duct tape over his mouth hands tied behind him he was bleeding from the temple and behind his ear lets go the other officers rose and the three of them hurried down the tunnel to the man she supposed was joey barzan in the beam she could see it wasnt galt the worker was badly injured and bleeding heavily as one of the patrolmen hurried toward him to stop the hemorrhaging barzan began to shake his head frantically and wail beneath the tape at first sachs assumed he was dying and that death tremors were shaking his body but as she got closer to him she looked at his wide eyes and glanced down following their path he was lying not on the bare floor but on a thick piece of what looked like teflon or plastic stop she shouted to the officer reaching forward to help the man its a trap the patrolman froze she remembered what sommers had told her about wounds and blood making the body much less resistant to electricity then without touching the worker she walked around behind him his hands were bound yes but not with tape or ropewith bare copper wire which had been spliced into one of the lines on the wall she grabbed sommerss voltage detector and aimed it at the wire wrapped around barzans flesh the meter jumped off the scale at v had the patrolman touched him the juice would have streaked through him through the officer and into the ground killing them instantly sachs stepped back and turned up the volume on her radio to call nancy simpson and have her find bob cavanaugh and tell the operations director he needed to cut the head off another snake chapter ron pulaski had managed to nurse ray galts damaged computer printer back to life and he was grabbing the hot sheets of paper as they eased into the output tray the young officer pored over them desperately searching for clues as to the mans whereabouts accomplices the location of justice for anything that might move them closer to stopping the attacks detective cooper sent him a text explaining that they hadnt successfully stopped galt at a hotel downtown they were still searching for the killer in the wall street area did pulaski have anything that could help not yet soon i hope he sent the message turned back to the printouts of the eight remaining pages in the print queue nothing was immediately relevant to finding and stopping the killer but pulaski did learn something that might become helpful raymond galts motive some of the pages were printouts of postings that galt had made on blogs and online newsletters others were downloads of medical research some very detailed and written by doctors with good credentials some were written by quacks in the language and tone of conspiracy theorists one had been written by galt himself and posted on a blog about environmental causes of serious disease my story is typical of many i was a lineman and later a troubleman like a supervisor for many years working for several power companies in direct contact with lines carrying over one hundred thousand volts it was the electromagnetic fields created by the transmission lines that are uninsulated that led to my leukemia i am convinced in addition it has been proven that power lines attract aerosol particles that lead to lung cancer among others but this is something that the media doesnt talk about we need to make all the power companies but more important the public aware of these dangers because the companies wont do anything voluntarily why should they if the people stopped using electricity by even half we could save thousands of lives a year and make them the companies more responsible in turn they would create safer ways to deliver electricity and stop destroying the earth too people you need to take matters into your own hands raymond galt so that was it he was ill he felt because of companies like algonquin and he was fighting back in the time he had left pulaski knew the man was a killer yet he couldnt help but feel a bit of sympathy for him the officer had found liquor bottles most of them at least half empty in one of the cupboards sleeping pills too and antidepressants it was no excuse to kill anybody but dying alone of a terminal disease and the people responsible for your death not caring well pulaski could understand where the anger came from he continued through the printouts but found only more of the same rants and medical research not even emails whose addresses they might trace to see if they could find galts friends and clues to his whereabouts he looked through them once more thinking about assistant special agent in charge tucker mcdaniels weird theory about cloud zone communications looking for code words and secret messages that might be embedded in the text then he decided hed wasted enough time on that and bundled up the printouts he spent a few minutes bagging the rest of the evidence collecting the trace and attaching chainofcustody cards then he laid the numbers and photographed the entire site when he was finished pulaski looked up the dim hallway to the front door and felt the uneasiness return he started toward the door noting again that both the knob and the door itself were metal whats the problem he asked himself angrily you opened it to get inside an hour ago leaving on the latex exam gloves he tentatively reached out and pulled the door open then with relief he stepped outside two nypd cops and an fbi agent were nearby pulaski nodded a greeting you hear the agent asked pulaski paused in the doorway of the apartment then stepped farther away from the steel door about the attack yeah i heard he got away i dont know any details he killed five people wouldve been more but your partner saved a lot of them partner that woman detective amelia sachs bunch were injured badly burned pulaski shook his head thats tough that same way the arc flash i dont know he electrocuted them though thats all i heard jesus pulaski looked around the street hed never noticed how much metal there was on a typical residential block a creepy feeling was flooding over him the paranoia there were metal posts and bars and rods everywhere it seemed fire escapes vents pipes going into the ground those metal sheets covering undersidewalk elevators any one of them could be energized enough to send a charge right through you or to explode in a shower of metal shrapnel killed five people thirddegree burns you okay there officer pulaski gave a reflexive laugh yeah he wanted to explain his fear but of course he didnt any leads to galt no hes gone well i gotta get this back to lincoln rhyme find anything yeah galts definitely the one but i couldnt find anything about where he is now or what hes got planned next the fbi agent asked whos going to do surveillance he nodded at the apartment you want to leave some of your people here the implication being that the feds were perfectly happy to come along for the bust but since galt wasnt here and probably wouldnt returnhe mustve heard on the news that theyd identified himthey didnt want to bother leaving their people on guard detail thats not my call the young officer said he radioed lon sellitto and told him what hed found the lieutenant would arrange for two nypd officers to remain on site though hidden until an official undercover surveillance team could be put together just in case galt tried to sneak back pulaski then walked around the corner and into the deserted alleyway behind the building he popped the trunk and loaded the evidence inside he slammed it and looked around uneasily at all the metal surrounded by metal goddamn it stop thinking about that he got into the drivers seat and started to insert the key into the steering column then he hesitated the car had been parked here up the alley out of sight of the apartment in case galt did come back if the perp was still free was there a chance hed returned and rigged some kind of a trap on pulaskis car no too farfetched pulaski grimaced he started the car and put it in reverse his phone buzzed he glanced at the screen it was his wife jenny he debated no hed call her later he slipped the phone away glancing out the window he saw an electrical service panel on the side of a building three large wires running from it shivering at the sight pulaski gripped the key and turned it the starter gave that huge grinding sound when the engines already running in panic believing that he was being electrocuted the young cop grabbed the door handle and yanked it open his foot slipped off the brake and landed on the accelerator the crown victoria screeched backward tires skidding he slammed on the brake but not before there was a sickening thud and a scream and he caught a glimpse of a middleaged man whod been crossing the alley carting a load of groceries the pedestrian flew into the wall and collapsed on the cobblestones blood streaming from his head chapter amelia sachs was taking stock of joey barzan how you doing yeah i guess she wasnt sure what that meant and didnt think he knew either she glanced at the ems medic who was bent over barzan they were still in the tunnel beneath the battery park hotel concussion lost some blood he turned to his patient who was sitting unsteadily against the wall youll be all right bob cavanaugh had managed to find the source of the juice and shut down the line that galt had used for the trap sachs had confirmed that the electrical supply was dead using sommerss current detector and quicklyreally quicklyundone the wire attached to the feeder line what happened she asked barzan it was ray galt i found him down here he hit me with a hot stick knocked me out when i woke up hed wired me to the line jesus that was sixtythousand volts a subway feeder if youd touched me if id rolled a few inches to the side jesus then he blinked i heard the sirens on the street the smell what happened galt ran some wires into the hotel next door god no is anybody hurt there are casualties i dont know the details yet whered galt go i dont know i was out if he didnt leave through the college he had to go that way through the tunnel he cast his eyes to the side theres plenty of access to the subway tunnels and platforms sachs asked did he say anything not really where was he when you saw him right there he pointed about ten feet away you can see where he rigged the line theres some kind of box on it ive never seen that before and he was watching the construction site and the hotel on his computer like it was hooked into a security camera sachs rose and looked over the cable the same bennington brand as at the bus stop yesterday no sign of the computer or hot stick which she recalled sommers telling her abouta fiberglass pole for livewire work then barzan said in a soft voice the only reason im alive now is that he wanted to use me to kill people isnt that right he wanted to stop you from chasing him thats right that son of a bitch and hes one of us linemen and troublemen stick together its like a brotherhood you know we have to be juice is so dangerous he was furious at the betrayal sachs rolled the mans hands arms and legs for trace and then nodded to the medics he can go now she told barzan if he thought of anything else to give her a call and handed him a card a medic radioed his colleague and said that the scene was clear and that they could bring the stretcher down the tunnel to evacuate the worker barzan sat back against the tunnel wall and closed his eyes sachs then contacted nancy simpson and told her what had happened get esu into the algonquin tunnels for a half mile around and the subways too sure amelia hold on simpson came back on a moment later theyre on their way what about our witness from the hotel im still checking sachss eyes were growing more accustomed to the dark she squinted ill get back to you nancy i see something she moved through the tunnel in the direction that barzan indicated galt probably had fled about thirty feet away sandwiched behind a grating in a small recess she found a set of algonquin dark blue overalls hard hat and gear bag shed seen a flash of yellow from the safety hat of course galt would now know that everybody was looking for him so hed stripped off the outfit and hidden it here with the tool bag she called back simpson and asked her to contact bo haumann and esu and let them know that galt would be in different clothes then she donned latex gloves and reached forward to pull the evidence out from behind the metal but then she stopped fast now you have to remember that even if you think youre avoiding it you could still be in danger sommerss words resounded in her head she took the current detector and swept it over the tools the needle jumped volts gasping sachs closed her eyes and felt the strength drain from her legs she looked more carefully and saw a wire it ran from the grating underground to the conduit behind which the evidence was stashed shed have to touch the pipe to pull the items out the power was technically off in the tunnel but maybe this was a case of islanding or backfeed if she remembered what sommers had told her how much amperage does it take to kill you one tenth of one amp she returned to barzan who gazed at her blearily his bandaged head still resting against the tunnel wall i need some help i need to collect some evidence but theres still power in one of the lines what line up there six hundred volts hes wired it to some conduit six hundred its dc backfeed from the third rail supply on the subway look you can use my hot stick see it there he pointed and my gloves the best thing is to run another wire to a ground from the conduit you know how to do that no im in no shape to help you sorry thats okay tell me how to use the stick she pulled on barzans gloves over the latex ones and took the tool which ended with a clawlike attachment on the end covered in rubber it gave her some but not a lot of confidence stand on the rubber mat and pull whatever you saw out one by one youll be fine to be safe do it onehanded your right hand farthest from the heart which thudded furiously as she walked up to the recess lay the teflon sheets down and began slowly to collect the evidence pictured yet again young luis martins torn body the shivering creatures dying in the hotel lobby hated being distracted hated being up against an enemy she couldnt see holding her breaththough she didnt know whyshe pulled out the overalls and hard hat then the gear bag r galt was written in sloppy marker on the red canvas exhaling long finally she assembled and bagged the evidence a crime scene technician from queens had arrived with cs equipment suitcases in hand even though the scene was now vastly contaminated sachs dressed in the blue tyvek jumpsuit and continued to run the scene like any other she laid out the numbers took pictures and walked the grid using sommerss detector she doublechecked the lines and then quickly unbolted the bennington cable and a square black plastic box that connected it to the main feeder line galts wire ran to the steel girder of the hotel which would carry the juice to energize the metal fixtures of the door handles revolving doors and stair rails she bagged everything shed found then took samples from where galt had stood to mount the cable and where hed attacked joey barzan she looked again for the hot stick galt had hit his fellow worker with but couldnt find it nor was there any sign of where hed cut into any video feeds to use the schools or construction sites security cameras to look over the site of the attack as barzan had told her after shed finished bagging the evidence she called rhyme and gave him an update get back here as soon as you can sachs we need that evidence whatd ron find according to lon nothing spectacular hm wonder whats going on he should be here by now his impatience was obvious itll just be a few minutes i want to find that witness somebody having lunch apparently got a good look at galt im hoping he can tell us something specific they disconnected and sachs returned to the surface and found nancy simpson the detective was in the hotel lobby which was now largely empty sachs started for one of the revolving doors not sealed off with police tape but stopped she turned and climbed through the shattered window simpsons hollow face revealed that she was still shaken just talked to bo no idea where galt got out of the system with the power off he mightve just walked down the subway tracks to canal street got lost in chinatown nobody knows sachs looked at where blood and scorch marks stained the marble floors outlining where the victims had been final count five dead looks like eleven injured all seriously burns are mostly third degree you canvass yep but nobody saw anything most of the guests who were here just vanished they werent even checking out simpson added that they had fled with spouses children associates and suitcases in tow the hotel staff had done nothing to stop them half the employees had left too it seemed what about our witness im trying to track him down i found some people he was having lunch with they said he saw galt thats why id really love to find him who is he his names sam vetter was here from scottsdale on business his first trip to the city a patrolman walked past excuse me i heard you mention the name vetter right sam vetter he came up to me in the lobby said he had some information about galt where is he oh you didnt know the officer said he was one of the victims was in the revolving door hes dead chapter amelia sachs returned with the evidence rhymes eyes narrowed as she walked quickly into the townhouse in her wake was a repulsive odor burned hair burned rubber burned flesh some crips believed they had an increased sense of smell because of their disability rhyme wasnt sure if this was true but in any case he had no problem detecting the stench he looked over the evidence sachs and a crime scene tech from queens had carted in the hungry itch to tackle the mysteries the clues might reveal filled him as sachs and cooper laid it out rhyme asked esu find where galt got out of the tunnel no sign of him none at all she looked around wheres ron rhyme said that the rookie still wasnt back i called left a message i havent heard from him the last he said hed found galts motive but didnt go into it what sachs hed caught her gazing out the window her face still i got it wrong rhyme i wasted time evacuating the construction site and missed the real target completely she explained that it had been bob cavanaugh who figured out that the target was the hotel she was sighing if id thought it out better i mightve saved them she walked to a whiteboard and with a firm hand wrote battery park hotel at the top and just below that the names of the deceased victims apparently a husband and wife a businessman from scottsdale arizona a waiter and an advertising executive from germany it couldve been a lot more i heard you took out the windows and got people out that way her response was a shrug rhyme felt that what if had no part in the policing business you did the best you could you played the odds though he too was feeling what sachs was angry that despite their race against the clock and their correct deduction about the general locale where the attack would be not only had they failed to save victims but theyd missed their chance to collar galt but he wasnt as upset as she was however many people were at fault and whatever their degree of blame sachs was always hardest on herself he could have told her that undoubtedly more people would have died if she hadnt been there and that galt now knew that hed been identified and nearly outthought he might very well stop the attacks altogether and give up but saying this to her would smack of condescension and had it been directed at rhyme himself he wouldnt even have listened besides the stark truth was yes the perp got away because theyd got it wrong sachs returned to assembling the evidence on the examining table her face was paler than normal she was a minimalist when it came to makeup and rhyme could see that this crime scene too had affected her the bus incident had spooked herand some of that was still in her eyes a patina of ill ease but this was a different horror the residue of the image of the people in the hotel dying in such terrible ways they were it was like they were dancing while they died rhyme shed described it to him shed collected galts algonquin overalls and hard hat the gear bag containing tools and supplies another of the heavyduty cables identical to the one galt had used for the arc flash yesterday morning there were also several bags of trace another item too in a thick plastic bag connecting the cable to the main line involved something different from what galt had used at the algonquin substation on fiftyseventh street she explained hed used split bolts but between the two wires was a plastic box about the size of a hardcover book cooper scanned it for explosives and then opened it up looks homemade but i have no idea what it is sachs said lets talk to charlie sommers in five minutes they were on a conference call with the inventor from algonquin sachs described the attack at the hotel i didnt know it was that bad he said in a soft voice rhyme said appreciate your advice earlierhow hed be rigging the current like he did instead of the arc didnt help much though the man muttered can you look over this box we recovered sachs asked it was connecting the algonquin line to the one he ran to the hotel of course cooper gave sommers a url for a secure streaming video and then turned the highdef camera over the guts of the box got it let me take a look go back to the other side interesting not commercial made by hand thats what it looks like to us rhyme said ive never seen anything like it not this compact its switchgear thats our term for the switches in substations and on transmission systems just shuts a circuit on and off yep like a wall switch except id say it could handle a hundred thousand volts easy a builtin fan a solenoid and a receiver remote control so he hooked the wires together without transferring any current then when he was safely away he hit the switch andi jessen said he might try something like that did she hm interesting then sommers added but i dont think the issue is safety any troubleman knows how to splice wires safely he did this for another reason rhyme understood to time the attackhed turn on the juice the moment when most victims were exposed i think thats it yes sachs added one of the workers who saw him said he was watching the scene on his laptopit was probably hooked into a nearby security camera i couldnt find where he cut in though maybe thats why he hit the switch a few minutes early rhyme said he had the chance to get the most victims and he knew algonquin wasnt going to give in to his demand at that point anyway sommers sounded impressed when he said hes talented thats a clever piece of work the switch seems simple but it was a lot harder to make than youd think theres a lot of electromagnetic power in voltage lines that big and hed have to shield the electronics hes smart which i guess is bad news where could he get the parts the solenoid the receiver the fan in any one of a hundred electrical supply stores in the area two hundred any serial numbers cooper examined them carefully no model numbers thats all then youre out of luck rhyme and sachs thanked sommers and they hung up sachs and cooper examined galts gear kit and the algonquin overalls and hard hat no notes or maps nothing to indicate where he might be hiding out or what his next target might be that didnt surprise them since galt had intentionally ditched the items and would know theyd been discovered detective gretchen sahloff from crime scene hq had collected samplars of galts fingerprints from his office and a thumbprint on file from algonquin human resources cooper now examined all of the items collected against these prints he found only galts on the collected evidence rhyme was frustrated at this had they found others that could have led them to a friend of galts or an accomplice or someone in the justice for cell if it was involved in the attacks also rhyme noted that the hacksaw and bolt cutter werent in the bag but this didnt surprise him the kit was for smaller hand tools the wrench however was and it had tool marks that were identical to those on the bolts at the substation on fiftyseventh street the crime scene team from the arson incident at the substation in harlem arrived they had very little galt had used a simple molotov cocktaila glass bottle filled with gasoline and a cloth rag stuck into the top it had been thrown against the barred but open window and the burning gas had flowed inside igniting rubber and plastic insulation the bottle was for winethere were no threads for a screwtop capand was manufactured by a glassworks that sold to dozens of wineries which in turn sold to thousands of retail outlets the label had been soaked off untraceable the gasoline was bp regular grade and the cloth was from a tshirt none of these items could be traced to a specific location though a rattail file was found in galts gear bag with glass dust that could be associated with the bottlefrom scoring it so that it would be certain to break there was no security camera outside or in the substation a knock on the door sounded thom went to open it and a moment later ron pulaski entered with the evidence hed gathered at galts apartment several milk crates full of items the bolt cutter and the hacksaw along with a pair of boots well at last rhyme thought irritated at the delay though pleased at the arrival of the evidence unsmiling pulaski looked at no one as he stacked up the evidence on the table then rhyme noticed that his hand was shaking rookie you all right the young man his back to them all paused looking down hands on the table in front of him then he turned took a breath there was an accident at the scene i hit somebody with my car somebody innocent just happened to be there hes in a coma they think he might die chapter the young officer told them what had happened i just wasnt thinking or maybe i was thinking too much i got spooked i was worried galt mightve gotten to my car and rigged a trap or something how could he have done that rhyme asked i dont know pulaski said emotionally i didnt remember id already started the engine i turned the key again and the noise well it scared me i guess my foot slipped off the brake who was he just some guy palmers his name works nights at a trucking company he was taking a shortcut back from a grocery store i hit him pretty hard rhyme thought about the head injury that pulaski himself had suffered hed be troubled by the fact that his carelessness had now seriously injured someone else internal affairss going to talk to me they said the cityll probably be sued they told me to contact the pba about a lawyer i words failed him finally he repeated a bit manically my foot slipped off the brake i didnt even remember putting the car in gear or starting it well rookie blame yourself or not but the point is this palmers not a player in the galt case is he no so deal with it after hours rhyme said firmly yessir sure i will im sorry so whatd you find he explained about the sheets hed managed to tease out of galts printer rhyme complimented him on thatit was a good savebut the officer didnt even seem to hear pulaski continued explaining about galts cancer and the hightension wires revenge rhyme mused the old standby an okay motive not one of my favorites yours he glanced at sachs no she replied seriously greed and lustre mine revenges usually an antisocial personality disorder thing but this could be more than revenge rhyme from the demand note hes on a crusade saving the people from the evil energy company a fanatic and i still think we may find a terrorist connection apart from the motive though and the evidence tying galt to the crime scenes pulaski had found nothing that suggested his present whereabouts or where he might be going to attack next this was disappointing but didnt surprise rhyme the attacks were obviously well planned and galt was smart hed have known from the start that his identity might be learned and he would have made arrangements for a hideout rhyme scrolled through numbers and placed a call andi jessens office came the weary voice through the speakerphone rhyme identified himself and a moment later was talking to the ceo of the power company she said i just talked to gary noble and agent mcdaniel therere five people dead i heard and more in the hospital thats right im so sorry how awful ive been looking at ray galts employee file his pictures up in front of me right now he doesnt look like the kind of person whod do something like this they never do rhyme explained hes convinced he got cancer from working on the electric lines is that why hes doing this it seems hes crusading he thinks working on highpower lines is a big risk she sighed weve got a half dozen suits pending on the issue highvoltage cables give off emfselectromagnetic fields insulation and walls shield the electrical field but not the magnetic therere arguments that that can cause leukemia reading over the pages from galts printer now scanned and up on the monitor in front of him rhyme said he also talks about the lines attracting airborne particles that can cause lung cancer none of thats ever been proven i dispute it i dispute the leukemia thing too well galt doesnt what does he want us to do i guess we wont know that until we get another demand note or he contacts you some other way ill make a statement ask him to give himself up it couldnt hurt though rhyme was thinking that galt had come too far simply to make a point and surrender he had more retribution in mind they had to assume seventyfive feet of cable and a dozen split bolts so far hed used about thirty feet of the stolen wire as he disconnected rhyme noticed that pulaski was on the phone head down the officer looked up and met his bosss eyes he ended his call quicklyand guiltilyand walked over to the evidence table he started to reach for one of the tools hed collected and then froze realizing he didnt have latex gloves on he pulled on a pair cleaned the rubber fingers and palm with the doghair roller then he picked up the bolt cutter a comparison of the tool marks showed that both it and the hacksaw were the same tools used to create the trap at the bus stop and the boots were the same brand and size too but that just confirmed what they already knew raymond galt was the perp they took a look at the paper and the pens the young officer had collected from galts apartment they could determine no source but the paper and the ink in the bics were virtually the same as had been used in the demand note what they discovered next was much more disturbing cooper was studying the results from the gas chromatographmass spectrometer he said got some trace here found it in two separate locations the lace of the boots and the handle of the bolt cutter in galts apartment and then the sleeve of the worker whod been attacked by galt in the tunnel downtown joey barzan and rhyme asked its a kerosene derivative with minute amounts of phenol and dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid added rhyme said its standard jet a fuel the phenol is an antigumming substance and the acid is an antistatic agent but theres more cooper continued something odd a form of natural gas liquefied but stable across a wide range of temperatures and get this traces of biodiesel check the fuel database mel a moment later the tech said got it its an alternative aviation fuel thats being tested now mostly in military fighters its cleaner and it cuts down on fossilfuel use they say itll be the wave of the future alternative energy rhyme mused wondering how this piece of the puzzle fit but one thing he knew sachs call homeland security and the department of defense faa too tell them our boy may have been checking out fuel depos or air bases an arc flash was bad enough combined with jet propellant rhyme couldnt even imagine the devastation

vinblastine and prednisone in significant quantities traces of etoposide leukemia chapter lincoln rhymes main phone trilled the caller id registered a number hed been hoping to see though not at this particular moment still he immediately clicked answer kathryn what do you have no time for pleasantries at the moment but dance would understand she was the same way when it came to a case the dea guys in mexico city got the worker to talkthe man who gave the package to logan just after he slipped into the country he did take a look at what was inside like we thought im not sure its helpful but here it is a dark blue booklet with lettering on it he didnt remember the words two letter cs he thought a logo of a company maybe then a sheet of paper that had a capital letter i followed by five or six lines like blanks to be filled in he have any idea what they were no then a slip of paper containing some numbers all he remembers is five hundred seventy and three hundred seventynine the da vinci code rhyme said discouraged exactly i like puzzles but not on the job true i fill in the blanks and five hundred seventy and three hundred seventynine dance added then he found something else a circuit board a small one for a computer he didnt know he was disappointed he said he would have stolen it if itd been something he could sell more easily and hed be dead now if he had i think hes relieved to be in jail for that very reason ive had a talk with rodolfo hed like you to call of course rhyme thanked dance and disconnected he then called the commander rodolfo luna in mexico city ah captain ret rhyme yes i just spoke to agent dance the mystery the numbers an address perhaps it is but his fading voice meant of course that in a city of million people one would need more than a few numbers to find a specific location and maybe related maybe not two separate meanings yes rhyme said do they have any significance at all regarding the places hes been spotted no and those buildings the tenants arturo diaz and his officers are speaking with them now explaining the situation the ones there who are legitimate businesspeople are mystified because they cannot believe they are in danger the ones who are themselves criminals are mystified because they are better armed than my troops and believe no one would dare attack them five hundred seventy and three hundred seventynine phone numbers coordinates parts of an address luna continued weve reconstructed the route the truck took from the airport to the capital they were pulled over once but you may have heard about our traffic police a fine was paid immediately and no questions were asked arturo tells me those officerswho are by the way now looking for new jobsidentified your mr watchmaker there was no one else in the truck other than the driver and of course they didnt bother to look over his license and there was in the back no equipment or contraband that would lead us in one direction or another so we are left to focus on the buildings he seems to be focusing on and hope that he isnt sneaking up behind his real victim five miles away very much what i was going to say do you have any thoughts about the circuit board that logan was given im a soldier detective rhyme not a hacker and so naturally i thought it was not a piece of computer hardware but a remote detonator for explosives the booklet was perhaps an instruction manual yes i was thinking that too he would not want to travel with such a device it would make sense to acquire it here and i understand from our news that you have your hands full there some terrorist group we dont know i wish i could help you appreciated but keep your attention focused on the watchmaker commander good advice luna gave a sound between a growl and a laugh cases are so much easier to run when you start with a corpse or two i hate it when the bodies are still alive and being elusive rhyme smiled at that and couldnt disagree chapter at pm algonquin security chief bernard wahl was walking along the sidewalk in queens coming back from his investigation thats how he liked to think of it his investigation about his company the numberone energy provider in the east maybe in the entire north american grid he wanted to help especially now since the horrific attack this afternoon at the battery park hotel ever since hed heard that woman detective sachs mention to ms jessen about the greek food hed been devising a strategy microinvestigation was how he thought of what he was doing wahl had read about it somewhere or maybe seen it on the discovery channel it was all about looking at the small clues the small connections forget geopolitics and terrorists get a single fingerprint or hair and run with it until you collared the perp or it turned out to be a dead end and you went in a different direction so hed been on a mission of his ownchecking out the nearby greek restaurants in astoria queens hed learned galt enjoyed that cuisine and just a half hour ago hed hit pay dirt a waitress sonja more than cute earned a twentydollar tip by reporting that twice in the past week a man wearing dark slacks and a knit algonquin consolidated shirtthe sort worn by middle managershad been in for lunch the restaurant was lenis known for its moussaka and grilled octopus and more significant homemade taramasalata bowls of which were brought to everyone who sat down lunch and dinner along with wedges of pita bread and lemon sonja couldnt swear to it but when shown a picture of raymond galt she said yeah yeah that looks like him and the man had been online the entire timeon a sony vaio computer while hed only picked at the rest of his food hed eaten all his taramasalata shed noted online the whole time which meant to wahl that there might be some way to trace what galt had searched for or who hed emailed wahl watched all those crime shows on tv and did some continuing education in security on his own dime maybe the police could get the identification number of galts computer and find out where he was hiding sonja had reported the killer had also made a lot of cell phone calls that was interesting galt was a loner he was attacking people because he was pissed off about getting cancer from hightension wires so who was he calling a partner why that was something they could find out too hurrying back to the office now wahl considered how best to handle this of course hed have to get word back to the police as fast as he could his heart was slamming at the thought of being instrumental in catching the killer maybe detective sachs would be impressed enough to get him a job interview with the nypd but hold on dont be cagey here he cautioned himself just do whats best and deal with the future in the future call everybodydetective sachs lincoln rhyme and the others fbi agent mcdaniel and that police lieutenant lon sellitto and of course tell ms jessen he walked quickly tense and exhilarated seeing ahead of him the red and gray smokestacks of algonquin consolidated and in front of the building those damn protesters he enjoyed a brief image of turning a water cannon on them or even more fun a taser the company that made them also had a sort of a shotgun taser which would fire a number of barbs into a crowd for riot control he was smiling at the thought of them dancing around on the ground when the man got him from behind wahl gasped and barked a cry a muzzle of a gun appeared against his right cheek dont turn around was the whisper the gun now pressed against his back the voice told him to walk into an alley between a closed car repair shop and a darkened warehouse a harsh whisper just do what i say bernie and you wont get hurt you know me its ray came the whisper ray galt wahls heart thudded hard he wondered if hed be sick oh man look whatre you shhh keep going they continued into the alley for another fifty feet or so and turned a corner into a dim recess lie down facefirst arms out at your sides wahl hesitated thinking for some ridiculous reason about the suit hed proudly put on that morning an expensive one always look better than your job title his father had told him the nudged his back he dropped like a stone into the greasy dirt i dont go to lenis anymore bernie you think im stupid which told him that galt had been tailing him for a while and i hadnt even noticed oh some fucking cop id be jesus and i dont use their broadband i use a prepaid cell connection you killed those people ray you theyre not dead because of me theyre dead because algonquin and andi jessen killed them why didnt she listen to me why didnt she do what i asked they wanted to man there just wasnt enough time to shut the grid down bullshit ray listen turn yourself in this is crazy what youre doing a bitter laugh crazy you think im crazy i didnt mean that ill tell you whats crazy bernie companies that burn gas and oil and fuck up the planet and that pump juice through wires that kills our children just because we like fucking blenders and hair dryers and tvs and microwaves dont you think thats whats crazy no youre right ray youre right im sorry i didnt know all the shit youd been through i feel bad for you do you mean it bernie do you really mean it or are you just trying to save your ass a pause little bit of both ray to bernard wahls surprise the killer gave a laugh thats an honest answer maybe one of the only honest answers thats ever come out of somebody who works for algonquin look ray im just doing my job which was a cowardly thing to say and he hated himself for saying it but he was thinking of his wife and three children and his mother who lived in their home on long island i dont have anything against you personally bernie and with that wahl suspected that he was a dead man he struggled not to cry in a shaky voice he asked what do you want i need you to tell me something the security code for andi jessens townhouse what garage she parked her car in wahl didnt know either of those but the killers request was something very different i need to know whos looking for me wahls voice cracked whos well the policere the fbi homeland security i mean everybody theres hundreds of them tell me something i dont know bernie im talking about names and at algonquin too i know employeesre helping them wahl was going to cry i dont know ray of course you know i need names give me names i cant do that ray they almost figured out about the attack at the hotel how did they know that they almost got me there whos behind this i dont know they dont talk to me ray im a security guard youre chief of security bernie of course they talk to you no i really he felt his wallet coming out of his pocket oh not that a moment later galt recited wahls home address tucked the wallet back whats the service in your house bernie two hundred amps oh come on ray my family never did anything to you i never did anything to anybody and i got sick youre part of the system that made me sick and your family benefited from that system two hundred amps not enough for an arc but the shower the bathtub the kitchen i could just play with the ground fault interrupts and your whole housed become one big electric chair bernie now talk to me chapter fred dellray was walking down a street in the east village past a row of gardenias past a gourmet coffee shop past a clothing store my my was that for a shirt without a suit tie and pair of shoes attached he continued past storefronts in which sat complicated espresso machines and overpriced art and the sorts of glittery shoes that a girl would lose at am en route from one hazy downtown club to another thinking how the village had changed in the years since hed started being an agent change used to be a carnival used to be crazy used to be gaudy and loud laughter and madness lovers entwined or shrieking or floating sullenly down the busy sidewalks all the time all the time twentyfour hours now this portion of the east village had the formula and sound track of a homogenized sitcom man had this place changed and it wasnt just the money not just the preoccupied eyes of the professionals who lived here now cardboard coffee cups replacing chipped porcelain no that wasnt what dellray kept seeing what he saw was everybody on fucking cell phones talking texting and jesus our savior in heaven here were two tourists right in front of him using gps to find a restaurant in the east fucking village cloud zone everywhere more evidence that the world even this worlddellrays worldwas now tucker mcdaniels back in the day dellray would play dressup here looking homeless pimp dealer he was good at pimp loved the colored shirts purple and green not because he worked vice which wasnt a federal crime but because he knew how to fit the chameleon he fit in places like this and that meant people talked to him but now hell there were more people on phones than there werent and every one of those phonesdepending on the inclination of the federal magistratecould be tapped into and give up information that it would have taken dellray days to get and even if they werent tapped there apparently were still ways to get that information or some of it out of the air out of clouds but maybe he was just overly sensitive he told himself using a word that had rarely figured in the psyche of fred dellray ahead of him he saw carmellasthe old establishment that may very well have been a whorehouse a long time ago and was presently an island of tradition here he walked inside and sat down at a rickety table he ordered a regular coffee noting that yes espresso and cappuccino and latte were on the menu but of course they always had been long before starbucks god bless carmella and around him of the ten people herehe countedonly two were on cell phones this was the world of mama behind the cash register her prettyboy sons waiting tables and even now midafternoon customers twirling pasta glistening orange not supermarket red and sipping from small hemispheres of wineglasses the whole place filled with animated talk punctuating gestures this filled him with comfort he believed that he was doing this the right way he believed in william brents reassurance he was about to receive some value something for the dubious one hundred thousand dollars only a tenuous lead but it would be enough that was something else about street dellray hed been able to weave cloth from the tiny treads his cis delivered usually they themselves oblivious to the value of what theyd found a single hard fact that would lead to galt or to the site of the next attack or to the elusive justice for and he was well aware that fact that find that save theyd vindicate him too dellray the oldschool street agent far far from the cloud zone dellray sipped the coffee and snuck a glance at his watch exactly pm hed had never known william brent to be late even by sixty seconds not efficient the ci had said of being either early or tardy fortyfive minutes later without as much as a phone call from brent a grimfaced fred dellray checked his messages once more on the cold phone nothing he tried brents for the sixth time still straight to the robotic voice telling him to leave a message dellray gave it ten minutes longer tried once more then called in a big favor from a buddy of his at one of the mobile providers and learned that the battery had been removed from brents phone the only reason to do that was to prevent tracing of course a young couple approached and asked if dellray was using the other chair at his table the responsive glance must have been pretty intimidating because they retreated instantly and the boyfriend didnt even try for a moment of chivalric bravado brents gone ive been robbed and hes gone replaying the mans confidence his reassurance guarantee my ass one hundred thousand dollars he should have known that something was going on when brent had insisted on that huge sum considering the shabby suit and threadbare argyle socks dellray wondered whether the man had decided to settle in the caribbean or south america on his windfall chapter weve had another demand grim andi jessen was staring out of rhymes flatscreen monitor on a video conference call her blond hair stiff oversprayed or perhaps shed spent the night in the office and hadnt showered that morning another one rhyme glanced at lon sellitto cooper and sachs all frozen in various places and attitudes around the lab the big detective tossed down half the muffin that hed snagged from a plate thom had brought in we just had an attack and hes hitting us again he wasnt happy we ignored him i suppose jessen said brittlely what does he want sachs asked at the same time as rhyme said id like the note here asap jessen answered rhyme first i gave it to agent mcdaniel its on its way to you now whats the deadline six pm today yes jesus sellitto muttered two hours and the demand sachs repeated he wants us to stop all the dcthe direct currenttransmission to the other north american grids for an hour starting at six if we dont hell kill more people rhyme asked what does that mean our grid is the northeastern interconnection and algonquins the big energy producer in it if a power company in another grid needs supply we sell it to them if theyre more than five hundred miles away we use dc transmission not ac its more cost effective usually it goes to smaller companies in rural areas whats the you know significance of the demand sellitto asked i dont know why hes asking it doesnt make any sense to me maybe his point is reducing cancer risk to people near the transmission lines but id guess fewer than a thousand people in north america live near dc lines rhyme said galt isnt necessarily behaving rationally true can you do it meet his demand no we cant its impossible its just like before with the grid in new york city except worse it would cut out service to thousands of small towns around the country and there are direct feeds into military bases and research facilities homeland securitys saying to shut it down would be a national security risk the defense department concurs rhyme added and presumably youd be losing millions of dollars a pause yes we would wed be in breach of hundreds of contracts it would be a disaster for the company but anyway the argument about complying is moot we physically couldnt do this in the time hes given us you dont just flip a wall switch with seven hundred thousand volts all right rhyme said how did you get the note galt gave it to one of our employees rhyme and sachs exchanged glances jessen continued explaining that galt accosted security chief bernard wahl as the man was returning from lunch is wahl there with you sachs asked hold on a minute jessen said he was being debriefed by the fbi let me see sellitto whispered they didnt fucking bother to even tell us they were talking to him the feebies it had to come from her a moment later solidshouldered bernard wahl appeared on the screen and sat down next to andi jessen his round black scalp glistened hello sachs said the handsome face nodded are you all right yes detective he wasnt all right though rhyme could see his eyes were hollow they were avoiding the webcam tell us what happened i was coming back from lunch and galt came up behind me with a gun and took me to an alleyway then he shoved the letter into my pocket and said get it to ms jessen right away then he was gone thats all a hesitation pretty much yes maam did he say anything that might lead us to where hes hiding out or where the next target might be no mostly he just rambled about electricity causing cancer and being dangerous and how nobody cares rhyme was curious about something mr wahl did you see the weapon or was he bluffing another hesitation then the security man said i caught a look a fortyfive nineteeneleven the old army model did he grab you we could get some trace evidence off your clothes no only his gun whered this happen somewhere in an alley near b and r auto repair i dont really remember sir i was pretty shaken up sachs asked and that was it he didnt ask anything about the investigation no maam he didnt i think all he cared about was getting the letter to ms jessen right away he couldnt think of another way to do it except to stop an employee rhyme had no more questions for him he glanced to sellitto who shook his head they thanked him and wahl moved off camera jessen looked up nodding at somebody whod come into the doorway then back to the camera for the video conference gary noble and i are meeting with the mayor then im doing a press conference ill make that personal appeal to galt do you think thatll work no rhyme didnt think it would work but he said anything you can doeven if it just buys us some time after they disconnected the call sellitto asked what wasnt wahl telling us he got scared galt threatened him he probably gave up some information im not too worried he was out of the loop pretty much but whatever he spilled frankly we cant worry about that now at that moment the doorbell rang it was tucker mcdaniel and the kid rhyme was surprised the fbi agent would have known there was a pending press conference and yet here he was not leveraging his way onto the podium hed yielded to homeland security so he could bring evidence to rhyme in person the asacs stock rose slightly once more after being briefed about galt and his motive the agent asked pulaski and in his apartment you found no reference to justice for or rahman terrorist cells no nothing the agent looked disappointed but said still that doesnt contradict a symbiosis construct which is rhyme asked a traditional terror operation using a front man with mutually aligned goals they may not even like each other but they want the same thing in the end an important aspect is that the professional terror cell keeps themselves completely isolated from the primary negative actor and all communications is cloud rhyme asked the agents index dipping a bit now exactly they have to minimize any contact two different agendas they want societal destruction he wants revenge mcdaniel nodded at the profile on the whiteboard what parker kincaid was saying galt didnt use pronounsdidnt want to give away any clue that he was working with somebody else eco or politicalreligious could be either it was hard to picture alqaida or the taliban in league with an unstable employee bent on revenge because his company had given him cancer but an ecoterror group made some sense theyd need somebody to help them get into the system rhyme would find it more credible though if there was some evidence to support that supposition mcdaniel added that hed heard from the warrants people whod gotten the okay for t and c teams to go through galts email and social networking accounts galt had emailed and posted comments in a number of places about his cancer and its relationship to highpower lines but nothing in the hundreds of pages hed written had given them any clues to where he was or what he might have in store rhyme was growing impatient at the speculation id like to see the note tucker sure the asac gestured at the kid please be chockfull of trace something helpful in sixty seconds they were looking at the second demand letter to andi jessen ceo and algonquin consolidated power and light youve made the decision to ignore my earlier request and thats not acceptable you could have responded to that reasonable request for a brownout but you didnt you have raised the stakes no one else has your callusness and greed lead to the deaths this afternoon you must show the people they do not need the drug that youve addicted them to they can return to a purer way of life they dont think they can but they can be shown the way you will cease all high voltage dc transmission to the other north american interconnections for one hour starting at pm this evening this is nonnegotiable cooper began his analysis of the letter ten minutes later he said theres nothing new lincoln same paper same pen unsourceable as far as trace goes more jet fuel thats about it shit like opening a beautifully wrapped box on christmas morning and finding it empty rhyme noticed pulaski in the corner his head with the blond spiky hair was cast forward as he spoke softly into his mobile the conversation seemed furtive and rhyme knew it didnt have anything to do with the galt case hed be calling the hospital about the man hed run into or maybe hed gotten the name of the next of kin and was offering condolences you with us pulaski rhyme called harshly pulaski snapped his phone shut sure i because i really need you with us im with you lincoln good call faa and tsa and tell them weve had another demand and that weve found more jet fuel on the second note they should step up security at all the airports and call the department of defense too it could be an attack on a military airfield especially if tuckers terrorist connection pans out you up for that talking to the pentagon impressing the risk on them yes ill do it turning back to the evidence charts rhyme sighed symbiotic terrorist cells cumulonimbus communications and an invisible suspect with an invisible weapon and as for the other case the attempt to trap the watchmaker in mexico city nothing but the mysterious circuit board its owners manual and two meaningless numbers five hundred seventy and three hundred seventynine which put him in mind of other digits those on the clock nearby the clock counting down to the next deadline second demand note delivered to bernard wahl algonquin security chief assaulted by galt no physical contact no trace no indication of whereabouts or site of next attack paper and ink associated with those found in galts apartment additional traces of alternative jet fuel embedded in paper attack on military base profile identified as raymond galt single living in manhattan suffolk st terrorist connection relation to justice for unknown terror group individual named rahman involved references to monetary disbursements personnel movements and something big algonquin security breach in philadelphia might be related sigint hits code word reference to weapons paper and supplies guns explosives personnel include man and woman galts relationship unknown cancer patient presence of vinblastine and prednisone in significant quantities traces of etoposide leukemia galt is armed with military colt chapter the tv was on in rhymes lab as a prelude to andi jessens press conference which would start in a few minutes a story about algonquin consolidated and jessen herself was airing rhyme was curious about the woman and paid attention to the anchorman as he traced jessens career in the business how her father had been president and ceo of the company before her there was no nepotism involved though the woman had degrees in engineering and business and had worked her way up actually starting as a lineman in upstate new york a lifelong employee of algonquin she was quoted as saying how devoted she was to her career and to her goal of building the company into the numberone player in both the generation of electricity and the brokering of it rhyme had not known that because of deregulation a few years ago power companies had increasingly taken to brokerage buying electricity and natural gas from other companies and selling it some had even sold off their interest in the generation and transmission of power and were in effect commodity dealers with no assets other than offices computers and telephones and very large banks behind them this was the reporter explained the thrust of enrons business andi jessen though had never slipped over to the dark sideextravagance arrogance greed the compact intense woman ran algonquin with an oldfashioned austerity and shunned the splashy life she was divorced and had no children jessen seemed to have no life other than algonquin her only family was a brother randall jessen who lived in philadelphia he was a decorated soldier in afghanistan and had been discharged after an injury by a roadside bomb andi was one of the countrys most outspoken advocates for the megagridone unified power grid that connected all of north america this was she felt a far more efficient way to produce and deliver electricity to consumers with algonquin as the major player rhyme supposed her nicknamethough apparently one never used to her face or in her presencewas the allpowerful apparently this was a reference to both her takenoprisoners management style and to her ambitions for algonquin her controversial reservations about green power were on blunt display in one interview first of all i wanted to say that we at algonquin consolidated are committed to renewable energy sources but at the same time i think we all need to be realistic the earth was here billions of years before we lost our gills and tails and started burning coal and driving internal combustion cars and itll be here doing just fine long long after were history when people say they want to save the earth what they really mean is that they want to save their lifestyle we have to admit we want energy and a lot of it and that we need itfor civilization to progress to be fed and educated to use fancy equipment to keep an eye on the dictators of the world to help third world countries join the first world oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power are the best ways to create that power the piece ended and pundits leapt in to criticize or say hurrah it was more politically correct and produced better ratings to eviscerate her however finally the camera went live to city hall four people on the dais jessen the mayor the police chief and gary noble from homeland security the mayor made a brief announcement and then turned over the mike andi jessen looking both harsh and reassuring told everyone that algonquin was doing all it could to control the situation a number of safeguards had been put into place though she didnt say what those might be surprising rhyme and everyone else in the room the group had made the decision to go public about the second demand letter he supposed that the reasoning was if they were unsuccessful in stopping galt and somebody else died in another attack the public relations and perhaps legal consequences to algonquin would have been disastrous the reporters leapt on this instantly and pelted her with questions jessen coolly silenced them and explained that it was impossible to meet the extortionists requirements a reduction in the amount of power he wanted would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and very likely many more deaths she added that it would be a national security risk because the demands would hamper military and other governmental operations algonquin is a major player in our nations defense and we will not do anything to jeopardize that slick thought rhyme shes turning the whole thing around finally she ended with a personal statement to galt to turn himself in hed be treated fairly dont let your family or anyone else suffer because of the tragedy thats happened to you well do whatever we can to ease your suffering but please do the right thing and turn yourself in she took no questions and was off the dais seconds after she finished speaking her high heels clattering loudly rhyme noticed that while her sympathy was heartfelt she never once admitted that the company had done anything wrong or that highvoltage lines might in fact have led to galts or anyone elses cancer then the police chief took over and tried his best to offer concrete reassurance police and federal agents were out in force looking for galt and national guard troops were ready to assist if there were more attacks or the grid was compromised he ended with a plea to citizens to report anything unusual now thats helpful rhyme thought if theres one thing thats the order of the day in new york city its the unusual and he turned back to the paltry evidence chapter susan stringer left her office on the eighth floor of an ancient building in midtown manhattan at pm she said hello to two other men also making their way to the elevator one of them she knew casually because theyd run into each other occasionally in the building larry left at about this same time every day the difference was that hed be returning to his office to work through the night susan on the other hand was heading home the attractive thirtyfiveyearold was an editor for a magazine that had a specialized field art and antiques restoration primarily eighteenth and nineteenth century she also wrote poetry occasionally and was published these passions gave her only a modest income but if she ever had any doubts about the wisdom of sticking to her career all she had to do was listen to a conversation like the one larry and his friend were having at the moment and she knew she could never go into that side of businesslaw finance banking accounting the two men wore very expensive suits nice watches and elegant shoes but there was a harried quality about them edgy it didnt seem they liked their jobs much the friend was complaining about his boss breathing down his neck larry was complaining about an audit that was in the fucking tank stress unhappiness and that language too susan was pleased she didnt have to deal with that her life was the rococo and neoclassical designs of craftsmen from chippendale to george hepplewhite to sheraton practical beauty she phrased their creations you look wasted the friend said to larry he did susan agreed i am bear of a trip whend you get back tuesday you were senior auditor larry nodded the books were a nightmare twelvehour days the only time i could get out on the golf course was sunday and the temperature hit a hundred and sixteen ouch ive got to go back monday i mean i just dont know where the hell the moneys going somethings fishy weather that hot maybe its evaporating funny larry muttered in an unfunny way the men continued their banter about financial statements and disappearing money but susan tuned them out she saw another man approach wearing a workmans brown overalls and a hat as well as glasses eyes down he carried a tool kit and a large watering can though he mustve been working in a different office since there were no decorative plants in the hallway here and none in her office her publisher wouldnt pay for any flora and he sure wouldnt pay for a person to water them the elevator car came and the two businessmen let her precede them inside and she reflected that at least some semblance of chivalry remained in the twentyfirst century the workman entered too and hit the button for the floor two down but unlike the others he rudely pushed past her to get to the back of the car they started to descend a moment later larry glanced down and said hey mister watch it youre leaking there susan looked back the workman had accidentally tilted the can and a stream of water was pouring onto the stainlesssteel floor of the car oh sorry the man mumbled unapologetically the whole floor was soaked susan noted the door opened and the worker got out another man entered larrys friend said in a loud voice careful that guy just spilled some water in here didnt even bother to clean it up but whether the culprit had heard or not susan couldnt say even if he had she doubted he cared the door closed and they continued their journey downward chapter rhyme was staring at the clock ten minutes until the next deadline the last hour or so had involved coordinated searches throughout the city by the police and fbi and in the townhouse here a frantic analysis of the evidence once more frantic and futile they were no closer to finding galt or his next target location than theyd been just after the first attack rhymes eyes swung to the evidence charts which remained an elusive jumble of puzzle pieces he was aware of mcdaniels taking a call the agent listened nodding broadly he shot a look to his protégé he then thanked the caller and hung up one of my t and c teams had another hit about the terror group a small one but its gold another word in the name is earth justice for the earth sachs said could be more to it but we know those words for certain justice for and earth at least we know its ecoterror sellitto muttered no hits on any database rhyme wondered aloud no but remember this is all cloud zone and there was another hit rahmans second in command seems to be somebody named johnston anglo but how does this help rhyme wondered angrily to himself how does any of this help us find the site of the attack whichs going to happen in just a few minutes and what the hell kind of weapon has he devised this time another arc flash another deadly circuit in a public place rhymes eyes were riveted on the evidence whiteboards mcdaniel said to the kid get me dellray a moment later the agents voice came through the speaker yes whos this whos there fred its tucker im here with lincoln rhyme and some other people from the nypd at rhymes yes how you doing lincoln been better yeah true about all of us mcdaniel said fred you heard about the new demand and deadline your assistant called me she told me about the motive too galts cancer weve got a confirmation that its probably a terror group ecoterror how does that play with galt symbiosis what a symbiotic construct it was in my memo theyre working together the groups called justice for the earth and rahmans second in command is named johnston dellray asked sounds like they have different agendas howd they hook up galt and rahman i dont know fred thats not the point maybe they contacted him read his postings about the cancer it was all over the internet oh now the deadlines coming up at any minute has your ci found anything a pause no tucker nothing the debriefing you said it was at three another hesitation thats right but he doesnt have anything concrete yet hes going a little farther underground the whole fucking worlds underground the fbi agent snapped surprising rhyme he couldnt imagine an expletive issuing from the mans smooth lips so call your guy up and get him the information about justice for the earth and the new player johnston ill do it fred yes hes the only one has any leads this ci of yours thats right and he didnt hear anything not a name nothing afraid not mcdaniel said distractedly well thanks fred you did what you could as if he hadnt expected to learn anything helpful anyway a pause sure they disconnected rhyme and sellitto both were aware of mcdaniels sour expression freds a good man the detective said he is a good man the asac replied quickly too quickly but the subject of fred dellray and mcdaniels opinion of him vanished as everyone in the townhouse except thom got a cell call all within five seconds of each other different sources but the news was the same although the deadline was still seven minutes away ray galt had struck again once more killing innocents in manhattan it was sellittos caller who gave them the details through speakerphone the nypd patrolman sounding young and distracted started to give an account of the attacka midtown office building elevator car in which four passengers were riding it was it was pretty bad then the officer choked his voice dissolved in coughingmaybe from smoke created by the attack or maybe it was simply to cover up his emotion the officer excused himself and said hed call back in a few minutes he never did chapter that smell again could amelia sachs ever escape it and even if she scrubbed and scrubbed and threw her clothes out could she ever forget it apparently the sleeve and hair of one of the victims had caught fire in the elevator car the flames hadnt been bad but the smoke was thick and the smell was repulsive sachs and ron pulaski were suiting up in their overalls she asked one of the emergency service officers dcds gesturing toward the hazy car deceased confirmed dead at scene thats right wherere the bodies up the hall i know we fucked up the scene in the elevator detective but there was so much smoke we didnt know what was going on we had to clear it she told him that was all right checking on the conditions of victims is the first priority besides nothing contaminates a crime scene like fire a few emergency worker footprints would make little difference howd it work she asked the esu officer we arent sure the building supervisor said the car stopped just above the ground floor then smoke started and the screams by the time they got the car down to the main floor and the door opened it was all over sachs shivered at the thought the molten metal disks were bad enough but being claustrophobic she was even more troubled by the thought of those four people in a confined space filled with electricity and one of them burning the esu officer looked over his notes the vics were an editor of an arts magazine a lawyer and an accountant on the eighth floor a computer parts salesman from the sixth if youre interested sachs was always interested in anything that made the victims real partly this was to keep her heart about her to make certain she didnt become callous because of what she encountered on the job but partly it was because of what rhyme had instilled in her for a man who was pure scientist a rationalist rhymes talent as a forensic expert was also due to his uncanny ability to step into the mind of the perp years ago at the very first scene theyd worked a terrible crime also involving death by a utility systemsteam in that caserhyme had whispered to her something that seated itself in her mind every time she walked the grid i want you to be him hed told her speaking of the perp just get into his head youve been thinking the way we think i want you to think the way he does rhyme had told her that while he believed forensic science could be taught this empathy was an innate talent and sachs believed the best way to maintain this connectionthis wire she thought now between your heart and your skillwas never to forget the victims ready she asked pulaski i guess were going to do the grid rhyme she said into the microphone okay but do it without me sachs she was alarmed despite his protests to the contrary rhyme hadnt been well she could tell easily but it turned out that there was another reason he was signing off i want you to walk the grid with that guy from algonquin sommers right why for one thing i like his mind he thinks broadly maybe its his inventors side i dont know but beyond that somethings not right sachs i cant explain it i feel were missing something galt had to have planned this out for a month at least but now it looks like hes accelerating the attackstwo in one day i cant figure that out maybe she suggested its because weve gotten on to him faster than he hoped could be i dont know but if thats the case it also means hed love to take us out too true so i want a fresh perspective ive already called charlie and hes willing to help does he always eat when he talks on the phone he likes junk food well when youre on the grid make sure hes got something that doesnt crunch communications will patch you in whenever youre ready just get back here asap with whatever you find for all we know galts rigging another attack right now they disconnected she glanced at ron pulaski who was still clearly troubled i need you with us rookie she called him over ron the major scenes downstairs where he probably rigged the wires and that device of his she tapped her radio ill be online with charlie sommers i need you to run the elevator another pause and process the bodies too there probably wont be much trace his mo is he doesnt have any direct contact with the vics but it needs to be done are you okay with that the young officer nodded anything you need amelia sounding painfully sincere he was making amends for the accident at galts apartment she guessed lets get to it and vicks what in the kit vicks vaporub put some underneath your nose for the smell in five minutes she was online with charlie sommers grateful that he was helping her in running the sceneto give technical support which he defined in his irreverent way as helping to save her ass sachs clicked on her helmet light and started down the stairs into the basement of the building describing to charlie sommers exactly what she saw in the dank filthy area at the base of the elevator shaft she was linked to him only through audio not video as she usually was with rhyme the building had been cleared by esu but she was very aware of what rhyme had told her earlierthat galt could easily have decided to start targeting his pursuers she looked around for a moment taking only a few detours to shine the light on shadows that had a vaguely human form they turned out to be only shadows that had a vaguely human form he asked you see anything bolted to the railings the elevator rides on she focused again on her search no nothing on the rails but theres a piece of that bennington cable bolted to the wall im test the voltage first was just going to say that ah a born electrician no way after this im not even going to change my car batteries she swept with the detector its zero good where does the line go on one end to a bus bar thats dangling in the shaft its resting against the bottom of the elevator car its scorched where its made contact the other end goes to a thick cable that runs into a beige panel on the wall like a big medicine cabinet the bennington wire is connected to a main line with one of those remote switches like at the last scene thats the incoming service line he added that an office building like this didnt receive electricity the way a residence did it took in a much larger amount like a street transformer volts which was then stepped down for distribution to the offices it was a spot network so the car would descend and hit the hot bus bar but there has to be another switch somewhere one that controls the power to the elevator he needed to stop the car just before it got to the lobby so the victims inside would hit the call button then the passengers hand on the panel and his feet on the floor completed the circuit and electrocuted him and anybody who touched him or he was brushing up against sachs looked around and found the other device she told sommers this he explained exactly how to dismantle the cables and what to look for before she removed any evidence though sachs laid the numbers and photographed the scene then she thanked sommers and told him that was all she needed for now they disconnected and she walked the grid including the entrance and exit routeswhich turned out to be in all likelihood a door nearby that led to the alley it had a flimsy lock and had recently been jimmied open she took pictures of this too she was about to go upstairs and join pulaski when she paused four victims here in the elevator sam vetter and four others dead at the hotel a number in the hospital luis martin and fear throughout the city fear of this invisible killer in her imagination she heard rhyme say you have to become him sachs rested the evidence by the stairs and returned to the base of the elevator shaft im him im raymond galt sachs had trouble summoning the fanatic the crusader since that emotion didnt jibe in her mind with the extreme calculation that the man had shown so far anybody else would just have taken a shot at andi jessen or firebombed the queens plant but galt was going to these precise elaborate lengths to use a very complicated weapon to kill what did it mean im him im galt then her mind went still and up bubbled the answer i dont care about motive i dont care why im doing this none of that matters all thats important is to focus on technique like focusing on making the most perfect splice or switch or connection i can to cause the most harm thats the center of my universe ive become addicted to the process addicted to the juice and with that thought came another its all about angles he had to get i have to get the bus bar in just the right position to kiss the floor of the elevator car when its near the lobby but not yet there which means i have to watch the elevator in operation from all different perspectives down here to make sure the counterweight the gears the motor the cables of the elevator dont knock aside the bus bar or otherwise interfere with the wire i have to study the shaft from all angles i have to on her hands and knees sachs made a circuit of the filthy basement all around the base of the shaftanywhere that galt could have seen the cable and bar and contacts she found no footprints no fingerprints but she did find places where the ground had been recently disturbed and it was not unreasonable to think that hed crouched there to examine his deadly handiwork she took samples from ten locations and deposited them into separate evidence bags marking them according to positions of the compass away northwest away south she then gathered all the other evidence and climbed painfully on her arthritic legs to the lobby joining pulaski sachs looked into the interior of the elevator it wasnt badly damaged there were some smoke marksaccompanied by that terrible smell she simply couldnt imagine what it would have been like to be riding in that car and suddenly have thirteen thousand volts race through your body at least she supposed the vics would have felt nothing after the first few seconds she saw that hed laid the numbers and taken pictures you find anything no i searched the car too but the panel hadnt been opened recently he rigged everything from downstairs and the bodies his face was solemn troubled and she could tell that it had been a difficult chore still he said evenly no trace but there was something interesting all three of them had wet soles all their shoes the fire department no the fire was out by the time they got here water that was interesting to improve the connection but how did he get their shoes wet sachs then asked you said three bodies thats right but that esu guy said there were four vics there were but only three of them died here he handed her a piece of paper whats this on the slip was a name and phone number the survivor i figured youd want to talk to her her names susan stringer shes at st vincents smoke inhalation some burns but shell be okay theyll be releasing her in an hour or so sachs was shaking her head i dont see how anybody couldve survived there were thirteen thousand volts in here ron pulaski replied oh shes disabled in a wheelchair rubber tires you know guess that insulated her chapter howd he do rhyme asked sachs whod just returned to the lab ron little distracted but he did a good job processed the bodies that was tough but he found something interesting somehow the vics all had wet shoes howd galt manage that i dont know you dont think rons too shaken up not too but some but hes young happens thats no excuse no its not its an explanation theyre both the same to me rhyme muttered where is he the hour was after pm he went back to galts thought he mightve missed something rhyme thought this wasnt a bad idea though he was confident that the young officer had searched the scene well the first time he added just keep an eye on him i wont risk anybodys life because hes distracted agreed the two of them and cooper were here alone in the lab mcdaniel and the kid were back at the federal building meeting with homeland security and sellitto was down at the big buildingone police plaza rhyme wasnt sure whom he was meeting with but thered undoubtedly be a long list of people who wanted explanations about why there was no suspect in custody cooper and sachs were laying out the evidence that sachs had collected at the office building the tech then examined the cable and other items that were rigged at the base of the elevator shaft theres one other thing sachs probably thought her voice was casual in fact it was tripping with meaning to rhyme tough to be in love with somebody you can read them so well when theyre up to something what he gave her his inquisitors gaze there was a witness she was in the elevator when the other people died she hurt bad apparently not smoke inhalation mostly that wouldve been unpleasant burning hair his nostrils flared slightly sachs sniffed at her red strands her nose wrinkled too im taking a really long shower tonight whatd she have to say i didnt get a chance to interview her shes coming over here as soon as shes released here rhyme asked with surprise not only was he skeptical of witnesses in the first place but there was a security question about letting a stranger into the lab if a terrorist cell was behind the attacks they might want to sneak one of their members into the inner sanctum of the investigators but sachs laughed deducing his thoughts i checked her out rhyme shes clean no record no warrants longtime editor of some furniture magazine besides i thought it wasnt a bad ideai wouldnt have to spend the time getting to and from the hospital i can stay here and work the evidence what else she hesitated another smile i was explaining too much uhhuh okay shes disabled is she now thats still not answering my question she wants to meet you rhyme youre a celebrity rhyme sighed fine sachs turned to him eyes narrowed youre not arguing now he laughed not in the mood let her come over ill interview her myself show you how its done short and sweet sachs gave a cautious look rhyme then asked what do you have mel peering through the eyepiece of a microscope the tech said nothing helpful for sourcing him sourcing missed that word when i was in verb school rhyme said sourly but ive got one thing cooper said ignoring rhymes remark and reading the results from the chromatographtraces of substances that the database is saying are ginseng and wolfberry chinese herbs maybe tea rhyme announced a case several years ago had involved a snakehead a smuggler of illegal aliens and much of the investigation had centered around chinatown a police officer from mainland china helping in the case had taught rhyme about herbalism thinking it might help his condition the substances had no effect of course but rhyme had found the subject potentially helpful in investigations at the moment he noted the find but agreed with cooper that it wasnt much of a lead there was a time when those substances would have been found only in asian specialty shops and what rhyme called woowoo stores now products like that were in every rite aid pharmacy and food emporium throughout the city on the board if you please sachs as she wrote he looked over a series of small evidence bags lined up in a row with her handwriting on the chainofcustody cards they were labeled with directions from the compass ten little indians rhyme said intrigued what do we have there i got mad rhyme no i got fucking furious good i find anger liberating why because we cant find him so i took samples of substrate from where he mightve been i crawled around in some pretty lousy places rhyme hence the smudge he looked at her forehead she caught his eye ill wash it off later a smile seductive he believed he lifted an eyebrow well get searching tell me what you find she pulled on gloves and poured the samples into ten examining dishes donning magnifying goggles she began sifting through them using a sterile probe to search the contents of each bag dirt cigarette butts the bits of paper the nuts and bolts the bits of what seemed to be rodent shit hairs scraps of cloth candy and fast food wrappers grains of concrete metal and stone the epidermis of underground new york rhyme had learned long ago that in searching for evidence at crime scenes the key was finding patterns what repeated itself frequently objects in that category could be presumptively eliminated it was the unique items those that were out of place that might be relevant outliers statisticians and sociologists called them nearly everything that sachs had found was repeated in every dish of the samples but there was only one thing that was in a category of its own a very tiny band of curved metal nearly in a circle about twice the width of a pencil lead though there were many other bits of metalparts of screws and bolts and shavingsnothing resembled this it was also clean suggesting it had been left recently where was this sachs rising from her hunchedover pose and stretching she looked at the label on the bag in front of the dish twenty feet from the shaft southwest its where he wouldve had a view of all the wiring connections hed made it was under a beam so galt would have been crouching the metal bit could have fallen from his cuff or clothing he asked sachs to hold it up for him to examine closely she put magnifying goggles on him adjusted them then she took tweezers and picked up the bit holding it close ah bluing he said used on iron like on guns treated with sodium hydroxide and nitrite for corrosion resistance and good tensile properties its a spring of some kind mel whats your mechanical parts database like not as updated as when you were chief but its something rhyme went online laboriously typing the pass code he could use voice recognition but characters like which the department had adopted to improve securitywere troublesome to interpret vocally the nypd forensic database main screen popped up and rhyme started in the miscellaneous metalssprings category after ten minutes of scrolling through hundreds of samples he announced its a hairspring i think whats that cooper asked rhyme was grimacing im afraid its bad news if its his it means he might be changing his approach to the attacks how sachs wondered aloud theyre used in timers id bet hes worried were getting close to him and hes going to start using a timed device instead of a remote control when the next attack happens he could be in a different borough rhyme had sachs bag the spring and mark a chainofcustody card hes smart cooper observed but hell slip up they always do they often do rhyme corrected silently the tech then said got a pretty good print from one of the remotes switches rhyme hoped it was from somebody else but no it was just one of galtshe didnt need to be diligent about obscuring his identity now that theyd learned his name the phone buzzed and rhyme blinked to see the country code he answered at once commander luna captain rhyme we have perhaps a development go ahead please an hour ago there was a false fire alarm in a wing of the building mr watchmaker was observing on that floor is an office of a company that brokers real estate loans in latin america the owners a colorful fellow been under investigation a few times it made me suspicious i looked into the background of this man and hes had death threats made before by whom clients whose deals turned out to be less lucrative than they would have wanted he performs some other functions too which i cannot find out about too easily and if i cannot find out about them the answer is simple hes a crook which means he has a very large and efficient security staff so hes the sort of target that would require a killer like the watchmaker exactly but rhyme continued i would also keep in mind that the target could be at the exact opposite end of the complex from that office you think the fire alarm was a feint possibly ill have arturos men consider that too hes put his bestand most invisiblesurveillance people on the case have you found anything more about the contents of the package that logan received the letter i with the blanks the circuit board the booklet the numbers nothing but speculation and as i think you would too captain i feel speculation is a waste of time true commander rhyme thanked the man again and they disconnected he glanced at the clock the time was pm thirtyfive hours since the attack at the substation rhyme was in turmoil on the one hand he was aware of the terrible pressure to move forward with a case in which the progress was frustratingly slow on the other he was exhausted more tired than he remembered being in a long time he needed sleep but he didnt want to admit it to anyone even sachs he was staring at the silent box of the phone considering what the mexican police commander had just told him when he was aware of sweat dotting his forehead this infuriated him he wanted to wipe it before anyone noticed but of course that was a luxury not available to him he jerked his head from side to side finally the motion dislodged the drop but it also caught sachss attention he sensed she was about to ask if he was feeling all right he didnt want to talk about his condition since hed either have to admit that he wasnt or lie to her he wheeled abruptly to an evidence whiteboard and studied the script intently without seeing the words at all sachs was starting toward him when the doorbell rang a moment later there was some motion from the doorway and thom entered the room with a visitor rhyme easily deduced the persons identity she was in a wheelchair made by the same company that had produced his chapter susan stringer had a pretty heartshaped face and a singsongy voice two adjectives stood out pleasant and sweet her eyes were quick though and lips taut even when smiling as befit somebody who had to maneuver her way through the streets of new york using only the power of her arms an accessible townhouse on the upper west side thats a rarity rhyme gave her a smile in returnhe was reserved he had work to do and very little of it involved witnesses his comments to sachs earlier about his interviewing susan stringer were of course facetious still shed nearly been killed by ray galtin a particularly horrible wayand might have some helpful information and if as sachs had reported she wanted to meet him in the process he could live with that she nodded at thom reston with a knowing look about the importance ofand burdens uponcaregivers he asked if there was anything she wanted and she said no i cant stay long its late and im not feeling too well her face had a hollow look shed undoubtedly be thinking of the terrible moments in the elevator she wheeled closer to rhyme susans arms clearly worked fine she was a paraplegic and would probably have suffered a thoracic injury in her mid or upper back no burns rhyme asked no i didnt get a shock the only problem was smokefrom the from the men in the elevator with me one caught fire the last sentence was a whisper what happened sachs asked a stoic look we were near the ground floor when the elevator stopped suddenly the lights went out except for the emergency light one of the businessmen behind me reached for the panel to hit the help button as soon as he touched it he just started moaning and dancing around she coughed cleared her throat it was terrible he couldnt let go of the panel his friend grabbed him or he brushed against him it was like a chain reaction they just kept jerking around and one of them caught fire his hair the smoke the smell susan was whispering now horrible just horrible they were dying right around me they were dying i was screaming i realized it was some electrical problem and i didnt want to touch the metal hand rim of the chair or the metal door frame i just sat there susan shuddered then repeated i just sat there then the car moved down the last few feet and the door opened there were dozens of people in the lobby they pulled me out i tried to warn them not to touch anything but the electricity was off by then she coughed softly for a moment who is this man ray galt susan asked rhyme told her he thinks he got sick from power lines cancer hes out for revenge but there may be an ecoterror connection he mightve been recruited by a group thats opposed to traditional power companies we dont know yet not for sure susan blurted and he wants to kill innocent people to make his point what a hypocrite sachs said hes a fanatic so he doesnt even register hypocrisy whatever he wants to do is good whatever stops him from doing what he wants is bad very simple universe rhyme glanced at sachs who caught the cue and asked susan you said there was something that might help us yes i think i saw him despite his distrust of witnesses rhyme said encouragingly go ahead please he got onto the elevator at my floor you think it was him why because he spilled some water accidentally it seemed but now i know he did it on purpose to improve the connection sachs said the water that ron found on the soles of their shoes sure we wondered where that came from he was dressed like a maintenance man with a watering can for the plants he was wearing brown overalls kind of dirty it seemed odd and the building doesnt have plants in the hall and we dont in our office theres still a team there rhyme asked sachs she said that there would be fire maybe not pd have them call the building manager wake him up if they have to see if they have a plant maintenance service and check video security a few minutes later they had their answer no plant waterers for the building or any of the companies on the eighth floor and security cameras were only in the lobby with wideangle lenses uselessly showing a bunch of people coming a bunch of people going one of the fire marshals reported cant make out a single face rhyme called up the dmv picture of galt on the screen is that him he asked susan could be he didnt look at us and i didnt look at him really a knowing glance toward rhyme his face wasnt exactly at eye level anything else you remember about him when he was walking toward the car and then when he first got in he kept looking at his watch the deadline sachs pointed out then added he set it off early though only a few minutes rhyme said maybe he was worried that somebodyd recognized him in the building he wanted to finish up and get out and he was probably monitoring algonquins electrical transmissions and knew the company wasnt going to shut down the juice by the deadline susan continued he was wearing gloves tan gloves they were leather those were at eye level and i remember them because i was thinking his hands must be sweating it was hot in the car did the uniform have any writing on it no anything else she shrugged not that its helpful but he was rude rude when he got on the elevator he pushed past me didnt apologize or anything he actually touched you not me she nodded down the chair it was kind of a tight squeeze mel the techs head swiveled toward them susan rhyme asked do you mind if we examine that spot on your chair no not at all cooper carefully looked over the side of the chair she indicated using a magnifying glass rhyme couldnt see exactly what he found but the tech lifted away two items from bolts at joints in the upright pieces what fibers one dark green and one brown cooper was examining them through the microscope then turned to a computer database of similar fiber cotton heavy duty could be military army surplus enough to test plenty the tech and sachs ran a portion of each of the samples through the gas chromatographmass spectrometer finally as rhyme waited impatiently she called got the results a printout eased from the machine and cooper looked it over more aviation fuel on the green fiber but something else on the brown fiber theres diesel fuel and more of those chinese herbs diesel rhyme was considering this maybe its not an airport maybe its a refinery hes after cooper said thatd be one hell of a target lincoln it sure would sachs call gary nobel tell him to step up security in the ports refineries and tankers especially she grabbed the phone mel add everything weve got so far to the chart crime scene office building at w th street victims deceased larry fishbein new york city accountant robert bodine new york city attorney

maintenance man in dark brown overalls dark green as well wearing tan leather gloves cooper organized the evidence and marked chain of custody cards while sachs was on the phone with homeland security about the risk to the ports in new york and new jersey rhyme and susan stringer found themselves alone as he stared at the chart he was aware that the woman was looking him over closely uneasy he turned toward her trying to figure out how to get her to leave shed come shed helped shed met the celebrity crip time to get on with things she asked youre c right this meant his injury was at the fourth cervical vertebra four bones down in his spine from the base of the skull yes though ive got a little motion in my hands no sensation technically his was a complete injury meaning that hed lost all sensory function below the site of the injury incomplete patients can have considerable movement but the human body is quirky and a few electric impulses escaped over the barricade the wiring was faulty but not wholly severed youre in good shape she said musclewise eyes back on the whiteboards he said absently i do rangeofmotion exercises every day and functional electric stimulation to keep the tone up rhyme had to admit that he enjoyed the exercise he explained that he worked out on a treadmill and stationary bike the equipment moved him not the other way around but it still built up muscles and seemed to have been responsible for the recent movement hed regained in his right hand whereas after the accident only his left ring finger worked he was in better shape now than before the injury he told her this and he could see from her face that she understood she flexed id ask you to arm wrestle but a genuine laugh from rhymes throat then her face grew solemn and she glanced around to see if anyone else could hear when it was clear none could she turned back held his eyes and said lincoln do you believe in fate chapter there is a certain camaraderie in the disabled world some patients have the band of brothers attitudeits us against them dont mess with us others take a more huggy approach hey you ever need to cry on somebodys shoulder im here for you were all in this together friend but lincoln rhyme didnt have time for either he was a criminalist who happened to have a body that didnt operate the way he would have liked like amelia sachs was a cop with arthritis and a love of fast cars and guns rhyme didnt define himself by his disability it was an afterthought there were pleasant crips and witty ones and those who were insufferable pricks rhyme judged them one by one as he did everybody else he thought susan stringer was a perfectly pleasant woman and respected her courage in coming here when she could have stayed home and nursed her wounds and exploited her trauma but they had nothing in common other than a spinal cord injury and rhymes mind was already back to the galt case he suspected susan was soon to be disappointed that the famous gimp criminalist shed come to see had little time for her and he sure as hell wasnt anybody to talk to about fate no he answered her probably not in the sense you mean im referring to what seems to be coincidence actually could be events that were meant to happen he confirmed then no i didnt think so she was smiling but the good news for people like you is that there are people like me who do believe in fate i think theres a reason i was in that elevator and im here now the smile turned into a laugh dont worry im not a stalker a whisper im not after a donation or after your body im happily married and i can see that you and detective sachs are together its not about that its solely about you he was about to well he wasnt sure what he was about to do he simply wanted her to leave but didnt quite know how to engineer it so he lifted a curious and cautious eyebrow she asked have you heard about the pembroke spinal cord center over on lexington i think so im not sure he was forever getting information about spinal cord injury rehab and products and medical updates hed stopped paying much attention to the flood of material his obsession with the cases he was running for the bureau and the nypd greatly limited his time for extracurricular reading much less chasing around the country in search of new treatments susan said ive been in several programs there some people in my sci support group have too sci support group his heart sank he saw what was coming but again she was a step ahead im not asking you to join us dont worry you dont look like youd be a good member the eyes sparkled humorously in her heartshaped face of anything no all im asking tonight is that you hear me out i can do that now pembroke is the dday of spinal cord treatment they do everything there were many promising techniques to help people with severe disabilities but the problem was funding even though the injuries were severe and the consequences lifelong the reality was that when compared with other maladies serious spinal cord problems were relatively rare which meant that government and corporate research money went elsewhere to procedures and medicines that would help more people so most of the procedures that promised significant improvements in patients conditions remained experimental and unapproved in america and some of the results were remarkable in research labs rats with severed spinal cords had actually learned to walk again they have a critical response unit but that wont do us any good of course the key to minimizing spinal cord damage is to treat the affected area immediately after the accident with medications that prevent swelling and future killing of the nerves at the site of the injury but theres a very small window of opportunity to do that usually hours or at the most days after the injury as veteran patients rhyme and susan stringer could take advantage only of techniques to repair the damage but that always ran up against the intractable problem central nervous system cellsthose in the brain and spinal corddont regenerate the way the skin on your finger does after a cut this was the battle that sci doctors and researchers fought daily and pembroke was in the vanguard susan described an impressive array of techniques that the center offered they were working with stem cells doing nerve reroutingusing peripheral nerves any nerve outside the spinal cord which can regenerateand treating the injured areas with drugs and other substances to promote regeneration they were even building noncellular bridges around the location of the injury to carry nerve impulses between the brain and the muscles the center also had an extensive prosthetics department it was amazing she told him i saw a video of this paraplegic whod been implanted with a computer controller and a number of wires she could walk almost normally rhyme was staring at the length of the bennington cable that galt had used in the first attack wires she described something called the freehand system and others like it that involved implanting stimulators and electrodes in the arms by shrugging your shoulders or moving your neck in a certain way you could trigger coordinated movements of the arm and hands some quads she explained could even feed themselves none of that bullshit quackery you see doctors preying on the desperate susan angrily mentioned a doctor in china whod pocket to drill holes in patients heads and spines to implant tissue from embryos with of course no discernible effectother than exposing the patient to risk of death further injury and bankruptcy the people on the staff at pembroke she explained were all from the top medical schools from around the world and the claims were realisticthat is modest a quad like rhyme wouldnt be able to walk but he could improve his lung functioning perhaps get other digits to work and most important get back control of bowel and bladder this would greatly help in reducing the risk of dysreflexia attacksthat skyrocketing of the blood pressure that could lead to stroke that could render him even more disabled than he was or kill him its helped me a lot i think in a few years ill be able to walk again rhyme was nodding he could think of nothing to say i dont work for them im not a disability rights advocate im an editor who happens to be a paraplegic this echo made rhyme offer a faint smile she continued but when detective sachs said she was working with you i thought fate i was meant to come tell you about pembroke they can help you i appreciate it ive read about you of course youve done a lot of good for the city maybe its time you did some good for yourself well its complicated he had no idea what that meant much less why hed said it i know youre worried about the risk and you should be true surgery would be riskier for him as a c than for her he was prone to blood pressure respiratory and infection complications the question was balance was the surgery worth it hed nearly undergone an operation a few years ago but a case had derailed the procedure hed postponed any medical treatment of that sort indefinitely but now he considered was his life the way he wished it to be of course not but he was content he loved sachs and she him he lived for his job he wasnt eager to throw all that away chasing an unrealistic dream normally buttoned tight about his personal feelings he nonetheless told susan stringer this and she understood then he surprised himself further by adding something he hadnt told many people at all i feel that im mostly my mind thats where i live and i sometimes think thats one of the reasons im the criminalist that i am no distractions my power comes from my disability if i were to change if i were to become quote normal would that affect me as a forensic scientist i dont know but i dont want to take that chance susan was considering this its an interesting thought but i wonder if thats a crutch an excuse not to take the risk rhyme appreciated that he liked blunt talk he nodded at his chair a crutch is a step up in my case she laughed thanks for your thoughts he added because he felt he ought to and she fixed him with another of those knowing looks the expression was less irritating now though it remained disconcerting she backed away in the chair and said mission accomplished his brow furrowed susan said i found you two fibers you might not otherwise have she smiled wish it were more eyes back on rhyme but sometimes its the little things that make all the difference now i should go sachs thanked her and thom saw her out after shed left rhyme said this was a setup right sachs replied it was sort of a setup rhyme we needed to interview her anyway when i called about arranging it we got to talking when she heard i worked with you she wanted to make her sales pitch i told her id get her in to see the chairman rhyme gave a brief smile then it faded as sachs crouched and said in a voice that mel cooper couldnt hear i dont want you any different than you are rhyme but i want to make sure youre healthy for me thats all i care about whatever you choose is fine for a moment rhyme recalled the title of the pamphlet left by dr kopeski with die with dignity choices she leaned forward and kissed him he felt her hand touching the side of his head with a bit more palm than made sense for a gesture of affection i have a temperature he asked smiling at catching her she laughed we all have temperatures rhyme whether you have a fever or not i cant tell she kissed him again now get some sleep mel and ill keep going here for a while ill be up to bed soon she returned to the evidence shed found rhyme hesitated but then decided that he was tired too tired to be much help at the moment he wheeled toward the elevator where thom joined him and they began their journey upward in the tiny car sweat continued to dot his forehead and it seemed to him that his cheeks were flushed these were symptoms of dysreflexia but he didnt have a headache and he didnt feel the onset of the sensation that preceded an attack thom got him ready for bed and handled the evening detail the blood pressure cuff and thermometer were handy little high he said of the former as to the latter rhyme didnt in fact have a fever thom executed a smooth transfer to get him into bed and rhyme heard in his memory sachss comment from a few minutes earlier we all have a temperature rhyme he couldnt help reflecting that clinically this was true we all did even the dead chapter he awoke fast from a dream he tried to recall it he couldnt remember enough to know whether it had been bad or simply odd it was certainly intense though the likelihood however was that it was bad since he was sweating furiously as if he were walking through the turbine room at algonquin consolidated the time was just before midnight the faint light of the clockalarm reported hed been asleep for a short time and he was groggy it took a moment to orient himself hed ditched the uniform and hard hat and gear bag after the attack at the hotel but hed kept one of his accoutrements which was now dangling from a chair nearby the id badge in the dim reflected light he stared at it now his sullen picture the impersonal typeface of r galt and above that in somewhat more friendly lettering algonquin consolidated power energizing your life considering what hed been up to for the past several days he appreciated the irony of that slogan he lay back and stared at the shabby ceiling in the east village weekly rental which hed taken a month ago under a pseudonym knowing the police would find the apartment sooner or later sooner as it turned out he kicked the sheets off his flesh was damp with sweat thinking about the conductivity of the human body the resistance of our slippery internal organs can be as low as ohms making them extremely susceptible to current wet skin or less but dry skin has a resistance of ohms or more thats so high that significant amounts of voltage are needed to push that current through the body usually volts sweat makes the job a lot easier his skin cooled as it dried and his resistance climbed his mind leapt from thought to thought the plans for tomorrow what voltages to use how to rig the lines he thought about the people he was working with and he thought about the people pursuing him that woman detective sachs the younger one pulaski and of course lincoln rhyme then he was meditating on something else entirely two men in the s the chemists stanley miller and harold urey at the university of chicago they devised a very interesting experiment in their lab they created their version of the primordial soup and atmosphere that had covered the earth billions of years ago into this mix of hydrogen ammonia and methane they fired sparks mimicking the lightning that blanketed the earth back then and what happened a few days later they found something thrilling in the test tubes were traces of amino acids the socalled building blocks of life they had discovered evidence suggesting that life had begun on earth all because of a spark of electricity as the clock approached midnight he composed his next demand letter to algonquin and the city of new york then with sleep enfolding him he thought again about juice and the irony that what had in a millisecond burst of lightning created life so many many years ago would tomorrow take it away just as fast earth day iii juice i havent failed ive just found ten thousand ways that wont work thomas alva edison chapter please leave a message at the tone sitting in his brooklyn townhouse at am fred dellray stared at his phone flipped it closed he didnt bother to leave another message though not after leaving twelve earlier ones on william brents cold phone im screwed he thought there was the chance the man was dead even though mcdaniels phrasing was fuckedup symbiosis construct his theory might not be it made sense that ray galt was the inside man seduced into helping rahman and johnston and their justice for the earth group target algonquin and the grid if brent had stumbled into their cell theyd have killed him in an instant ah dellray thought angrily blind simpleminded politicsthe empty calories of terrorism but dellrayd been in this business a long time and his gut told him that william brent was very much alive new york city is smaller than people think particularly the underside of the big apple dellray had called up other contacts a lot of them other cis and some of the undercover agents he ran no word about brent even jimmy jeep knew nothingand he definitely had a motive to track down the man again to make sure dellray still backed the upcoming march through georgia yet nobodyd heard about anybody ordering a clip or a cleaner and no surprised garbagemen had wheeled a dumpster to their truck and found nestled inside the pungent sarcophagus an unidentified body no dellray concluded there was only the obvious answer and he could ignore it no more brent had fucked him over hed checked homeland security to see if the snitch either as brent or as one of his half dozen undercover identities had booked a flight anywhere he hadnt though any professional ci knows where to buy airtight identity papers honey dellray jumped at the sound and he looked up and saw serena in the doorway holding preston youre looking thoughtful she said dellray continued to be struck by the fact she looked like jada pinkett smith the actress and producer you were brooding before you went to bed you started brooding when you woke up i suspect you were brooding in your sleep he opened his mouth to spin a tale but then said i think i got my ass fired yesterday what her face was shocked mcdaniel fired you not in so many wordshe thanked me but some thankyous mean thank you others mean pack up your stuff lets just say im being eased out same thing i think youre reading too much into it he keeps forgetting to call me with updates on the case the grid case right lincoln calls me lon sellitto calls me tuckers assistant calls me dellray didnt go into the part about another source of the brooding the possible indictment for the stolen and missing but more troubling was the fact that he really did believe william brent had had a solid lead something that might let them stop these terrible attacks a lead that had vanished with him serena walked over and sat beside him handed over preston who grabbing dellrays lengthy thumb in enthusiastic fingers took away some of the brooding she said to him im sorry honey he looked out the window of the townhouse into the complex geometry of buildings and beyond where he could just see a bit of stonework from the brooklyn bridge a portion of walt whitmans poem crossing brooklyn ferry came to mind the best i had done seemd to me blank and suspicious my great thoughts as i supposed them were they not in reality meagre these words were true of him as well the facade of fred dellray hip ornery tough man of the street occasionally thinking more than occasionally thinking what if im getting it wrong the beginning lines of the next stanza of whitmans poem though were the kicker it is not you alone who know what it is to be evil i am he who knew what it was to be evil whatm i going to do he mused justice for the earth he ruefully recalled turning down the chance to go to a highlevel conference on satellite and data intelligence gathering and analysis the memo had read the shape of the future slipping into street dellray had said aloud heres the shape of the fewture and rolled the memo into a ball launching it into a trash bin for a threepointer so youre just home serena asked wiping prestons mouth the baby giggled and wanted more she obliged and tickled him too i had one angle on the case and it vanished well i lost it i trusted somebody i shouldntve im outa the loop a snitch walked out on you an inch away from mentioning the one hundred thousand but he didnt go there gone and vanished dellray muttered gone and vanished both serenas face grew theatrically grave dont tell me he absconded and disappeared too the agent could resist the smile no longer i only use snitches with extraordinary talents then the smile faded in two years he never missed a debriefing or call of course in those two years i never paid him till after hed delivered serena asked so whatre you going to do he answered honestly i dont know then you can do me a favor i suppose what you know all that stuff in the basement that youve been meaning to organize fred dellrays first reaction was to say youve got to be kidding but then he considered the leads he had in the galt case which were none and hefting the baby on his hip rose and followed her downstairs chapter ron pulaski could still hear the sound the thud and then the crack oh the crack he hated that thinking back to his first time working for lincoln and amelia how hed gotten careless and had been smacked in the head with a bat or club he knew about the incident though he couldnt remember a single thing about it careless hed turned the corner without checking on the whereabouts of the suspect and the man had clocked him good the injury had made him scared made him confused made him disoriented he did the best he couldoh he tried hardthough the trauma kept coming back and even worse it was one thing to get lazy and walk around a corner when he shouldve been careful but it was something very different to make a mistake and hurt somebody else pulaski now parked his squad car in front of the hospitala different vehicle the other one had been impounded for evidence if he was asked he was going to say he was here to take a statement from somebody whod been in the neighborhood of the man committing the terrorist attacks on the grid im trying to ascertain the perpetrators whereabouts that was the sort of thing he and his twin brother also a cop would say to each other and theyd laugh their asses off only it wasnt funny now because he knew the guy hed run over whose body had thudded and whose head had cracked was just some poor passerby as he walked inside the chaotic hospital a wave of panic hit him what if he had killed the guy vehicular manslaughter he supposed the charge could be or criminally negligent homicide this could be the end of his career and even if he didnt get indicted even if the attorney general didnt go anywhere with the case he could still be sued by the guys family what if the man ended up like lincoln rhyme paralyzed did the police department have insurance for this sort of thing his own coverage sure wouldnt pay for anything like lifelong care could the vic sue pulaski and take away everything he and jennyd be working for the rest of their lives just to pay off the judgment the kids might never go to college the tiny fund theyd already started would disappear like smoke im here to see stanley palmer he told the attendant sitting behind a desk auto accident yesterday sure officer hes in four oh two being in uniform he walked freely through several doors until he found the room he paused outside to gather his courage what if palmers entire family was there wife and children he tried to think of something to say but all he heard was thud then crack ron pulaski took a deep breath and stepped into the room palmer was alone he lay unconscious hooked to all sorts of intimidating wires and tubes electronic equipment as complicated as the things in lincoln rhymes lab rhyme how hed let down his boss the man whod inspired him to remain a cop because rhyme had done the same after his own injury and the man who kept giving him more and more responsibility lincoln rhyme believed in him and look what ive done now pulaski stared at palmer lying absolutely stilleven stiller than rhyme because nothing on the patients body was moving except his lungs though even the lines on the monitor werent doing much a nurse passed by and pulaski called her in how is he i dont know she replied in a thick accent he couldnt identify you have to talk to you know the doctor after staring at palmers still form for some time pulaski looked up to see a middleaged man of indeterminate race in blue scrubs md was embroidered after his name again because of pulaskis own uniform it seemed the medico gave him information he might not otherwise have doled out to a stranger palmer had undergone surgery for severe internal injuries he was in a coma and they werent able to give a prognosis at this point he didnt have any family in the area it seemed he was single he had a brother and parents in oregon and theyd been contacted brother pulaski whispered thinking of his own twin thats right then the doctor lowered the chart and cast a look at the cop after a moment he said with a knowing gaze youre not here to take his statement this has nothing to do with the investigation come on what alarmed pulaski could only stare then a kind smile blossomed in the doctors face it happens dont worry about it happens ive been an er doctor in the city for a long time you never see veteran cops come in person to pay respects to victims only the young ones no really i was just checking to see if i could take a statement sure but you couldve called to see if he was conscious dont play all hardass officer you got a good heart which was pounding all the harder now the doctors eyes went to palmers motionless form was it a hitandrun no we know the driver good you nailed the prick i hope the jury throws the book at him then the man in his stained outfit was walking away pulaski stopped at the nurses station and once more under the aura of his uniform got palmers address and social security number hed find out what he could about him his family dependents even though he was single palmer was middleaged so he might have kids hed call them see if he could help in some way pulaski didnt have much money but hed give whatever moral support he could mostly the young officer just wanted to unburden his soul for the pain hed caused the nurse excused herself and turned away answering an incoming call pulaski turned too even more quickly and before he left the nurses station he pulled on sunglasses so nobody could see the tears chapter at a little after am rhyme asked mel cooper to click on the tv in the lab though he kept the sound down since the feds had seemed slow to share uptotheminute information with the nypd at least with rhyme he wanted to make certain he learned the latest developments what better source than cnn the case was front and center of course galts picture was flashed about a million times and there were nearly as many references to the mysterious justice for the earth ecoterror group and sound bites from antigreen andi jessen but most of the coverage of the galt attacks involved windstorms of speculation and many anchors of course wondered if there was a connection to earth day which was also the subject of much reportage there were a number of celebrations in the city a parade schoolchildren planting trees protests the new energy expo at the convention center and the big rally in central park at which two of the presidents key allies on the environment would be speaking upandcoming senators from out west following that would be a concert by a half dozen famous rock groups attendance would be close to a half million people several stories dealt with the increased security at all the events because of the recent attacks gary noble and tucker mcdaniel had told rhyme that not only were two hundred extra agents and nypd officers assigned to security the fbis technical support people had been working with algonquin to make sure that all the electrical lines in and around the park were protected from sabotage rhyme now looked up as ron pulaski walked into the room whereve you been rookie uhm he held up a white envelope the dna hed been someplace elserhyme believed he knew where the criminalist didnt press it but he said that wasnt a priority we know who the perp is well need it for the trial but weve got to catch him first sure you find anything else yesterday at galts went over it again top to bottom lincoln but nothing sorry sellitto too arrived looking more disheveled than usual the outfit seemed the samelight blue shirt and navy suit rhyme wondered if hed slept in his own office last night the detective gave them a synopsis of how things were unfolding downtownthe case had bled over into the public relations world political careers could be at stake and while local state and federal officials were putting bodies on the street and bringing resources to bear each was also carefully suggesting that it was doing more than the others settling into a noisy wicker chair he loudly slurped coffee and muttered but the bottom line is nobody knows how to run this thing weve got portables and feebies and national guard at the airports subways train stations all the refineries and docks special harbor patrols around the tankersthough i dont know how the fuck hed attack a ship with an arc flash or whatever and theyve got people on all the algonquin substations hes not going after the substations anymore rhyme complained i know that and so does everybody but nobody knows where exactly to expect him its everywhere what is this fucking juice electricity he waved his hand apparently indicating the entire city everybodys goddamn house he eyed the outlets in rhymes wall then said at least we havent got any more demands christ two yesterday within a few hours i was thinking he just got pissed off and decided to kill those guys in an elevator no matter what the big man sighed ill be taking the stairs for a while ill tell you good for the weight at least eyes sweeping across the evidence boards rhyme was in agreement about the rudderless nature of the case galt was smart but he wasnt brilliant and he was leaving ample trace behind it just wasnt leading them anywhere other than offering general ideas of his targets an airport an oil depot though lincoln rhyme was also thinking something else are the paths there and am i just missing them and felt again the tickle of sweat the faint recurring headache that had plagued him recently hed successfully ignored it for a time but the throbbing had returned yes he was feeling worse there was no doubt about it was that affecting his mental skills he would admit to no one not even sachs that this was perhaps the most terrifying thing in the world to him as hed told susan stringer last night his mind was all he had he found his eyes drawn to the den across the hall the table where dr arlen kopeskis die with dignity brochure rested choices he then tipped the thought away just then sellitto took a call sitting up as he listened and setting down his coffee quickly yeah where he jotted in his limp notebook everyone in the room was watching him intently rhyme was thinking a new demand the phone clicked closed he looked up from his notes okay may have something a portable downtown near chinatown calls in womand come up to him and says she thinks she saw our boy galt pulaski asked sourly what other boy we interested in officer sorry she thinks she recognized the picture where rhyme snapped theres an abandoned school near chinatown sellitto gave them the address sachs was writing the portable checked it out nobody there now but if he was there hedve left something behind rhyme said at his nod sachs stood okay ron lets go you better take a team sellitto added wryly weve probably got a few cops left who arent guarding fuse boxes or wires around town lets get esu in the area she said stage nearby but keep em out of sight ron and ill go in first if hes there after all and we need a takedown ill call but we dont want a team running through the place screwing up the evidence if its empty the two of them headed out the door sellitto called bo haumann of emergency service and briefed him the esu head would get officers into the area and coordinate with sachs the detective disconnected and looked around the room presumably for something to accompany the coffee he found a plate of pastry courtesy of thom and grabbed a bear claw pastry dunked it and ate then he frowned rhyme asked what just realized i forgot to call mcdaniel and the feds and tell em about the operation in chinatownat the school then he grimaced and held up his phone theatrically aw shit i cant i didnt pay for a cloud zone sim chip guess ill have to tell him later rhyme laughed and ignored the searing ache that spiked momentarily in his head just then his phone rang and both humor and headaches vanished kathryn dance was calling his finger struggled to hit the keypad yes kathryn whats going on she said im on the phone with rodolfo theyve found the watchmakers target excellent he reflected though part of him was also thinking why now but then he decided the watchmakers the priority at least for the moment youve got sachs and pulaski and a dozen esu troops after galt and the last time you had a chance at the watchmaker you turned away from the search to focus on something else and he killed his victim and got away not this time richard logan isnt escaping this time go ahead he told the cbi agent forcing himself to turn away from the evidence boards there was a click rodolfo dance said lincolns on the line ill leave you two to talk ive got to see tj they said goodbye to her hello captain commander what do you have arturo diaz has four undercover officers in the office complex i was telling you about about ten minutes ago mr watchmaker dressed as a businessman entered the building from the lobby he used a pay phone to call a company on the sixth flooron the opposite side of where the fire alarm was yesterday just like you thought he spent about ten minutes inside and then left he vanished rhyme asked alarmed no hes now outside in a small park between the two main buildings in the complex just sitting there so it seems hes made several mobile calls but the frequency is unusual or theyre scrambled arturo tells me so we cant intercept rhyme supposed rules about eavesdropping in mexico might be somewhat less strict than in the us theyre sure its the watchmaker yes arturos men said they had a clear view he has a satchel with him he still is carrying it he is yes we still cant be sure what it is a bomb perhaps with the circuit board detonator our teams are surrounding the facility all plainclothed but we have a full complement of soldiers nearby and the bomb squad where are you commander a laugh it was very considerate of your watchmaker to pick this place the jamaican consulate is here they have bomb barriers up and were behind those logan cant see us rhyme hoped that was true when will you move in as soon as arturos men say its clear the park is crowded with innocents a number of children but he wont get away we have most of the roads sealed off a trickle of sweat slipped down rhymes temple he grimaced and twisted his head to the side to wipe it on the headrest the watchmaker so close please let this work out please and again squelched the frustration that he felt from working on such an important case at a distance well let you know soon captain they disconnected the call and rhyme forced himself to focus on raymond galt once again was the lead to his whereabouts solid he looked like an everyman approaching middle age not too heavy not too slim average height and in the paranoid climate hed created people were undoubtedly primed to see things that werent there electrical traps arc flash risks and the killer himself then he started as sachss voice snapped through the radio rhyme you there k shed ended her transmission with the traditional conclusion of a comment or question in the police radio parlance k to let the recipient know it was okay to transmit he and she usually disposed of this formality and for some reason rhyme found it troubling that shed used the shorthand sachs go ahead what do you have we just got here were about to go in ill let you know chapter a maroon torino cobra made for a bad undercover car so sachs had glided it to a stop about two blocks away from the school where galt had been sighted the school had closed years ago and according to the signage was soon to be demolished and condominiums built on the grounds good hideyhole she said to pulaski as they jogged close noting the sevenfoothigh wooden fence around the grounds covered with graffiti and posters of alternative theater performance pieces and music groups plummeting to obscurity the seventh seal the right hands bolo pulaski who seemed to be forcing himself to concentrate nodded shed have to keep an eye on him hed done well at the elevator crime scene in midtown but it seemed that the accident at galts apartmenthitting that manwas bothering him again they paused in front of the fence the demolition hadnt started yet the gatetwo hinged pieces of plywood chained together and padlockedhad enough play so they could have squeezed through which is probably how galt had gotten in if in fact he had sachs stood to the side of the gap and peered in the school was largely intact though it seemed that a portion of the roof had fallen in most of the glass had been stoned out of the windows but you could see virtually nothing inside yep it was a good hideyhole and a nightmare to assault thered be a hundred good defensive positions call in the troops not yet sachs thought every minute they delayed was a minute galt could be finishing the last touches on his new weapon and every esu officers footfall might destroy trace evidence he could have it boobytrapped pulaski whispered in an unsteady voice looking at the metal chain maybe its wired no he wouldnt risk somebody just touching it casually and getting a shock theyd call the police right away but she continued he could easily have something rigged to tell him of intruders presence so sighing and with a grimace on her face she looked up the street can you climb that what the fence i guess i could if i were chasing or being chased well i cant unless you give me a boost then you come after all right they walked to where she could make out through a crack in the fence some thick bushes on the other side which would both break their fall and give them some cover she recalled that galt was armedand with a particularly powerful gun the she made sure her glock holster was solidly clipped into her waistband and then nodded pulaski crouched down and laced his fingers together mostly to put him at ease she whispered gravely one thing to remember its important whats that he looked into her eyes uneasily ive gained a few pounds said the tall policewoman be careful of your back a smile it didnt last long but it was a smile nonetheless she winced from the pain in her leg as she stepped onto his hands and twisted to face the wall just because galt hadnt electrified the chain didnt mean he hadnt rigged something on the other side she saw in her minds eye once more the holes in luis martins flesh saw too the sooty floor of the elevator car yesterday the quivering bodies of the hotel guests no backup he whispered youre sure im sure on three one two three and up she went pulaski much stronger than shed expected launching her nearly sixfoot frame straight up her palms caught the top and she lodged there sitting momentarily a glance at the school no sign of anyone then a look downward and she saw beneath her only the bush nothing to burn her flesh with fivethousanddegree arc flashes no metal wires or panels sachs turned her back to the school gripped the top of the fence and lowered herself as far as she could then when she knew shed have to let go she let go she hit rolling and the pain rattled through her knees and thighs but she knew her malady of arthritis as intimately as rhyme knew his bodily limitations and she understood this was merely a temporary protest by the time shed taken cover behind the thickest stand of shrub gun drawn and looking for any presenting targets the pain had diminished clear she whispered through the fence there was a thump and a faint grunt and like some kungfu movie actor pulaski landed deftly and silently beside her his weapon too appeared in his hand there was no way they could approach the front without being seen if galt happened to look out theyd go around to the back but sachs needed to do one thing first she scanned the grounds and gesturing pulaski to follow her stayed behind the bushes and dumpsters awaiting filling heading to the right side of the school with pulaski covering her she moved fast to where two large rusting metal boxes were fitted to the brick both had peeling decals with the name algonquin consolidated on the side and a number to call in an emergency she took from her pocket sommerss current detector turned it on and swept the unit over the boxes the display showed zero not surprising since the place had been deserted for years it seemed but she was happy to see the confirmation look pulaski whispered touching her arm sachs gazed at where he was pointing through a greasy window it was dim and hard to make out anything inside clearly but after a moment she could see the faint movement of a flashlight she believed slowly scanning possiblythe shadows were deceptiveshe was looking at a man poring over a document a map a diagram of an electrical system he was going to turn into a deadly trap he is here pulaski whispered excitedly she pulled the headset on and called bo haumann the esu head what do you have detective k theres somebody here i cant tell if its galt or not hes in the middle part of the main building ron and i are going to flank him whats your eta k eight nine minutes silent rollup k good well be in the back call me when youre ready for the takedown well come in from behind roger out she then called rhyme and told him that they might have the perp theyd go in as soon as esu was on site look out for traps rhyme urged theres no power its safe she disconnected the transmission and glanced at pulaski ready he nodded crouching she moved quickly toward the back of the school gripping her weapon tightly and thinking okay galt havent got your juice to protect you here youve got a gun ive got a gun now were on my turf chapter as he disconnected from sachs rhyme felt another tickle of sweat he finally had to resort to calling thom and asking him to wipe it off this was perhaps the hardest for rhyme relying on somebody for the big tasks wasnt so bad the rangeofmotion exercises bowel and bladder the sittingtransfer maneuver to get him into the wheelchair or bed the feeding it was the tiny needs that were the most infuriating and embarrassing flicking away an insect picking fuzz off your slacks wiping away a rivulet of sweat the aide appeared and easily took care of the problem without a thought thank you the criminalist said thom hesitated at the unexpected show of gratitude rhyme turned back to the evidence boards but in fact he wasnt thinking much of galt it was possible that sachs and the esu team were about to collar the crazed employee at the school in chinatown no what was occupying his overheated mind exclusively was the watchmaker in mexico city goddamn it why wasnt luna or kathryn dance or somebody calling to give him a blowbyblow description of the takedown maybe the watchmaker had already planted the bomb in the office building and was using his own presence as a diversion the satchel he carried might be filled with bricks why exactly was he hanging out in the office park like some goddamn tourist trying to figure out where to get a margarita and could it be a different office altogether he was targeting then rhyme said mel i want to see where the takedowns happening google earth or whatever its called pull it up for me mexico city sure avenue bosque de reforma how often do they update the images i dont know probably every few months its not real time though i dont imagine i dont care about that a few minutes later they were looking at a satellite image of the area a curving road avenue bosque de reforma with the office buildings separated by the park where the watchmaker was sitting at that moment across the street was the jamaican consulate protected by a series of concrete barriersthe bomb blast shieldsand a gate rodolfo luna and his team would be on the other side of those behind them were official vehicles parked in front of the embassy itself he gasped as he stared at the barriers to the left was a blast shield running perpendicular to the road to the right were six others parallel to it this was the letter i and the blank spaces from the package delivered to the watchmaker at mexico city airport gold letters little blue booklet the mysterious numbers mel he said sharply the techs head snapped up at the urgency is there any passport that has the letters cc on the cover issued in blue a moment later cooper looked up from the state department archive yes as a matter of fact there is navy blue with interlocking cs at the top its the caribbean community passport therere about fifteen countries in is jamaica one yes he realized too theyd been thinking of the numbers as five hundred seventy and three hundred seventynine in fact there was another way to refer to them quick look up lexus suvs is there a model with a five seventy or a three seventynine in the designation this was even faster than the passport lets see yep the lx fiveseventy its a luxury get me luna on the phone now he didnt want to risk his own dialing which would have taken some time and might have been inaccurate he felt the sweat again but ignored it sí rodolfo its lincoln rhyme ah captain listen to me you are the target the office buildings a diversion the package delivered to logan the rectangular images on the drawing it was a diagram of the grounds of the jamaican embassy where you are right now the rectangles are the blast barriers and you drive a lexus lx fiveseventy yes you mean that was the five hundred seventy i think so and the watchmaker was given a jamaican passport to get into the compound is there a car parked nearby with three seven nine in the license plate i dont why yes its a mercedes with diplomatic plates clear the area now thats where the bomb is the mercedes he heard shouting in spanish the sound of footfalls hard breathing then a stunning explosion rhyme blinked at the startling noise that rattled the speakers of the phone commander are you there rodolfo more shouting static screams rodolfo after a long moment captain rhyme hello the man was shoutingprobably because hed been partially deafened by the blast commander are you all right hello a hissing noise moans gasping shouts sirens and more shouting cooper asked should we call and then qué are you there captain yes are you hurt rodolfo no no no bad injuries some cuts stunned you know the voice was gasping we climbed over barriers and got down on the other side i see people cut bleeding but no one is dead i think it would have killed me and the officers standing beside me how did you know ill go into that later commander where is the watchmaker wait a moment wait all right at the explosion he fled arturos men were distracted by the blastas he planned of course arturo said a car drove into the park and he got inside theyre moving south now we have officers following him thank you captain rhyme i cannot thank you enough but now i must go i will call as soon as we learn something inhaling deeply ignoring the headache and the sweat okay logan rhyme was thinking weve stopped you weve ruined your plan but we still dont have you not yet please rodolfo keep after him as he was thinking this his eyes strayed over the evidence charts in the galt case maybe this would be the conclusion of both of the operations the watchmaker would be apprehended in mexico and ray galt in an abandoned school near chinatown then his eyes settled on one bit of evidence in particular chinese herbs ginseng and wolfberry and another listing a substance that had been found in proximity to the herbs diesel fuel rhyme originally had though that the fuel was from a possible site of an attack a refinery perhaps but it occurred to him now that diesel fuel would also run motors like in an electric generator then another thought occurred to him mel the call are you all right im fine rhyme snapped you look flushed ignoring the comment he instructed find out the number of the cop who called in about galt being in the school the tech turned away and made a call a few minutes later he looked up funny i got the number from patrol but its out of service give it to me cooper did slowly rhyme typed it into a mobile phone database at the nypd it was listed as prepaid a cop with a prepaid mobile and now out of service no way and the school was in chinatown thats where galt had picked up the herbs but it wasnt a staging area or where he was hiding out it was a trap galt had run wires from a dieselpowered generator to kill whoever was searching for him and then pretending to be a cop he called in to report himself since the juice was off in the building sachs and the others wouldnt expect the electrocution danger theres no power its safe he had to warn them he started to press sachs on the speeddial panel on the computer but just at that moment his nagging headache swelled to a blinding explosion in his head lights like electric sparks a thousand electric sparks flashed across his vision sweat poured from his skin as the dysreflexia attack began in earnest lincoln rhyme whispered mel you have to call and then passed out chapter they made it to the back of the school without being seen sachs and pulaski were crouching looking for entrances and exits when they heard the first whimpers pulaski turned an alarmed face toward the detective she held up a finger and listened a womans voice it seemed she was in pain maybe held hostage being tortured the woman whod spotted galt someone else the sound faded then returned they listened for a long ten seconds amelia sachs gestured ron pulaski closer they were in the back of the school smelling urine rotting plasterboard mold the whimpering grew louder what the hell was galt doing maybe the victim had information he needed for his next attack no no no sachs was sure thats what the voice was saying or maybe galt had slipped farther from reality maybe hed kidnapped an algonquin worker and was torturing her satisfying his lust for revenge maybe she was in charge of the longdistance transmission lines oh no sachs thought could it be andi jessen herself she sensed pulaski staring at her with wide eyes no please the woman cried sachs hit transmit and radioed emergency service bo its amelia k go ahead k hes got a hostage here where are you hostage who female unknown roger that well be five minutes k hes hurting her im not going to wait ron and ire going in you have logistics just what i told you before galts in the middle of the building ground floor armed with a fortyfive acp nothings electrified here the powers off well thats the good news i guess out she disconnected and whispered to pulaski pointing now move well stage at the back door the young officer said sure okay an uneasy glance into the shadows of the building from which another moan floated out on the foul air sachs surveyed their route to the back door and loading dock the crumbling asphalt was littered with broken bottles and papers and cans noisy to traverse but they didnt have a choice she gestured pulaski forward they began to pick their way over the ground trying to be quiet though they couldnt avoid crunching glass beneath their shoes but as they approached they had some luck which sachs believed in even if lincoln rhyme did not somewhere nearby a noisy diesel engine rattled to life providing good covering sound sometimes you do catch a break sachs thought lord knows we could use one now chapter he wasnt going to lose rhyme thom reston had his boss out of the storm arrow chair and into a near standing position pinned against the wall in autonomic dysreflexia attacks the patient should be kept uprightthe books say sitting but rhyme had been in his chair when the vessels tightened en masse and the aide wanted to get him even more elevated to force the blood back toward the ground hed planned for occurrences like thiseven rehearsing when rhyme wasnt around since he knew his boss wouldnt have the patience for running mock emergencies now without even looking he grabbed a small vial of vasodilator medication popped the cap with one thumb and slipped the delicate pill under rhymes tongue mel help me here thom said the rehearsals didnt include a real patient thoms unconscious boss was presently pounds of dead weight dont think about it that way he thought mel cooper leapt forward supporting rhyme while thom hit speeddial button one on the phone he always made sure was charged and that had the best signal of any hed tested after two brief rings he was connected and in five long seconds he was speaking to a doctor in a private hospital an sci team was dispatched immediately the hospital rhyme went to regularly for specialized therapy and regular checkups had a large spinal cord injury department and two emergency response teams for situations where it would take too long to get a disabled patient to the hospital rhyme had had a dozen or so attacks over the years but this was the worst thom had ever seen he couldnt support rhyme and take his blood pressure simultaneously but he knew it was dangerously high his face was flushed he was sweating thom could only imagine the pain of the excruciating headache as the body tricked by the quadriplegia into believing it needed more blood and quickly pumped hard and constricted the vessels the condition could cause death and more troubling to rhyme a stroke which could mean even more paralysis in which case rhyme might very well dust off his longlaidtorest idea of assisted suicide which that damn arlen kopeski had brought up again what can i do cooper whispered the normally placid face dark with worry slick with sweat well just keep him upright thom examined rhymes eyes blank the aide snagged a second vial and administered another dose of clonidine no response thom stood helpless both he and cooper silent he thought of the past years with rhyme theyd fought sometimes bitterly but thom had been a caregiver all his working life and knew not to take the anger personally knew not to take it at all he gave as much as he got hed been fired by rhyme and had quit in nearly equal measure but hed never believed the separation between the two of them would last more than a day and it never had looking at rhyme wondering where the hell the medics were he was considering was this my fault dysreflexia is frequently caused by the irritation that comes from a full bladder or bowel since rhyme didnt know when he needed to relieve himself thom noted the intake of food and liquid and judged the intervals had he gotten it wrong he didnt think so but maybe the stress of running the double case had exacerbated the irritation he should have checked more often i shouldve exercised better judgment i shouldve been firmer to lose rhyme would be to lose the finest criminalist in the city if not the world and to lose countless victims because their killers would go undetected to lose rhyme would be to lose one of his closest friends yet he remained calm caregivers learn this early hard and fast decisions cant be made in panic then the color of rhymes face stabilized and they got him into the wheelchair again they couldnt have kept him up much longer anyway lincoln can you hear me no response then a moment later the mans head lolled and he whispered something lincoln youre going to be all right dr metz is sending a team another whisper its all right lincoln youll be all right in a faint voice rhyme said you have to tell her lincoln stay still sachs cooper said shes at the scene the school where you sent her shes not back yet you have to tell sachs the voice faded i will lincoln ill tell her as soon as she calls in thom said cooper added you dont want to disturb her now shes moving in on galt tell her rhymes eyes rolled back in his head and he went out again thom angrily looked out the window as if that would speed the arrival of the ambulance but all he saw were people strolling by on healthy legs people jogging people bicycling through the park none of them with an apparent care in the world chapter ron pulaski glanced at sachs who was peeking through a window at the back of the school she held up a finger squinting and jockeying for position to try to get a better look at where galt was the whimpering was hard to hear from this vantage point since that diesel truck or engine was close just on the other side of a fence then came a louder moan sachs turned back and nodded at the door whispering were going to get her i want crossfire coverage somebody up somebody down you want to go through here or up the fire escape pulaski glanced to their right where a rusty metal ladder led up to a platform and an open window he knew there was no chance they were electrified amelia had checked but he really didnt want to go that way then he thought about his mistake at galts apartment about stanley palmer the man who might die who even if he lived might never be the same again he said ill go up you sure yes remember we want him alive if at all possible if hes set another trap it might have a timer on it and well need him to tell us where it is and when its going to activate pulaski nodded crouching he made his way over the filthy asphalt strewn with all sorts of garbage concentrate he told himself youve got a job to do youre not going to get spooked again youre not going to make a mistake as he moved silently he found he was in fact a lot less spooked than before and then he wasnt spooked at all ron pulaski was angry galt had gotten sick well sorry well too goddamn bad hell pulaski had had his head trauma and he didnt blame anybody for it just like lincoln rhyme didnt sit around and mope and galt might very well be fine all the new cancer treatments and techniques and everything but here this whiny little shit was taking out his unhappiness on the innocent and jesus lord what was he doing to that woman inside she mustve had information galt needed or maybe she was a doctor whod missed a diagnosis or something and he was getting revenge on her too at this thought he moved a little more quickly he glanced back and saw sachs waiting beside a halfopen door glock drawn and pointed down extended in a combat grip the anger growing pulaski came to a solid brick wall where he couldnt be seen he sped up further heading toward the fire escape ladder it was old and most of the paint had worn off replaced by rust he paused at the puddle of standing water surrounding the concrete around the base of the ladder water electricity but there was no electricity and anyway there was no way to avoid the water he sloshed through it ten feet away looking up picking the best window to go through hoping the stairs and platform wouldnt clank galt couldnt be more than forty feet from them still the sound of the diesel engine would cover up most squeaks five feet pulaski examined his heart and found its beat steady he was going to make lincoln rhyme proud of him again hell he was going to collar this sick bastard himself he reached for the ladder and the next thing he knew he heard a snap and every muscle in his body contracted at once in his mind he was looking at all the light of heaven before his vision dissolved to yellow then black chapter standing together behind the school amelia sachs and lon sellitto watched the place being swept by esu a trap the lieutenant said right she replied grimly galt hooked up a big generator in a shed behind the school he started it and then left it was connected to the metal doors and the fire escape the fire escape thats the way pulaski was going she nodded poor kid he an esu officer a tall african american interrupted them weve finished the sweep detective lieutenant its clean the whole place we didnt touch anything inside like you asked a digital recorder she asked thats what im betting he used thats right detective sounded like a scene from a tv show or something and a flashlight hanging by a cord so it looked like somebody was holding it no hostage no galt nobody at all ill run the scenes in a minute the officer asked there was no portable called it in right sellitto muttered was galt probably on a prepaid mobile id bet ill check it and he just did thisa wave at the schoolto kill some of us thats right sachs said somberly the esu officer grimaced and headed off to gather his team sachs had immediately called rhyme to give him the news about the school and about ron pulaski but curiously the phone went right to voice mail maybe something had heated up in the case or in the watchmaker situation in mexico a medic was walking toward her head down picking his way through the trash the yard behind the school looked like a beach after a garbage spill sachs walked forward to meet him you free now detective he asked her sure she followed him around to the side of the building where the ambulances waited there sitting on a concrete stoop was ron pulaski head in his hands she paused took a deep breath and walked up to him im sorry ron he was massaging his arm flexing his fingers no maam he blinked at his own formality grinned i should say thank you if thered been any other way i wouldve done it but i couldnt shout i assumed galt was still inside and had his weapon i figured fifteen minutes earlier as sachs had waited at the door shed decided to use sommerss current detector once more to double check that there was no electricity in the school to her horror she saw the metal door she was inches away from contained volts and the concrete she was standing on was soaking wet she realized that whether or not galt was inside hed rigged wires to the metal infrastructure of the school probably from a dieselpowered generator that was the racket theyd heard if galt had rigged the door he would have rigged the fire escape as well shed leapt to her feet then and charged after pulaski as he approached the ladder she didnt dare call his name even in a whisper because if galt was in the school hed hear and start shooting so shed used taser on pulaski she carried an x model which fired probes that delivered both high and lowvoltage charges the x had a range of about thirtyfive feet and when she saw that she couldnt tackle the officer in time shed hit him with the double probes the neuromuscular incapacitation dropped him where he stood hed fallen hard on his shoulder but thank god hadnt struck his head again sachs dragged him gasping and quivering to cover shed found and shut the generator off just as the esu officers arrived blowing open the chain on the front gate and storming the school you look a little woozy was quite a rush pulaski said breathing deeply she said take it easy im okay im helping the scene he blinked like a drunk i mean helping you search the scene youre up for it long as i dont move too fast but listen keep that thing of yours that box that charlie sommers gave you keep it handy okay im not touching anything until you go over it the first thing they did was walk the grid around the generator behind the school pulaski collected and bagged the wires that had carried the charge to the door and fire escapes sachs herself searched around the generator it was a big unit several feet high and about three long a placard on the side reported that its maximum output was watts producing amps about four hundred times what was needed to kill you nodding at the unit could you pack it up and get it to rhymes she asked the crime scene team from queens whod just joined them it weighed about two hundred pounds you bet amelia well get it there asap she said to pulaski lets walk the grid inside they were heading into the school when sachss phone rang rhyme popped up on caller id about time she said goodnaturedly as she answered ive got some amelia it was thoms voice but the tone was one shed never heard before you better come back here you better come now chapter breathing hard sachs hurried up the ramp and pushed open the door to rhymes townhouse jogging across the foyer boots slapping hard she ran into the den to the right opposite the lab thom looked toward her from where he was standing over lincoln rhyme in his wheelchair eyes closed face pale and damp between them was one of rhymes doctors a solidly built african american a former football star in college dr ralston she said breathing hard he nodded amelia finally rhymes eyes opened ah sachs the voice was weak how are you no no how are you im fine and the rookie he nearly had a problem but it worked out okay rhyme said in a stiff voice it was a generator right yes how did you know did crime scene call no i figured it out diesel fuel and herbs from chinatown the fact that there didnt seem to be any juice in the school i figured out it was a trap but had a little problem before i could call didnt matter rhyme she said i figured it out too and didnt tell him how close pulaski had come to getting electrocuted well good i good she understood that he was thinking how hed failed how hed nearly gotten one or both of them injured or killed normally hed have been furious a tantrum might have ensued hed want a drink hed insult people hed revel in sarcasm all of which was directed toward himself of course as she and thom knew very well but this was different there was something about his eyes something she didnt like one bit oddly for someone with such a severe disability there was rarely anything vulnerable about lincoln rhyme now with this failure he radiated weakness she found she had to look away and turned to the doctor who said hes out of danger blood pressures down he then turned to rhyme even more than most patients spinal cord injury victims hate being discussed in the third person which happens a lot stay in the chair and out of bed as much as you can and make sure bladder and bowel are taken care of loose clothes and socks rhyme nodded why did it happen now stress probably combined with pressure somewhere internally shoes garments you know how dysreflexia works mostly its a mystery how long was i out thom said forty minutes off and on he rocked his head back in the chair forty he whispered sachs understood hed be replaying his failure which had nearly cost her and pulaski their lives now he was staring toward the lab wheres the evidence i came here first rons on his way we needed some people from queens to get the generator it weighs a couple of hundred pounds rons coming thats right she confirmed noting that shed just told him this and wondering if the episode had made him disoriented maybe the doctor had given him a painkiller dysreflexia is accompanied by excruciating headaches good hell be here soon ron a hesitant glance at thom any minute now she said dr ralston said lincoln id rather you took it easy for the rest of the day rhyme was hesitating looking down was he actually going to give in to a request like this but he said in a soft voice im sorry doctor i really cant theres a case its important the grid thing the terrorists yes i hope you dont mind his eyes were downcast im sorry i really have to work it sachs and thom exchanged glances rhymes apologetic mien was atypical to put it mildly and again the vulnerability in his eyes i know its important lincoln i cant force you to do anything just remember what i said stay upright and avoid any kinds of pressure on your body inside and out i guess it wont do any good to say avoid stress not with this madman on the loose thank you and thank you thom the aide blinked and nodded uneasily again though rhyme was hesitating staring down not driving into the parlor lab with all the speed the storm arrow could muster which hed be doing under other circumstances and even when the front door to the townhouse opened and they could hear pulaski and the other crime scene technicians hurrying in with the evidence rhyme remained where he was staring down li sachs found herself saying and braking her words to a halttheir superstition again rhyme you want to go into the lab yes sure but still staring down not moving alarmed she wondered if he was having another attack then he swallowed and moved the controller of the wheelchair his face melted with relief and she understood what had been happening rhyme was worriedterrifiedthat the attack had caused yet more damage that perhaps even the rudimentary mobility hed achieved in his right hand and fingers had been erased thats what hed been staring at his hand but apparently thered been no damage come on sachs he said though softly weve got work to do chapter the pool parlor was looking like a crack house rc decided hed talk to his father about it the thirtyyearold pressed his pale hands around his beer bottle watching the games at the pool tables snuck a cigarette and blew the smoke toward the exhaust vent that smoking law was fucking stupid his father said the socialists in washington were to blame they didnt mind sending kids to get killed in places with names you couldnt pronounce but they had to say fuck you no smoking eyes on the pool tables the fast one on the end might be troublethere was serious money on itbut stipp had the baseball bat behind the bar and he liked to swing speaking of which goddamn mets he grabbed the remote boston didnt make him feel any better then he put on the news about the crazy man screwing around with electricity rcs brother was handy and did a fair amount of electrical work but wiring always scared him and now people around town were getting fried you hear about that shit he asked stipp yeah which shit is that he had a cast eye or one that didnt look right at you if thats what a cast eye was about the electricity thing some dude hooking up wires at that hotel you touched the door handle and zzzzzzz youre dead oh that shit stipp coughed a funky laugh like the electric chair like that only it could be stairs or a puddle or those metal doors on the sidewalk elevators to the basements you walk on them and get zapped i guess fuck and you push those metal walk buttons in the crosswalks thats it youre fucked whats he doing it for fuck knows the electric chair you piss your pants and your hair catches fire you know that thats what kills you sometimes the fire burns you to death most states got injection stipp frowned you probably still piss your pants rc was eyeing janie in her tight blouse and trying to remember when his wife was coming by to pick up the grocery money when the door opened and a couple of people came in two guys in delivery company uniforms maybe early shifters which was good because theyd be spending money now that their day was over then right behind them a homeless guy pushed inside too fuck the black guy in filthy clothes had abandoned a grocery cart of empties on the sidewalk and more or less run in here he was now turning his back staring out the window scratching his leg and then his head under a disgusting cap rc caught the bartenders eye and shook his head no hey mister stipp called help you something weird out there the man muttered he talked to himself for a moment then louder something i saw something i don like and he gave a highpitched laugh that rc thought was pretty weird in itself yeah well take it outside okay you see that the bum asked no one come on buddy but the man tottered to the bar sat down spent a moment digging out some damp bills and a ton of change he counted the coins carefully sorry sir i think youve had plenty i aint had no drink you see that guy the guy with the wire wire rc and stipp eyed each other crazy shit going down in this town he turned his mad eyes on rc fucker was right outside by that you know lamppost he was doing something playing with the wires you hear whats going down around here peoples gettin their asses fried rc wandered to the window past the guy who stank so bad he felt like puking but he looked out and saw the lamppost was that a wire attached he couldnt tell was that terrorist around here the lower east side well why not if he wanted to kill innocent citizens this was as good a place as any rc said to the homeless guy listen man get outa here i wanna drink well youre not getting a drink eyes outside again rc was thinking he did see some cables or wires or shit what was going on was somebody fucking with the bar itself rc was thinking of all the metal in the place the bar footrest the sinks the doorknobs the register hell the urinal was metal if you peed would the current run up the stream to your dick you dont unnerstand dont unnerstand the homeless guy was wailing getting even weirder it aint safe out there look outside aint safe that asshole with the wires ima staying in here till it safe rc the bartender janie the pool players and the delivery guys were all staring out the window now the games had been suspended rcs interest in janie had shriveled not safe man gimme a vodka and coke out im not telling you again you dont think i can pay you i got fucking money here what you call this the mans odor had wafted throughout the bar it was repulsive sometimes you burn to death the wire man the wire man get the fuck out somebodys going to steal your fucking grocery cart i aint going out there you cant make me go i aint getting burnt up out no the disgusting asshole slammed his fist down on the bar you aint service you aint serving me he corrected cause im black rc saw a flash on the street he gasped then he relaxed it was just a reflection off the windshield of a passing car getting spooked like that made him all the angrier we aint servicing you cause you stink and youre a prick out the man had assembled all his wet bills and sticky coins he mustve had twenty dollars he muttered you the prick you throwing me out and ill go out there and get burnt up just take your money and get out stipp picked up the bat and displayed it the man didnt care you throw me out ima tell everbody what goes on here i know what goes on here you think i dont i seen you looking at miss titty over there an shame on you you got a wedding ring on whatta mrs prick think bout rc grabbed the guys disgusting jacket with both hands when the black guy winced in panic and cried don hit me im a you know a cop im a agent youre no fucking law rc drew back for a head butt in a fraction of a second the fbi id appeared in his face and the glock wasnt far behind oh fuck me rc muttered one of the two white guys whod come in just before him said duly witnessed fred he attempted to cause bodily harm after you identified yourself as a law enforcement officer we get back to work now thanks gentlemen ill take it from here chapter in the corner of the pool parlor fred dellray sat on a wobbly chair the back turned around facing the youngster it was a little less intimidatingthe back of the chair in between thembut that was okay because the agent didnt need rc to be so afraid he couldnt think straight though he needed him to be a little afraid you know what i am rc the sigh shook the skinny kids entire body no i mean i know youre an fbi agent and youre undercover but i dont know why youre hassling me dellray kept right on going what i am is a walking lie detector i been in the business so long i can look at a girl and hear her say lets go home and we can fuck and i know shes thinking hell be so drunk by the time we get there i can just get some sleep i was just protecting myself you were intimidating me fuck yes i was intimidating you and you can just close your lips and not say a word and wait for a lawyer to come by and hold your hand you can even call the federal building and complain about me but either which way words going to get to your daddy in singsing that his kid hassled an fbi agent and hes going to think that running this shithole bar the one thing he left to you to keep an eye on while hes inside and hoped you didnt fuck up you fucked up dellray watched him squirm so we all together on that whatta you want and just to make sure the back of the chair didnt make rc feel too much at ease dellray slapped his hand on the kids thigh and squeezed hard ouch whyd you do that you ever been polygraphed rc no dads lawyer said never its a rhetorical question dellray said even though it wasnt it was just a way to burst a little intimidation over rcs head like a tear gas grenade at a protest the agent gave another squeeze for good measure he couldnt help thinking hey mcdaniel cant do this while youre eavesdropping in the cloud zone can you whichs too bad cause this is a lot more fun fred dellray was here thanks to one person serena the favor that shed asked had nothing to do with cleaning the basement it was about getting off his ass shed led him downstairs into the messy storeroom where he kept his outfits from his days as an undercover agent she found one in particular sealed up in the same kind of plastic bag that you used for wedding dresses it was the homeless drunk costume suitably perfumed with mold and sufficient human odorand a little cat peeto get a confession just by sitting down next to a suspect serena had said you lost your snitch quit feeling sorry for yourself and go pick up his trail if you cant find him then find out what he found dellray had smiled hugged her and gone to change as he left serena said whoa you smell bad son and gave him a playful swat on the butt a gesture very very few people had ever bestowed on fred dellray and he hit the street william brent was good at hiding tracks but dellray was good at finding them one thing hed learned encouragingly was that maybe brent had been on the job after all dellray found by tracing his movements that the ci had come up with a lead to galt or to justice for the earth or something relevant to the attacks the man had been working hard tracking deep undercover finally hed learned brent had come here to this dark pool parlor where apparently the ci had sought and ideally gotten important information from the young man whose knee dellray had just visegripped dellray now said so my cards on the table are we havin fun yet jesus a fierce grimace that mightve sent rcs cheeks into a cramp just tell me what you want thats the spirit son a picture of william brent appeared dellray watched his face closely and a flash of recognition popped into rcs eyes before it dissolved he asked the kid instantly whatd he pay you the blink of a pause told dellray both that brent had paid him and that the amount he was about to say would be considerably less than what really changed hands one large damn brent was being pretty fucking generous with dellrays money rc said with a bit of whine it wasnt drugs man im not into that course you are but i dont care he was here about information and now now now i need to know what he asked and what you told him dellray limbered up his lengthy fingers again okay ill tell you billhe said his name was bill rc pointed at the picture bill is as good as any keep going friend he heard somebody was staying here in the hood some guy whod come to town recent was driving a white van carrying a piece a big fucking fortyfive he clipped somebody dellray gave nothing away whod he kill and why he didnt know name didnt have one the agent didnt need a polygraph rc was doing just fine with the dharmic quality of honesty come on rc my friend what else about him white van just came to town big fortyfive clipped somebody for reasons unknown maybe kidnapped em before he killed em was somebody you didnt fuck with that kind of went without saying rc continued so this bill or whoever heard i was connected you know hooked into the wire you know the wire yeah not what that assholes using to kill people i mean the word on the street oh thats what you mean dellray said but rc floated below irony and you are connected arent you son you know all bout the hood right youre the ethel mertz of the lower east side who keep going okay well like i had heard something i like to know whos around what kind of shit could be going down anyway id heard about this guy was just like bill said and i sent him over to where hes staying thats it thats all dellray believed him gimme the address he did a decrepit street not far away its the basement apartment okay sall i need for now you i wont tell daddy anything dontcha worry less youre fucking with me im not no fred really when dellray was at the door rc called it wasnt what you think the agent turned it really was cause you smelt bad thats why we werent going to serve you not because youre black five minutes later dellray was approaching the block rc had told him about hed debated calling in backup but decided not to quite yet working street required finesse not sirens and takedown teams or tucker mcdaniel dellray loped through the streets dodging the dense crowds thinking as he often did its the middle of the day what the hell do these people do for work then he turned two corners and eased into an alley so he could approach the apartment in question from the back he looked quickly up the dim rotsmelling canyon not far away was a white guy in a cap and baggy shirt sweeping cobblestones dellray counted addresses he was directly behind the place where rc had sent william brent okay thiss weird the agent thought he started forward through the alley the sweeper turned his mirrored sunglasses his way and then went back to sweeping dellray stopped near him frowning and looking around trying to make sense of this finally the sweeper asked the fuckre you doing well ill tell you dellray offered one thing im doing is looking at an nypd undercover cop who for some fuckedup reason is trying to blend by sweeping cobblestones in a hood where they stopped sweeping cobblestones oh about a hundred and thirty years ago dellray displayed his id dellray i heard of you then defensively the cop said im just doing what they told me its a stakeout stakeout why what is this place you dont know dellray rolled his eyes when the cop told him dellray froze but only momentarily a few seconds later he was ripping away his smelly undercover costume and dumping it in a waste bin as he started sprinting for the subway he noted the cops startled reaction and supposed it could have come from one of two things the striptease act itself or the fact that underneath the disgusting outfit he was wearing a kelly green velour tracksuit he supposed it was a little of both chapter rodolfo tell me we may have good news soon lincoln arturo diazs men have followed mr watchmaker into gustavo madero its a delegación in the north of the cityyou would say borough like your bronx much of it is not so nice and arturo believes thats where the associates helping him are but do you know where he is they think so theyve found the car he escaped inthey were no more than three or four minutes behind but could not get through the traffic to stop his car hes been spotted in a large apartment building near the center of the delegación its being sealed off we will do a complete search i will call back with more information soon rhyme disconnected the call and struggled to keep his impatience and concern at bay he would believe that the watchmaker had actually been arrested when he saw the man arraigned in a new york court he wasnt encouraged when he called kathryn dance to tell her the latest and she replied gustavo madero its a lousy neighborhood lincoln she said i was down in mexico city for an extradition we drove through the area i was really glad the car didnt break down even with two armed federal officers next to me its a rabbit warren easy to hide in but the good news is that the residents absolutely wont want the police there if luna moves a busload of riot cops in the localsll give up an american pretty fast he said hed keep her posted and disconnected the fatigue and fogginess from the dysreflexia attack ebbed in once more and he rested his head on the back of the storm arrow come on stay sharp he commanded refusing to accept anything less than percent from himself just as he did from everybody else but he wasnt feeling that measure not at all then he glanced up to see ron pulaski at the evidence table and thoughts of the watchmaker faded the young officer was moving pretty slowly rhyme regarded him with concern the jolt of the taser had been pretty powerful apparently but that concern was accompanied by another emotion one hed been feeling for the past hour guilt it had been exclusively rhymes fault that pulaskiand sachs toohad come as close as they had to being electrocuted by galts trap at the school sachs had downplayed the incident pulaski too laughing hed said she tased me bro which apparently was some kind of joke drawing a smile from mel cooper but rhyme didnt get it nor was he in a mood that was at all humorous he was confused and disoriented and not just from the medical emergency he was having trouble shaking his sense of failure from letting down sachs and the rookie he forced himself to focus on the evidence thatd been collected from the school some bags of trace some electronics and most important the generator lincoln rhyme loved big bulky pieces of equipment to move them took a lot of physical contact and that meant such objects picked up significant prints fibers hair sweat and skin cells as well as other trace the generator was attached to a wheeled cart but it would still have taken some grappling to get it into place ron pulaski got a phone call he glanced at rhyme and then headed into the corner of the room to take it despite his groggy demeanor his face began to brighten he disconnected and stood for a moment looking out the window though he didnt know the substance of the conversation rhyme wasnt surprised to see the young man walk toward him with a confessional cast to his eyes i have to tell you something lincoln his glance took in lon sellitto too yeah rhyme asked distractedly offering a word that would have earned the young officer a glare if hed used it i kind of wasnt honest with you earlier kind of okay i wasnt what about scanning the evidence boards and the profile of ray galt he said the dna results i know i didnt need to get them i used that as an excuse i went to see stan palmer who the man in the hospital the one i ran into in the alley rhyme was impatient the evidence beckoned but this was important it seemed he nodded then asked hes okay they still dont know but what im saying is first im sorry i didnt tell the truth i was going to but it just seemed i dont know unprofessional it was but theres more see when i was at the hospital i asked the nurse for his social security number and personal information guess what he was a con did three years in attica got a long sheet really sachs asked yep i mean yes and theres active paper on him hes wanted rhyme mused warrants for what sellitto asked assault receiving stolen burglary the rumpled cop barked a laugh you backed into a collar like literally he laughed again and looked at rhyme who didnt join in the fun the criminalist said so thats why youre so chipper im not happy i hurt him it was still a screwup but if you had to run over somebody its better him than a father of four well yeah pulaski said rhyme had more to say on the subject but this wasnt the time or place the important thing is youre not distracted anymore right no good now if weve got the soap opera out of the way maybe we can all get back to work he looked at the digital clock pm rhyme felt the time pressure humming like well electricity in a hightension wire they had the perps identity they had his address but they had no solid leads to his whereabouts it was then that the doorbell rang thom appeared a moment later with tucker mcdaniel minus his underling rhyme knew immediately what he was going to say everybody in the room probably did another demand rhyme asked yes and hes really upped the ante this time chapter whats the deadline sellitto asked sixthirty tonight gives us a little over three hours whats he want this demands even crazier than the first two can i use a computer rhyme nodded toward it the asac typed and in a moment the letter appeared on the screen rhymes vision was blurred he blinked into clarity and leaned toward the monitor to algonquin consolidated power and light and ceo andi jessen at about pm yesterday a remote control switch routed current from a spot network distribution system at an office building at w th street totaling volts to the floor of the elevator which had a return line connected through the control panel in the car when the car stopped before it got to the ground floor a passenger touched the panel to hit the alarm button the circuit was closed and individuals inside died twice ive asked you to show good faith by reducing output of supply and twice you have refused if youd done what i reasonably requested you would never have brought such suffering into the lives of the people you call your customers you wantonly disregarded my requests and somebody else paid the price for that in when thomas a edison died his coworkers respectfully requested that all the power in the city be shut off for sixty seconds to mark the passing of the man who had created the grid and brought light to millions the city declined i am now making the same requestnot out of respect for the man who created the grid but for the people who are being destroyed because of it those who are made sick from the power lines and from the pollution from burning coal and from radiation those who lose their houses from the earthquakes caused by geothermal drilling and damming our natural rivers those cheated by companies like enron the list is endless only unlike i am insisting you shut down the entire northeastern interconnection for one day beginning at pm today if you do this people will see that they do not need to use as much power as they do they will see that it is their greed and gluttony that motivates them which you are happy to play into why for profits of course if you ignore me this time the consequences will be far far greater than the small incidents of yesterday and the day before the loss of life far worse r galt mcdaniel said absurd therell be civil chaos riots looting the governor and president are adamant no caving in wheres the letter rhyme asked what youre seeing there it was an email whod he send it to andi jessenpersonally and the company itself their security office email account traceable no used a proxy in europe hes going for a mass attack it seems mcdaniel looked up washingtons involved now in a big way those senatorsthe ones working with the president on renewable energyare coming to town early theyre going to meet with the mayor the assistant director of the bureaus coming in too gary nobles coordinating everything weve got even more agents and troops out on the streets and the chief has mobilized a thousand more nypd officers he rubbed his eyes lincoln weve got the manpower and the firepower but we need to know some idea of where to look for the next attack whatve you got we need something concrete mcdaniel was reminding rhyme hed let the criminalist take the case with the assurance that his condition wouldnt slow the investigation from entrance to exit rhyme had gotten what he wantedthe investigation and yet he hadnt found the man in fact the very condition that hed assured mcdaniel wasnt a problem had nearly gotten sachs and pulaski killed along with a dozen esu officers he gazed back to the agents smooth face and predators eyes and said evenly what ive got is more evidence to look at mcdaniel hesitated then waved his hand in an ambiguous gesture all right go ahead rhyme had already turned away to cooper with a nod toward the digital recorder on which had been recorded the sounds of the victim moaning audio analysis with gloved hands the tech plugged the unit into his computer and typed a moment later reading the sine curves on the screen he said the volume and signal quality suggest it was recorded from a tv program cable brand of the recorder sanoya chinese he typed some commands and then studied a new database sold in about ten thousand stores in the country no serial number anything more no prints on it or other trace except more taramasalata the generator cooper and sachs went over it carefully while tucker mcdaniel made phone calls and fidgeted in the corner the generator turned out to be a power plus model made by the williamsjonas manufacturing company in new jersey whered this one come from rhyme asked lets find out sachs said two phone calls laterto the local sales office of the manufacturer and the general contractor that the company referred them torevealed that it had been stolen from a job site in manhattan there were no leads in the theft according to the local precinct the construction project had no security cameras got some trace thats curious cooper announced he ran it through the gcms the machine hummed away getting something cooper was bending forward over the screen hmm this would normally have drawn an acerbic what does that mean glance from rhyme but he still felt tired and shaken from the attack he waited patiently for the tech to explain finally dont think ive seen it before a significant amount of quartz and some ammonium chloride ratios about ten to one rhyme knew the answer instantly copper cleaner copper wires pulaski suggested galt is cleaning them good idea rookie but im not sure he didnt think electricians cleaned wires besides he explained mostly its used for cleaning copper on buildings what else mel some stone dust you dont usually see in manhattan architectural terracotta cooper was now looking into the eyepieces of a microscope he added and some granules that look like white marble rhyme blurted the police riots of fiftyseven thats eighteen fiftyseven what mcdaniel asked a few years ago the delgado case oh sure sachs said sellitto asked did we work it rhymes grimace conveyed his message it didnt matter who worked a case or when crime scene officershell every officer on the forcehad to be aware of all major cases in the city present and past the more you put into the brain the more likely you were to make connections that solved your crime homework he explained a few years ago steven delgado a paranoid schizophrenic planned a series of murders to mimic deaths that occurred during the infamous new york city police riots of the madman picked the same locale as the carnage years earlier city hall park he was captured after his first kill because rhyme had traced him to an apartment on the upper west side where hed left trace that included copper cleaner terracotta residue from the woolworth building and white marble dust from the city courthouse which was undergoing renovations then as now you think hes going to hit city hall mcdaniel asked urgently the phone in his hand drooping i think theres a connection thats all i can say put it on the board and well think about it what else do you have from the generator more hair cooper announced holding up a pair of tweezers blond about nine inches long he slipped it under the microscope and slid the specimen tray up and down slowly not dyed natural blond no color degradation and not desiccated id say its from somebody younger than fifty also refraction variation on one end i could run it through the chromatograph but im ninety percent sure its hair spray right woman probably anything else another hair brown shorter crew cut also under fifty so rhyme said not galts maybe weve got our justice for the earth connection or maybe some other players keep going the other news wasnt so encouraging the flashlight he couldve bought in a thousand places no trace or prints the string was generic too the cable he used to wire the doors at the school bennington the same hes been using all along bolts are generic but similar to the others eye on the generator rhyme was aware his thoughts were spinning dizzily part of this was the attack hed experienced a short time ago but some of it had to do with the case itself something was wrong pieces of the puzzle were missing the answer had to be in the evidence and just as important what wasnt in the evidence rhyme now scanned the whiteboards trying to stay calm this wasnt to stave off another episode of dysreflexia per doctors orders it was because nothing made you blind faster than

the evidenceas much else in this casejust didnt add up but he was wrong in that the key to unraveling the mystery wasnt to be found on the charts surrounding him rather it came blustering into the lab just now accompanied by thom in the form of a tall lanky sweating man skin black clothing bright green catching his breath fred dellray nodded fast to everybody in the room then proceeded to ignore them as he strode up to rhyme i need to throw something out lincoln and you gotta tell me if it works or not fred mcdaniel began what the hell lincoln dellray persisted sure fred go ahead what do you think of the theory that ray galts a fall guy hes dead been dead for a couple of days i think its somebody else whos put this whole thing together from the beginning rhyme paused for a momentthe disorientation from the attack was slowing his analysis of dellrays idea but finally he offered a faint smile and said what do i think its brilliant thats what chapter tucker mcdaniels response however was ridiculous the whole investigations based on galt sellitto ignored him whats your theory fred i want to hear it my ci a guy named william brent he was following up on a lead he was on to somebody who was connected withmaybe behindthe grid attacks but then he vanished i found out that brent was interested in somebody whod just come to town was armed with a fortyfive and was driving a white van hed recently kidnapped and killed somebody hed been staying at an address on the lower east side for the past couple of days i found out where it turned out to be a crime scene crime scene rhyme asked you betcha it was ray galts apartment sachs said but galt didnt just come to town hes lived here all his adult life exactly so whats this brent have to say mcdaniel asked skeptically oh he aint tellin anybody anything cause yesterday he was in the alley behind galts and got himself run over by an nypd patrolman hes in the hospital still unconscious oh my god ron pulaski whispered st vincents right pulaski said in a weak voice that was me who hit him you dellray asked voice rising the officer said but no it cant be the guy i hit his names stanley palmer yep yep thats him palmer was one of brents covers you mean he didnt have warrants on him he didnt do time for attempted murder aggravated assault dellray shook his head the rap sheet was fake ron we put it into the system so anybody who checkedd find out he had a record the worst we got him for was conspiracy and then i turned him brents a standup guy he snitched for the money mostly one of the best in the business but what was he doing with groceries in the alley undercover technique a lot of us use you cart around groceries or shopping bags you look less suspicious baby carriage is the best with a doll in it course oh pulaski muttered i oh but rhyme couldnt be concerned about his officers psyche dellray had raised a credible theory that explained the inconsistencies that rhyme had been sensing in the case all along hed been looking for a wolf when he should have been hunting a fox but could it be was somebody else behind the attacks and galt just a fall guy mcdaniel looked doubtful but thereve been witnesses his brown eyes locked on his bosss blue ones dellray said are they reliable what do you mean fred an edge now in the slick asacs voice or were they people who believed it was galt because we told the media thats who it was and the media told the world rhyme added you wear safety goggles you wear a hard hat and a company uniform if youre the same race and same build and youve got a fake name badge with your own picture on it and galts name sure it could work sachs too was considering the evidence the lineman in the tunnel joey barzan said he identified him because of the name badge hed never met galt and it was real dark down there and the security chief bernie wahl rhyme added never saw him when he delivered the second demand note the perp got him from behind rhyme said and galt was the one he kidnapped and killed like your ci found out thats right dellray said but the evidence mcdaniel persisted rhyme stared at the board shaking his head shit how could ive missed it what rhyme the boots in galts apartment a pair of albertsonfenwicks but they matched pulaski said of course they matched but thats not the point rookie the boots were in galts apartment if they were his they wouldntve been there hed be wearing them workers wouldnt have two pairs of new boots theyre expensive and employees usually have to buy their own no the real perp found out what kind galt wore and bought another pair same with the bolt cutter and hacksaw the real perp left them in galts apartment to find the rest of the evidence implicating galt like the hair in the coffee shop across from the substation on fiftyseventh street that was planted too look at the blog posting rhyme continued nodding at the documents pulaski had wrested from galts printer my story is typical of many i was a lineman and later a troubleman like a supervisor for many years working for several power companies in direct contact with lines carrying over one hundred thousand volts it was the electromagnetic fields created by the transmission lines that are uninsulated that led to my leukemia i am convinced in addition it has been proven that power lines attract aerosol particles that lead to lung cancer among others but this is something that the media doesnt talk about we need to make all the power companies but more important the public aware of these dangers because the companies wont do anything voluntarily why should they if the people stopped using electricity by even half we could save thousands of lives a year and make them the companies more responsible in turn they would create safer ways to deliver electricity and stop destroying the earth too people you need to take matters into your own hands raymond galt now look at the first couple of paragraphs of the first demand letter at around am yesterday morning there was an arc flash incident at the mh substation on w street in manhattan this happened by securing a bennington cable and bus bar to a postbreaker line with two split bolts by shutting down four substations and raising the breaker limit at mh an overload of close to two hundred thousand volts caused the flash this incident was entirely your fault and due to your greed and selfishness this is typical of the industry and it is reprehensable enron destroyed the financial lives of people your company destroys our physical lives and the life of the earth by exploiting electricity without regard for its consequences you are destroying our world you insideously work your way into our lives like a virus until we are dependent on what is killing us whats distinctive rhyme asked sachs shrugged pulaski pointed out no misspellings in the blog true rookie but thats not my point the computers spell checker would have picked up any mistakes in the blog and corrected them im talking about word choice sachs nodded vigorously sure the blog language is a lot simpler exactly the blog was written by galt himself the letters were transcribed by himit was his handwritingbut they were dictated by the real perp the man who kidnapped galt and forced him to write what he was saying the perp used his own language which galt wasnt familiar with so he misspelled the big words in the blog he never used any words like reprehensible and in the other letters therere similar misspellings in the last letterno misspellings because the perp wrote that himself in an email sellitto paced the floor creaked remember what parker kincaid said our handwriting guy that the letter was written by somebody who was emotional upsetbecause he was being threatened to take the dictation thatd make anybody upset and he also forced galt to handle the switches and hard hat so theyd have his prints on them rhyme nodded in fact ill bet the blog postings were real hell they were probably how the perp picked galt in the first place hed read how angry galt was about the power industry a moment later his eyes took in the physical evidence itself the cables the nuts and bolts and the generator he gazed at it for a moment then he called up word processing software on his computer and began to type his neck and temple throbbedthis time though not as a prelude to an attack but a sign that his heart was pounding hard with excitement hunt lust foxes not wolves well mcdaniel muttered ignoring an incoming phone call if thats right i dont think it is but if its right who the hells behind it typing slowly the criminalist continued lets think about the facts well discount all the evidence specifically implicating galt for the moment lets assume its been planted so the short blond hair is out the tools are out the boots are out his uniform gear bag hard hat friction ridges all of those are out okay so what else do we have weve got a queens connectionthe taramasalata he tried to destroy the access door we found it on so we know that evidence is real weve got the handgun so the real perp has access to weapons weve got a geographic connection to the city hall areathe trace we found in the generator weve got hairlong blond and short brown that suggests two perps one definitely male rigging the attacks the other unknown but probably a woman what else do we know hes from out of town dellray pointed out pulaski said knowledge of arc flashes and how to create the booby traps good rhyme said sellitto said one of them has access to algonquin facilities possibly though they could have used galt for that hums and clicks from the forensic instruments filled the parlor coins jingled in somebodys pocket a man and a woman mcdaniel said just what we learned from t and c justice for the earth rhyme exhaled a sigh tucker i could buy that if we had any evidence about the group but we dont not a single fiber print bit of trace its all cloud zone but the criminalist snapped if they exist they have a physical presence somewhere i dont have any proof of that well then what do you thinks going on rhyme smiled almost simultaneously amelia sachs was shaking her head rhyme you dont think it could be do you you know what i say when youve eliminated all the other possibilities the remaining one however outlandish it seems has to be the answer i dont get it lincoln pulaski said mcdaniels expression echoed the same what do you mean well rookie you might want to ask yourself a few questions one does andi jessen have blond hair about the length of what you found two does she have a brother whos a former soldier who lives out of town and who might have access to weapons like a nineteen eleven colt army fortyfive and three has andi spent any time in city hall in the last couple of days oh say giving press conferences chapter andi jessen as he continued to type rhyme replied to mcdaniel and her brothers doing the legwork randall hes the one whos actually staged the attacks but they coordinated them together thats why the transfer of evidence she helped him move the generator out of the white van to the back of the school in chinatown sachs crossed her arms as she considered this remember charlie sommers said that the army teaches soldiers about arc flashes randall couldve learned what he needed to know there cooper said the fibers we found in susans wheelchair the database said they mightve come from a military uniform rhyme nodded at the evidence board there was that report of an intrusion at a company substation in philadelphia we heard on tv that randall jessen lives in pennsylvania thats right sachs confirmed hes got dark hair pulaski asked yes he does well he did when he was a kidfrom the pictures on andis desk and andi went out of her way to say he didnt live here and theres something else she told me she didnt come out of the technical side of the business she said she got her fathers talentthe business side of the energy industry but remember that news story about her before the press conference cooper nodded she was a lineman for a while before she moved into management and succeeded her father he pointed to the perp profile on the whiteboard she was lying sachs said and the greek foodcould have come from andi herself or maybe she met her brother at a restaurant near the company eyes on what he was typing rhymes brow furrowed as he considered something else and why is bernie wahl still alive the security chief at algonquin sellitto mused fuck i never thought about it sure it would have made sense for galtwell the perpto kill him randall couldve delivered the second demand letter a dozen different ways the point was to make wahl believe it was galt he never saw the perps face dellray chimed in no wonder nobody spotted the real galt even after all the pictures on tv and the internet it was a different goddamn perp altogether mcdaniel now looked less skeptical so wheres randall jessen now all we know is hes planning something big for sixthirty tonight eyeing the recent evidence rhyme was lost in thought for a moment then continued to typeit was a list of instructions on how to proceed from here one slow letter at a time then the assistant special agent in charges skeptical gaze returned im sorry timeout here i can see what youre saying but whats her motive shes screwing up her own company shes committing murder that makes no sense rhyme corrected a typo and kept going click click then he looked up and said softly the victims what rhyme explained if the perp was just making a statement like it seemed he could have rigged a timed deviceand not risked being nearby we know he could have done that we found the timer spring at one of the crime scenes but he didnt he was using a remote control and he was nearby when the victims died why sellitto barked a laugh goddamn linc andi and her brother were after somebody in particular she was just making it look you know random thats why the attacks happened before the deadlines exactly rookie bring the whiteboards over here now he did the vics look at the vics luis martin assistant store manager linda kepler oklahoma city tourist morris kepler oklahoma city tourist samuel vetter scottsdale businessman ali mamoud new york city waiter gerhart schiller frankfurt germany advertising executive larry fishbein new york city accountant robert bodine new york city attorney franklin tucker paramus new jersey salesman do we know anything about the injured sachs said she didnt well one of them mightve been the intended victim too we should find out but what do we know about them at least the deceased rhyme asked staring at the names is there any reason andi would want any of them dead the keplers were tourists in town on a package tour sachs said retired ten years ago vetter was the witness maybe thats why they killed him no this was planned a month ago what was the business sachs flipped through her notebook president of southwest concrete look em up mel in a minute cooper was saying well listen to this based in scottsdale general construction with a specialty in infrastructure projects on the website it says that vetter was attending an alternative energy financing seminar at the battery park hotel he looked up recently theyve been involved in constructing the foundations for photovoltaic arrays solar power rhymes eyes continued to take in the evidence he said and the victims in the office building sachs call susan stringer and see if she knows anything about them sachs pulled out her phone and had a conversation with the woman when she hung up she said okay she doesnt know the lawyer or the man who got on at the sixth floor but larry fishbein was an accountant she knew a little she overheard him complaining that there was something odd about the books of a company where hed just done an audit some money was disappearing and wherever it was the place was really hot too hot to golf maybe arizona call and find out sellitto got the number of the mans firm from sachs and called he spoke for a few minutes and then disconnected bingo fishbein was in scottsdale he got back tuesday ah scottsdale where vetter had his company mcdaniel said what is this lincoln i still dont see the motive after a moment rhyme said andi jessens opposed to renewable energy right sachs said thats a little strong but shes definitely not a fan what if she was bribing alternative energy companies to limit production or doing something else to sabotage them to keep demand for algonquins power high mcdaniel asked a motive in his pocket he seemed more on board now thats right vetter and fishbein mightve had information that wouldve sunk her if theyd been murdered in separate incidents just the two of them the investigators mightve wondered if there was a connection but andi arranged this whole thing to make it look like they were random victims so nobodyd put the pieces together thats why the demands were impossible to comply with she didnt want to comply with them she needed the attacks to take place rhyme said to sachs and get the names of the injured and check out their histories maybe one of them was a target too sure rhyme but sellitto said with unusual urgency in his voice theres the third demand letter the email that means she still needs to kill somebody else whos the next victim rhyme continued to type as quickly as he could on his keyboard his eyes rose momentarily to the digital clock on the wall nearby i dont know and weve got less than two hours to figure it out chapter despite the horror of ray galts attacks charlie sommers couldnt deny the exhilaration that now well electrified him hed taken a coffee break during which hed spent the time jotting diagrams for a possible invention on a napkin of course a way to deliver hydrogen gas to homes for fuel cells he was now returning to the main floor of the new energy expo in the manhattan convention center on the west side near the hudson river it was filled with thousands of the most innovative people in the world inventors scientists professors the allimportant investors too each devoted to one thing alternative energy creating it delivering it storing it using it this was the biggest conference of its sort in the world timed to coincide with earth day it brought together those who knew the importance of energy but knew too the importance of making and using it in very different ways from what wed been used to as sommers made his way through the halls of the futuristic convention centerfinished just a month or so agohis heart was pounding like that of a schoolboy at his first science fair he felt dizzy head swiveling back and forth as he took in the booths those of companies operating wind farms nonprofits seeking backers to create microgrids in remote parts of third world countries solar power companies geothermal exploration operations and smaller outfits that made or installed photovoltaic arrays flywheel and liquid sodium storage systems batteries superconductive transport systems smart grids the list was endless and utterly enthralling he arrived at his companys tenfootwide booth at the back end of the hall algonquin consolidated power special projects division the smarter alternative although algonquin was probably bigger than the five largest exhibitors here put together his company had bought only the smallest booth available for the newenergy show and he was the only one manning it which was a pretty clear indication of how ceo andi jessen felt about renewables still sommers didnt care sure he was here as a company representative but hed also come here to meet people and make contacts on his own somedaysoon he hopedhed leave algonquin and spend all his time on his own company he was very up front with his supervisors about his private work nobody at algonquin had ever had a problem with what he did on his own time they wouldnt be interested in the inventions he created at home anyway things like the sinkrynicity watersaving system for kitchens or the voltcollector a portable box that used the motion of vehicles to create power and store it in a battery you could plug into a fixture in your house or office thus reducing demand from your local company the king of negawatts already incorporated sommers illuminating innovations inc was his companys name and it consisted of himself his wife and her brother the name was a play on thomas edisons corporation edison illuminating company the first investorowned utility and the operator of the first grid while he may have had a bita tiny bitof edisons genius sommers was no businessman he was oblivious when it came to money when hed come up with the idea of creating regional grids so that smaller producers could sell excess electricity to algonquin and other large power companies a friend in the industry had laughed and why would algonquin want to buy electricity when theyre in the business of selling it well sommers replied blinking in surprise at his friends naivete because its more efficient itll be cheaper to customers and reduce the risk of outages this was obvious the laugh in response suggested that perhaps sommers was the naive one sitting down at the booth he flicked on light switches and removed the be back soon sign he poured more candy into a bowl algonquin had vetoed hiring a model in a lowcut dress to stand in front of the booth and smile like some of the exhibitors had no the smiling was up to him and he grinned with a vengeance as he gestured people over and talked about power during a lull he sat back and gazed around him wondering what thomas edison would have thought walking through these halls sommers had a feeling that the man would have been fascinated and delighted but not amazed after all electrical generation and the grid hadnt changed significantly for years the scale was bigger the efficiency better but every major system in use nowadays had been around then edison would probably have gazed enviously at the halogen bulbs knowing how hard it had been to find a filament that worked in his and laughed to see the displays on micronuclear reactors which could travel on barges to where they were needed edison had predicted in the s that we would one day be using nuclear energy to power generators he would also undoubtedly have been awed by the convention center building itself the architect had made no attempt to hide the infrastructure the beams the walls the ducts even portions of the floor were gleaming copper and stainless steel it was sommers considered like being inside a huge switchgear array the special project manager kept his guard up though theres a seamy side to invention the creation of the lightbulb had been a fierce battlenot only technologically but legally dozens of people were involved in knockdown dragout battles for credit forand the profit fromthe lightbulb thomas edison and englands joseph wilson swan emerged as the victors but from a field littered with lawsuits anger espionage and sabotage and destroyed careers sommers was thinking of this now because hed seen a man in glasses and a cap not far from the algonquin booth he was suspicious because the guy had been lingering at two different booths nearby one company made equipment for geothermal exploration devices that would locate hot spots deep in the earth the other built hybrid motors for small vehicles but sommers knew that someone interested in geothermal would likely have no interest in hybrids true the man was paying little attention to sommers or algonquin but he could easily have been taking pictures of some of the inventions and mockups on display at the booth spy cameras nowadays were extremely sophisticated sommers turned away to answer a womans question when he looked back the manspy or businessman or just curious attendeewas gone ten minutes later another lull in visitors he decided to use the restroom he asked the man in the booth next to his to keep an eye on things and then headed down a nearly deserted corridor to the mens room one advantage of being in the cheaper smallbooth area was that you had the toilets largely to yourself he stepped into a corridor whose stylish steel floor was embossed with bumps presumably to simulate the flooring of a space station or rocket when he was twenty feet away his cell phone started to ring he didnt recognize the numberfrom a local area code he thought for a moment then hit the ignore button sommers continued toward the toilet noticing the shiny copper handle on the door and thinking they sure didnt spare any expense here no wonder its costing us so damn much for the booth chapter please sachs muttered out loud hovering over the speakerphone charlie pick up please shed called sommers just a moment before but the phone rang only once and then went to voice mail she was trying again come on rhyme too said two rings three and finally in the speaker a click hello charlie its amelia sachs oh did you call a minute ago i was on my way charlie she broke in youre in danger what where are you in the convention center about to what do you mean danger are you near anything metal anything that could produce an arc flash or something that could be rigged with a hot line he gave an abrupt laugh im standing on a metal floor and i was just about to open a bathroom door with a metal handle then the humor faded from his voice are you saying they might be boobytrapped its possible get off the metal floor now i dont understand theres been another demand and a deadline sixthirty but we think the attacksthe hotel the elevatordont have anything to do with the threats or demands theyre coverups to target certain people and you might be one of them me why first of all get someplace safe ill go back to the main floor its concrete hold on a moment later he said okay you know i saw somebody here watching me but i dont think it was galt rhyme said charlie its lincoln we think ray galt was set up hes probably dead somebody else is behind the attacks yes who andi jessen the man you saw mightve been her brother randall the evidence shows that theyre working together what thats crazy and whym i in danger sachs continued some of the people killed in the other attacks were involved in alternative energy production like you we think that she may have been bribing renewable power companies to cut back generation to keep up demand for algonquins electricity there was a pause well its true one of my projectss been to consolidate regional grids so that they could be more selfsufficientand start supplying juice to the big interconnections like algonquin i guess that could be a problem for her have you been to scottsdale recently im working on some solar farm projects near there yes among other places california its wind farms and geothermal arizona is mostly solar farms sachs said i was thinking back to something you said when i met you at algonquin why did she ask you to help me with the investigation he paused youre right she couldve asked a dozen people i think she was setting you up then he gasped and said oh jesus what rhyme asked maybe its not just me whos at risk think about it everybody here at the conventions a threat to algonquin the whole events about alternative energy microgrids decentralization andi could see every exhibitor here as a threat if shes that obsessed with algonquin being the numberone energy provider in north america is there somebody at algonquin we can trust somebody to shut off power there and not let andi know algonquin doesnt run service here like some of the subway lines the convention center makes its own juice the plants next to the building here should we evacuate the place would people have to go over a metal floor to get outside yes most of them would the front lobby and the loading docks are all steel not painted pure steel and do you know how much electricity there is feeding in here the load on a day like this is close to twenty million watts look i can go downstairs find the supply maybe i can pull the breakers i could no we need to find out exactly what theyre doing and how theyre doing it well call as soon as we know more stay put chapter sweating frantic charlie sommers looked around him at the tens of thousands of visitors at the new energy expo some hoping to make a fortune some hoping to help if not save the planet some here because it seemed like a fun idea to stop in for a while some were young teenagers who like him years ago would be inspired to take different courses in high school after seeing these exhibits more science less foreign language and history and become the edisons of their generations they were all at risk stay put the police had told him crowds jostled carting colorful bagsthe exhibitors giveaways with the company logos printed boldly volt storage technologies next generation batteries geothermal innovations stay put except his mind was in a place his wife called charliethink it was spinning on its own like a dynamo like an electricity storage flywheel ten thousand rpm thinking of the electricity usage here in the convention center twenty megawatts twenty million watts watts equals volts times amps enough electricity if channeled through this conductive superstructure to electrocute thousands arc flashes or just ground faults the massive current surging through bodies taking lives and leaving smoldering piles of flesh and clothing and hair stay put well he couldnt and like any inventor sommers considered the practical details randall jessen and andi would have somehow secured the power plant they couldnt risk that the police would call the maintenance staff and simply cut the supply but thered be a main line coming into this building probably like an area transmission line it would be carrying v they would have cut into the line to electrify floors or stairways or doorknobs the elevators again maybe sommers reflected the attendees here couldnt avoid the juice they couldnt protect themselves against it so hed have to cut its head off there was no staying put if he could find the incoming line before randall jessen ran the splice sommers could short it out hed run a cable from the hot line directly to a return the resulting short circuit accompanied by an arc flash as powerful as the one at the bus station the other morning would pop breakers in the convention center power plant eliminating the danger the emergency lighting system would kick on but that was low voltageprobably from twelvevolt leadcalcium batteries thered be no risk of electrocution with that small supply a few people would be stuck in the elevators maybe thered be some panic but injuries would be minimal but then reality came home to him the only way to short out the system was to do the most dangerous procedure in the utility business bare hand work on an energized line carrying volts only the top linemen ever attempted this working from insulated buckets or helicopters to avoid any risk of ground contact and wearing faraday suitsactual metal clothingthe linemen connected themselves directly to the highvoltage wire itself in effect they became part of it and hundreds of thousands of volts streamed over their bodies charlie sommers had never tried bare hand work with high voltage but he knew how to perform itin theory like a bird on a wire at the algonquin booth he now grabbed his pathetically sparse tool kit and borrowed a length of lightweight hightension wire from a nearby exhibitor he ran into the dim hallway to find a service door he glanced at the copper doorknob hesitated only a moment then yanked it open and plunged into the dimness of the centers several basements stay put i dont think so chapter he sat in the front seat of his white van hot because the air conditioner was off he didnt want to run the engine and draw attention to himself a parked vehicle is one thing a parked vehicle with an engine running exponentially increased suspicion sweat tickled the side of his cheek he hardly noticed it he pressed the headset more firmly against his ear still nothing he turned the volume higher static a clunk or two a snap he was thinking of the words hed sent via email earlier today if you ignore me this time the consequences will be far far greater than the small incidents of yesterday and the day before the loss of life far worse yes and no he tilted his head listening for more words to flow through the microphone hed hidden in the generator hed planted at the school near chinatown a trojan horse one that the crime scene unit had courteously carted right into lincoln rhymes townhouse hed already gotten the lowdown on the cast of characters helping rhyme and their whereabouts lon sellitto the nypd detective and tucker mcdaniel asac of the fbi were gone headed downtown to city hall where they would coordinate the defense of the convention center amelia sachs and ron pulaski were speeding to the center right now to see if they could shut the power off waste of time he reflected then he stiffened hearing the voice of lincoln rhyme okay mel i need you to get that cable to the lab in queens the the cable which one how the hell many cables are there about four well the one sachs and pulaski found at the school in chinatown i want the trace between the insulation and the wire itself dug out and run through their sem then came the sound of plastic and paper a moment later footsteps ill be back in forty minutes an hour i dont care when you get back i care when you call me with the results footsteps thudding the microphone was very sensitive a door slammed silence the tapping of computer keys nothing else then rhyme shouting goddamn it thom thom what lincoln are you is mel gone hold on after a moment the voice called yes his car just left you want me to call him no dont bother look i need a piece of wire i want to see if i can duplicate something randall did a long piece of wire do we have anything like that here extension cord no bigger twenty thirty feet why would i have any wire that long here i just thought maybe you would well go find some now where am i supposed to find wire a fucking wire store i dont know a hardware store theres that one on broadway right there used to be its still there so you need thirty feet that should do it what its just youre not looking well lincoln im not sure i should leave you yes you should you should do what im asking the sooner you leave the sooner youll be back and you can motherhen me to your hearts content but for now go there was no sound for a moment all right but im checking your blood pressure first another pause go ahead muffled sounds a faint hiss the rasp of velcro its not bad but i want to make sure it stays that way how are you feeling im just tired ill be back in a half hour faint steps sounded on the floor the door opened again then closed he listened for a moment more and then rose he pulled on a cable tv repairmans uniform he slipped the colt into a gear bag which he slung over his shoulder he checked the front windows and mirrors of the van and noting that the alley was empty climbed out he verified there were no security cameras and walked to the back door of lincoln rhymes townhouse in three minutes hed made sure the alarm was off and had picked the lock slipping into the basement he found the electrical service panel and silently went to work rigging another of his remote control switchgear units to the incoming service line amps which was double that of most other residences in the area this was interesting to note but not particularly significant of course since he knew that all he needed to cause virtually instant death was a tiny portion of that one tenth of one amp chapter rhyme was looking over the evidence boards when the electricity went off in his townhouse the computer screen turned black machinery sighed to silence the red green and yellow eyes of the leds on the equipment surrounding him vanished he swiveled his head from side to side from the basement the creak of a door then he heard footsteps not the footfalls themselves but the faint protest of human weight on old dry wood hello he shouted thom is that you the power theres something wrong with the power the creaking grew closer then it vanished rhyme turned his chair in a circle he scanned the room eyes darting the way they used to dart at crime scenes upon first arrival taking in all the relevant evidence getting the impression of the scene looking for the dangers too the places where the perp might still be hiding maybe injured maybe panicked maybe coolly waiting for a chance to kill a police officer another creak he spun the wheelchair around again threesixty but saw nothing then he spotted on one of the examination tables at the far end of the room a cell phone although the power was off in the rest of the townhouse of course the mobile would be working batteries rhyme pushed the controller touchpad forward and the chair responded quickly he sped to the table and stopped his back to the doorway and stared down at the phone it was no more than eighteen inches from his face its lcd indicator glowed green plenty of juice ready to take or send a call thom he called again nothing rhyme felt the pounding of his heart through the telegraph of his temples and the throbbing veins in his neck alone in the room virtually immobile less than two feet away from the phone staring rhyme turned the chair slightly sideways and then back quickly knocking into the table rocking the phone but it remained exactly where it was then he was aware of a change in the acoustics of the room and he knew the intruder had entered he banged into the table once again but before the phone skidded closer to him he heard footsteps pound across the floor behind him a gloved hand reached over his shoulder and seized the phone is that you rhyme demanded of the person behind him randall randall jessen no answer only faint sounds behind him clicks then jostling which he felt in his shoulders the wheelchairs battery indicator light on the touchpad went black the intruder disengaged the brake manually and wheeled the chair to an area illuminated by a band of pale sunlight falling through the window the man then slowly turned the chair around rhyme opened his mouth to speak but then his eyes narrowed as he studied the face before him carefully he said nothing for a moment then in a whisper it cant be the cosmetic surgery had been very good still there were familiar landmarks in the mans face besides how could rhyme possibly fail to recognize richard logan the watchmaker the man who was supposedly hiding out at that very moment in an unsavory part of mexico city chapter logan shut off the cell phone that lincoln rhyme had apparently been trying in his desperation to knock into service i dont understand the criminalist said logan sloughed a gear bag off his shoulder and set it on the floor crouching and opening it his quick fingers dug into the bag and he extracted a laptop computer and two wireless video cameras one he took into the kitchen and pointed into the alley the other he set in a front window he booted up the computer and placed it on a nearby table he typed in some commands immediately images of the alley and sidewalk approaches to rhymes townhouse came on the screen it was the same system hed used at the battery park hotel to spy on vetter and determine the exact moment to hit the switch when flesh met metal then logan looked up and gave a faint laugh he walked to the dark oak mantelpiece where a pocketwatch sat on a stand you still have my present he whispered you have it have it out on display he was shocked hed assumed the ancient breguet had been dismantled and every piece examined to determine where logan lived though they were enemies and logan would soon kill him he admired rhyme a great deal and was oddly pleased that the man had kept the timepiece intact when he thought about it however he decided that of course the criminalist had indeed ordered it taken apart down to the last hairspring and jewel for the forensics team but then had it reassembled perfectly making rhyme a bit of a watchmaker too next to the pocketwatch was the note that had accompanied the timepiece it was both an appreciation of rhyme and an ominous promise that theyd meet again a promise now fulfilled the criminalist was recovering from his shock he said peoplell be back here any minute no lincoln they wont logan recited the whereabouts of everyone whod been in the room fifteen minutes ago rhyme frowned how did you oh no of course the generator you have a bug in it he closed his eyes in disgust thats right and i know how much time i have richard logan reflected that whatever else occurred in his life he always knew exactly how much time he had the dismay on rhymes face then faded into confusion so it wasnt randall jessen masquerading as ray galt it was you logan fondly studied the breguet compared the time to a watch on his own wrist you keep it wound then he replaced it thats right ive been raymond galt master electrician and troubleman for the past week but i saw you in the airport security video you were hired to kill rodolfo luna in mexico not exactly his colleague arturo diaz was on the payroll of one of the big drug cartels out of puerto vallarta luna is one of the few honest cops left in mexico diaz wanted to hire me to kill him but i was too busy for a fee though i did agree to pretend i was behind it to keep suspicion off him it served my purposes too i needed everyoneespecially youto believe i was someplace other than new york city but at the airport rhymes voice fell to a confused whisper you were on the plane the security tape we saw you get in that truck hide under the tarp and you were spotted in mexico city and on the road there from the airport you were seen in gustavo madero an hour ago your fingerprints and the words dissolved the criminalist shook his head and gave a resigned smile my god you never left the airport at all no i didnt you picked up that package and got onto the truck in front of the camera on purpose but it just drove out of view you handed the package off to somebody else and got a flight headed to the east coast diazs men kept reporting you in mexico cityto make everybody think you were there how many of diazs people were on the take about two dozen there was no car fleeing to gustavo madero no pity was an emotion that to logan was inefficient and therefore pointless still he could recognize without being moved personally that there was something pitiable about lincoln rhyme at the moment he also looked smaller than when last they met nearly frail perhaps hed been sick which was good logan decided the electricity coursing through his body would take its toll more quickly he certainly didnt want rhyme to suffer he added as if in consolation you anticipated the attack on luna you stopped diaz from killing him i never thought youd figure it out in time but on reflection i shouldnt have been surprised but i didnt stop you logan had killed a number of people in his lengthy career as a professional most of them if they were aware they were about to die grew calm as they understood the inevitability of what was about to happen but rhyme went even further the criminalist now almost looked relieved perhaps that was what logan saw in rhymes face the symptoms of a terminal illness or maybe hed just lost the will to live given his condition a fast death would be a blessing wheres galts body the burnthe boiler furnace at algonquin power theres nothing left logan glanced at the laptop still all clear he took out a length of bennington mediumvoltage cable and attached one end to the hot line in a nearby volt outlet hed spent months learning all about juice he felt as comfortable with it now as with the fine gears and springs of clocks and watches logan felt in his pocket the weight of the remote control that would turn the power back on and send sufficient amperage into the criminalist to kill him instantly as he wound part of the cable around rhymes arm the man said but if you bugged the generator you mustve heard what we were saying before we know raymond galt isnt the real perp that he was set up and we know that andi jessen wanted to kill sam vetter and larry fishbein whether or not it was her brother who rigged the traps or you shell still get collared and logan did no more than glance at rhyme on whose face appeared a look of both understanding and complete resignation but thats not what this is about is it thats not what this is about at all no lincoln its not chapter a bird not on but above a wire dangling in the air in the deepest subbasement of the convention center charlie sommers was in an improvised sling exactly two feet away from a line carrying volts swathed in red insulation if electricity were water the pressure in the cable in front of him would be like that at the bottom of the sea millions of pounds per square inch just waiting for any excuse to crush the submarine into a flat bloody strip of metal the main line suspended on insulated glass supports was ten feet off the ground running from the wall across the basement to the convention centers own substation at the far end of the dim space because he couldnt touch both the bare wire and anything connected to the ground at the same time hed improvised a sling from fire hose which hed tied to a catwalk above the highvoltage cable using all his strength hed shimmied down the hose and had managed to slide into the crux of the sling he fervently hoped that fire hoses were made exclusively of rubber and canvas if the hose was for some reason reinforced with metal strands then in a few minutes he would become a major player in a phasetoground fault and would turn into vapor around his neck was a length of gauge cablewhat hed borrowed from the booth next to algonquins with his swiss army knife sommers was slowly stripping away the dark red insulation on it when he was finished he would similarly strip away the protective coating from the highvoltage line exposing the aluminum strands and with his unprotected hands hed join the two wires then one of two things would happen either nothing or a phasetoground fault and vapor if the case of the former he would then carefully extend the exposed end of the wire and touch it to a nearby return sourcesome iron girders connected to the convention centers foundation the result would be a spectacular short that would blow the breakers in the centers power plant as for him well charlie sommers himself wouldnt be grounded but voltage that high would produce a huge arc flash which could easily burn him to death knowing now that the deadline was meaningless and that randall and andi jessen might trip the switchgear at any moment he worked feverishly slicing the bloodred insulation off the cable the curled strips of dielectric fell to the floor beneath him and sommers couldnt help but think they were like petals falling from dying roses in a funeral home after the mourners had returned home chapter richard logan watched lincoln rhyme gazing out one of the large windows of the townhousein the direction of the east river somewhere out there the gray and red towers of algonquin consolidated power presided over the grim riverfront the smokestacks werent visible from here but logan supposed that on a cold day rhyme could see the billowing exhaust rising over the skyline shaking his head the criminalist whispered andi jessen didnt hire you at all no shes the target isnt she youre setting her up thats right rhyme nodded at the gear bag at logans feet theres evidence in there implicating her and her brother youre going to plant it here as if andi and randall had killed me too just like youve been planting evidence all along the trace from city hall the blond hair the greek food you were hired by somebody to make it look like andi was using ray galt to kill sam vetter and larry fishbein why them it wasnt them particularly the victims could have been anybody from the alternative energy conference at the battery park hotel or from fishbeins accounting firm anybody there might have information about some scam or another andi jessen wanted to cover up even though they didnt have any information no nothing to do with algonquin or andi at all whos behind it rhymes brow was furrowed the eyes now darting over the evidence boards as if he needed to know the answer to the puzzle before he died i cant figure that out logan looked down at the mans gaunt face pity he extracted a second wire and rigged it too to rhyme hed connect this to the closest ground the radiator richard logan never cared on a moral level why his clients wanted the victims dead but he made a point of learning the motive because it helped him to plan his job and to get away afterward so hed listened with interest when it was explained to him why andi jessen had to be discredited and go to jail for a long long time he now said andi is a threat to the new order her viewher very vocal view apparentlyis that oil and gas and coal and nuke are the only significant sources for energy and will be for the next hundred years renewables are a kids toy shes pointing out the emperors new clothes exactly so some ecoterror group is behind this then logan grimaced ecoterrorists oh please bearded unwashed idiots who cant even burn down a ski resort construction site without getting caught in the act logan laughed no lincoln its about money rhyme seemed to understand ah sure it doesnt matter that clean energy and renewables dont add up to much in the great scheme of things yet theres still lots of profit to be made building wind and solar farms and regional grids and the transmission equipment exactly government subsidies and tax breaks too not to mention consumers wholl pay whatever theyre billed for green power because they think theyre saving the earth rhyme said when we found galts apartment his emails about the cancer we were thinking that revenge never sits well as a motive no but greeds perennial the criminalist apparently couldnt help but laugh so a green cartels behind this what a thought his eyes took in the whiteboards i think i can deduce one of the players bob cavanaugh good yes hes the principal in fact how did you know he gave us information implicating randall jessen rhyme squinted and he helped us at the hotel in battery park we mightve saved vetter but sure it didnt matter if you actually killed him or fishbein or anyone else for that matter no what was important was that andi jessen get arrested for the attacks discredited and sent to jail and there was another motive cavanaugh was an associate of andis father and never very happy hed been passed over for the president and ceo spot by daddys little girl he cant be the only one no the cartel has ceos from a half dozen alternativeenergy equipment suppliers around the world mostly in the united states china and switzerland a green cartel rhyme shook his head times change logan said but why not just kill her andi my very question logan said but there was an economic component cavanaugh and the others needed andi out but also needed to have algonquins share price drop the cartel is going to snap up the company and the attack on the bus needed to get everybodys attention logan felt a ping of regret and he was comfortable confessing to rhyme i didnt want anyone to die there that passenger would have been okay if hed gotten onto the bus instead of hesitating but i couldnt wait anymore i can see why youd set up vetter and fishbein to make it look like andi wanted them deadthey were involved in alternative energy projects in arizona theyd be logical victims but why would the cartel want to kill charlie sommers wasnt his job developing alternative energy sommers a nod at the generator i heard you mention him and bernie wahl dimed him out when i delivered the second note wahl snitched on you too by the way because you threatened to what electrocute his family yes i hardly blame him logan continued but whoever this sommers is hes not part of the plan but you sent algonquin a third demand letter that meant you had to kill somebody else you dont have a trap at the convention center rhyme looked confused no then he nodded with understanding of course me im the next victim logan paused the wire taut in his hands thats right you took on this whole assignment because of me i get a lot of calls but ive been waiting for a job that would bring me back to new york logan lowered his head you nearly caught me when i was here a few years agoand you ruined that assignment it was the first time that anyones ever stopped me from fulfilling a contract i had to return the fee it wasnt the cash it was the embarrassment shameful and then you nearly caught me in england too next time you might get lucky thats why i took the job when cavanaugh called me i needed to get close to you logan wondered why hed chosen those words he pushed the thought away finished affixing the ground wire he rose sorry but i have to do this he apologized then poured water onto rhymes chest soaking his shirt it was undignified but he didnt have a choice conductivity and justice for the earth nothing to do with you either no i never heard of them rhyme was watching him so that remote control switch youve made its rigged downstairs in my circuit breaker panel yes rhyme mused electricity ive learned a lot about it in the past few days ive been studying it for months galt taught you the algonquin computer controls no that was cavanaugh he got me the pass codes to the system ah sure logan said but i also took a course in scada and the algonquin system in particular of course you would have logan continued i was surprised how fascinated ive become i always belittled electricity because of your watchmaking exactly a battery and a massproduced chip can equal the capability of the finest handmade watches rhyme nodded with understanding electrical clocks seemed cheap to you somehow using battery power lessened the beauty of a watch lessened the art logan felt excitement coursing through him to engage in a conversation like this was enthralling there were so few people who were his equal and the criminalist actually knew what he was feeling yes yes exactly but then working on this job my opinion changed why is a watch that tells time by an oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal any less astonishing than one run by gears and levers and springs in the end it all comes down to physics as a man of science youd appreciate that oh and complications you know what complications are rhyme said all the bells and whistles they build into watches the date the phases of the moon the equinox chimes logan was surprised rhyme added oh ive studied watchmaking too close to you electronic watches duplicate all of those functions and a hundred more the timex data link you know it no rhyme said theyre classics nowwristwatches that link to your computer telling the time is only one of a hundred things they can do astronauts have worn them to the moon another look at the computer screen no one was approaching the townhouse and all this change this modernity doesnt bother you rhyme asked no it simply proves how integrated in our lives is the subject of time we forget that the watchmakers were the silicon valley innovators of their day why look at this project what an impressive weaponelectricity i shut down the entire city for a few days thanks just to electricity its part of our nature now part of our being we couldnt live without it times change we have to change too whatever the risks whatever we have to leave behind rhyme said i have a favor ive adjusted the circuit breakers in your service panel theyll carry three times the load itll be fast you wont feel anything i never feel very much in any event rhyme said i logan felt as if he had committed a shameful faux pas i apologize i wasnt thinking a demurring nod what im asking has to do with amelia sachs theres no reason to go after her logan had considered this and he now told rhyme his conclusion no i have no intention to shell have the drive to find me the tenacity but shes no match for me shell be safe and now rhymes smile was faint thank you i was going to say richard you are richard logan right or is that fake thats my real name logan glanced at the screen again the sidewalk outside was empty no police none of rhymes associates returning he and the criminalist were completely alone it was time youre remarkably calm rhyme replied why shouldnt i be ive been living on borrowed time for years every day its a bit of surprise when i wake up logan dug into his gear bag and tossed another coil of wire containing randall jessens fingerprints onto the floor he then opened a baggie and upended it letting some of randalls hairs flutter to the ground nearby he used one of the brothers shoes to leave an impression in the spilled water then he planted more of andi jessens blond hairs along with some fibers from one of her suits which hed gotten from her closet at work he looked up and checked the electrical connections again why was he hesitating perhaps it was that rhymes death represented for him the end of an era killing the criminalist would be a vast relief but it would also be a loss hed feel forever he supposed what he was experiencing now was what one felt making the decision to take a loved one off life support close to you he slipped the remote control from his pocket stood back from the wheelchair lincoln rhyme was studying him calmly he sighed and said i guess thats about it then logan hesitated and his eyes narrowed staring at rhyme there was something very different about the criminalists tone as hed spoken those words his facial expression too and the eyes the eyes were suddenly a predators richard logan actually shivered as he suddenly understood that that incongruous sentence delivered so incongruously was not directed toward him at all it was a message to somebody else whatve you done logan whispered heart pounding he stared at the small computer monitor there was no sign that anybody was returning to the townhouse but but what if theyd never left in the first place oh no logan stared at rhyme and then jammed his finger onto the two buttons of the remote control switch nothing happened rhyme said matteroffactly as soon as you came upstairs one of our officers disconnected it no logan gasped a creak sounded on the floor behind him he spun around richard logan do not move it was that police detective theyd just been talking about amelia sachs keep your hands in view if you move your hands you will be shot behind her were two other men logan took them to be police too one was heavy and wearing a wrinkled blue suit the other skinnier was in shirtsleeves wearing blackframed glasses all three officers trained weapons on him but logans eyes were on amelia sachs who seemed the most eager to shoot he realized that rhyme had asked the question about sachs to alert them that he was ready to say the magic words and spring the trap i guess thats about it then but the consequence was that she would have heard logans comment about her her inferior skills still when she stepped forward to cuff him it was with utmost professionalism gently almost then she eased him to the floor with minimal discomfort the heavy officer stepped forward and reached for the wires coiled around rhyme gloves please said the criminalist calmly the big cop hesitated then pulled on latex gloves and removed the cables he said into his radio its clear up here you can put the power back on a moment later lights filled the room and surrounded by the clicks of the equipment returning to life and the diodes flickering red green and white richard logan the watchmaker was read his rights chapter it was time for the heroics not generally the bailiwick of inventors charlie sommers decided he had removed enough insulation from the lightweight cable so that he was ready to try for the short circuit in theory this should work the risk was that in its desperation to get to the ground the instant he moved it closer to the return the massive voltage in the feeder line would arc to the cable then consume his body in a plasma spark he was only ten feet above the concrete sommers had seen videos of arc flashes that were fifty feet in length but hed waited long enough first step connect the cable to the main line thinking of his wife thinking of his childrenand his other children the inventions hed fathered over the yearshe leaned toward the hot wire and with a deep breath touched the lightweight cable to it using his hands nothing happened so far so good his body and the wires were now at the same potential in effect charlie sommers was simply a portion of a v line he worked the bare section of the cable around the far side of the energized line and caught the end underneath he twisted it so there was tight contact gripping the insulated part of the lightweight cable he eased back in his unsure firehose swing and stared at the place hed decided to close the connection a girder that rose to the ceiling but more important for his purposes descended deep into the earth to which all juice had a primal instinct to return the girder was about six feet away charlie sommers gave a faint laugh this was fucking ridiculous the minute the exposed end of the other wire neared the metal beam the current would anticipate the contact and lunge outward in a huge explosion of arc flash plasma flame molten metal drops flying at three thousand feet per second but he saw no other choice now cut its head off he began to feed the cable to the metal bar six feet five four hey there charlie charlie sommers he gasped the end of the cable swung wildly but he reeled it in fast whos there sommers blurted before realizing that it might be andi jessens brother whod come to shoot him its ron pulaski im that officer works with detective sachs yes what sommers gasped whatre you doing here weve been trying to call you for a half hour get out of here officer its dangerous we couldnt get through we called you right after you hung up speaking to amelia and lincoln sommers steadied his voice i dont have my goddamn phone look im shutting down the power here in the whole area its the only way to stop him theres going to be a huge hes already stopped what yessir they sent me here to find you to tell you that what they were saying on the phone was fake they knew the killer was listening in and they couldnt tell you what they were really planning we had to make him think we believed the attack was happening here as soon as i left lincolns i tried to call you but we couldnt get through somebody said they saw you coming down here jesus lord in heaven sommers stared at the cable dangling below him the juice in the feeder cable could decide at any moment that it wanted to take a shortcut to get back home and sommers would simply disappear pulaski called say what exactlyre you doing up there killing myself sommers retracted the cable slowly and then he reached into the enclosure and began undoing the connection with the main line expectingno positivethat at any moment he would hear very very briefly the arc flash hum and bang as he died the process of unraveling the beast seemed to take forever anything i can do sir yes shut the hell up um just stay back and give me a minute officer sure finally the cable came away from the feeder line and sommers dropped it to the floor then he eased out of the fire hose sling hung for a moment and tumbled to the ground on top of the cable he collapsed in pain from the fall but stood and tested for broken bones he sensed there was none whats that you were saying sir pulaski asked hed been repeating a frantic mantra stay put stay put stay put but he told the cop nothing then he dusted off his slacks and looked around he asked hey officer yessir by any chance you pass a restroom on your way down here chapter charlie sommerss okay sachs called slipping away her cell phone ron just called rhyme frowned i didnt know he wasnt okay seems he tried to play hero he was going to shut down the power at the convention center ron found him in the basement with a wire and some tools he was hanging from the ceiling doing what i dont know what part of stay put did he have trouble with sachs shrugged you couldntve just called him didnt have his phone on him something about a hundred thousand volts andi jessens brother was fine too though filthy and hungry and furious hed been recovered from the back of logans white van parked in the alley behind rhymes townhouse logan had shared nothing with him and had kept him in the darkin both senses randall jessen had assumed hed been kidnapped in some scheme to extort money from his wealthy ceo sister randalld heard nothing of the attacks and logans plan was apparently to electrocute him in rhymes basement as if hed accidentally touched a hot wire dismantling the switch hed installed to kill rhyme hed been reunited with his sister whod been briefed by gary noble about the situation rhyme wondered if shed respond to the fact that the target of her attacks in the pressthe alternative energy worldhad been behind the scheme rhyme asked and bob cavanaugh the operations man mcdaniels guys got him he was in his office no resistance tons of business records on startup alternative energy companies the conspirators planned to do deals with after theyd taken over algonquin the bureaull get the other names from his computer and phone recordsif he doesnt cooperate a green cartel rhyme now realized that richard logan sitting cuffed and shackled in a chair between two uniformed patrolmen was speaking to him in a cool eerily analytical voice the killer repeated a setup all fake you knew all along i knew rhyme regarded him carefully though hed confirmed the name richard logan it was impossible to think of him as that to rhyme he would always be the watchmaker the face was different yes after the plastic surgery but the eyes were those of the same man whod proved every bit as smart as rhyme himself smarter even on occasion and unbridled by the trivia of law and conscience the shackles were sturdy and the cuffs tight but lon sellitto sat nearby anyway keeping an eye on the man as if the cop thought that logan was using his considerable mental prowess to plan an escape but rhyme believed not the prisoners darting eyes had taken in the room and the other officers and had concluded that there was nothing to be gained by resisting so logan said evenly how did you do it he seemed genuinely curious as sachs and cooper logged and bagged the new evidence rhyme with no small ego himself was pleased to indulge him when our fbi agent told me that it was somebody else not galt that jarred me out of my rut you know the risk of making assumptions id been assuming all along that galt was the perp but once that idea got turned upside down i started thinking about the wholerhyme smiled at the fortuitous word that popped into his mindthe whole arc of the crimes take the trap at the school what was the point of trying to hurt only two or three officers and with a noisy generator it occurred to me that thatd be a good way to get some planted evidence inside the laband big enough to hide a microphone i took the chance that the generator was bugged and that you were listening so i started rambling about new theories involving andi jessen and her brother which is where the evidence was obviously leading us but at the same time i was typing out instructions for everybody in the lab they were all reading over my shoulder i had melmy associatescan the generator for a bug and there it was well if you wanted the generator to be found that meant that any evidence in it was planted so whoever it pointed to was not involved in the crimes andi jessen and her brother were innocent logan was frowning but you never suspected her i did yes we thought andid lied to us you heard that on the microphone yes though i wasnt sure what you meant she told sachs that she got her skills from her father as if she was hiding the fact that shed been a lineman and could rig arc flashes but if you think about what she said she wasnt denying that shed worked in the field but that she was simply saying her talent was mostly on the business side of the operation well if it wasnt andi or her brother then who i kept going back over the evidence a glance at the charts there were some items unaccounted for the one that stuck in my mind was the spring spring yes you mentioned that we found a tiny hairspring at one of the scenes nearly invisible we thought it could have been from a timer in some switchgear but i decided if it could come from a timer it could also be used in watchmaking that put me in mind of you of course a hairspring logans face fell i always use a roller on my clotheshe nodded to a rack of pethair rollers near an examination tableto make sure i pick up any trace before i go out on a job that mustve fallen into my cuff and you want to know something funny lincoln it probably got there because i was putting away a lot of my old supplies and tools what i told you before id become fascinated with the idea of electronic timekeeping thats what i was going to try next i wanted to make the most perfect clock in the world even better than the governments atomic clock but an electronic one rhyme continued and then all the other pieces fell into place my conclusion about the lettersthat they were written by galt under threatworked if you were the one dictating them the alternative jet fuel it was being tested mostly in military jetsbut that means it was also being tested in some private and commercial flights i decided it wouldnt make sense for anybody to plan an attack at an airport or a military base the security around the electrical systems would be too high so where did that trace come from the only aviation scenario that had come up recently didnt involve this case at all it involved youin mexico and we found a green fiber at one of the scenes it was the exact shade of mexican police uniforms and it had aviation fuel in it i left a fiber angry with himself now furious i supposed you picked it up from meeting with arturo diaz at the airport before you flew back to philadelphia to kidnap randall jessen and drive to new york logan could only sigh confirming rhymes theory well that was my theory that you were involved but it was purely speculationuntil i realized i had the answer right in front of me the definitive answer what do you mean the dna we had the analysis of the blood we found on the access door near the first substation attack but i never ran it through codisthe dna database why should we we knew galts identity this was the final check not long ago rhyme had typed instructions to cooperhe couldnt tell him orally because of the bug in the generatorto have the dna lab send a copy of the sample to codis we had a sample of your dna from your assignment in new york a few years ago i was reading the confirmation that they were the same when you showed up i scrambled to switch screens pretty quickly logans face tightened with anger at himself yes yes in the substation at the access door i cut my finger on a burr of metal i wiped the blood off as best i could but i was worried that youd find it its why i rigged the battery to blow and burn off the dna locards principle rhyme said citing the earlytwentiethcentury criminologist he quoted in every crime there is an exchange logan finished between criminal and victim or criminal and the site of the crime it may be very difficult to find but the connection exists and it is the obligation of every crime scene professional to find that one common bit of evidence that will lead to the perpetrators identity if not his doorstep rhyme couldnt help but laugh that particular quotation was his own a paraphrase of locards it had appeared in an article about forensics hed written only two or three months ago richard logan had apparently been doing his homework too or was it more than research thats why i took the job i needed to get close to you logan said youre not only a good criminalist youre a good actor you had me fooled youve done some of that yourself now havent you the mens eyes met and their gaze held steady then sellittos phone rang and he answered had a brief conversation and hung up transports here three officers arrived in the doorway two uniforms and a brownhaired detective in blue jeans blue shirt and tan sports coat he had an easygoing smile which was tempered by the fact he wore two very large automatic pistols one on each hip hey roland amelia sachs said smiling rhyme offered havent seen you for a while howdy well you got yourself some catch here roland bell was a transplant from a sheriffs office in north carolina hed been a detective on the nypd for some years but had yet to lose the southern midatlantic twang his specialty was protecting witnesses and making sure suspects didnt escape there was nobody better at the job rhyme was pleased that hed be the one shepherding the watchmaker down to detention hell be in good hands at a nod from bell the patrolmen helped logan to his feet bell checked the shackles and cuffs and then searched the man himself he nodded and they headed for the door the watchmaker turned back saying coyly ill see you again lincoln i know you will im looking forward to it the suspects smile was replaced by a perplexed look rhyme continued ill be the expert forensic witness at your trial maybe there maybe someplace else the man glanced at the breguet dont forget to keep it wound and with that he was gone chapter im sorry to tell you rodolfo the boisterous voice was absent completely arturo no i can hardly believe it rhyme continued explaining about the plot that diaz had engineeredto kill his boss and make it seem like a byproduct of an assassination mission to mexico city in the ensuing silence rhyme asked he was a friend ah friendship i would say when it comes to betrayals the wife who sleeps with a man and returns home to care for your children and to make you a hot meal is less of a sinner than the friend who betrays you for greed what do you say to that captain rhyme betrayal is a symptom of the truth ah captain rhyme you are a buddhist you are a hindu rhyme had to laugh no but you wax philosophical i think the answer is that arturo diaz was a mexican law enforcer and that is reason enough for him to do what he did life is impossible down here yet you persist you continue to fight i do but im a fool much like you my friend could you not be making millions by writing security reports for corporations the criminalist replied but whats the fun of that the laugh was genuine and rich the mexican asked what will happen to him now logan hell be convicted of murder for these crimes and for crimes here several years ago will he get the death penalty he could but he wont be executed why not those liberals in america that i hear so much about its more complicated than that the question is one of momentary politics right now the governor here doesnt want to execute any prisoners whatever theyve done because it would be awkward especially so for the prisoner his opinion doesnt much enter into the matter i suppose not well despite such leniency captain i think i would like america perhaps ill sneak across the border and become an illegal immigrant i could work in mcdonalds and solve crimes at night ill sponsor you rodolfo ha my traveling there is about as likely as you coming to mexico city for mole chicken and tequila yes thats true too though i would like the tequila now im afraid i must go clean out the rats nest that my department has become i may the voice faded whats that commander i may have some questions of evidence i know its presumptuous of me but perhaps i could impose upon you id be delighted to help however i can very good another chuckle perhaps in a few years if i am lucky i can add those magic letters to my name too magic letters ret you retire commander i am making a joke captain retirement is not for people like us we will die on the job lets pray that its a long time from now now my friend goodbye they disconnected rhyme then ordered his phone to call kathryn dance in california he gave her the news about the apprehension of richard logan the conversation was brief not because he was feeling antisocialjust the contrary he was thrilled at his victory but the aftermath of the dysreflexia attack was settling on him like cold dew he let sachs take over the phone call girl talk and rhyme asked thom to bring him some glenmorangie the eighteen year if you would be so kind please and thank you thom poured a generous slug into the tumbler and propped it in the cup holder near his bosss mouth rhyme sipped through the straw he savored the smoky scotch and then swallowed it he felt the warmth the comfort though it also accentuated that damn fatigue plaguing him the past week or so he forced himself not to think about it when sachs disconnected her call he asked youll join me sachs you bet i will i feel like music he said jazz sure he picked dave brubeck a recording from a live concert in the sixties the signature tune take five came on and with its distinctive fivefour beat the music cantered from speakers scratchy and infectious as sachs poured the liquor and sat beside him her eyes strayed to the evidence boards theres one thing we forgot about rhyme what that supposed terrorist group justice for the earth thats mcdaniels case now if wed found any evidence id be more concerned but nothing rhyme sipped more liquor and felt another wave of the persistent fatigue nestle around him still he managed a small joke personally i think it was just a wrong number from the cloud zone chapter the earth day festivities in central park were in full swing at sixtwenty on this pleasant though cool and overcast evening an fbi agent was on the edge of the sheep meadow scanning the crowd most of which were protesting something or another some picnickers and some tourists but the crowd of fifty thousand mostly just seemed pissed off about one thing or another global warming oil big business carbon dioxide greenhouse gases and methane special agent timothy conradt blinked as he looked at a group of people protesting bovine flatulence methane from livestock apparently burned holes in the ozone layer too cow farts what a crazy world conradt was sporting an undercover mustache and wore jeans and a baggy shirt concealing his radio and weapon his wife had ironed the wrinkles into his garments that morning vetoing his idea that he sleep in his clothes to get that livedin look he was no fan of kneejerk liberals and people whod sell the country out in the name of well who knew what complacency europe globalism socialism cowardice but one thing he had in common with these people was the environment conradt lived for the outdoors hunting fishing hiking so he sympathized he was scanning the crowds carefully because even though the perp known as the watchmaker had been collared asac tucker mcdaniel still was sure that that group justice for the earth was going to try something the sigint hits were compelling even nontech conradt had to admit justice for the earth or as the agents were referring to it now per mcdaniels instruction jfte pronounced juftee teams of agents and nypd cops were deployed throughout the city covering the convention center near the hudson river a parade downtown in battery park and this gathering in central park mcdaniels theory was that theyd misread the connection among richard logan algonquin consolidated power and jfte but it was likely that the group could have formed an alliance with possibly an islamic fundamentalist cell a symbiotic construct a phrase that would give the agents plenty of ammunition for the next few months when they were out for drinks conradts own feeling from years on the street was that jfte may have existed but it was just a bunch of cranks of no threat to anybody he strolled around casually but all the while he was looking for people who fit the profile watching where their arms were in relation to their bodies watching for certain types of backpacks watching for a gait that might reveal if they were carrying a weapon or an ied watching for pale jaws that suggested a newly shaved beard or a womans absent touch to her hair possibly indicating her ill ease at being in public without a hijab for the first time since shed reached adolescence and always watching the eyes so far conradt had seen some devout eyes and oblivious eyes and curious eyes but none that suggested they were in the head of a man or woman who wanted to murder a large number of people in the name of a deity or in the name of whales or trees or spotted owls he circulated for a while and finally eased up beside his partner an unsmiling thirtyfiveyearold dressed in a long peasant skirt and a blouse as baggy and concealing as conradts shirt anything a pointless question because she would have called himand every other of the multitude of law enforcers here tonightif shed spotted anything a shake of the head pointless questions werent worth answering aloud in barbs opinion barbara he corrected himself as shed corrected him when they first started working together are they here yet conradt nodded at the stage set up at the south end of the sheep meadow referring to the speakers scheduled to begin at sixthirty the two senators whod flown into the city from washington theyd been working with the president on environmental issues sponsoring legislation that made the green libbers happy and half the corporations in america mad enough to wring their necks over a concert would follow he couldnt decide if most people were here for the music or the speeches with this crowd it was probably evenly divided just got here barbara said they both scanned for a while then conradt said that acronyms weird juftee they should just call it jfte juftees not an acronym what do you mean barbara explained by definition to be an acronym the letters themselves have to spell an actual word in english she gave what he thought was a condescending sigh well in an englishspeaking country obviously so nfl isnt an acronym no thats initials arcamerican resource council thats an acronym conradt thought barbara is a how about bic he asked i suppose i dont know about brand names what does it stand for i forget their radios clattered simultaneously and they cocked their heads be advised the visitors are at the stage repeat the visitors are at the stage the visitorsa euphemism for the senators the command post agent ordered conradt and barbara to move into position on the west side of the stage they made their way forward you know this actually was a sheep meadow conradt told bic the city fathers let them graze here until the thirties then they got moved to prospect park brooklyn the sheep i mean barbara looked at him blankly meaning what does that have to do with anything conradt let her precede him up a narrow path there was a burst of applause and shouts then the two senators were up on the podium the first one to speak leaned forward into the microphone and began talking in low resonant tones his voice echoing across the sheep meadow the crowd was soon hoarse from shouting their mad approval every two minutes or so as the senator fed them platitudes preaching to the converted it was then that conradt saw something off to the side of the stage moving steadily to the front where the senators were standing he stiffened then leapt forward what barbara called reaching for her weapon juftee he whispered and grabbed his radio chapter at pm fred dellray returned to the manhattan federal building from visiting william brent aka stanley palmer aka a lot of other names in the hospital the man was badly injured but had regained consciousness hed be discharged in three or four days brent had already been contacted by the city lawyers about a settlement for the accident being hit by an nypd police officer who fucks up with a squad car was pretty much a nobrainer the figure being offered was about plus medical bills so william brent was having a pretty good couple of days financially at least being the recipient of both the settlement taxfree as a personal injury award and the gs dellray had paid himtaxfree too though solely because the irs and new york department of revenue would never hear a whisper about it dellray was in his office savoring the news that richard logan the watchmaker was in custody when his assistant a sharp africanamerican woman in her twenties said you hear about that earth day thing whats that i dont know the details but that group juftee what jfte justice for the earth whatever it is the ecoterror group dellray set down his coffee his heart pounding its real yep what happened he asked urgently all i heard is they got into central park right near those two senatorsthe ones the president sent down to speak at the rally the sac wants you in his office now anybody hurt killed dellray whispered in dismay i dont know grimfaced the lanky agent stood he started down the hallway quickly his variation of the lope the way he usually walked the gait came of course from the street which he was now about to say goodbye to hed tracked down an important clue to help catch the watchmaker but hed failed in the primary mission to find the terror group and thats what mcdaniel would use to crucify him in his brighteyed yet somber energetic yet subtle way apparently he already had if the sac wanted him well keep at it fred youre doing a good job as he walked he glanced into offices to find somebody to ask about the incident but they were empty it was after hours but more likely he guessed everybodyd sped to central park after justice for the earth was spotted that was perhaps the best indicator that his career was over nobody had even called to request his presence in the operation of course there was another possible reason for that tooand for the summons to the sacs office the stolen k what the hell had he been thinking of hed done it for the city he loved for the citizens he was sworn to protect but did he actually believe hed get away with it especially with an asac who wanted him out and who pored over his agents paperwork like a crosswordpuzzle addict could he negotiate his way out of jail time he wasnt sure with the fuckup over justice for the earth his stock was real low down one corridor of the nondescript office building down another finally he came to the den of the special agent in charge his assistant announced dellray and the agent walked inside the large corner office fred jon the sac jonathan phelps midfifties brushed at his gray sweptback hair pushing it a little further back and motioned the agent into a chair across from his cluttered desk no dellray thought cluttered wasnt the right word it was ordered and organized it was just layered in three inches of files this was after all new york there was a lot that could go wrong and needed mending by people like the sac dellray tried to read the man but could find no clues he too had worked undercover earlier in his career but that wouldnt buy dellray any sympathy that wisp of common past that was one thing about the bureau federal law and the regulations promulgated thereunder trumped everything the sac was the only person in the room which didnt surprise dellray tucker mcdaniel would be reading rights to terrorists in central park so fred ill get right to it sure about this juftee thing justice for the earth right another sweep through the opulent hair it was as ordered after the fingers left as when they arrived i just want to understand you didnt find anything about the group right dellray hadnt gotten this far by poking at the truth no jon i blew it i hit up all my usual sources and a half dozen new ones everybody im running now and a dozen ive retired two dozen i didnt come up with squat im sorry and yet tucker mcdaniels surveillance teams had ten clear hits the cloud zone dellray wasnt going to trash mcdaniel either not even wing him a bit thats what i understand his teams came up with a bucketful of good details the personnelthis rahman johnston and code words about weapons he sighed i heard there was an incident jon what happened oh yeah juftee made a move casualties weve got a video you want to see it dellray thought no sir you betcha i dont the last thing i want to see is people hurt because i screwed up or tucker mcdaniel leading in a takedown team to save the day but he said sure roll it the sac leaned over his laptop and hit some keys then spun the unit around for dellray to look at he expected to see one of the typical bureau surveillance videos shot with a wideangle lens low contrast to pick up all the details information at the bottom location and bythesecond time stamp instead he was looking at a cnn newscast cnn a smiling coiffed woman reporter holding a sheaf of notes was talking to a man in his thirties wearing a mismatched suit jacket and slacks he was darkcomplexioned and his hair was cropped short he was smiling uneasily eyes shifting between the reporter and the camera a young redheaded boy with freckles about eight years old stood next to him the reporter was saying to the man now i understand your students have been preparing for earth day for the past several months thats right the man answered awkward but proud there are a lot of different groups here in central park tonight supporting one issue or another do your students have a particular environmental cause not really they have a lot of different interests renewable energy risks to the rain forest global warming and carbon dioxide protecting the ozone layer recycling and whos your young assistant here this is a student of mine tony johnston johnston hello tony can you tell our viewers at home the name of your environmental club at school uhm yeah its just us kids for the earth and those are quite some posters did you and your classmates make them yourself uhm yeah but you know our teacher mr rahmanhe glanced up at the man beside himhe helped us some well good for you tony and thanks to you and all your fellow students in peter rahmans thirdgrade class at ralph waldo emerson elementary school in queens who believe youre never too young to start making a difference when it comes to the environment this is kathy brigham reporting from under the sacs stabbing finger the screen went blank he sat back dellray couldnt tell if he was going to laugh or utter some obscenity justice he said enunciating carefully just us kids he sighed want to guess how much shit this office is in fred dellray cocked a bushy eyebrow we begged washington for an extra five million dollars on top of the expense of mobilizing four hundred agents two dozen warrants were ramrodded through magistrates offices in new york westchester philly baltimore and boston we had absolutely rock solid sigint that an ecoterror group worse than timothy mcveigh worse than bin laden was going to bring america to its knees with the attack of all time and they turned out to be a bunch of eight and nineyearolds the code words for the weapons paper and supplies they meant paper and supplies the communication wasnt going on in the cloud zone it went on facetoface when they woke up from naptime at school the woman working with rahman it was probably little tony because his goddamn voice hasnt changed yet its a good thing we didnt get sigint hits about somebody quote releasing doves in central park because we mightve called in a fucking surfacetoair missile strike there was silence for a moment youre not gloating fred a shrug of the lanky shoulders you want tuckers job and where will he elsewhere washington does it matter so the asac spot you want it you can move in tonight dellray didnt hesitate no jon thanks but no youre one of the most respected agents in this office people look up to you ill ask you to reconsider i want to be on the street thats all ive ever wanted its important to me sounding as unstreet as any human being possibly could you cowboys the sac chuckled now you might wanta get back to your office mcdaniels on his way here for a conversation im assuming you dont want to meet him probably not as dellray was at the door the sac said oh fred theres one other thing the agent stopped in midlope you worked the gonzalez case didnt you dellray had faced down some of the most dangerous assholes in the city without his pulse speeding up a single beat he now was sure his neck was throbbing visibly as the blood pumped the drug collar staten island right there was a little mixup somewhere it seems mixup yeah with the evidence really the sac rubbed his eyes at the bust your teams scored thirty kis of smack a couple dozen guns and some big bricks of money thats right the press release said the cash recovered was one point one million but we were getting the case ready for the grand jury and it looks like theres only one million even in the evidence locker mislogging a hundred k the sac cocked his head naw its something else not mislogging uhhuh dellray breathed deeply oh man this is it i looked over the paperwork and it was funny the second zero on the chainofcustody card the zero after the one million was real skinny you look at it fast you could think it was a one somebody glanced at it and wrote the press release wrong they wrote one point one i see just wanted to tell you if the question comes up it was a typo the exact amount the bureau collected in the gonzalez bust was one million even thats official sure thanks jon a frown for what clarifying a nod it was a nod with a message and that message had been delivered the sac added by the way you did a good job helping nail richard logan he had that plan a few years ago to take out dozens of soldiers and pentagon people some of our folks too glad hes going away forever dellray turned and left the office as he returned to his own he allowed himself a single nervous laugh third graders then pulled out his mobile to text serena and to tell her that hed be home soon chapter lincoln rhyme glanced up to see pulaski in the doorway rookie whatre you doing here i thought you were logging in evidence in queens i was just his voice slowed like a car hitting a patch of soupy fog just it was close to pm and they were alone in rhymes parlor comforting domestic sounds in the kitchen sachs and thom were getting dinner ready it was rhyme noticed well past cocktail hour and he was a bit piqued that nobody had filled up his plastic tumbler of scotch again a failing he now told pulaski to remedy which the young cop did thats not a double rhyme muttered but pulaski seemed not to hear hed walked to the window eyes outside shaping up to be a dramatic scene from a slowmoving brit drama rhyme deduced and sipped the smoky liquor through the straw ive kind of made a decision i wanted to tell you first kind of rhyme chided once again i mean i have made a decision rhyme raised his eyebrow he didnt want to be too encouraging what was coming next he wondered though he believed he had an idea rhymes life might have been devoted to science but hed also been in charge of hundreds of employees and cops and despite his impatience his gruffness his fits of temper hed been a reasonable and fair boss as long as you didnt screw up go on rookie im leaving the area the force ah rhyme had become aware of body language since hed known kathryn dance he sensed that pulaski was now delivering lines hed rehearsed many times the cop rubbed his hand through his short blond hair william brent dellrays ci right yessir rhyme thought once more about reminding the young man that he didnt need to use such deferential appellations but he said only go on pulaski his face grim eyes turbulent pulaski sat down in the creaking wicker chair near rhymes storm arrow at galts place i was spooked i panicked i didnt exercise good judgment i wasnt aware enough of procedures as if in summary he added i didnt assess the situation properly and adjust my behavior accordingly like a schoolboy who wasnt sure of the test answers and was rattling them off quickly hoping one would stick hes out of his coma but he mightve died and thats why youre quitting i made a mistake it nearly cost somebody his life i just dont feel i can keep functioning at full capacity jesus where did he get these lines it was an accident rookie and one that shouldntve happened are there any other kinds of accidents you know what i mean lincoln its not like i havent thought this through i can prove that you have to stay that itd be wrong for you to quit what say that im talented i have a lot to contribute the cops face was skeptical he was young but he looked a lot older than when rhyme had met him policing will do that so will working with me lincoln rhyme reflected you know why you cant quit youd be a hypocrite pulaski blinked rhyme continued an edge to his voice you missed your window of opportunity whats that mean okay you fucked up and somebody was injured badly but then when it looked like brent was a perp with outstanding paper you thought youd been given a reprieve right well i guess you suddenly didnt care that youd hit him since he was what less than human no i just let me finish the minute after you backed into that guy you had a choice to make either you shouldve decided that the risk of collateral damage and accidents isnt acceptable to you and quit on the spot or you shouldve put the whole thing behind you and learned to live with what happened it doesnt make any difference if that guy was a serial killer or a deacon at his church and its intellectually dishonest for you to whine about it now the rookies eyes narrowed with anger and he was about to offer a defense of some sort but rhyme continued you made a mistake you didnt commit a crime well mistakes happen in this business the problem is that when they do its not like accounting or making shoes when we fuck up theres a chance somebodys going to get killed but if we stopped and worried about that wed never get anything done wed be looking over our shoulders all the time and that would mean more people would die because we werent doing our jobs easy for you to say pulaski snapped angrily good for him rhyme thought but kept his face solemn have you ever been in a situation like this pulaski muttered of course he had rhyme had made mistakes dozens if not hundreds of them it was a mistake years ago one that indeed resulted in the deaths of innocent people that led to the case that brought rhyme and sachs together for the first time but he didnt want a bandofbrothers argument at the moment thats not the point pulaski the point is youve already made your decision coming back here with the evidence from galts after youd run over brent you lost the right to quit so its a nonissue this is eating me up well its time to tell itwhatever the hell it isto stop eating part of being a cop is putting that wall up lincoln youre not listening to me i did listen i considered your arguments and i rejected them theyre invalid theyre valid to me no theyre not and ill tell you why rhyme hesitated because theyre not valid to me and you and i are a lot alike pulaski i myself hate to goddamn admit it but its true this brought the young man up short now forget all this crap youve been boring me with im glad youre here because i need you to do some followup work at the pulaski stared at the criminalist and gave a cold laugh im not doing anything im quitting im not listening to you well youre not going to quit now you can do it in a few days i need you the caseyour case as much as mineisnt over with yet we have to make absolutely sure logans convicted you agree a sigh i agree before mcdaniel got removed from command and sent to the cloud zone or wherever he went he had his men search bob cavanaughs office he didnt call us to do it the bureaus evidence response team is goodi helped set it up but we shouldve walked the grid too i want you to do that now logan was saying theres a cartel involved and i want to make sure every one of them gets nailed a resigned grimace ill do it but thats my last assignment shaking his head the young man stormed from the room lincoln rhyme struggled to keep the smile from his face as he sought the straw sprouting from his tumbler of whisky chapter lincoln rhyme was now alone ron pulaski was walking the grid at algonquin consolidated mel cooper and lon sellitto were back in their respective homes roland bell had reported that richard logan was tucked away safely in a special highsecurity wing of downtown detention amelia sachs had been downtown too helping with the paperwork but was now back in brooklyn rhyme hoped she might be taking a little time to herself maybe to sneak a drive in her cobra torino she occasionally took pammy out on the road the girl reported that the drives were untotallybelievable which he interpreted as meaning exhilarating he knew though that the girl was never in any danger unlike when sachs was by herself she knew the right moment to pull back when her nature tried to assert itself thom was out too with his partner a reporter for the new york times hed wanted to stay at home and keep an eye on his boss watching for horrific side effects from the dysreflexia attack or for who knew what but the criminalist had insisted he go out for the night youve got a curfew hed snapped midnight lincoln ill be back before no youll be back after midnight its a negative curfew thats crazy im not leaving ill fucking fire you if you come back before then the aide examined him carefully and said okay thanks rhyme had no patience for the gratitude and proceeded to ignore the aide as he busied himself on the computer organizing the lists of evidence that would be turned over to the prosecutor for the trial at the end of which the watchmaker would go to jail for an impressive assortment of crimes including capital murder he would surely be convicted but new york unlike california and texas treated the death penalty like an embarrassing birthmark in the middle of its forehead as hed told rodolfo luna he doubted the man would die other jurisdictions would be vying for him too but hed been caught in new york theyd have to wait in line rhyme secretly was not troubled by a life sentence had logan been killed during the confrontation heresay going after a gun to hurt sachs or sellittothat would have been a fair end an honest end that rhyme had captured him and that hed spend the rest of his life in prison was justice enough lethal injection seemed cheap insulting and rhyme wouldnt want to be part of the case that sent the man on that final stroll to the gurney enjoying the solitude rhyme now dictated several pages of crime scene reports some forensic officers wrote lyrical ones dramatic or poetic this wasnt rhymes way the language was lean and hardcast metal not carved wood he reviewed it and was pleased though irritated at the gaps he was waiting for some analytical results to come in still he reminded himself that impatience was a sin too though not one as grave as carelessness and that the case would not suffer if the final report were delayed for a day or two good he allowed more to doalways more to dobut good rhyme looked over the lab left in pristine shape by mel cooper presently at his mothers home in queens where he lived or perhaps after a quick checkin on mom with his scandinavian girlfriend they might be dancing up a storm by now in some ballroom in midtown aware of a slight headache like the one hed experienced earlier he glanced at a nearby shelf of his medications and noticed a bottle of clonidine the vasodilator that had possibly saved his life earlier it occurred to him that if he had an attack at this moment he might very well not survive the bottle was inches away from his hands but it might as well have been miles rhyme looked over the familiar evidence boards filled with sachss and mel coopers writing there were smears and crossouts erasures of false starts misspellings and downright errors an emblem for the way criminal cases always unfolded he then gazed at the equipment the density gradient device the forceps and vials the gloves the flasks the collection gear and the battleships of the line the scanning electron microscope and the chromatographmass spectrometer silent and bulky he thought back on the many many hours hed spent on these machines and their predecessors recalled the sound of the units the smell as he sacrificed a sample in the fiery heart of the chromatograph to learn what a mysterious compound really was often the debate if you destroyed your sole sample to find the identity and whereabouts of the perp you risked jeopardizing the case at trial because the sample had disappeared lincoln rhyme always voted to burn he recalled the rumble of the machine under his hand when his hand could still feel rumbles he now looked too at the snaky wires crisscrossing the parquet floor remembered feelingin his jaw and head only of coursethe bumps as the wheelchair thumped over them on the way from one examining table to another or to the computer monitor wires he then wheeled into the den looking at family pictures thinking of his cousin arthur his uncle henry thinking too of his parents and of amelia sachs of course always of amelia then the good memories faded and he couldnt help thinking about how his failings had nearly cost her her life today because his rebellious body had betrayed them all rhyme and sachs and ron pulaski and who knew how many esu officers who might have been electrocuted storming the rigged school in chinatown from there his thoughts continued to spiral and he realized that the incident was a symbol of their relationship the love was there of course but he couldnt deny that he was holding her back that she was only partly the person she could be if she were with somebody else or even on her own this wasnt selfpity and in fact rhyme was feeling oddly exhilarated by where his thoughts were going he considered what would happen if she were to go on in life alone dispassionately he pictured the scenario and he concluded that amelia sachs would be just fine once again he had an image of ron pulaski and sachs running crime scene in a few years now in the quiet den across from the lab surrounded by pictures of his family rhyme glanced down at something that sat on the table nearby colorful and glossy it was the brochure that the assistedsuicide advocate arlen kopeski had left choices rhyme was amused to note that the brochure had been designed cleverly with the disabled in mind you didnt need to pick it up and flip through it the phone number of the euthanasia organization was printed on the front and in large typein the event that the condition spurring someone to kill himself involved deteriorating vision as he gazed at the brochure his mind spun the plan that was formulating itself would take some organizing it would take some secrecy it would take some conspiracy and bribery but such was the life of a quadriplegic a life where thinking was free and easy but where acting required complicity the plan would take some time too but nothing that was important in life ever happened quickly rhyme was filled with the thrill that comes with making a firm decision his big concern was making sure that his testimony against the watchmaker regarding the evidence could be heard by the jury without rhymes presence theres a procedure for this sworn depositions besides sachs and mel cooper were seasoned witnesses for the prosecution he believed that ron pulaski would be too hed talk to the prosecutor tomorrow a private conversation and have a court reporter come to the townhouse and take his testimony thom would think nothing of it smiling lincoln rhyme wheeled back into the empty lab with its electronics and software andah yesthe wires that would allow him to make the phone call hed been thinking of no obsessing over from virtually the moment the watchmaker was arrested ten days after earth day iv the last case most of the exercise i get is from standing and walking all day from one laboratory table to another i derive more benefit and entertainment from this than some of my friends and competitors get from playing games like golf thomas alva edison chapter amelia sachs and thom reston hurried through the door of the hospital neither spoke the lobby and hallways were calm odd for places like this on a saturday evening in new york city usually chaos ruled in the houses of healing chaos from accidents alcohol poisoning overdoses and of course the occasional gunshot or knife wound here though the atmosphere was oddly eerily sedate grimfaced sachs paused and regarded signs she pointed and they started down an even dimmer corridor in the basement of the hospital they paused again that way sachs whispered its not well marked it should be better marked sachs heard the exasperation in thoms voice but she knew the tone was grounded mostly in dismay there they continued on past a station where nurses sat leisurely chatting behind the high counter there were plenty of official accoutrements of the job papers and files but also coffee cups some makeup and a book of puzzles a lot of sudoku sachs noted wondering why the game had caught on she didnt have the patience she supposed that down here in this department the staff wasnt required to leap into action very often à la tv medicos in emergency rooms at a second counter sachs approached a solitary nurse a middleaged woman and said one word rhyme ah yes the nurse said looking up not needing to consult a chart or any other document and you are his partner she said shed used the term a number of times regarding the man in both the professional and personal sense but had never realized until now how completely inadequate it was she didnt like it hated it thom identified himself as caregiver which too clunked like tin im afraid i dont know any details the nurse said echoing what would have been sachss question come with me the staunch woman led them down another corridor even more grim than the first spotless pleasingly designed ordered and abhorrent what better word to describe hospitals anyway as they approached a room with an open door the nurse said not unsympathetically wait in there please somebody will be in soon the woman was instantly gone as if afraid one of them might shove her into a chair and interrogate her which sachs was half inclined to do she and thom turned the corner and stepped into the waiting room it was empty lon sellitto and rhymes cousin arthur and his wife judy were on their way sachss mother too rose the woman had been going to take the subway here sachs had insisted on a car service they sat in silence sachs picked up yet another sudoku book looked through it thom glanced toward her he squeezed her arm and slumped back it was curious to see him abdicate his usually perfect posture the man said he never said anything not a word that surprises you he began to say that it did but then he slumped even more no a man in a business suit tie askew came into the room looked at the faces of the two already there and decided to wait elsewhere sachs could hardly blame him at times like this you dont want to share a public space with strangers sachs leaned her head against thom who hugged her hard shed forgotten how strong the man was this evening was the culmination of perhaps the strangest and most tense twelve hours in all the years shed known rhyme that morning when shed arrived from spending the night in brooklyn shed found thom gazing at the door expectantly the aide had then glanced behind her and frowned what shed asked also glancing back wasnt he with you who lincoln no goddamn it hes disappeared thanks to the speedy and reliable storm arrow wheelchair rhyme was as mobile as any quad and it was not unheard of for him to drive out to central park on his own though it was also true that the outofdoors held little interest to him rhyme preferring to be in the lab surrounded by his equipment and mentally wrestling with a case the aide had gotten him up early today as rhyme had instructed dressed and deposited him into the wheelchair the criminalist had then said im meeting somebody for breakfast where are we going thom had asked i is singular first person thom we is plural also first person and a pronoun but other than that they have very little in common youre not invited and its for your own sake youd be bored its never boring around you lincoln ha ill be back soon the criminalist had been in such a good mood that thom had agreed but then rhyme simply hadnt returned another hour had gone by after sachs had arrived and curiosity became concern but at that very instant theyd both received an email dinging on computers and blackberrys it was as clipped and functional as one would expect from lincoln rhyme thom sachs after a great deal of deliberation ive concluded that i dont want to continue to live in my current condition no thom had gasped keep reading recent events have made clear that certain inabilities are no longer acceptable to me ive been motivated to act by two things the visit by kopeski which told me that while i would never kill myself nonetheless there are times when the risk of death should not deter one from making a decision the second was meeting susan stringer she said there were no coincidences and that she felt she was fated to tell me about pembroke spinal cord center you know how much i believe in thatand if this is the point where im supposed to type lol its not going to happen ive been in regular discussions with the center and have made four appointments for various procedures over the next eight months the first of these is about to begin of course theres the possibility that i might not make the other three appointments but one can only wait and see if things turn out as i hope ill be giving you all the gory details of the surgery in a day or two if not thom you know where all the paperwork is kept oh and one thing i forgot to put into the will give all my scotch to my cousin arthur hell appreciate it sachs theres another letter for you thom will hand it over sorry i handled it this way but you both have better things to do on this fine day than shepherd a bad patient like me to a hospital and waste time besides you know me some things id just rather do on my own havent had much of a chance to do that in the past few years somebody will call with information late this afternoon or early evening as for our last case sachs i expect to testify at the watchmakers trial in person but if things dont go quite right ive filed my depositions with the attorney general you and mel and ron can take up the slack make sure mr logan spends the rest of his life in jail this thought from someone ive been close to describes what im feeling perfectly times change we have to change too whatever the risks whatever we have to leave behind lr and now in the abhorrent hospital they waited finally an official a tall man in green scrubs with graying hair slim walked into the room youre amelia sachs thats right and thom a nod the man turned out to be the chief surgeon of the pembroke spinal cord center he said hes come through the surgery but hes still unconscious he continued explaining technical things to them sachs nodded taking in the details some seemed good some seemed less so but mostly she noted that he wasnt answering the one question that matterednot about the success of the surgery in technical terms but when or if lincoln rhyme would swim back to consciousness when she bluntly posed that question the best the doctor could say was we just dont know well have to wait chapter the d swirls of fingerprints evolved not to help forensic scientists identify and convict criminals but simply to give our digits sure purchase so that whatever we were holding that was precious or necessary or unrecognized wouldnt slip from our frail human grasp we are after all bereft of claws and our muscle tonesorry ardent health club devoteesis truly pathetic compared with that of any wild animal of comparable weight the official title of the patterns on the fingers feet too is in fact friction ridge revealing their true purpose lincoln rhyme glanced briefly at amelia sachs who was ten feet away curled up sleeping in a chair in an oddly content and demure pose her red hair fell straight and thick bisecting her face nearly midnight he returned to his contemplation of friction ridges they occur on digits which word includes both fingers and toes and on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet you can be convicted as easily by an incriminating sole print as by a fingerprint though the circumstances of the crime in which one was involved would surely be a bit unusual people have known about the individuality of friction ridges for a long timethey were used to mark official documents eight hundred years agobut it wasnt until the s that prints became recognized as a way to link criminal and crime the worlds first fingerprint department within a law enforcement agency was in calcutta india formed under the direction of sir edward richard henry who gave his name to the classification system of fingerprinting used by police for the next hundred years the reason for rhymes meditation on fingerprints was that he was presently looking at his own for the first time in years for the first time since the accident in the subway his right arm was raised flexed at the elbow the wrist and palm twisted so that it was facing him and he was gazing intently at the patterns he was thoroughly exhilarated filled with the same sensation as when hed find the tiny fiber the bit of trace evidence the faint impression in the mud that allowed him to make a connection between suspect and crime scene the surgery had worked the implantation of the wires the computer controlled by movements of his head and shoulders above the site of his injury hed begun tightening muscles in his neck and shoulder to levitate the arm carefully and rotate the wrist seeing his own fingerprints had long been a dream of his and hed decided that if he could ever regain arm movement gazing at the whorls and ridges would be the first thing hed do thered be much therapy ahead of him of course and hed have the other operations too nerve rerouting which would have little effect on mobility but might improve some bodily functions then stem cell therapy and physical rehabilitation too the treadmill and bicycle and rangeofmotion exercises there would be limitations too of coursethoms job wasnt in any danger even if his arms and hands moved even if his lungs were working better than ever and the business below the waist was approaching that of the nondisabled he still had no sensation was still subject to sepsis would not walkprobably never would or at least not for many years but this didnt bother lincoln rhyme hed learned from his work in forensics that you rarely got percent of what you sought but usually with hard work and the alignment of circumstancenever in rhymes view luck of coursewhat you did achieve was enough for the identification the arrest the conviction besides lincoln rhyme was a man who needed goals he lived to fill gaps toas sachs knew wellscratch the itch his life would be useless without having someplace to go constantly someplace to go now carefully using faint movements of the muscles in his neck he rotated his palm and lowered it to the bed with all the coordination of a newborn foal finding its legs then exhaustion and the residue of the drugs were all over him rhyme was certainly prepared to sleep but he chose instead to postpone oblivion for a few minutes resting his eyes on amelia sachss face pale and half visible through her hair like the midpoint of a lunar eclipse acknowledgments warm thanks to crimespree magazine the muskego wisconsin library and all those who attended the murder and mayhem gettogether there last november and won this product placement
