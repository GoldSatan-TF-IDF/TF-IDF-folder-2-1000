answers and finally thanks to luke for suggesting nanotechnology when i told him i was stuck anyone i overlooked i promise to get you next time chapter the rotors of marine one slowed then stopped dust clouds billowed into the still air minutes later a second identical helicopter landed twenty yards away a short staircase lowered to the parched ground a marine sergeant in formal dress left the shelter of the first chopper and took a position at attention at the base of the staircase the door of the chunky sikorsky sea king swung open and with no more fanfare than that the most powerful man on earth his ubiquitous wellpublicized dog at heel stepped out into the warm wyoming evening fifty feet away still in the saddle gabe singleton calmed his horse with a few pats behind the ear the midmorning appearance of a secret service agent at the ambrose regional medical center had given gabe warning that the presidential dropin was going to take place but the man hadnt been specific about the time and following an exhausting allnighter caring for two patients in the icu even a visitor of this magnitude couldnt keep gabe from his customary ride out into the desert and back hey cowboy president andrew stoddard called out descending the stairs and sincerely saluting the lone marine as he passed whattaya say i say you and your choppers scared the crap out of this worldweary old nag frightened my horse too the two men shook hands then embraced stoddard who gabe felt looked presidential even when they were firstyear roommates at the naval academy showed the stress of three and a half years in office silver highlighted his razorcut dark brown hair and deep crowsfeet had appeared at the corners of his iridescent blue eyes still he was every bit the man in chargethe decorated desert storm pilot and former governor of north carolina whose star had been on the ascendancy since the day he took his first privileged breath one of the downsides of the job stoddard said gesturing toward his entourage twin helicopters so that any whacko who decides to take a bazooka shot at one of them has only a fiftyfifty chance of blowing me away secret service studs checking out every inch thats gonna be stepped on by these size elevens and every toilet seat thats gonna be graced by these presidential cheeks plus a medical team trained to know that its not if something terrible happens to their boss its when if youre looking to make a job change i could use a wrangler on my ranch how many do you have working for you now stoddard asked glancing about you would be the first im afraid our benefits package is a little thin too starting with that youd have to pay me to work here hey put me on the list i dont know if you follow the polls or not but i havent got a hell of a lot of job security at the moment got some time to talk with an old pal if youll let me put my other old pal condor here in the stables finelooking horse and thats a finelooking pooch liberty right gabe patted the dogs rocksolid flank good memory stoddard said libertys making quite a name for himself tagging along with me and changing peoples misperceptions about pit bulls just like were changing peoples misconceptions about america ive had dogs all my life gabe but liberty here is the best strong as a tiger wise as an owl and as gentle and dependable as that horse of yours maybe you should have named him simile the president laughed out loud i love it this heres my trusty dog simile hes tough as a tennessee hickory nut but gentle as baby powder carol will think thats very funny too especially since unlike her husband shes actually likely to know the difference between a simile and a metaphor hey griz a thicknecked barrelchested balding secret service man wearing the obligatory black suit and reflective shades seemed to materialize from nowhere you rang griz this is my old college roomie gabe singleton doctor gabe singleton its been five years or so since we last saw one another but it seems like yesterday gabe this heres treat griswold my numberone protector and probably the numbertwo man in the whole secret service obsessive to a fault swears hes telling the truth when he says hell take that proverbial bullet for me but with that crooked smile and those beady little eyes of his i just dont believe him in that case sir youll just have to wait and see griswold said stopping just short of pulverizing the bones in gabes hand at the same time ill be happy to get condor settled in doctor i used to muck out stables and ride warmups when i was a kid gabe liked the secret service agent immediately in that case youve come a long way he said handing over the reins tack rooms in the barn maybe we can go for a ride sometime maybe we can sir griswold said come on liberty lets put this big ol fellow to bed stoddard took gabe by the arm and led him to the back door the house seven rustic rooms that still had the feel of the cabin it was before some additions was gabes cut from the end of his fiveyear marriage to cynthia townes a bright vivacious nurse from the hospital who loved him to pieces from day one to day last her mistake cinnies last words to him before she handed over her keys and took off for a teaching job in cheyenne were to beg him to finish dealing with his past before he made any further attempts to build a future with anyone for seven more years he had taken her at her word and so had carefully avoided another indepth connection he might be done dealing with his past but he had serious doubt it was ever going to be done dealing with him sorry i havent gotten out here for so long stoddard said i used to really enjoy the evening rides and our fishing trips up into those mountains the laramies theres no place on earth quite like them but stow the apologies matie from what ive heard youve had a few other things on your platelike saving the world stoddard grinned wistfully its a little bigger a job than i once thought he said settling in at the round oak table in the kitchen but i still intend to make a dent in it i remember you talking like that during our first or second night of barhopping together at the academy i kept trying to stay cynical and believe that you were an idealistic jerk but this little voice inside me kept saying that this was a guy who might actually be able to do it then when you drank me under the table i really decided to give you the benefit of the doubt that was beginners luck and you know it you must have had a virus or something speaking of which it should come as no surprise that i cant offer you a beer but i can brew you some coffee oror some tea tea would be great the president said placing a manila folder in front of him while im in apology mode sorry i couldnt make it in for your dads funeral i appreciated your letting me know he had passed and i appreciated that you would take the time to call from south america your dad was a bit quirky but i always did like him he was very proud of you drew you being a fellow annapolis grad and all the instant he spoke the words gabe wished he hadnt cinnies pleas notwithstanding he had done what he could to deal with fairhaven and his fathers reaction to it he hadnt meant the statement to come out the way it did im sure he was very proud of you too gabe stoddard said a bit uncomfortably what with your md degree and all those medical missions youve been on and that youth foundation youre running thanks hey speaking of sires hows yours doing same old lemar still trying to micromanage everything including me he tells me hes bought his way onto a russian space shot fifteen million and he becomes the first seventyfiveyearold to soak his hemorrhoids in the international space station tub fifteen million god bless him hey come on when were talking about my father its like monopoly money just do the math the ten billion or so hes worth minus the fifteen million or so he spent is um take away three carry the onestill ten billion or so i wouldnt be surprised if he paid in cash with bills he pulled out of his sock drawer gabe smiled if over the years he had suffered from too little father drew stoddard had suffered from too much from his days in diapers stoddard had been molded by the charismatic wildly successful industrialist the heartache buzz singleton endured when gabe was drummed out of the naval academy had to pale next to lemar stoddards having to explain to his pals at the hunt club or the polo pitch or wherever that drew had become a democratand one of the shining stars of the party at that did drews remarkable transformation from elitist republican to populist democrat have its roots in the accident at fairhaven all those years ago gabe often wondered in such an inestimable tragedy not even the bystanders and innocents like drew stoddard escaped unchanged gabe set a pot of earl grey tea and some shortbread on the table there was a time before the last presidential election when the two of them got together once or twice a year to hike and fish in the smokies or laramies and exchange news and stories but now despite their longstanding friendship gabe felt strangely edgy about taking up the time of the most powerful man in the solar system with small talk still this lastminute trip to tyler was stoddards doing so it seemed right to let him set the agenda gabe didnt have long to wait did you know that in addition to the comprehensive medical facility on the first floor of the eisenhower office building we have our own medical clinic right in the white house stoddard began you said something about it in one of our conversations yes its run by the white house medical unit which for reasons lost in antiquity is actually a division of the white house military office pretty nice setup toorecently renovated stateoftheart equipment topnotch nurses and paramedics and the best doctors from all branches of the service twentyfive or thirty staff altogether they take care of me and carol and the boys when theyre home from school as well as vice president cooper and his family and anyone else who happens to need medical care while theyre at the white house the boysthey doing well terrific andrews going into eleventh rickll be in ninth both are at school in connecticut right now theyre at soccer camp andrews an allstar goalie rick plays because he thinks he should he wants to go to the academy and be an astronaut think you can get him in i think he can get in on his own but i may keep an eye on his application eleventh and ninththats amazing theyre happy and healthy thats all that really matters speaking of healthy you had your doc from north carolina come up to dc to care for you yes jim ferendelli hes been a great doctor for me and the family the best kind knowledgeable empathetic plays beautiful classical piano too im really glad to hear all that drew having a doctor one can trust is a huge weight off of anyones shoulders i agree but im glad to hear you verbalize it just the same well thats how i feel although when it comes to caring for the president of the united states i assume you know im just stating the obvious your wellbeing and good health have an effect one way or another on every person on the planet stoddard laughed with no great glee i understand what youre saying but i still get the willies thinking about things that way its a hell of a job you signed on for i dont envy that responsibility in the least but i still have your support of course in that case it should come as no surprise that i didnt break away to fly here in the midst of a heated campaign just because i missed your smiling face i need something from you gabe something important name it i need you to come to washington and be my doctor gabe sank back in his chair and stared at his onetime roommate in utter disbelief but you said this jim ferendelli is a terrific doctor he is was gabe felt as if a band were tightening around his chest i dont understand he finally managed gabe stoddard said jim ferendellis gone vanished chapter what about the fbi you dont think theyre all over this hundreds of agents have been on the case for almost two weeks nothing evening had settled in and a steady breeze from the north had dispelled the last of the days warmth gabe had listened in stunned silence to the description of a fiftysixyearold widower devoted father of a grown daughter personable and diligent churchgoing and humble who one day simply failed to show up at work a search of his apartment in georgetown and his chapel hill home revealed nothing out of the ordinary and a check of his phone and emails had also been of no help with the presidential campaign just heating up andrew stoddards advisors had managed to keep the potentially distracting disappearance out of the news until they were certain the search was not going to be successful for more than a week now that was clearly the case and what scant details there were had just been released to the press theyve all been told that for now the white house medical unit would handle any problems i might have but as competent as the unit is i really want my own physician this is absolutely incredible gabe said the doctor to the president of the united states has vanished without a trace what about his family have they heard anything as i said jims wife died of cancer about five years ago his mothers in a nursing home and two older sisters havent heard a word from him but you also said he had a daughter has she heard anything actually jennifers disappeared too what shes a graduate film student at nyu the evening of the day jim disappeared jennifers roommate came home from a date and jennifer wasnt there but the fbi already was there was no evidence she had packed anything no note nothing they tried every number the roommate could think of but just like her father the girl had simply vanished gabe could only shake his head jesus he muttered do you make any sense of this drew any sense at all do you think this is politically related maybe its just a coincidence of some sort like an accident or or a mental crisis was the daughter stable a terrific kid some therapy after her mother died but none for years as far as we can tell no drugs minimal drinker no current boyfriend but her last one had only good things to say was ferendelli seeing anyone not that weve been able to determine gabe rubbed his eyes and studied the vaulted redwood ceiling i wish i could help you drew he said at last really i do but theres just too much going on here actually stoddard said magnus lattimore my chief of staff has been here in tyler for a few days nosing about hes discreet and very very efficient and he can move very quietly when he needs to like the guys in the suits and sunglasses out there just like them yes terrific im not sure i want to know what he learned well lets see both of your partners say they can hold down the fort for the time between now and the election in november apparently you guys just hired a new physicians assistant named lillian lawrence whos in a position to absorb a lot of the load that sending you off on a working sabbatical would generate one of your partners said lillian is probably smarter than you are anyway gabe was unable to stifle a grin which one he asked sorry he swore magnus to secrecy its not that simple drew in addition to my patients i have a commitment to my foundation you mean lariat uhoh whatd magnus learn about that he learned that over the years youve kept more than a few kids from heading down the wrong path by getting them involved in rodeo and other riding projects so he must have learned how important it is to me and me to it what he learned is that there isnt a soul in southeast wyoming with money to donate that you havent successfully squeezedmost of them more than once ive always been a determined little beaver when i set my mind to it well yesterday magnus had lunch withstoddard opened the folder and scanned one of the pagesirene dejesus she told him you never do much work around lariat anyway if irene said that shes toast but i know she didnt okay okay she said she would have to recruit three or four people to match what you do with the kids each week thats better she also said that a lot of your efforts lately have gone into planning and raising money for an indoor riding facility were getting there gabe take this job for me and you are there gabe felt his pulse leap sooner or later the new stables and riding arena were going to happen but at the moment they were still little more than an ambitious dream you would do that he asked the day you set foot in the white house medical office an anonymous angel will donate fifty thousand dollars to lariat if that isnt enough to finish the job i know another angel or two who will want to help another volley of skipped heartbeats bake sales and silent auctions could only take things so far so fast and other lariat projects had all but tapped out their regular boosters fundraising for this dream had been surprisingly slow and there were at least a dozen boys and girls on the waiting list who could be brought on board along with the staff to deal with them the moment the arena and stables were finished gabe paced across the kitchen and back he had no doubt that if drew stoddard promised money for lariat money there would be i cant believe gabe said that with a machine as efficient as this magnus working for you youre worried about getting elected well i am worried this campaigns going to be a marathon brad dunleavy is a warrior who has already served a term as president our two parties are poised and ready to claw one another to shreds control of both houses of congress could hang on a single seat but you know what gabe i just heard what i was saying about arranging for your project to be funded if you come to dc and im taking it all back you dont deserve to have me sit here bribing you that was magnuss idea but now that ive done it i dont like the way it sounds and i dont like the way i feel after all youve been through and the way youve bounced back and all the people youve helped you just dont deserve it so i give you my word that regardless of what you decide about coming to washington the money you need will be here for you and all the kids you serve gabe knew he was surroundedoutflanked outmaneuvered no wonder the man had never lost an election was the sudden commitment to fund lariats expansion irrespective of gabes decision part of magnus lattimores carefully designed strategy or was drew being legitimately spontaneous and sincere and most important did it really matter how can you tell a politician is lying his lips are moving who first said that if drew was being the politician he deserved to have gabe simply say okay ill take the money and you find another replacement doctor but that wasnt going to happen gabe sighed and sat down across from his friend the accident at fairhaven is bound to come up he said how would you plan to deal with what happened there thanks to you and what youve accomplished with your life since your release thats not going to be as big a deal as you might think says magnus lattimore and others gabe gazed through the rear window at the violet sky and the silhouette of marine one as always his mind balked at dredging up the accident and the terrible aftermath and as always the imagesas far as they wentwere inexorable he and drew like many of the secondyear midshipmen were celebrating the end of the term with a veritable olympiad of drinking games conducted at a variety of bars rockfish acme mcgarveys the boatyard was the last stop gabe remembered but according to court records there were several more as almost always on what they called drinkathons drew stoddard was at gabes side if not matching him glass for glass and bottle for bottle as he once could do at least making a respectable effort fairhaven wasnt the first time gabe had drunken himself into a blackout in fact since high school he had been somewhat notorious for them he took pride in describing himself as a hardridin hardstudyin hardfightin hardlovin harddrinkin sonofagun and few of those who knew him well would dispute any of those claims nor could anyone argue with a high school valedictorian and rodeo champ who was also coveted by the football coach at navy as a running back although gabe never bothered to try out for the team an alcoholic doesnt usually start off as a failure gabes aa sponsor would tell him one day he often has to work and drink very hard to become one gabes blood alcohol levelcould have been lethal in a body less adapted to heavy drinking even a twentyyearolds body his blackout came and went over the hours following the accident he remembered the rainsoaked ground at the bottom of the steep embankment and pawing at the blood cascading down into his eyes he remembered drews quavering voice calling to him from somewhere in the darkness asking him over and over if he was all right and he remembered the police and the handcuffs it was hours after he lost control of the borrowed car jumped the median and plowed headon into the subcompact being driven by a young pregnant woman before his mind began permanently to clear but he never remembered any details of the accidentnot one and he remembered absolutely nothing of the young woman he had killed along with her unborn child gabe the presidents voice cut into his thoughts but did not dispel them entirely huh oh sorry its still hard isnt it its not the sort of thing i was put together to deal with if thats what you mean i just cant imagine the washington press corps wont dredge up every lurid detail a year in prison isnt exactly what the american public would consider a ringing endorsement for the man taking care of their leader my people assure me it wont be that bad you took the punishment society gave you and you went on with a life of service to others even the nastiest of reporters knows it could have been them behind the wheel that night and even the most jaded can appreciate what youve accomplished since then thanks for saying that we both know it hasnt been easy or really all that successful that kid would be over thirty now sometimes i find myself wondering what he might have grown up to be the statement though absolutely true seemed to catch stoddard by surprise for a time the decorated desert storm fighter pilot now commander in chief of the most powerful armed forces ever assembled seemed unable to respond thirtytwo years had passed since fairhaven and still gabes wounds were raw and at times festering gabe i mean it stoddard said finally i came all the way out here personally because i really need you the campaign is already taking its toll on my health headaches stomach pains insomnia intermittent diarrhea name a symptom ive had it jims been secretly having neurologic tests run for headaches ive been havingmigraines hes been calling them i need someone i can trustsomeone who is above the washington gossipmongers someone i can bank the future of this country on the fbi is still going full bore to find ferendelli and the investigative arm of the secret service if hes found and wants his job back im coming home you have my word damn but im not excited about this drew i know im a frigging homebody except for the missions to central america the closest i come to going anyplace is reading travel and leisure magazine at the dentists office my partners love me because im always around to cover for them in case of any emergency so they said dammit stoddard why are you looking and acting like you already know im gonna cave in stoddards boyish smile had probably won him or million votes in the last election because youre a good man dr singleton and you know this is the right thing to do how much time do i have to get ready according to magnuss inquiries two days should be enough im looking forward to meeting up with this magnus of yours in dc stoddard asked in dc mr president chapter the white house physicians clinic was situated directly across the corridor from the elevator to the first familys residence standing before the bathroom mirror in the elegant threeroom office gabe sensed he would have been more at ease had he been stationed in a clinic in downtown baghdad it was just after seven in the evening as promised the tuxedo complete with shoes had arrived at the office at precisely six the size was perfect in every respectnot surprisingly since the arrangements had been made through the social office of the president by magnus lattimore unfortunately the garment bag failed to include either a clipon or instructions on how to knot the enclosed bow tiea rare if understandable lattimore oversight gabe watched as the hands that had lassoed steers hung on to bucking broncos and sutured innumerable lacerations struggled to create even a passable knot the directions he had printed out from the internet were propped up on the sink in addition to his limited dexterity he looked tired and strained the zygomatic arches above his cheeks were even more pronounced than usual and his dark eyes which cinnie had called his sexiest feature seemed lost no surprise four whirlwind days in a new apartment new city and new job were taking their toll the formal dinner reception scheduled for eight in the state dining room was ostensibly to welcome the recently reelected president of botswana according to the africa expert sent by lattimore to brief gabe the country was a staunch ally of the united states and one of the enduring democracies on the continent in truth the guest list had carefully been stacked with dignitaries and cabinet members who were interested in meeting the man the president had selected to bring stability to the white house medical office another try at the knot another morbid failure the muscles in gabes neck and shoulders always the physical receptacle in his body for stress and emotional fatigue were drumhead tight and a throbbing headache was developing beneath his temples some sort of medicine would help make the evening more bearable he decidedmaybe a couple of tylenols with codeine since fairhaven he had sworn off alcohol forever and for his first few years out of prison he had expanded that pledge to boycott all manner of drugs as well but with an array of orthopedic maladies dating back to his rodeo and football days and stressrelated head and neck aches tylenol and ibuprofen had intermittently begun surrendering to darvon and tylenol no with whatever happened to be in the medicine cabinet thrown in from time to time for those discomforts that crossed the imaginary line between dull ache and disruptive pain he knew relying on pain pills and even the antidepressants he resorted to from time to time wasnt the smartest behavior for an alcoholic in recovery and he knew that there was always the danger he would be conjuring up the pains to justify taking the drugs but he had gone about as far in life as he could go in terms of doing the right thing he set the tie and the instructions in the sink brought a glass of water to the exquisite cherrywood desk the white house decorators had determined was appropriate for the inner office of the physician to the president and fished out two tylenols with codeine from the thirty or so he had transferred to a bottle that read simply tylenol if anyone found out about the deception or discovered the envelopes of demerol and antidepressants in the eyeglass case in the back of his drawer so be it if drew had asked him about pills he would have told him the truth probably should have said something anyhow if he had he might still be back in tyler taking care of folks with calluses on their hands and teaching kids how to throw a lasso but in the end he decided it was his business and his business only the world knew quite enough about him as it was the codeine had just begun its journey from stomach to brain when with a firm knock the door to the receptionists office opened hello a mans voice not one that gabe recognized called out im in here gabe replied the admirals dress whites seemed to throw off at least as much light as the desk lamp and the golden scrambled eggs insignia on the brim of his cover appeared possessed of its own inner glow he stepped across the threshold and with his gaze fixed on gabe reached back and closed the door ellis wright he said giving gabes hand a perfunctory pump my apologies for not having come by sooner but i was overseas when you came on board i assume you know who i am the two photos of the man lattimore had shared with gabe did not do the imposing officer full credit nor did craggy and steely the adjectives that had first come to gabes mind when he saw them ellis wright was every fiber a military commanderramrod straight and rock jawed with gunmetal eyes and shoulders that seemed mitered at perfect ninetydegree angles given just one guess as to what he did for a living few would ever be wrong gabe wondered if wrights eyes were always this cold or the look had been reserved for him ellis wright holds sway over virtually everything that moves or breathes around the president lattimore had said during his briefing except you and to a much lesser extent me nobody has any control over you other than the potus himself and even he had better be careful trying to order you about before president stoddard took office his predecessor brad dunleavy allowed wright to choose a military md to be his personal physician so it should come as no surprise that wright resented having a civilian assume this position when jim ferendelli was appointed i think its safe to anticipate that hell have issues with you for the same reason around here everything boils down to proximity and access to the potus and first ferendelli and now you nudge wright back a notch in that regard im the head of the white house military office wright still standing was saying the militarys involvement with the smooth efficient running of the presidency dates back to george washington were responsible for communications emergency operations the airlift group helicopter squadron one camp david the white house transportation agency the white house mess andhe paused unsubtly for emphasisthe white house medical unit were military with a capital m if the president so much as thinks of something he wants done our people will have already started doing it is that clear pretty clear yes you um want to sit down gabe stopped himself at the last possible moment from asking if the admiral also headed a department that knew anything about bow ties i intend to say what i have to say and leave wright went on i can do both standing you sound like something of a wiseass singleton are you a wiseass gabe cocked his head and hoped his expression said that he was open to any frank discussion but he was not going to be easily pushed around admiral he said ive been brought here to take care of the president im board certified in internal medicine and ive worked in big gleaming hospitals and in central american jungles most people who know me and know medicine think im pretty competent at what i do if thats your definition of a wiseass then maybe we have a problem i told the president when he was considering a replacement for dr ferendelli and im telling you now we have doctors in every branch of the military who are so knowledgeable precise and clinically competent that i doubt most doctors including you could carry their instrument bags this is a military operation and you are needed here about as much as a bull needs tits the president doesnt seem to think so i know all about what happened to you at the academy singleton kicked out for being a drunk and killing a couple of people you still a drunk pill popper it was time gabe decided to meet his new nemesis eyetoeye he exhaled as he stood wondering how the presidents spin doctors would deal with a fistfight between the presidents private physician and the head of the white house military office at just a shade under six feet gabe was still looking up at the admiral he had the fleeting cartoon image of his fist slamming against the mans angular jaw and shattering into a million pieces exactly what do you want admiral he asked i wonder dr singleton if you have taken the time to learn anything about this job you have signed on to do wrights metallic eyes sparked for instance the details of the twentyfifth amendment to the united states constitution presidential succession gabe said grateful to have that much knowledge although he remembered at the same instant that wright had asked for details actually wright said with unbridled disdain presidential succession was dealt with in the presidential succession law of and modified in to include the succession following the vice president of two elected officialsthe president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house oh gabe felt the slight calming effect of the codeine kick in and welcomed the sensation in the short time between drews trip to wyoming and his own flight on air force one to washington no one had discussed the provisions of the twentyfifth amendment with him assuming that not doing so was an oversight on magnus lattimores part the seriousness of the lack of bow tie instructions had just been supplanted the twentyfifth amendment wright went on deals with the inability of the president to reliably conduct the duties of his office it took years to hammer out the precise wording and the most junior of my white house medical officers could summarize the amendment section by section many of them know the whole thing verbatim the ones ive met have certainly seemed very bright as the presidents personal physician i want you to review the presidential law of succession and memorize the twentyfifth amendment wright demanded and i want you to stop barking orders at a civilian was gabes kneejerk reply especially one who has been chosen by the president to be his personal physician gabe transiently felt as if he were going to melt before the mans gaze and power they put their pants on one leg at a time just like the rest of us his high school football coach used to say about an intimidating opponent at that moment gabe could not imagine admiral ellis wright ever being out of uniform i am the head of this medical unit wright said with controlled fury if anything unusual goes on here and i am not informed i promise i will squash you like a bug you could never qualify to be considered military my friend but that doesnt mean for one second that you are not vulnerable if you wish to learn how vulnerable simply let me find out that you have been withholding information about the president from me i will see you at dinner wright executed a perfect turn opened the door and had taken one step into the reception area when he stopped cromartie what in the hell are you doing here he snapped i im the covering nurse tonight sir a womans quavering voice replied seven until midnight for several seconds there was only silence well wright said finally if anything dr singleton and i just discussed gets back to me youre the first one i am going to come looking for yes sir i mean the door was closed sir i mean i didnt hear very much civilians wright grumbled as the outer door opened and slammed shut cromartie the name meant nothing to gabe but there were still a number of unit nurses and physicians assistants and even a couple of doctors he had yet to meet well come on in nurse cromartie he called out the admiral wright fan club is now in session gabe heard a magazine being dropped onto the table and moments later alison cromartie appeared in the doorway to his office chapter radiant the word filled gabes thoughts the instant he saw alison cromartie for the first time absolutely radiant what admiral ellis wrights starched whites did to light up a room alison accomplished wearing nothing more imposing than a crisply tailored green pants suitmaybe jade green gabe decidedand a muted yellow top no jewelry and if she wore makeup at all it was precious little and impeccably applied gabe flashed on his reaction to first meeting cinnie in the hospital er when he vowed on the spot that this was the woman he was going to marry no such pledges here but he did sense immediately that this was someone he was going to enjoy being around her looks were unusual and exoticmixed nationalities of some sort he guessedwith smooth light mocha skin and a trim athletes body her jet hair was cut short and her face dominated by dark curious eyes seemed ready to laugh at the slightest provocation she shook his hand firmly and introduced herself keeping her gaze fixed on him just long enough to express interest from what i just heard out there gabe said motioning her to the chair opposite his youre not an admiral wright appointee yet here you are here i am she replied matteroffactly so howd you manage that i used to work with a surgeon whos a friend of president stoddard he recommended me i think hes a bigtime fundraiser as well no accent whatsoeverif anything a hint of the south alison cromartie either was american born or had one hell of an english teacher so have you had to take care of the potus potus gabe grinned when i got here i thought i was the only one in the city who had never heard the acronym acronym oh president of the united states no i met him once but i havent been involved in his care i like the acronym though im always the last one to hear about anything thats in theres even flotus for the first lady for those who absolutely cant live without abbreviating things well when the potus recommended me to the admiralinsisted he hire me would probably say it betterdr ferendelli was still here then soon after i arrived to begin work he was gone its a measure of my personal growth that i didnt feel responsible aha one of those another club we both belong tothe loyal and honored order of i would have been the cause of world war two if i had only been alive when it started gabe added alisons smile and laugh to the list of attributes he felt drawn to so hows it been going for you so far she asked this is only like my fourth day but so far so goodexcept for all the protocol ive had to absorb and that little exchange with admiral starch that doesnt count did you hear the part about how i couldnt carry the military docs medical bags i did hear that yes actually as far as i can tell the military docs and nurses and pas working in this unit are pretty damn good ive been impressed with the same thing but ill bet youre a pretty darn good doc yourself as far as i know most of my patients and colleagues back in wyoming think so how about the stuff about my drinking did you hear that too i um tried not to alisons blush was genuine no big deal its been yearsdecades evensince my last one you dont have to justify yourself to me my dad was in aa he was creole drinking was a way of life where he was raised besides im in the habit of forming my own opinion about people howm i doing so far you were doing perfect until you asked again that smile well dont worry im much less insecure when im running a code lets hope you never have to prove that to me here but i have a feeling that in crunch time you can handle yourself pretty well her expression gave the statement a thousand layers gabe was working probably too hard at formulating a response when his radio sounded this is piper magnus lattimores detached voice said has anyone seen the doc this is dr singleton i copy direct doc its magnus you still in the office how did you know where i was yes yes i am ill be by to escort you to dinner in ten minutes roger and doc yes whatever the admiral had to say pay no attention hes just spraying to mark off his territory just spraying roger that your first state dinner alison said as gabe set the radio down how exciting ill tell you whatyou go to the dinner and ill man the fort here im a wrangler not a minglerespecially not sober whos the dinner for um depending on who you ask that would be either the president of botswana or to a lesser extent me the guest of honor more like an auxiliary guest of honor people are jittery over dr ferendellis disappearance so president stoddard wanted everyone to get a look at the man who was taking his place and to know he was in reliable medical hands makes sense well in that case i think some sort of tie is called for to go along with the rest of that tuxperhaps the one i noticed casually resting in the bathroom sink its being punisheda timeout for insubordination nothing worse than a surly disrespectful bow tie ive dealt with its kind before well make this one behave and you get a years supply of tongue depressors plus a rubber glove blown up and decorated like a rooster you drive a hard bargain you got that right alison retrieved the tie and took less than a minute up on her tiptoes inches away from him to knot it wishing it had taken longer gabe breathed in what might have been her shampoo or a microdot of subtle perfume he decided as she stepped back to appraise her handiwork that he would try for a guinness record for breath holding before he had to exhale there you are doc she said not bad not bad at all congratulations nurse you have been of great service to the united states of america i want my rooster smiling and autographed she replied chapter direct sunlight never found its way into the threehundredfootlong underpass beneath levalee street the tunnel just a few miles from the seats of justice and government of the most powerful nation on earth was a living teeming monument to the havenots in this richest of societies in fact in many ways the rules of this microcosm were as complex and constricting as those of the civilization that surrounded it and chief among those rules was never to deal with outsiders the man appeared at the south opening of the squalid corridor just as dusk was settling in over the city he wore a light brown suit over a dark knit shirt and looked average in every way at least until he extracted a powerful flashlight and a noisesuppressedcaliber heckler koch pistol from loops on his belt he had learned to kill game as a child in mississippi and humans as a sniper in the army and then had honed his skills over the dozen years since his discharge the name he used most was carlcarl eric porterbut there were many others as usual he was being well paid and as usual he was relishing every aspect of his job for a time porter stood motionless his eyes adjusting to the gloom with no great effort he closed his senses to the stench of garbage filth urine whiskey and vermin he had encountered worse stretched out before him spaced on either side was a gauntlet of cardboard appliance containers and makeshift leantos every four years as the world descended on washington for the inauguration of a new or returning american president police would swoop down and roust the denizens of the levalee underpass and other such places from their fetid homes at times even putting the makeshift villages to the torch but within a short while like a forest recovering from a volcano the space would begin to fill with life once again until soon it was indistinguishable from the village that had preceded it with a presidential election just a few months away it would not be long before the cycle commenced once more but at the moment no one in the levalee underpass was concerned with anything but the intruder aware of the dozens of eyes following him porter pinned his pistol and flashlight beneath his arm and pulled on a pair of rubber gloves steve crackowski a security chief for some sort of companyporter didnt particularly care which onehad hired him to find and eliminate a man named ferendelli now crackowski had gotten a tip that the mark a doctor was hiding out with the downandouters he had once taken care of in a nearby free clinic this was the second hobo village porter had visited he strongly sensed this might be the one certain the denizens of the tunnel had gotten a good look at the gun porter replaced it in his belt and took a fivebyseven photo of ferendelli from his jacket then he made his way purposefully down the squalid gauntlet panning the beam from one side to the other pausing each time the light struck a face to ask about the photo a hundred bucks porter was saying to one of the men loudly enough for everyone to hear tell me where this here man is and a hundred is yours dont tell me and one of you is gonna get hurt real bad over the years porter had taken great pains to keep his heavy mississippi drawl intact there had been times when his dense accent had actually fed into a marks southern stereotype and put them at ease their mistake white man five ten dark hair fiftyfive thin body narrow face speak up now im losin my patience and believe me you dont want that to happen nothing porter inched ahead shifting his focus from one side of the tunnel to the other the eerie intense silence was broken only by staccato coughing and the clearing of inflamed throats the killer stopped now and again to kick the soles of tattered shoes to get their owners to look up into the light you there you seen this man a hundred bucks is a pile a money the gnarled wizened man kneeling placidly beside his refrigerator carton home stared at porter with vacant rheumy eyes and shook his head then he coughed up a dense wad of phlegm and spit it in porters direction without a moments hesitation porter pulled out his pistol and from less than ten feet away shot the old man through the eye silence im gonna wait one minute if i dont hear something im going to pay a visit to another one of you last chance hes gone someone called out porter whirled to the voice and fixed the intense beam on the man it belonged to the hobo blocked the brightness with his hands when porter demanded jjust now when you got here outout that way fuck you frank someone called out the doc was good to us here frank porter said throwing a bill at him go nuts porter raced to the end of the tunnel and scanned the area beyond it then he put the flash back in his belt and took a device from his jacket pocketa remote of some kind he aimed it down the rows of the cardboard village and depressed a button on it several times nothing finally without a glance back at the old man he had just killed carl eric porter disappeared up the embankment for ten minutes beneath the levalee overpass the only sounds were the rasping breathing of forty men and women the clearing of inflamed throats and the occasional lighting of a cigarette then from deep within a makeshift ducttaped cardboard home at the end of the tunnel farthest from where the killer had left jim ferendelli physician to the president worked his way out from where he had been hiding huddled beneath a damp mildewed harry potter sleeping bag and crawled to the opening of the box drawn and filthy ferendelli looked no different from any of the others in the hobo village what do you think santiago he asked of the cachectic man sitting on the dirt outside the opening i think he is gone the man said with a heavy spanish accent but i also think he might come back did he hurt someone he killed old gordon just like that shot him like he was nothing damn im sorry santiago frank saved you i think i heard him that was quick thinkingby all of you you were always good to us in the clinic i need to go santiago thank you for sheltering me im so sorry about gordon thank frank and the others for me too we wish you well doctor still on all fours ferendelli crawled cautiously to the tunnel entrance then ran as best he could down the deep swale toward the next road chapter gabe stood near the doorway leading from the stylish red room to the glittering state dining room to his right a string quartet was playing what might have been mozart to his left popular vice president tom cooper iii and his wife were chatting with the secretary of state scattered throughout the room were leaders of both parties as well as members of drews cabinet calvyn berriman the president of botswana was across the room shaking hands with a steady stream of dignitaries and simultaneously nodding politely at any number of passersby gabe was unable to suppress a sardonic smile he strongly suspected that only he of all those present at the formal dinner was thinking about ricky the shiv gentille or razor tufts or any of the other inmates who had once joined him shuffling along in the food line at the maryland correctional institution in hagerstown the interminable lines the dehumanizing inspections the payoffs the gangs the smuggling the egos the violence the ignorance even the scattered acts of heroismhe hated every second of the year he spent at mci every single second he spent trying to avoid eye contact to keep his back to a wall and to remain invisible thirtysix hundred seconds an hour eightysix thousand four hundred seconds a day they were numbers burned into his consciousness like death camp tattoos still although even he had to acknowledge he had come far since his days in an orange prison jumpsuit it was possible that in some ways he felt more at ease among the murderers and other felons than he did right now he had voiced his concern to the president and the white house social secretary begging to be left off the guest list for the dinner altogether let alone the twoman list of those being introduced to the washington glitterati but the dinner was already scheduled and there was still a great deal of restlessness in dc surrounding the disappearance of jim ferendelli the president wanted to assure the politicians and the voters that he was in good hands medically youre handling yourself well doctor chief of staff magnus lattimore had materialized at gabes elbow he was a slightly built kinetic man with a boyish face carrot hair and the vestiges of a brogue of all the presidents men gabe had learned the most about himscottish immigrant harvard grad tireless smart in many senses of the word decisive meticulous not the least afraid of stepping on toes and blessed with a rapier wit that at times could be devastating he was also it was clear to gabe absolutely devoted to andrew stoddard his presidency and his reelection its the monkey suit gabe replied throw a tux on me and youve got instant socialite i can tell your bow tie is a dead giveaway that theres more to you than the backwoods buckaroo you claim hows that tying a bow tie is an absolutely individual affair it should never be knotted perfectly yours is tied with perfect imperfection says a lot about your level of sophisticationgruff saddle tramp image or not is that why you didnt have the rental people include a clipon i suppose you could conclude that yes i was prepared to help you if necessary in dealing with people data is worth collecting regardless of the source if i ever did have the urge to underestimate you which i most certainly do not i need only remind myself of your skill with a bow tie gabe flashed on alison cromartie her brow knit as she focused on the task at hand had she left the knot just slightly askew on purpose the truth was he hadnt even noticed gruff saddle tramp indeed was that article in the post about my arrival on the scene your doing he asked we have a friend or two on the staff there was lattimores typically oblique reply i had sort of planned to keep a low profile until i was done with the job in wyoming you get to keep a low profile here you keep whatever profile most benefits the president so i gathered speaking of the man where is he actuallylattimore checked his omegahes late his expression had darkened any problem no no hes usually fairly prompt though and calvyn berriman is a man he actually likes and admires he went out of his way to have me ask joe malzone the pastry chef to do a cake in the form of the presidential flag of botswana and a wild flag it is too complete with zebras african shield elephant tusks and even a basrelief bulls head perfectly rendered in black frosting makes our flag look sedate save me the bulls head ive gone after them at birthday parties since i was a tyke and also let me know if drew needs me to do a physical exam on anyone in the next couple of hours this would be the perfect time for me to have to leave back home i used to bribe the hospital operator to page me when i couldnt find another way of getting out of a cocktail party or worse a formal dinner perfectly imperfect bow tie or not im sure its only a matter of time at this soiree before i go emily postal and commit some huge social gaffe dont use your fingers except for the bread dont slurp your soup directly from the bowl and avoid throwing up on the person next to you thats all you need to know slurp my bread finger my soup throw up on the guest of honor got it oh and most important of all dont think for a moment that anyone here is more interested in hearing what you have to say than in hearing what they have to say in this town a good listener is like a oneeyed man in the land of the blind mouth shut ears open i can do that good speaking of socialites theres one more person id like you to meet before we all go trooping on in there you ever heard of lily sexton gabe shook his head should i have when we get reelected one of the presidents first moves will be the creation of a new cabinet postthe secretary of science and technology dr lily sexton will be it an md phd molecular physics or some such she was a professor of carols at princeton although he had been at carol and drew stoddards wedding and had spent a fair amount of time with her over the years gabe really knew very little about the first lady he knew she was brightexceedingly so in factbut nothing she had ever said suggested that she might have studied molecular physics in college secretary of science and technology he mused out loud i wonder where that will rank on the presidential succession list bite your tongue youre right see i told you it was only a matter of time before i said something stupid youre doing fine just remember about the oneeyed man theres lily over there shes not too hard to spot given that every woman in this room is wearing a designer evening gown and shes wearing a tux lattimore led gabe by the arm across the red room and introduced him to the second interesting and attractive woman he had met in just an hour lily sexton had a dazzling ageless aura starting from her pure silver hair cut elegantly short her face virtually unlined was sharp and intelligent highlighted by piercing bluegreen eyes her black tuxedo was perfectly tailored to her tall slender figure and just above the top button of her jacket where a shirt would have been had she been wearing one rested a spectacular turquoise pendant on a silver chain protruding from beneath her pants were topoftheline alligator cowboy boots the stylish western look made a clear statement about the womans willingness to fly in the face of fashion but gabe guessed that with the addition of the inlaid turquoise ring and earrings that matched her necklace the price of her outfit came to as much or more than that of many of the evening gowns in the room excuse me if im out of line gabe said after lattimore had completed the introduction and moved on but magnus told me you were one of carols college professors i dont know exactly how old the first lady is but i have trouble doing the math around that relationship why thank you dr singleton lily said with an easy drawlmaybe arizona gabe thought what a flattering thing to say but im afraid my friend magnus hasnt got his facts quite right i was a graduate assistant of carols not a professor weve been dear friends since the day we met theres not much more than five or six years difference in our ages she would have made a terrific scientist but she had other plans the dilemma of carol stoddard he said test tubes bunsen burners and white mice or the chance to marry an absolutely brilliant war hero hunk of a man and change the world for the better hmmmm let me think believe me she said if a man like drew stoddard had dropped into my life i would have made the same choice carol did actually somewhere along the way a few men did come along with enough going for them to marry but none of them ended up having drews staying power so doctor how has your washington medical experience been so far a few visiting dignitaries have been sent to the clinic for various bumps and bruises and upset stomachs but thankfully the first patient hasnt dialed my number except to tell me that there were a lot of people anxious to meet me tonight and so id better show up oh yes speaking as one of those people congratulations thanks youre the one deserving of congratulations though magnus tells me you are destined for a cabinet post if we win were going to win in that case ill be the first secretary of science and technology pardon me for sounding uninformed but what is the presidents position on science and technology that he would need a new cabinet post to implement it actually its built into the party platform the president feels that the federal government needs to take a more proactive position regarding control of scientific research and developmentstem cells cloning nanotechnology fuel alternatives reproductive physiology cyberspace utilization and the like the fda is overwhelmed as it is and no cabinet post is specifically set up to coordinate the research necessary to put together some legislation with teeth i didnt realize that drew had taken such a hardline approach to government control of science and technology first of all its neither hardline nor control and second of all its more carols concerns than drews the administration is not opposed to research and development in any field of science but they want the people to have the right to know whats going on and to monitor if any particular product or line of research has the potential to do harm or to cost the taxpayer in some as yet unseen way it sounds like theyve picked the perfect person for the job thats very kind of you to say oh dr singleton im sorry to be monopolizing you so as a guest of distinction you must have many more important people to meet than me no actually i have no one more important to meet than you the truth is i was grateful to you for protecting me from the masses the last thing i remember clearly was riding one of my horses through the desert then the president showed up at my doorstep and now this i feel like alice floating down the rabbits hole he gestured to the room thats right lily exclaimed youre a high plains drifter wyoming yes she took a thin silver case from her jacket pocket and removed a pale lavender business card i can do without a gown or even an evening bag but a rule of survival in this town is never ever go out without your business cards magnus had mine waiting in my desk drawer when i arrived now i know why alas theyre still there lily pad stables the card read simply along with an address in virginia and an ornate lps in one corner im west texas born and bred she said and where i come from people say that the numberone reason for making piles of money is to have horses in wyoming we like to say that a horse is nothing more or less than a fourlegged shrink same thing really her laugh was unforced and totally appealing well at lily pad we have some of the finest saddle horses anyplace unless you like to jump weve got those too jumping things on a horse makes no more sense to me than jumping things not on a horse when in doubt go around thats my motto in that case give me a call ill show you some of my adopted state from a western saddle id be happy to im already having saddle soap withdrawal in that case the sooner the better her enigmatic expression at that moment would he knew stay with him until they hit the trail togetherwhenever that was no sooner had he and lily moved apart when the admiral ellis wright stepped in to introduce gabe to a general as my man in the white house there was no hint whatsoever of the rancor that had so recently marked wrights visit to gabes office the outer face the inner face gabe mused as the general and the admiral turned to greet calvyn berriman did anyone in this town actually say what they meant or mean what they said it was at that instant gabe noticed lattimore standing by the doorway to the hall motioning him over with his eyes and a minute shake of his head even as he smiled and nodded at various passing guests his expression at least to gabes reckoning was grim slowly deliberately feeling very much like the other guests as he masked his purpose with a cheerful expression he worked his way across to the chief of staff joining him in acknowledging the secretary of defense and his wife then the chief of the national security council is there a problem gabe asked softly taking pains not to look directly at lattimore perhaps wait two minutes then make your way to your office and get your medical bag the presidents secret service man treat griswold will be waiting to take you upstairs to the residence do i need to bring anything special gabe asked just an open mind was the reply chapter battling to look nonchalant gabe retrieved his medical bag from the floor by his desk an open mind what in the hell had lattimore meant by that by the time gabe reentered his office reception area treat griswold was waiting motioning with an upraised hand for him to stay quiet and stay where he was cautiously the secret service agent checked the corridor then beckoned gabe across to the elevator which another waiting agent keyed electronically is the president in trouble gabe asked as they rode i guess thats for you to determine sir griswold said a floor above the elevator opened into a small anteroom with double doors to the broad elegantly furnished foyer of the first familys residence griswold motioned gabe down the hall to the master bedroom then retreated to a position not far from the elevator just call if you need me sir he said his expression severe magnus lattimore stepped into the foyer anyone see you he asked griswold no one good ive sent for the mil aide with the football keep him right there in the landing will do the football during his orientation gabe had been told that the football was the name given to the communications case containing the codes and other necessary equipment for the quarterback the president to trigger a retaliatory or preemptive nuclear strike anywhere in the worldquite possibly the prelude to armageddon whenever the chief executive was traveling away from the white house the case was brought along by a military aide rotating from one of the five services also contained in the football lattimore had told gabe were the papers of presidential succession now the chief of staff turned to him his intensity threatening to burn a hole between gabes eyes go on in doctor he said he followed gabe into the bedroom stepped inside and quietly closed the door behind them legs out straight the president of the united states sat bolt upright his back pressed against the massive brass headboard his eyes were wide and feral his gaze dartingan expression of absolute fear his fingers were in constant motion like waving fronds of kelp the corners of his mouth pulled back repetitively then relaxed to his left standing close by the bed was the first lady stunning in a simple black strapless gown her expression was an odd mixture of concern and embarrassment hes been like this for twenty minutes now she said eschewing any greeting i know about his asthma and his migraines gabe said are the meds he takes up here yes plus some tylenol sometimes and ibuprofen for some back pain see if you can find those bottles carol bring me any pills you come across anything at all also the inhaler he uses the first lady hurried into the bathroom suddenly stoddard began rocking forward and back like an orthodox jew reciting his prayers after a minute or two he seemed to notice gabe for the first time gabe gabe my old friend what in the sam hill are you doing here he asked still rocking his voice was strained and higher pitched than usual his speech pressured youve got work to do work to do my man my man people to meet and greet and work to do mr president im here because you suddenly arent acting like yourself mr president mr president they all call me that mr frigging president but not you gabe singleton not you my old friend my roomie you must call me drew call me drew and ill trust you hey a rhyme call me drew and ill trust you not like the others i dont trust any of the others just my lovely carol isnt she lovely hey where is she whered she go and of course sweet magnus sweet thinkofeverything magnus how could anyone not trust him but tom frigging vice president cooper the frigging thirdhim i dont trust any farther than i can throw him and bradford frigging dunleavy cant be trusted he wants to beat my ass in the next election and take this house away from us have us evicted and the frigging chinese when it comes to trust they are just the worst of all i cant stop rocking dr gabe back and forth forth and back help me stop rocking and ill double your salary you know who you really cant trust its the arabs you really cant trust thats who the arabs maybe we should just take a little old nuclear devicethats what we call them devicesand waste the whole lot of them thatd solve the frigging middle east crisis once and for all might as well take out israel while were at it and start all over again carol stoddard returned with her hands full of pill bottles plus an inhaler and passed them over gabe scanned them one by one setting each on the bedside table none of them differed from what he already knew stoddard was taking with ellis wrights words booming in stereo in his brain gabe moved cautiously toward the bedside opposite where carol was standing the twentyfifth amendment deals with the inability of the president to reliably conduct the duties of his office i want you to review the presidential law of succession and memorize the twentyfifth amendment drew gabe said gently but firmly theres something going on here with you thats not quite right not quite right not quite right stoddard sang the words to the tune of little lamb little lamb gabe felt an icewater chill somewhere in the building a military aide was approaching bearing the footballthe buttons and codes that could effectively end all life on earth codes that could be triggered by one man and one man only his mind struggled with only minimal success to wrap itself around the enormity of the situation he glanced at carol and then at lattimore to confirm that they too were aware of the awesome implications of what was transpiring before them but their expressions validated nothing drew is it okay if i do a little examination of you i want to get to the bottom of this i see the answers drew is it okay if i check you over the answers to all questions is there some sort of shot you can give him magnus lattimore asked gabe stopped himself at the last possible instant from snapping at the chief of staff as soon as i know whats going on ill treat him gabe said instead right now as long as hes not in immediate danger masking these symptoms is the last thing i want to do stoddard was perspiring profusely now his face cardinal red but the rocking had stopped still he continued a rapid disjointed chatter jumping from topic to topic laughing inappropriately and mixing in often bizarre opinions on issues of public concernopinions that gabe knew were not typically held by the man the andrew stoddard he had known since college was dr jekyll this was mr hyde gabe wondered in passing what would happen if the nations commander in chief suddenly started calling out for the military aide with the football moving slowly but deliberately gabe checked his patients blood pressure in each arm and his pulse in the neck arms and feet the pressure was up over in each arm and the pulse was also up at years of training and practice had kicked in the moment gabe entered the room and with each second he was observing avoiding assumptions and considering dozens of diagnostic possibilitiesrejecting some filing others away as possible moving still others to the forefront of probability ignoring the steady stream of pressured babble gabe did as rapid a physical exam as he dared there would be time for more detailed examination and testing when the immediate crisis had been dealt with as matters stood two things were apparent to him the president of the united states was not having a cerebral hemorrhage or a cardiac episode and so was in no immediate danger but also at the moment the man was quite mad chapter for the twenty minutes that followed and the twenty minutes just past gabe knew that the united states was without reliable leadership he continued his evaluation of andrew stoddard but gabes mind was spinning someone had to be notified probably the vice president ellis wright was an ass but he had been absolutely justified in saying that gabe had to become an expert on presidential illness and succession but why hadnt lattimore stepped forwardor even carol why were they standing by almost calmly as one of the greatest crises imaginable evolved before them why had the only even slightly emotional thing either of them uttered been lattimores requesta request that gabe brushed aside as bordering on malpracticethat the president be given some sort of shot to settle him down it didnt take a formal medical education to reason out that unless a diagnosis was either known or quite obvious giving any sort of mindaltering medication to someone with acute brain dysfunction from either trauma stroke or chemical imbalance was contraindicated the presidents continuous rocking had slowed then finally stopped and the tenor of his speech had softened somewhat gabe propped a pillow behind him and took advantage of the relative calm to focus his ophthalmoscope beam onto the retinas of stoddards eyesthe only place in the body where arteries veins and nerves specifically the large optic nerves could be directly observed the arteries appeared healthy with minimal if any signs of arteriosclerosis the veins too seemed normal and were free from nicking where the arteries crossed on top of thema finding that would have hinted at prolonged high blood pressure but most important the margins of the optic nerve in each eye were sharply demarcated blurring of those edges known medically as papilledema would have suggested a buildup of pressure on the brain from swelling hemorrhage or infection reflexes normal extremities normal strength and range of motion good cranial nerves intact carotid pulses strong and free of bruitsthe churning sound made by blood rushing past an obstruction heart rate down to still high but improved blood pressure down to over lungs clear respiratory rate down from to abdomen soft stoddards perspiring had slowed and the redness in his face had begun to abate drew are you with me youre the best pal the salt of the earth drew i want to ask you some questions will you answer them no matter how silly they might seem go for it what city are we in why would you ask me something as please drew humor me washington districto of columbio the day thursday doc this is please august the something maybe the seventeenth isnt that right carol baby the seventeenth thats right youre doing great honey she looked over at gabe hes coming around drew how much is forty times twenty eight hundred of course i was always good in math a hundred minus thirty four sixtysix the answers came out almost before the questions were finished name the first eight presidents washington adams jefferson madison monroe the other adams jackson how many is that enough van buren the first harrison the one who croaked after thirty days tyler thats plenty drew i can do them all the latest one is me im glad of that the capital of uruguay montevideo what do i win most home runs by someone who never took steroids aaron you thought id say ruth didnt you no drew i knew youd get it right youre doing better my friend much better doc i have one question what is it the beasties that have been flying around herethe fairies and those round hairy things with the long tailswhat do you make of them gabe looked to see if stoddard was toying with him but there was nothing in the presidents expression to suggest that was the case he checked stoddards pupils again they had initially been midsize and a bit sluggishly reactive to light now they were smaller and more briskly reactive another sign that things were getting better hyperactive cardiovascular system uncontrolled rocking disjointed pressured speech excessive perspiration inappropriate affect visual hallucinations what in the hell was going on gabe desperately needed to speak with both carol stoddard and magnus lattimore but there was no way at this point that he would leave his patient to do so lattimore saved him the anguish whatever you need to say to us doctor you can say before the president there was no panic in his voice and little if any anxiety gabe wondered if lattimores odd demeanor was at least in part due to the fact that drew stoddard now appeared to be rapidly improving lattimore moved over to where carol stoddard stood stroking her husbands hand her expression was oddmore one of annoyance perhaps than concern okay gabe said its your call he calmed himself with a deep breath and slow exhale to begin with it looks like whatever is going on here is beginning to resolve drews life doesnt appear to be in immediate danger but we all know that for the last hour or so he has not been in control of his faculties the implications of that are obvious go on lattimore said his expression unchanged to gabes left the president had sunk down on his bed eyes closed his breathing was still somewhat rapid and shallow the redness had drained from his face which now looked drawn pale and utterly spent concerned gabe checked drews pulse and blood pressure once more fairly normal gabe said shaking his head in bewilderment give me a minute to draw a few tubes of blood what for lattimore asked im not sure yet but its better to have them and not need them than to realize tomorrow i should have gotten them do you need to put them on ice carol asked calmly i dont think so ill refrigerate them in the clinic until im ready to send them off you wont put his name on them will you no i promise ill identify them some other way honey the first lady said gently her lips brushing her husbands ear gabes going to draw some blood is that okay go for it stoddard managed through lips that were stiff and dry gabe drew three vials of blood and set them in his bag the president barely reacted to the procedure well theres still an impressive collection of diagnostic possibilities gabe said when he was done some sort of atypical seizure or even unusual migraine is on the list along with a small hemorrhage in some strategic area of his brain or a tumorpossibly one in a part of his body away from the brain that is secreting some sort of hormone or other psychoactive chemical there are a number of possible organs in this regard he certainly seems toxic but unless he has some pills hidden away that we dont know about i dont have an explanation for how that toxicity could have happened then theres the diagnosis that is at or near to top of the list at this point namely lattimore asked namely that the stress of the job and the reelection campaign has pushed his emotional and mental faculties past the breaking point you have no idea the hours he puts in carol said well its not a physicians job to guess so at the moment the field of possibilities is wide open and weve got to get him to the hospital for an mri and some other tests at this moment i am quite concerned about a tumor or a small hemorrhage its not a tumor lattimore said and its not a hemorrhage how could you possibly know that because the chief of staff said meeting gabes gaze intently the presidents already been recently checked for those by dr ferendelli hes run every test in the book i dont understand gabe carol said evenly still massaging her husbands hand this isnt the first episode like this that drew has had its at least the fourth chapter incredulous gabe stared across the bed at carol stoddard and magnus lattimore i cant believe this he said barely maintaining control how many episodes four carol said all within the last three months jim ferendelli was actually with us when the first attack occurred it was right here in the residence he was up here for dinner all of a sudden drew began shaking his head as if he were trying to clear something out of it it turns out he was hearing voices i just cant believe this gabe said again making no attempt to lower his voice how in the hell could drew come all the way out to wyoming to ask me to take over as his doctor and manage not to tell me about this and you two carol weve known each other for years magnus you had plenty of chances to talk to me before i flew out here who in the hell do you think this man isan organgrinder how can you ask me to uproot my life and come here to take care of him and then withhold information like this gabe please carol replied i understand why youre upset we debated how and when to tell you what had been happening but with all the tests coming out negative and no attacks for a few weeks drew thought wed be better off hoping the whole matter was a thing of the past he really needed you gabe then and now so thats why he lied to me thats why you lied to me because you all needed me gabe glanced down to see the presidents reaction but andrew stoddard eyes closed was lying motionless breathing coarsely and had clearly not heard a word reflexively gabe reached down and checked his pulse one hundred and regular then suddenly gabe found himself reflecting upon the meeting with drew in wyoming there was time then plenty of time for gabe to tell his longtime friend about the selfprescribing he had been doingabout the pain pills and the antidepressants he hadnt said anything to the president for the same reason he had never said anything to his former aa sponsorthe same reason he had gradually cut back on his meetings until he stopped going altogether he was ashamednot frightened not worried he was heading for an alcohol relapse like so many warned at the meetingsjust ashamed of his weakness and maybe of his foolhardiness and denial as well whatever the reason he had lied by omission just as carol and lattimore had been lying since his arrival in dc just as drew had done back in tyler different stripes same zebras the episodes havent all been the same carol said maintaining her composure against gabes onslaught the second one happened at a press conference jim was there and so was magnus the moment drews color changed and his speech became disjointed they got him off the stage the whole thing didnt last half an hour there were more audio and visual hallucinations than there were today but no rocking that was when jim had him brought to the presidential suite at bethesda naval after all the tests were negative including an evaluation by a team of neurologists the diagnosis was made of atypical migraine im surprised you didnt read about the whole thing in the papers or else hear about it on tv gabes smile was mirthless i dont own a tv that works with any reliability and the only newspaper i ever read is the tyler times life has been much easier that way i guess thats why you never asked us about the atypical migraines lattimore said i guess gabe replied acidly drew mentioned something about migraines when he was in tyler listen you two i dont know whats going on with him but i do know this man is in no position to function as the president of the united states weve got to do something and quickly i havent had the chance to study up on the twentyfifth amendment but i would imagine a call downstairs to the vice president is in order wait lattimore said sharply please gabe just wait and listen please gabe flashed on the desert behind his ranch the sun would be setting just about now the perfect time for a ride what in the hell was he doing here go ahead he said but you should know that i have no reason at this point to trust anything you tell me i understand with lobbyists and spin doctors and hidden agendas on every corner this town is justifiably famous for people playing fast and loose with the truth and im afraid that as a political advisor im hardly blameless in that regard myself even now the guests downstairs have been apologized to and told that the president has a migraine headache some asthma and some sort of gastric upset and that youre attending to him the press will be next go on gabe said picturing the truth being batted about like a badminton shuttlecock first of all lattimore went on remember that when you first came upstairs i asked agent griswold to send for the military aide who is entrusted with the football we talked about the football when you first arrived in town believe me i was paying attention that sort of stuff is not easy to ignore then i may have told you that among other things the briefcase contains the papers necessary to hand over control of the government to vice president cooper the military aide is waiting out there in the foyer right now gabe ultimately the decision as to what is best for your patient and for the country will be up to you go on im sorry truly sorry that we werent more forthcoming about these episodes in the first place we had come to an uneasy agreement with jim ferendelli that so long as the situation didnt worsen he would continue to try and come up with a diagnosis then when he disappeared the way he did we three have been in a quandary about what to do next the president and first lady felt that you were the only one who would step in and continue jims investigation into the situation while at the same time giving the president the chance to be reelected gabe the country needs him carol said the world needs him but not if the price of that service is his mental health carol if drew was an exam question and there was only one right answer i would have to say that his neurological presentation today and the history youve given me add up to some sort of stress disorder that is not a desirable condition in the man with his finger on the big red button it seems like with each episode hes drifting farther and farther from reality but in between these episodes lattimore said the president has been as focused and energetic as hes ever been and i mean that hes gotten the koreans and iran to back off and allow nuclear inspections thats major the new trade agreements with mexico and china have already brought us the lowest unemployment in a dozen years he knows that the only solution to the drug problem in our cities is to deliver hope for the future in the form of education and already hes gotten more money for schools than the last two administrations combined hes pushed through more legislation more of the pieces of his populist agenda than anyone ever thought he could and with the polls predicting the shift to a friendly congress theres no telling what he could accomplish in the next four years this is no ordinary man gabe magnus this mangabe gestured down at stoddard who had yet to move except for the rise and fall of his chesthas the authority and the power to destroy everything everything and he may be losing his mind theres got to be something causing this besides stress carol said im certain of it you heard him answer your questions hes absolutely brilliant you had barely asked the questions before he produced the answers gabe youre worried that drew has the power to destroy everything but he also has the power and the vision to change the world for the better as no presidentno personever has this upcoming election is by no means a lock lattimore added dunleavy still has a lead in most of the red states and the religious right is starting to get mobilized and organized again their political machine weakened when dunleavy lost the last election but theres strong evidence theyre regrouping do you remember thomas eagleton no wait maybe yes yes i do he was mcgoverns vice presidential nominee in what seventy seventytwo mcgovern wasnt going to beat nixon no matter what so none of the democratic biggies would run with him so he picked eagleton a nice enough senator from missouri only mcgoverns halfbaked research didnt uncover that the man had several psychiatric hospitalizations for depression which included electroshock therapy the negative press made mcgovern seem like anything but fit to lead this country and forced eagleton to quit he was replaced by sargent shriver the peace corps guy i remember now it was even worse with dukakis he was ahead in the polls when all of a sudden word started to circulate that he had been treated for depression rumor pure unsubstantiated rumor but the result was a dramatic shift in the polls and that scene in the tank notwithstanding he could never catch up i understand what youre saying if word gets out about these episodes of the presidents all the kings horses and all the kings men arent going to be able to help us and the most important thing as carol said is that in between episodes hes as sharp and in command as ever at that instant as if on cue andrew stoddards eyes fluttered open he looked to his left at his wife and chief of staff then to his right at gabe dr singleton i presume he said sweeping his tongue across his parched lips hey there welcome to our world this doesnt look good another episode gabe nodded honey carol said are you okay doin fine doin fine a little bit of a throbbing up here in my temples but otherwise i feel great i confess though that seeing the doc here like this is a little disconcertingespecially when hes supposed to be having dinner and botswana flag cake with calvyn berriman do you remember anything about what happened gabe asked not really i vaguely remember not feeling well mostly in my stomach why did i insult someone were supposed to be friends with no nothing like that carol said were just glad youre okay honey gabes really upset that we didnt carol i can do this myself gabe said with more snap to his voice than he had intended he looked from carol to lattimore and back and considered whether or not to send the two of them out of the room so he could speak to his patient in private finally though he pulled a brocade chair over next to stoddard who had pushed himself up on one elbow drew have you been totally aware of these episodes all along i have except when im having them of course but you chose not to tell me about them before i agreed to come to washington to care for you that may have been a mistake drew i appreciate your owning this and not deluging meat least not up frontwith rationalizations for why you chose to keep me in the dark and i understand why you and carol and magnus might have chosen that course but it was a mistake it was a lie i know i know omission of something isnt technically a lie but where i come from we dont draw that line im sorry gabe i truly am there was so much going on and so much pressure to stabilize the situation surrounding jims disappearance and i so desperately needed you with me jim told me the episodes were probably some form of atypical migraines he started me on imitrex and told me they might never happen again meanwhile he did all the tests and called in consultants what kind of consultants neurologists i guess any psychologists psychiatrists stoddard shook his head i i dont think so gabe if word gets out about these things im finished drew as things stand i feel as if i only have two choices to call in that military aide whos out there so that you and i can turn over the government to vice president cooper or to quit and jump on the next flight back to wyoming lattimore leaned forward and seemed as if he were about to enter the discussion but stoddard whose back was turned directly toward him stopped him with a raised hand and then sat up in bed still facing toward gabe and away from the chief of staff in that instant every vestige of drew stoddard had vanished and was completely replaced by the president of the united states gabe he said jim ferendelli had to deal with the same crisis of conscience as you are right now i ached for him then just as i ache for you now ultimately he rejected both possibilities you suggest he didnt quit and he didnt insist i turn over the government of this country to tom cooper he put me on medication for what he felt was causing my problem and he promised not to rest until he knew what was the matter with me and what we should do about it please believe that i do gabe working with a republican congress my jobs programs have taken more than six hundred thousand workers off unemployment communities have joined with me and private business to add two hundred thousand computers to our schools drug use in the inner cities has begun a serious decline a decline gabe the polls say that if i win ill likely have a friendly congress next term give me that and theres no limit to what we can accomplish for the people of this country im begging you gabe stay close to me find out whats the matter with me treat me with any medication you want bring any specialists in to evaluate me but please for gods sake please dont pull the plug on me not now not when were so close in the silence that followed gabe felt much of his anger at being deceived and much of his zeal to take immediate action deflate he didnt have the statistics that lattimore and the president had cited but he did know that there was a spirit of hope and optimism in the country that hadnt existed for a generation or more and best of all there were no american soldiers losing their lives on foreign soil drew stoddard scholar intellectual war hero humanist populist was the real deal i need some time gabe heard himself say i need some time to sort things out that was a very frightening scene in here im sure it was gabe take all the time you need and i need jim ferendellis records about his findings and his conclusions so far wherever they are lattimore said we cant find them except for some very thin records at bethesda naval the fbi and the investigative arm of the secret service have gone over every inch of the medical office jims house in georgetown and his home in north carolina dozens of agents are still on the job maybe a couple of hundred well i want access to his place no problem and if i decide to go along with what youre asking i need at least one other doctor to be my assistant in this case and to be close to you when i cant be do we have to tell him everything carol asked i need to decide that first though i have to feel more certain that this is a secret i want to keep just tell me what you need stoddard said tell me what you want me to do stay close to home here or camp david i want to know precisely where you are every minute until ive made my decision what about texas lattimore asked the president cancel it stoddard ordered brusquely finally i want your word drew and yours too carol and magnus that if i opt to bail on this whole deal and involve vice president cooper you wont try anymore to convince me otherwise you have our word the president said the other two hesitated then reluctantly nodded in assent in that case gabe said get ready for bed and then crawl back under the covers im going to be here tonight for as long as it takes to convince myself youre stable fine the lincoln bedroom is right down the hall if you want to rest there carol said i can get you a robe and pajamas griz will arrange for some food if youre hungry thats all right a few quiet hours and ill go home for now after i check you over again mr president i want to do some reading you have a library up here yes not a huge one but yes yes we do and griz can get you into the main library in the east wing good exactly what do you want to read about doctor gabe reached over to again check stoddards pulses then he tested the mans eye movements and the response of his pupils to light the twentyfifth amendment gabe said chapter midnight came and went by am when gabe decided it was safe to leave the president had been sleeping soundly for an hour and a half at lattimores request gabe watched from a distance as the military aide carrying the football was dismissed then gabe gathered his things including two books on presidential illness succession and the twentyfifth amendment he was about to notify treat griswold he was leaving when carol stoddard knocked softly on the open door she had removed her makeup and changed into pajamas and a robe but still looked no less elegant than she had in her evening dress her does eyes were slightly reddened leading gabe to suspect she had been crying ready to leave she asked taking a step into the room i think its safe no matter what im just a mile or so away hell be all right i thinkat least for now do you know what youre going to do about all this i need a little timemaybe just until later this morning gabe the job is taking a heavy toll on himon us heavier than either of us imagined i think drews been working sevenday weeks often as many as sixteen even twenty hours a day we hardly ever go to sleep at the same time and and our personal life has dwindled until well until there just isnt much of it left im sorry to hear that gabe im begging you if you think for the sake of his health drew should drop out of the campaign and let tom cooper take over please tell him he thinks he can be all things to all people but someone has to help him see that nobody cannot even him tears began to well in carols eyes gabe hesitated then crossed to her and held her quietly until her composure returned whatever i decide will be whats best for my patient he said finally i understand maybe you can convince him to just cut downtake a nonworking vacation spend more time with me and the boys spend some time each day doing nothing accept the fact that everyone has limits ill try carol really i will thank you thank you so much for what youre doing ill send treat griswold over to walk you out before gabe could respond the first lady was gone he flashed on the envy he had felt when he arrived in dc and first saw her and drew togetherthe perfect beautiful first couple leading the country together into a cultural political and social renaissance now he reflected on one of many wise observations by his original aa sponsorthis one dealing with the dangers inherent in going through life comparing your insides to everyone elses outsides he took the elevator down to the first floor where he identified the tubes of blood he had drawn by using his tyler phone number in reverse and set them in the small refrigerator in the clinic one fascinating vignette he had come across in his reading involved president bill clintons knee injury and subsequent surgery the president was on a golfing vacation in florida when his knee buckled while he was walking down a short flight of stairs his quadriceps muscle had torn in two and snapped off the patellar tendon a white house medical unit physician on duty nearby immobilized the leg and arranged for immediate transportation to the nearest hospital already waiting there was clintons personal physician who as usual was part of the medical team caring for the chief executive when he was away from the white house from that moment until clintons surgery at bethesda naval hospital in maryland and even after the muscle and tendon repair was completed his physician had two major decisions to makepain control and anesthesia never far from clinton throughout the ordeal was the military aide bearing the codes for unleashing nuclear missiles as well as an agreement forged between clinton and vice president al gore regarding situations in which the reins of government would be turned over to gore together clinton and his doctor decided that the only pain medication he would receive would be antiinflammatories with no central nervous system effects in addition with the approval of the orthopedic surgeons at bethesda naval he would receive epidural anesthesia and so would be awake and alert throughout his surgery the twohour procedure and clintons recovery went off without a hitch in print it all sounded so straightforward so simple gabe wondered how clintons personal physician would have handled a situation like the one he was enduring now it seemed doubtful that if drew stoddard had a doc other than his friend and college roommate he would still be president then gabe remembered that in fact until just a couple of weeks ago stoddard did have a different doc and he was still the president gabe also realized that at no point had he been told the precise nature of the agreement between stoddard and thomas cooper iii because of the large number of dignitaries attending the state dinner the navy captain who was covering the medical office had elected to stay inhouse gabe dropped off his medical bag and gave the man the line lattimore and he had concocted and disseminated first to the dinner guests then to the press that the president had been seized by a combination of his asthma migraine and severe gastroenteritis and had specifically asked his personal physician to attend to him until the attacks were resolved more lies edgy and uncertain about the decisions he had made throughout the night medical and political gabe allowed treat griswold to accompany him down the elevator and out of the white house to the senior staff parking area on west executive boulevard the eighteen acres as the white house compound was known was eerily quiet the two of them made the trip in pensive silence bound by the enormity of the drama in which they each had played a part bullnecked griswold a loyal veteran of many years in the secret service had signed on to take a bullet for andrew stoddard if necessary was the man raving incomprehensibly and rocking as if trying to shake demons from his mind a person he would want to die for gabe wanted to ask that question of the agent but knew he never would if they only knew gabe was thinking the press the cabinet the congress the chinese the israelis the arabs the terrorists the american peopleif they only knew what had transpired this night in the presidential residence he wondered about those men who had preceded drew stoddard into the presidency how many secrets had been kept on their behalf how many lies had been told you gonna be all right griswold asked as they reached gabes car thanks for caring griz yeah i think ill be okay im assuming you know most of what went on in there i know as much as i need to know the agent said hes a very special man doctor we should do what we can to keep him around i hear you im not a hundred percent certain i agree with you but i hear you weve all got to do what weve got to do take care sir at the moment i dont envy you gabe patted griswolds massive shoulder it was like patting a boulder at the moment i dont blame you listen lets not forget about taking that ride in the desert someday i wont good luck sir griswold retreated the way they had come leaving gabe alone in the quiet the silver buick riviera gabe was driving was like his furnished fourroom suite in the watergate apartments an openended loan from lemar stoddard the first father wouldnt have it any other way from the day drew and gabe came together at the academy the senior stoddard had embraced gabe and his parents as family inviting them to his north carolina estate as well as to his virginia hunting lodge even though the accident and gabes subsequent expulsion from school and imprisonment proved more than buzz singleton could handle lemar had remained a dependable friend and supporter providing him with a topnotch defense team and visiting him more than once at mci years later lemar even pulled some strings to make sure gabes past didnt keep him from being accepted into medical school gabe started the buick and for a few minutes simply sat behind the wheel letting the airconditioning get up to speed and continuing the process of sorting out his thoughts and feelings over the years when faced with a medical puzzle he tried to keep all diagnostic possibilities in play until they were weeded out by either a negative lab test a positive lab test or a new physical finding but always he had an early suspicion as to where the answer lay the trick was not to be ruled or even influenced by that suspicion until the weeding out had left little or better still no choice hes a very special man we should do what we can to keep him around with griswolds words reverberating in his head gabe pulled out of the white house compound onto sixteenth street and then made his way to g street for the milelong drive to the watergate complex the night was thickly overcast warm and humid even for august in dc essentially lost in thoughts about the evening just past gabe rolled along with the languid early morning traffic as he stopped at a red light at twentysecond street the dark sedan that had been following him since he left the compound pulled into the empty lane to his left and drew up precisely even with him what happened then was nothing but a blur aware only of slight movement in the car next to him gabe turned his head to the left the driver of the other car his face obscured by a baseball cap pulled low and by dense shadow had opened his passenger window and had raised a large handgun pointing the menacing barrel straight at gabes face from a distance of no more than five or six feet an instant before the killer fired gabes car was struck firmly from behind sending it forward several feet with the muzzle flash etched into his vision and the shot ringing in his ears gabes head snapped back the rear side window of the buick spiderwebbed from the errant bullet there was no second shot instead tires screeching amid the smoke and stench of burning rubber the sedan vaulted forward spun on two wheels onto twentysecond and disappeared still unable to piece together exactly what had happened gabe was limp held in place by his seat belt gasping for air and for composure no time there had been no time even to react a man had just tried to kill him from somewhere behind him a car door opened and closed then there were rapid footsteps and seconds later his own car door flew open are you all right the voice was familiar it took a moment for gabes vision to clear standing there looking down at him with undisguised concern was alison cromartie chapter is he all right a motorist called out from across the street do you want me to call an ambulance do you alison asked gabe still stunned he managed to shake his head no hes fine alison called out just a little fender bender the motorist the only one around hesitated and then drove off a guy in that car next to mine tried to kill me gabe said fumbling for the words he he shot at me from jesus i cant believe this i i dont know if it was some sort of random driveby or or easy doctor easy are you sure youre not hurt can you stand up i think so i i froze all i could see was the muzzle of that gun and and all i could think was this is it i dont even know what happened next i hit you from behind thats what happened next she said i saw what was about to happen and i rammed you it was the only thing i could think of to do gabe glanced back at the shattered rear window of the buick nice move he said slowly with help he managed to stand and brace himself against the roof of his car alison wearing black jeans and a black tank top kept a supportive arm around his waist until it was clear he could manage on his own as before he became instantly engrossed in her closeness and the scent of her uhoh she said a dc blackandwhite pulled up and stopped directly over the burnt rubber from the assassins car the strobes flicked on and the cop in the passengers seat a lean black man lowered his window whats the deal here he asked oh am i glad to nothing big alison said pointedly cutting gabe off he did the right thing and stopped for a light and i did the wrong thing and bumped into him im guilty as charged they could see the policeman eyeing the rear window clearly trying to put the odd damage together with a rearend collision you all right he asked gabe unseen by the cops alisons expression was strongly cautionary i im a little shaken up thats all and that window two days ago while it was parked vandals probably im getting it fixed tomorrow want us to call an ambulance sometimes the adrenaline from an accident can mask serious injury again the look from her warning gabe to say nothing about the shooting what in the hell was going on no no ambulance he heard himself say listen guys alison said to the cops do whatever you have to do but i really do intend to take full responsibility for this and i really do have to get home i just finished doing three hours of overtime in the er at dc general and i have to be back for the day shift in just a little while you a doc nurse i know way too much er medicine to be a doc you got that right the cop said and exchanged approving glances with his partner just then the radio in the cruiser crackled out something that sounded urgent alison watched benignly as the officer behind the wheel took the call but gabe bewildered as much at her handling the situation as he was at the situation itself saw the keenness in her eyes and sensed that she was on top of the action if not well ahead of it another second and theyre gone she whispered before the conversation was complete listen the cop closest to them said we gotta go you sure youre okay fella im fine fine gabe replied if you dont have to theres no need to write this up okay suit yourself you got an er nurse there just in case you have any delayed reaction that i do gabe said as the cruiser squealed away he watched until the taillights had vanished up twentysecond street and then looked down at alison what what she asked the license plate on the killers three or fouryearold dark blue taurus was covered and with that baseball cap there was no way whatsoever for me to get a look at his face and staring down the barrel of a gun i would strongly doubt that you got any kind of a look at him either by the time the police got the story straight from you and made their calls for backup help the odds that the shooters still driving around out there would be slim to none what good would telling them do there would be hours of interrogation and paperwork and piles of unwanted publicityespecially given dr ferendellis disappearance gabe had no quick response alison cromartie sounded incredibly certain and confident of what she was saying and absolutely comfortable with the lies she had told to deal with the police she was anything but the trim professional nurse who had tiptoed up to tie his bow tie just seven hours ago wouldnt they at least have gotten a crime team to find and examine the bullet he finally managed its got to be back there someplace alison sighed ill tell you what she said trade cars with me for a day and ill arrange to have the damage fixed on yours and the bullet checked out as well who are you gabe asked no longer willing to trust anyone in that city alison drew a thin leather case from the pocket of her jeans and flipped it open for him gabe flashed on lily sexton and her elegant folder of business cards but there were no business cards inside this case there was a gold shield and a photo identification card cromartie alison m united states secret service people were worried about you she said chapter im sorry not to have told you who i was back in the office but the higherup who placed me in the clinic asked me not to alison sounded sincere enough and gabe wanted to believe her but at that momentnearly four in the morninghe really couldnt focus well enough to sort very much out a man his face hidden in shadow had driven up next to gabes car and taken a shot at him from almost pointblank range four days in dc and in one evening he had been browbeaten by a navy admiral lied to bigtime by the president of the united states his wife and his chief of staff deceived by one of his office nurses and now nearly assassinated byby whom someone who was systematically killing white house docs why a whacko random driveby that hypothesis made as much sense as any it was simply a roll of the dice that a madman with the need to kill happened to reach the intersection of g and twentysecond at the same moment gabe did and another roll that alison cromartie with the instincts and reflexes of a secret service agent just happened to be in the car behind his following him the secret service doesnt like things that dont make sense alison was saying and right now jim ferendellis disappearance makes no sense at all im one of the few rns in the service so they plucked me off a backwater desk job in san antonio and arranged for me to become part of the white house medical unit my instructions were to keep my eyes and ears open for anything regarding dr ferendelli and to keep an eye on whoever got brought in to succeed him thats what i was doing tonight gabe rubbed at the grit in his eyes and tried to focus on what alison had just saidthat she had been placed in the white house medical office after ferendellis disappearance hadnt she told him earlier in the day that she had started working there before ferendelli vanished gabe tried through the deepening fog of fatigue to recreate the exchange between them but sensed he might not be recalling it exactly why would she bother lying to him about when she started working at the white house then again why would anyone have been lying to him about anything he thought about trying to pin down which version of her story was the real one but this just didnt seem like the time or place to get into an irresolvable yesyousaidit noididnt discussion well he said whatever the reason for why you were there thanks again for saving my life the alternative would have made a hell of a mess of the interior in that snazzy buick of yours earlier in the evening as she was working on his tie gabe would have offered his ranch for them to be sitting together at four in the morning on a bench behind the watergate overlooking the silent ebony potomac yet here he was in just that situation distracted edgy and totally ill at ease tell your boss that your secret is safe with me im not sure that will do the trick but ill try i always wondered why they called it the secret service when those agents in their dark suits and shades made no effort whatsoever to be secret theyre meant to be seen and recognized a lot of us arent and there are secret service offices outside of dc there are field offices all over we do investigational stuff and also prepare for any presidential or major diplomatic visit and our good friend the admiral doesnt know hes got a secret service agent working for him gabe asked almost no one knows treat griswold nope i report only to one manthe head of internal affairs internal affairs gabe i really cant tell you any more right now first thing in the morning im going to have to report to my boss that ive blown my cover the hour caught up with gabe and he tried unsuccessfully to stifle a yawn listen alison said why dont you go on in i can do all my explaining sometime later ill get this bullet to the lab and arrange for your car to be fixed just leave it on the street where you parked it itll be taken away within the hour and it wont take more than a day to be good as new better be its on loan from the first father i know of course everybody here knows everything or at least tries to so what are you going to tell your boss the truth she answered matteroffactly ach truth such a word i would have never thought it was one of them words that meant different things in different parts of the country like soda and pop or pancakes and flapjacks is that what you told me back in the office about how you came to be at the white house the truth im sorry you have every right to be irritated but i was just doing what i had been ordered to do and what should i tell my boss he asked thats up to you but im not sure whats to be gained secret service protection depends on how badly cramped you want to be gabe again pawed at his eyes he felt worn down by the events surrounding the president and utterly bewildered by this woman and by the attempt on his life but he was also strangely unwilling to head up to his apartment below them the surface of the river had begun subtly reflecting the first changes of the new day gabe found himself absurdly wondering which dignitary had gotten the bulls head on president calvyn berrimans botswana flag cake maybe it was lily sexton so tell me he asked finally how did a nurse end up with a badge and a gun and a desk job in san antonio you sure you dont want to do this later in the no no im really interested besides i feel a second wind coming on i cant tell if youre being facetious or not defensive might be a better word or maybe im just testy i was busy taking care of the presidents gastroenteritis and migraine and missed out on dessert gastroenteritis and migraine the untruth rolled out effortlessly perhaps he had a future in dc after all well okay she said with a shrug the story i told you is pretty close to what is i was born in louisiana and raised in new yorkqueens my dad i think i told you about him is was i mean part creole part southern crackervery handsome very charming rarely employed for long my mom is part japanese part other things shes a nurse still works in a nursing home i became a nurse because of her and got my masters when we first met i tried to piece together your background from your looks i doubt you would have come close i didnt but its a combination that works pretty well thanks more if you want lets see then a brief fling at marriage took me to la where i worked in a surgical icu like many hospitals it was more or less ruled by the surgeonsone group in particular busy beyond imagination wealthy and arrogant all male all well connected the cognac and cuban cigar club we used to call themthe four cs the problem was that while most of them were topnotch and maybe deserving of the big bucks a few of them werent that good go on well i wont go into the details but there was a death in the unit an order that should never have been given written by a surgeon who was well aware of the patients history and should have known better he was one of the founding partners of the group and drank too much he also had neglected to inform the nurses about past events with their patient then there was a ridiculous delay in his getting in touch with the unit after he was paged followed by a botched attempt to open the poor woman up right there in the icu sounds gruesome even more gruesome was the way the group railroaded blame for everything onto one of the nurses it was done with the ruthlessness and efficiency of a commando unit sheets disappeared from the patients chart doctors came forth with blatant lies unfortunately for her they picked on a nurse who was going through a bitter divorce and was on a bunch of meds for depression and who wasnt really that clinically strong anyhow janie got suspended from work and then she overdosed she didnt die but i think sometimes she wished she had eventually her ex got their kids and she moved away were you two close not that close but we considered one another friends i couldnt stand to see what they had done to her and i was on duty when all this happened so i decided to blow the whistle on the surgeon and those who covered up for him uhoh uhoh is right they went after me the same way they went after her it was a total mismatch evidence began to surface that suggested i had assisted janie in diverting drugs and was just trying to defend my partner in crime i began getting weird phone calls a year before i had broken off a threeyear relationship with a man who decided that despite what he and i had agreed upon all along he didnt want kids a new guy i had just started dating who seemed very promising without any real explanation suddenly wanted nothing to do with me my record at work had been spotless but out of the blue several groundless incident reports were filed against me by supervisors who had connections to the surgical group it seemed as if the doctors were actually enjoying the challenge of systematically dismantling my life gabe studied her face even through the gloom he could see the tension and hurt they seemed real then he reminded himself that he had already bought her story once tonight these people were good at manipulating the truthvery good he turned back to the river she was so attractive to him that it was hard to hang on to the notion that she might not be someone he could trust at the same time it was odd to think that while he was sitting there listening to her this way he was managing to avoid the issue of whether or not he should be instituting measures to remove the president of the united states from office tough night so what happened he asked well because in reality i had done nothing wrong the conflict became sort of a mexican standoff even though i knew that sooner or later the surgeons would increase their attack and id lose finally in a secret meeting the head of the hospital offered me a deal if i left the hospital and stopped making trouble he would see to it that i got an unconditionally strong recommendation if i stayed i was on my own and and so i swallowed my whistle and gave up it hurt then to make what seemed like a cowardly choice and it hurts every day now knowing that i did i guess im just not hero material i dont know if id say that remember you just saved my life at the expense of blowing your cover reflex actions dont get processed by the brain sometimes living to fight again is just as heroic as getting destroyed for your cause and often a hell of a lot smarter i have no intention of fighting again im afraid im just not cut out to be a crusader now theres something we have in common the rest is essentially what i told you in the office a doctor i worked for before his retirement was a big supporter of the president and helped me get into the secret service the irony is here i am back working as a nursesomething i promised i would never do again and sadly that step back is a step up from the paper pushing i was doing in san antonio well he said i really appreciate your sharing all that with me im getting a little chafed from the washington version of the truth he yawned again okay its time to steal a movie title from one of our former chief executives i think its bedtime for bonzo appropriate choice of films so what was it that kept you in the white house so late tonight was the president that sick instantly gabe felt himself tense on the surface the womans question was innocent enough but the transition to it seemed awkward and given that he had just announced he was going to sleep the timing felt forced was she trying to take advantage of the hour and the rescue and the intimacy generated by telling her story in order to pump him for information about drew or was he just sensitized and overreading the situation what if the whole scenario with the gunman was a setupa nifty maneuver to gain his trust what if alison had been placed in the white house clinic not because she was a nurse but because she was an attractive beguiling nurse what if this whole affair was nothing more than further proof that dr gabe singleton was playing out of his league and should never have left wyoming ive got to go now he said abruptly and before alison could react he was gone chapter gabe lay facedown on lemar stoddards kingsize bed trying unsuccessfully to will himself to sleep he had come to dc to replace a physician who had disappeared and now he himself had almost been killed at least that was the way it looked eyes closed he envisioned alison cromarties expression as he stood abruptly and left her by the river she was clearly surprised but was that because she expected him to tell her what was going on with the president was she or whoever she was working for trying to expand on some rumorssome halftruths they might have learned about the chief executives health what she said about the futility and possible negative fallout of reporting the driveby attack to the police made perfect sense still it seemed he had to do something more than merely allow her to get lemars car fixed and have the bullet examined he had to share what had happened with someone lattimore treat griswold admiral wright the president himself even more important he had to decide what to do about the recurrent attacks of insanity in the commander in chief of the most powerful armed force in history for a time he tried to imagine what nixons final days in office had really been likepacing the empty halls of the white house allegedly holding animated conversations with the ghosts of lincoln wilson and other presidents past down on his knees blubbering like a child to secretary of state henry kissinger from all gabe could tell nixon had lost his grip well before that last fateful walk to the waiting helicopter how long had the finger of that madman rested on the button that could have killed hundreds of millions days weeks even longer had kissinger ford and others somehow banded together and formulated a plan to bypass any orders from nixon that they felt were not in the best interests of the country and of the rest of mankind he rolled over once again this time replaying the remarkable accomplishments of andrew stoddards first three and a half years in office and the potential of the four years aheadespecially if the man was working with a friendly congress gabe had never had much faith in the political process being able to make a huge improvement in the quality of life of the average americanand especially in the lives of those less fortunate than the average he often mused about how much could be accomplished if the billions spent on political campaigns most of them unsuccessful could be applied to public works projects or to reversing global warming or to cancer research or to providing computers for innercity schools yet here the man wasa president with a true vision for america not someone frantically navigating the country from one crisis to another a president of the people with the courage to go nosetonose with big business and big oil and big pharma as well as with the architects of terror a president with the charisma to bring people together would it be right at this time to invoke the twentyfifth amendment effectively pulling the plug on drews presidency when it was just getting rolling the decision wasnt one he could put off much longer at quarter after six still unable even to doze gabe showered and shaved then gave serious consideration to taking a xanax you still a drunk pill popper ellis wrights words kept gabe from immediately reaching into the bottom bureau drawer for the plastic bottle and its varied contents few would argue that after the day he had just endured a little sleeping aid was both necessary and deserved but there were others who would point out that sooner or later the reasons for taking pills would mutate into reasons to take them maybe they already had he wondered briefly maybe this particular fallout from fairhaven would be part of his life for keeps enduring as long as he did he considered putting lemars elegant coffeemaker to work with something highoctane loading up on caffeine would be the final capitulation to his inability to sleep then as if in a trance he searched out a xanax from his stash of pills and washed it down whether it was the act of taking the drug or the drug itself fifteen minutes later he floated off to a fitful sleep when the ringing phone woke him at eight fortyfive he had decided with an edgy certainty what he was going to do about the crisis in the white house for the time being he would do what he could to keep drew in office and in as strong a position as possible for reelection while at the same time doing everything he could to follow up on jim ferendellis investigations into what might be causing the presidents episodic mental imbalance hopefully sometime in the future when the reason for the presidents episodes had been diagnosed and properly treated and any of the countless potential disasters had simply failed to materialize he and drew and carol would look back and laugh at the role the tranquilizer xanax had played in saving the country the ringing persisted at some point during the hours since he had returned to the room he had managed to pull the roomdarkening drapes a scant amount of sunlight from between them made it possible to find the bedside lamp which he turned on and a halfempty glass of water which he finished before picking up the receiver hlo dr singleton a womans voice asked yes whos calling doctor please hold for mr lemar stoddard gabe reflected that if he were worth billion or more he probably wouldnt be making his own calls either hopefully the first father wasnt calling to take his buick back gabe lemar stoddard here gabe pictured the surpassingly handsome man in a penthouse office somewhere seated at a desk the size of his bed gazing out across the city its me sir drop the sir stuff cowboy weve all grown up now its lemar ill try everything okay the place the car everythings fine im very grateful to you for all this good i like having people feel grateful to me itll go that much better for me when my damn high blood pressure or bad cholesterol or whatever catches up with me and i have to check into the great office building in the sky his laugh was hearty and selfdeprecating but gabe had little doubt that the remark about having people beholding to him was serious for a multibillionaire lemar had always seemed to gabe to be reasonably right sized although drew of course had other thoughts about that whatever negotiations had landed gabe the watergate suite and the riviera had been between the first father and his son the last time gabe had met the man facetoface had been early in the campaign when the stoddards flew into salt lake city on lemars jet and gabe drove down from tyler lemar a year or two short of seventy then with dark hair graying at the temples and electric grayblue eyes was as fit and dashing as any hollywood swashbuckler well gabe said all that this incredible place and the car have done is dig me deeper and deeper in the gratitude hole nonsense youre a good guy gabea good guy who had a lousy break and has had the character to overcome it having you up here taking care of drew makes us more than even in fact not to toot my own horn but it was me who originally put the bee in his bonnet about bringing you on board well thank you for that ill be here as long as he needs me gabe stopped himself at the last instant from adding sir excellent so i was wondering if you might have a little time today for me say lunch provided my patient doesnt need me i can do that wonderful were moored at the capital yacht club downriver from you ill send a driver to pick you up at noon once you get a look at aphrodite i dont think youll feel too guilty about nudging me out of the watergate given how much everyone in dc seemed to know everyone elses business gabe halfexpected the tycoon to mention the shattered rear window in his buick ill be waiting in front gabe said perfect bring your appetite gabe set the receiver down and then pushed open the drapes flooding lemars wondrous apartment with morning light four stories below the potomac sparkled somewhere downriver the apartments owner was probably sitting on the deck of the boat named for the greek goddess of love and beauty sipping some exotic blend of arabian coffees while his companies continued churning away adding to his net worth at a rate far faster than he could ever spend nice life sir except for a little problem with your son gabe chose some kenyan beans from the wide variety in the freezer and spooned them into the builtin coffee master the single push of a button took the selection from beans to brew not surprisingly the result was perfect nice life cup in hand he retrieved his address book from the desk opened it to the bs and set it by the phone he had made his decision regarding drew stoddard now it was time to put this aspect of his plan in motion he dialed and listened to the ringing of kyle blackthorns private line picturing the small office fifteen hundred miles away warmly decorated with indian weavings and artifacts mostly arapaho blackthorns tribe dr blackthorn kyle its gabe hey brother i feel like i should break into a rendition of hail to the chief but i really only use that one at tribal councils hey thats pretty funny and here i thought you guys had no sense of humor at all you doing okay in the big city pretty much i miss everyone back there but they allow cowboy boots in the white house so im managing what can i do for you my friend you can let me send you firstclass tickets and fly out here to do what you do the patient id rather brief you when you get here does it have to be soon very can you juggle your schedule i know you wouldnt be calling like this if it wasnt important and you know that after you saved my mothers life theres nothing that i wouldnt do for you someone will call you later today with travel details it will be good to see you my friend dont forget to bring your testing stuff i never leave home without it chapter the windowless white van had b d drywall painted on the side along with a dc number that had anyone dialed it would have routed their call to an answering machine that had never been checked inside carl porter adjusted his headphones and continued to listen to a conversation between dr gabe singleton and another doctor named blackthorn despite less than three hours of sleep in the last twentyfour porter was completely alert he had always responded to anger and frustration that way and at the moment he was consumed by both for the second time he had come within just a minute or two of completing his mission but somehow dr james ferendelli had managed to elude him when he took the contract porter had expected to have his mark in a few daysa week at the most crackowski had hired a small army of pis and had sent word out of a fiftygrand reward for anyone who fingered the man but after porter had just missed him at his georgetown place ferendelli had proven wily and resourceful and as one lead after another had dried up porters frustration had begun to mount now there had been another near miss singletons conversation ended and porter set the headphones aside he knew very little of the man who was paying him but what was clear was that crackowski had unlimited resources and access to professionals who knew how to use them the surveillance equipment he had gotten installed in singletons apartment was sophisticated and topoftheline in addition a starcraft gps tracking system had been clamped onto the chassis of singletons car and wired for power into the electrical system porter was stretching away some of the stiffness from his neck and back when there were knocks on the rear doorthree then two crackowski with his silenced pistol drawn and the interior lights cut porter undid the lock steve crackowski pulled open the doors and quickly climbed inside he was at least as tall as porter with broader shoulders a narrower waist and a large perfectly shaved head wirerimmed glasses helped make his overall appearance something of a cross between a college professor and a stevedore anything he asked with no more greeting than that the presidents daddy invited singleton to lunch then there uz just a guy named blackthorn kyle or lyle i think he said singleton made the call they just finished talkin singleton asked him to fly out here as soon as possible and to bring his testing stuff thats what he said testing stuff i think so i think hes a doctor too all these doctors crackowski muttered ill check it you tired want me to take over i want ferendelli ive got the word out sooner or later hes going to surface you tried using the remote in the tunnel several times just in case the animals living there were pulling my chain about ferendelli taking off i dont think it has much of a range you sure youre okay here you jes find him for me ferendellis got to be feeling the pressure he knows if he comes in hes dead he knows that if he stays hidden hell never find out what hes up against or what he can do about it his best bet is to contact someone and try to work something out with them im betting that someone is gonna be singleton the car its in that body shop right just keep it on the screen and when it moves you move go check with your people just get me something to work with and ill do the rest just be ready porter were going to find him ill be back to check on you in four hours make it six porter said he watched until the door had closed then turned on a small light and repositioned the headphones in the past he had spent more than a day wedged high in a tree in the jungle just waiting for a mark six more hours here was nothing time well spent if it meant putting a bullet in dr james ferendellis eyehis favorite shot it was time the mans photo joined the other two hundred or so in the gallery on the wall of his study high time chapter shes a fendship f a hundred fortysix feet fore to aft thirtyfoot beam steel hull if gabe felt like alice in wonderland before his lunch with lemar stoddard his tour of aphrodite sent him spiraling well beyond the rabbit hole the yacht was embarrassingly luxurious with oriental carpets leather furnishings crystal light fixtures and three full baths with deep jacuzzis the other two staterooms merely had elegant shower stalls it was odd being escorted on a private tour around the spectacular boat by drews father when drew himself was just a few miles away in fact before lemars driver came to pick him up gabe had taken a cab to the white house and met in the residence with the mans son and daughterinlaw as well as magnus lattimore the news that gabe had decided to stay the course charted by jim ferendelliat least for the time beingwas accepted by the trio with quiet gratitude and what seemed like forthright determination to do whatever gabe asked of them in exchange for the reprieve drew would have to agree to work with dr kyle blackthorn for as long as the forensic psychologist needed to formulate a diagnosis and treatment plan and finally they would all have to understand that another episode involving the president just one would likely result in gabes pulling the plug and calling in vice president tom cooper for a crash course in the twentyfifth amendment where was this beauty made gabe asked grateful that he had actually thought of a question holland the dutch and the italians are the very best at this sort of thing ive only had aphrodite for six or seven months but she puts any other boat ive ever owned to shame whats her range gabe asked next reconnecting with some of his naval academy roots stoddard wearing a dress shirt no tie charcoal slacks and a navy blue blazer looked pleased transatlantic maybe even to the end of the mediterranean traveling fourteen or fifteen knots not the swiftest lady on the seas but certainly one of the sleekest and most relaxing i wont mind an extra half a day crossing the atlantic maybe someday youd like to join me on the trip first things first lets get your son reelected well put gabe marveled at the utter comfort and relative lack of pretension with which the presidents father enjoyed and presented his wealth of course gabe reminded himself when you had everything and billions in the bank in case you discovered something you didnt it had to be fairly easy to act as if it were all no big deal still he also reminded himself as they settled in across from one another at a glasstopped table on the lower deck this was a man who had founded and supported a number of charities devoted primarily to cancer research and reducing infant mortality and he was also the man who had supplied gabe with emotional and financial support and an attorney at a time when his own father had all but turned his back whoever had looked at wealth without class or style and had coined the term nouveau riche clearly did not have lemar stoddard in mind the table was set with crystal and fine china there was a small silver pillbox to the left of lemars place he noticed gabe glancing at it and answered the unasked question by dropping three tablets onto his tongue and washing them down with a long draft of lemon water see what you have to look forward to two blood pressure pills and one to stop my stomach from making acid and thats just the noon box my doctors going to get my blood pressure down to a hundred and twenty or kill me in the process sounds like you have a good doc i shoot for numbers like that in my patients too and they complain just as much is your pressure responding dont ask stoddard ended the exchange by motioning to the young whitecoated waiter that they were ready to be served i hope you like salmon we dont get a lot of good seafood in wyoming gabe replied the aroma clashes with that of the cattle being driven down the center of main street stoddard grinned its good to see you after so long gabe he said i always liked your sense of humor laughing at oneself is said to be an advanced form of wit and its especially easy when the one happens to be me stow that talk i was there remember you have certainly overcome the tragedy and the odds and made something of yourself thank you sir rumor has it that your son is well on his way to making something of himself too stoddards face crinkled in an arresting way when he smiled but gabe also noticed that the tycoons remarkably intelligent eyes remained leveled at him as if taking in every nuance of his expressions stay sharp he cautioned himself in all likelihood this was not a man who relished immersion in idle chitchatat least not for very long gabe guessed that when it came to lunch with stoddard whether at his club or his suite at the watergate or his lodge or here aboard aphrodite the courses on the menu were seldom served without an agenda so stoddard said as waldorf salads were placed before them i understand that you were a special guest at the dinner honoring the president of botswana last night gabe wondered briefly how often the presidents father was invited to such affairs he guessed that despite being the most powerful leader in the world drew was and always would be intimidated by the man it seemed quite possible that omitting him from guest lists was one way of dealing with that dynamic gabe also decided that if stoddard knew about the blacktie affair he also knew that both his son and his sons physician were conspicuous by their absences even for a man with considerably less acumen than his host the implications of such a concurrence would be obvious gabe gripped the sides of his chair as if it were a flotation device five minutes into lunch with aphrodite tied fast to the pier and they were already on choppy seas i um at the last minute i wasnt able to attend he tried but you were there for a while the assault on what had transpired in the white house was close at hand gabe knew it was time for a preemptive strike sir lemar lemar you know that i would never violate the trust any of my patients place in me my belief in patientphysician confidentiality is second only to my belief in my horse im worried about my son thats all i understand gabe even though drew has had asthma for a number of years and has mentioned migraine headaches to me in the past i couldnt help feeling that there was more to the story than what the public was being fed i didnt accumulate all of thishe gestured to aphroditewithout a builtin bullshit detector and when i saw a tape of that press conference last night every light on my detector panel lit up i dont know what to say gabe replied unwilling to lend even the slightest credence to stoddards belief that there was something medically wrong with his son beyond what the public was being told theres nothing i can or would tell you other than what you already know to gabes utter surprise the billionaire forged ahead gabe is there something the matter with drew he asked i mean seriously the matter gabe hesitated then pushed back from the table lemar dont force me to leave he said and please dont play the card of all that you did for me way back when ive already told you many times how grateful i am for that easy easy stoddard said hands raised im a very worried parent thats all my son starts getting migraine headaches he never had before then all of a sudden his personal physician vanishes along with the mans daughter do you blame me for being concerned no sirlemar i dont blame you a bit he chose his next words carefully if drew ever tells me theres something about his health he wants me to share with you ill contact you in a heartbeat but until that happens youll just have to get used to some frustration stoddard sighed and motioned to the waiter that he had no further interest in his salmon anxious for the inquisition to end gabe did the same for the next ten minutes through coffee and a chocolate soufflé that gabe suspected was close to perfect the conversation lightened considerablyan amusing tale out of school about the presidents childhood some questions about gabes medical practice and lariat and an anecdote about magnus lattimore containing a veiled suggestion of the mans sexual preference for men a possibility that gabe had wondered about in passing but didnt particularly care about one way or the other so stoddard said with no more transition than that have you had much contact with thomas cooper the third very little actually he insists on using the third whenever possibledoesnt want to be just another tom cooper you dont have a physicianpatient relationship with him do you not unless he comes to see me for medical help and so far that hasnt happened he has his own doctora navy man gabe felt uncomfortable speaking about anyone else to stoddard but it was quite clear that the presidents father like most of those people he had met since arriving in dc traded in gossip speculation and information the way folks in tyler traded in horses it wasnt necessarily anything sinister or immoral it was just the nature of the washington beast gossip speculation and informationthe coin of the realm gabe knew that even the most casual offhand remark such as the one he had just made about tom cooper not having come to him as a patient could have useful implications to the right person once again gabe cautioned himself to be careful he was no better equipped to be playing in this game than he would have been in olympic ice dancing he flexed his neck and became aware of the all too familiar discomfort of tightly knotted muscles i know youre being very careful with what you share with me stoddard was saying possibly with anyone but i want you to know that if you hear or encounter anything about the vice president anything at all you will be doing a great service to your friend and my son by reporting it to me i dont understand gabe replied i thought the vice president and drew were linked emotionally and politically nonsense stoddard shot simply put and contrary to the pap his pr men have fed to the public thomas cooper the third is no friend of drews he would like nothing more than to set his butt down behind that desk in the oval office and it kills him every day that hes going to have to wait another four years to get there if in fact he gets there at all gabe was shocked at the virulence of stoddards attack well nothing ive heard supports that view was the best he could manage during the primaries four years ago cooper started every manner of rumor about drew when confronted of course he denied everything and my son actually believed him but i know better i warned drew against choosing him for a running mate but he wouldnt listen tom cooper is a brutus and as things stand hes just waiting until after the election to begin to assert himself and to take credit for drews achievements gabe shook his head in dismay one of the many things credited to the president was adding a public importance and credibility to the office of second in command that hadnt existed in prior administrations the explanation in the press of course was that drew was grooming cooper for eight more years of democratic control of the office was there something behind lemars vitriolic attack on the man gabe wondered now did lemar have suspicion or information that something might be wrongthat his sons presidency might be in trouble was that what was behind the invitation to lunch did he know more than he was letting on about drews illness well gabe said ill be certain to keep my eyes and ears open without warning the billionaires countenance softened dramatically he reached across the elegant table and took gabes hand in both of his suddenly looking vulnerable and very much like a man in his seventies gabe please he said his earnestness unquestionable please dont let anything happen to my boy chapter gabe please please dont let anything happen to my boy with lemar stoddards oddly compelling display of vulnerability still reverberating in his mind gabe entered the white house through the west wing checkpoint and headed directly to the clinic the president and first lady had promised him they would spend the day at home leaving the residence only for a luncheon meeting with his campaign advisors in the small white house dining room and after that a carefully orchestrated press conference in the pressbriefing room which gabe was to attend by and large the polls were holding between an eight and elevenpoint lead for drew and tom cooper over bradford dunleavy and charlie christman a fourterm representative from texas whose politics were clearly and purposefully further to the right than those of dunleavy a selfproclaimed moderate conservative eight to eleven pointscertainly not a landslide but an encouraging margin at this stage of the campaign still lattimore had reminded gabe just a few hours ago even an elevenpoint lead was unlikely to survive any credible evidence that the chief executive was undergoing diagnostic evaluation or even more damaging treatment for mental illness of any sort rumors of treatment for depression had been enough to start the dukakis campaign spinning out of orbit there had been other errors by the democratic strategists in that election lattimore admitted but a dukakis twelvepoint lead after the convention had turned into a tenpoint deficit with jackrabbit quickness of passing interest to gabe was a poll reported in that mornings post that he had read during the car ride from aphrodite to the white house in it thomas cooper iii held a fourteenpoint lead over charlie christman if the two of them were running against one another for the top spot experience and public trust were the two main issues to those voters who were polled nowhere did the poll pit the vice president against bradford dunleavy but the analyst of the survey did opine that cooper might win that race as well tom cooper is a brutus the small waiting area in the physicians office was empty save for heather estee the young ultraefficient office manager cum receptionist by her account over the threeplus years she and jim ferendelli had worked together they had become quite close and she was devastated not only by his disappearance but by his daughters as well jennifer and i had lunch together several times heather had told gabe and once we even went clothes shopping shes a brilliant talented wonderful person i cant believe shes missing i pray every day that shes all right as gabe entered the modest space heather on the phone glanced up from the notes she was taking smiled and waved gabe motioned to the partially opened door to the physicians office and she waved him to knock that the covering doc was in gabe had just done so when she said gretchen just a second please dr singleton this was on my desk when i came back from running some errands a little while ago she handed him a plain white business envelope with dr gabriel singleton typed on the front but no address at that moment the inner office door was pulled open he slipped the envelope into his jacket pocket as he was greeted with a noncommittal smile curt nod and brief handshake by the doc on duty this day a navy captain named nick mccall the greeting wasnt the least bit disconcerting to gabe there was still a coolness and formality toward him on the part of most of the other physicians assigned to the white house medical unitno surprise especially with admiral ellis wright running the show from his position as chief of the white house military office and boss of everyone on the unit staff except for the presidents personal civilian physician any word from the potus gabe asked closing the office door gently behind him not since you were here earlier not a word hes been in a meeting in the dining room for about an hour magnus just called and said hed be up here to get you in a few minutes fine gabe im really sorry we havent had much chance to talk ive been scrambling to catch up with everything i let drop after jim ferendelli vanished any theories about that mccall shook his head it makes no sense jim seemed like a pretty lowkey guy totally devoted to the president and to doing a good job there are still a slew of fbi and secret service people beating the bushes for him and rumors are still flying well theres nothing id like better than to see him walk through that door right now hows it been going for you so far i went from seeing like thirty patients a day in my practice back in wyoming to seeing one here and im totally exhausted what do you make of that the strain of having your one patient be the most powerful man on earth will tend to do that to you dont worry youll be seeing more cases as time goes by an hour or so ago i had a maintenance man with chest pain and hyperacute changes of an mi on his ekg that was sort of exciting we just finished cleaning up you have everything you needed pretty much except maybe a couple of more hands and a dozen or so more square feet of treatment room space but we did okay iv nitrates oxygen morphine aspirin bloods drawn he was pretty stable by the time the ambulance arrived bloods shortly after drawing the three vials of blood from the president gabe had brought them down to the office labeled them with the reverse of his home phone in tyler placed them in a sealed specimen bag and set them on the back of a shelf in the undercounter refrigerator until he could decide what tests to order and where the samples should be sent it wasnt done according to a legal chainofcustody protocol but he wasnt handling evidence and the fewer things drew stoddards name was physically attached to the better fatigue the hour the lack of a specific plan and subsequent events had temporarily driven thoughts of the samples from gabes mind sounds like you did great he said wondering if there was anything wrong with sharing the fact that he had drawn the vials the memory of lemar stoddard pumping him for information and the vision of ellis wright staring him down and calling his medical ability to question gave him enough pause to hold back lattimore would probably be able to answer his questions about where the blood chemistry studies should be run for effect he cleared his throat twice and then asked if mccall wanted to grab a glass and split the diet coke he had sequestered in the fridge there would be none there to split but he had plenty of fallback explanations for that centering about his absentmindedness the captain begged off and gabe entered the treatment room prepared to continue the charade the refrigerator was empty no diet coke no tubes of blood nothing gabe mentally retraced his steps from the eventful evening somewhere around two he had taken the elevator down to the clinic labeled the tubes and placed them on the rack in the back of the refrigerator then he and treat griswold had left the white house gabe was certain of it nick has anyone been in the fridge that you know of my diet coke is gone i can only tell you since seven thirty this morning when i got here i havent even left for lunch heather had a wrap sent up for me there was a lot of chaos when the mi was here and about as many people as that room will hold so someone might have come across it and maybe helped themselves damn okay singleton a diet coke is one thing the blood samples you drew are another come up with some scenario to explain how they might have gone mia speaking through the intercom heathers voice sliced into the moment dr singleton mr lattimore is here tell him ill be right out come on his mind urged how did it happen gabe left nick mccall and crossed through the examining room to the small bathroom where a lifetime ago he had engaged in nearmortal combat with a bow tie the brief note in the envelope was typed doc i have the keys to jfs place meet me at your parking space at six a ps your car looks great alison gabe flushed the toilet for effect and washed his hands he was drying them when he returned to mccall nick tell me something he asked sensing the answer before he had even voiced the question what nurse was assisting you during the mi it was the new one alison she rushed over from the clinic in the eisenhower building shes really excellent like having another md have you met her yeah gabe replied the tension gathering in his chest ive met her chapter gabe left the white house at five and headed to the watergate by cab following the realization that the bloods he had drawn on the president were missing and that alison had been in the clinic assisting in the cardiac resuscitation he had visited with the first family and checked his patient over drew stoddard was cheerful alert and energetic he had some significant amnesia surrounding the events of the previous night but his longterm memory was sharp and his mental status testing showed no real holes admiral ramrod thinks he runs this place drew said and to some extent he does but sometimes i have to find a way to remind him that despite all the authority he has i am still numero uno bringing you to washington instead of taking wrights suggestion that i go for a military doc was one way of keeping him in his place you know i dont think i mentioned it back in tyler but the initial idea to bring you on board was my fathers he really thinks a great deal of you and i do of him you think you can handle the admiral okay with your support i can handle him as much as i need to so i get another day as the big kahuna the question was asked with some lightness but there was no mistaking the seriousness behind it you get another day gabe said how long a leash for the time being shortvery short for a moment the president seemed ready for debate maybe after tomorrow i can start doing a little campaigning he ventured finally you know to keep my job lets do this a day at a time drew ive lined up a consultant who should be here sometime tomorrow i need to share some of the burden youve heaped onto these stooped shoulders hes the one ive chosen it wasnt until gabe was in a cab headed back to the watergate that he sorted through the significance of his decision to say nothing to the president about having had lunch with his father it wasnt an oversight gabe admitted to himself but now just didnt seem like the time to wade into the deluge of questions that were sure to follow perhaps he was merely catching onto the washington game of less is moreit cant be a lie if you never said it another unresolved issue was who to speak with regarding having a pointblank shot taken at him as he was headed home from the white house the last thing he wanted next to being shot was a secret service contingent following him around and the next thing to that was any sort of leak and the massive publicity that was certain to follow until his best response became clear he had decided he would just leave things be it would be a huge relief to have kyle blackthorn on the scene the psychologist whose logic sometimes reminded gabe of mr spock on star trek had an earthy wisdom and perspective unlike anyone else he knew first though there was the matter of alison cromartiewho she was really working for why she had lied to gabe and how she came to steal the blood he had drawn on the president at quarter of six when gabe arrived at the watergate garage the buick was back in its space with a new rear window and a clean interior if there had been any damage to the rear bumper it had been touched up if the upholstery had been torn by the wouldbe assassins bullet it had been repaired if nothing else alison most definitely had some clout gabe leaned against the car and tried to put together what he knew and what he sensed of the woman a continuinged course he had once attended on psychiatry for primarycare docs had spent an hour on sociopathspeople with little or no innate ability to separate truth from lies right from wrong glib often charismatic usually believable always dangerous the condition had a formal for insurance purposes nameantisocial personality disorder or something like that he wasnt sure of the precise wording could alison be one of those gabe wished he had paid more attention at the course so cowboy what do you think of your new wheels alison wearing jeans and a light zipupthefront san antonio sweatshirt was leaning against a volvo appraising him from no more than ten feet away can you arrange for onehour tailoring too i can be resourceful if thats what you mean actually i didnt even have to go through the office for this one the colombian guy who owns the auto body shop around the corner from my apartment thinks we are destined to spend forever together he did this do you think asking him for favors is leading him on maybe but hes like seventyfive and has three of his sons working for him and i think his wife is still in the picture too im not that great at reading people but he doesnt seem like much of a threat what about me gabe wanted to ask deliberately looking away from her am i a threat he was surprised at the hurt he was feelinghurt mixed with anger that she had lied to him more times in one day than cinnie had over the entire length of their marriage ferendellis place is in georgetown yes he asked the far side from heresomewhere between a walk and a drive hows your luck at finding parking spaces it was always pretty good in tyler but we only have three or four cars in town and a lot of spaces in that case lets take this car she flipped the keys to him traffics heavy but i dont mind spending the extra time together if you dont stop looking at me that way ill manage he said opening the door for her and receiving a smile of pleasant surprise in return in my world people worry that opening the door for a woman might offend her i like your world better so tell me you dropped off the bullet at the lab i did and did your handlers have any theories about who might have tried to kill me if in fact the guy wasnt a secret service employee to begin with i dont have any handlers doctor i have department heads and a division chief was that snide tone on purpose huh oh no he warned himself to be more careful im on edge about this thats all someone tried to kill me and the police show up a minute later and at your urging i end up not telling them anythingor anyone else for that matter well believe me or not it was the right thing to do i did speak to my superior about what happened he doesnt have any idea who could have done this or why is there anything going on surrounding dr ferendelli or the president that you havent told anyone about absolutely not nice delivery gabe thought not too rushed not too forced a little bit of incredulity thrown in you pick up on things quickly is this supervisor you spoke to the same guy who has no idea why ferendelli might have disappeared he asked pardon me for suggesting it but youre sounding snide again youre upset because i didnt tell you i was secret service when we first met is that it sorry lets drop it for now go left at the next light except for finishing the directions there was no other conversation ferendellis place was a threestory brownstone on a small treelined street off macarthur a parking place materialized just three doors down but with the tension between them more or less out in the open there was no comment about gabes luck thirtyseven hundred a month furnished alison said as they paused on the short front walk dr ferendelli and his wife both came from money in addition to that he invented something and got a patent on itsome sort of electronic gizmo that can pinpoint even small veins and arteries through the skin i may not be completely right about what it does ill try to find out but it sounds like such a thing might have some practical uses their place outside of raleigh is for sale for two and a half million i hope hes alive to spend the money ive been here twice she said opening the front door and then dealing with the alarm keypad in the hallway the place has been thoroughly searched and dusted for fingerprints i doubt theres anything left to find i just want to get a sense of the man i understand alison said coolly i can wait in the car or maybe in the kitchen theres a neat view of the woods from there and a little bit of the river the views from upstairs are much more striking that would be fine he replied matching her tone and gabe yes im sorry we seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot me too he replied as much to himself as to her me too the house had a wonderful feelheavy roughhewn beams and fireplaces in both the kitchen and the living room dark rich wainscoting in the dining room leaded glass in many of the windows there was so much money in the world concentrated with so few gabe mused as he made his way up the ornate staircase in one day he had been aboard aphrodite at the potomac basin yacht club in the watergate condominium residences and now here so much money he thought about his small place in the desert on the outskirts of tyler unlike his best friend and roommate at the academy he was never cut out for the life of brownstones and yachts even if the accident at fairhaven had never happened he would have eventually found his way to someplace like the ranch the ferendelli master bedroom had two tall mullioned windows that overlooked the tops of shade trees and beyond them the potomac spectacular set up beside the window was a professionalgrade artists easel with the rough sketching on an eighteenbytwentyfourinch canvas for an oil painting and evidence that someonejim ferendelli he supposedhad begun painting the piece gabe expected it to be a rendering of the view he was seeing and in fact it was a landscape but instead of the scene outside the window it was one of vast rolling hills surrounding in the distance some sort of structures perhaps the house barn and other outbuildings of a farm physician inventor artist gabe had always felt that the term renaissance man was overused but it certainly seemed that in his predecessor he had found one not the least bit certain what he was searching for gabe flipped through the clothes hanging in the two closets checked the floor beneath them and scanned the contents of the bureau and the bathroom medicine cabinet there were the usual salves and overthecounter analgesics but no prescriptions a healthy renaissance man at that in no particular rush gabe checked the two smaller bedrooms on the second floor then entered the exquisitely appointed office and library the room perhaps a thirteenfoot square featured a mahogany desk oxblood highbacked leather chair and matching love seat finely framed prints both renoirs graced two of the walls the drawers of the desk held nothing of interest except three portrait sketches that confirmed ferendellis skill as an artist two of them both rendered in charcoal were of a lovely younger woman with a narrow intelligent face and large widely set eyesferendellis daughter jennifer perhaps a third portrait again in charcoal again neckup was of a somewhat older woman also quite attractive with short hair and eyes that seemed almost luminescent even when done in char gabe stared intently at the work then he carried the sketch over to the rooms only window the early summer evening light was quite enough to confirm his initial impression that the subject of the drawing had to be lily sexton the woman destined in the event of a stoddardcooper victory in november to be the first secretary of science and technology the wall across from the desk and the window was the libraryneatly aligned volumes nearly all of them hardcover and many leather boundten feet across and extending up nine feet to the ceiling the collection was impressive there were classics chaucer dickens hemingway tolstoy fitzgerald coffeetable art books french impressionists picasso winslow homer and a number of others plus several volumes dealing with ww ii in addition there were groupings of american and european history world history philosophy and politicsmostly conservative gabe opened several volumes but there were no bookplates and no other indication as to whether the books belonged to the owner of the brownstone or to renaissance man dr jim ferendelli having learned more than he had expected to about his predecessor and having found one surprisethe portrait of lily sexton that the fbi and secret service may have missedgabe was about to head downstairs when his attention was drawn to book spines at the far right end of the very lowest shelf a set of six or seven volumes all paperbacks with colorful covers he pulled out the largest thickest of the volumes nanomedicine by robert a freitas jr volume basic capabilities it was a highly technical treatise pages long with an extensive table of contents and vast index meticulously blockprinted at the top of the inside front cover was the single word ferendelli gabe set the tome on the desk and brought out the others understanding nanotechnology nanotechnology for dummies nanotechnology science innovation and opportunity nanotechnology a gentle introduction to the next big idea each of the volumes had ferendellis name carefully printed inside the front cover gabe reflected on the neatly folded underwear and carefully arranged socks in the bedroom bureau and added meticulous to the characteristics he had already attributed to the man then he took a few minutes to flip though the volumes expounding on this latest aspect of ferendellia fascination with nanoscience the study and manipulation of atomic and molecularsize particles and nanotechnology the construction of useful chemicals and machines built from individual atoms and molecules nanotechnology what gabe read in just three minutes of flipping pages was already way more than he knew about the subject but he decided that would not be the case for long he brought a heavy garbage bag up from the kitchen and set the books inside when alison asked what he was doing he was ready there are a couple of uptodate medical specialty texts in the library that i could use at the clinic he lied im sure the doc wont mind terrific find anything of interest up there nothing he lied again truth is i really didnt expect we would piece of cake he thought as they headed back to the buick once you got the hang of lying there really wasnt much to it taking a good medical history was much harder chapter midnight it had been yearsdecades actuallysince gabe had studied uninterrupted with such intensity perhaps back then it was a test in med school maybe his internalmedicine boards whatever the exam given where his life had taken him after fairhaven he always welcomed the chance to study where some sort of goal was involved tonight that goal was learning as much as he could about nanoscience and nanotechnology he had gotten himself up and running with the perusal of a few articles on the internet and then chosen the most basic of ferendellis textsan overview of the field in a small volume put together by the editors of scientific american next came nanotechnology for dummies now he was approaching the other books by topic rather than trying to scan each from cover to cover nanotechnology in your world pathways to molecular manufacturing building big by building small making molecules into motors the fantastic voyage into the human body it was possible even likely that jim ferendellis study of nanoscience and technology had nothing to do with his disappearance but it was fact that at the moment gabe had precious little in the way of ideas and it was also fact that less than twentyfour hours ago a mana legitimate assassin or part of an ingenious charadehad tried to kill him alison had offered to take a cab or the metro home from ferendellis brownstone and gabe anxious to start reading and not wanting to screen every word she said for underlying intent had come close to agreeing in the end though he acknowledged his ambivalence toward her and his reluctance to end their evening together and made the drive to her place although in near silence she lived in a prim brick garden apartment complex in arlington virginia just across the river from dc although she shared with gabe that she now suspected the residence would not be hers for long it seemed quite possible that by exposing her identity as she had she might have outstayed her usefulness and be facing imminent deportation back to the desk job in san antonio the secret service was as uptight as any branch of the military she told himmaybe more so a blown assignment was a blown assignment regardless of the reasons once during the drive he had risked a glance over at her she was gazing impassively ahead approaching headlights glinting off the dampness in her dark eyes she really did have an unusual expressive beauty he acknowledged as well as an energy he couldnt get out of his mind still something else he couldnt get out of his mind was that she had been placed in the white house medical unit to get information from him possibly about the presidents medical situation and she was willingno requiredto lie and possibly to steal as well to get the job done at that moment no amount of beauty or energy could make up for the lack of trust he was feeling toward her too bad well she said as she opened the car door and stepped out in front of her apartment complex see you around see you around he replied barely looking at her she took a step away and then looked back over her shoulder gabe yes its not like you think before he could ask what she meant she had turned and was gone hours later thoughts of her continued to intrude on his studies despite a load of caffeine from a splendidly rich colombian blend gabe could feel the hour and lack of sleep beginning to overtake him still he was fascinated by the material and reluctant to call it quits for the night carefully avoiding the bed and keeping the lights on full he rotated from the desk to a nottoocomfortable easy chair to the kitchen table and then back to the desk again as he read taking notes on a yellow legal pad he felt an increasing connection to dr jim ferendelli what had drawn the man to be interested in this stillarcane field what was his connection to lily sexton gabe remembered the spark of interest he himself had felt at first meeting her but the images and the scent and gentle touch of alison cromartie were fresh and powerful enough to keep any fantasies involving lily at bay ferendelli and sexton possible he mused very possible he had heard the term nanotechnology before and knew that it had something to do with constructing various materials beginning with very small particles but until tonight that was about as far as his knowledge went well he realized as he continued to read not totally he had come across someplacean article or novel or possibly something on public radiothe phantasmagorical possibility of nanotechnology eventually creating a new lifeform submicroscopic nanorobots capable of reproducing themselves again and again until the resultant gray goo began to smother all living matter on earth gray goo and nanobots gabe washed the grit from his eyes returned to the internet and did a more detailed reading on the subject the terms gray goo and nanobots possibly first coined by k eric drexler often referred to as the father of nanotechnology were pure science fictionspeculation depicting the ultimate end of the evolution of the science of all science for that matter decades or even centuries in the future interesting to think about and to debate over coffee but hardly an impending threat according to drexlers theory a selfreplicating nanobot one of hundreds of billions created to help society in any of hundreds or even thousands of ways could undergo a change similar to a biological mutation that one mutant particle then would create another then the two of them would each reproduce again two would become four then four eight then eight sixteentwo to the eventual power of infinity so long as the raw materials the substrate necessary to feed and sustain the process remained available because of the mutation like microbes suddenly impervious to antibiotics the technology to stop the unbridled growth of the new nanobots would no longer be effective gray goo the president feels that the federal government needs to take a more proactive position regarding control of scientific research and developmentstem cells cloning nanotechnology they were lily sextons words nanotechnology last night in the red room nanotechnology tonight in jim ferendellis library in wyoming gabe had encountered the word maybe once every few years now in washington twice in a day or so gabe returned to the books at carol stoddards urging the president was on the verge of appointing lily sexton to a new cabinet post that would in part at least oversee the evolution of nanotechnologyprotecting the world in theory at least from drexlers armageddon two am the bellwether muscles at the base of gabes neck were screaming for the relief that only sleep could bring he had sacrificed two codeines to the ache with little or no effect and pledged to use no moreat least not tonight the caffeine was still punching away at his nervous system but connecting less and less it was time to stop still what remained of his willpower refused to quit the scope of the new science was mesmerizing and although the future of nanotechnology was in many respects as vague and ill defined as gray goo the present was already intensely fascinatingand in some regards quite profitable as well gabe studied the photo of an early computer nearly filling the room it was in thanks to microprocessors his ultrathin laptop probably had more power now nanosize computer transistors were making even the sleekest pcs seem clunky disinfectants for killing specific germs without generating any human toxicity lightweight bulletproof armor and nonallergic cosmetics were just a few of the products of nanotechnology already on the marketplace gabes eyelids drifted closed and refused to reopen until he promised them a trip to bedno passing go no collecting once under the covers he eased into sleep through swirling images of drew stoddard and magnus lattimore of ellis wright and alison of tom cooper and lemar stoddard and jim ferendelli and finally of the charcoal portrait of the woman he hoped to spend at least part of the day ahead withthe elegant eccentric mistress of lily pad stables lily sexton phd chapter even during the drinking years gabe had never been a sound sleeper later on in his life the nurses at the hospital and the answering service operators at tyler connections knew that no matter what hour they called he would answer before the second ring and would invariably sound as if he were sitting at the kitchen table sipping coffee not even the xanax he took when sleep simply wouldnt come at all kept him from going on instant alert this morning when the phone began ringing in his watergate apartment gabe was enmeshed in a bizarre and bloody dream involving being trapped inside a slaughterhouse the woman trapped beside him might have been his ex or alison or possibly even lily sexton it was impossible to tell the desperate bellowing of doomed and dying cattle was terrifying and totally vivid and yielded only reluctantly to the telephone so that it might have been the third or fourth ring before his fumbling fingers located the receiver the led on the bedside alarm read maybe two and a half hours since he finally walked away from his nanotechnology notes dr singleton its magnus lattimore i hope i didnt wake you at the sound of the mans voice gabe went cold all he could think was that he had screwed up bigtime in letting lattimore and the stoddards talk him out of initiating the twentyfifth amendment why else a call at five in the morning is drew in trouble he doused the frog in his voice with water from the halffilled glass on his bedside table no no the chief of staff replied quickly everythings fine great i guess i should have said that right away sorry the president is doing fine fine in fact he just finished a fortyfiveminute workout with his trainer terrific gabe felt the tsunami of adrenaline begin to ebb he remembered that at the academy drew like a number of the othersmost of them private school kids with advanced study habitsoften chose to wake up at two or three in the morning to do his work while distractions were at a minimum gabe also found himself wondering in some corner of his mind exactly what in the hell the slaughteredcattle dream was all about believe me doc youre doing a great job lattimore was saying if hes okay everything else is secondary gabe said pointedly ignoring the praise youve got that right my friend well im calling on his behalf with a request go on theres a large meeting at the baltimore convention center later this morning which the president was supposed to address some major political allies and donors are running the show and one of them called quite upset that the secretary of the treasury had been written in to take the potuss place you see after the gastroenteritis attack the other night you said we should stick close to home and so we i know what i said magnus go on yes well although we still have a decent lead over dunleavy there has been a significant slippage in a couple of the important polls the president is feeling great and he thinks he should go speak to these people in person it can be a very brief address and what do you think i think we have made a deal with you and we are going to keep that deal but you want him to go and make this speech more importantly he wants to go can the decision wait for twenty minutes not too much longer than that our advance teams are on the way to baltimore just in case we get the green light from you but there are some other logistical problems that need to be worked out gabe glanced down at his wrists halfexpecting to see the strings of a marionette in that case he said give me time for a quick shower and ill be right over ill decide for certain after i have seen him thats all we can ask for youre in charge doc youre always in charge yeah thanks thats good to be reminded of a car will be waiting for you outside the main entrance magnus tell me something yes that carwhere is it right now there was just enough hesitation so that gabe knew the chief of staff was deciding if there was anything to lose by telling the truth the car yes well actually the car is waiting out in front of the watergate right now thanks it looks like im going to have to work at being a little less predictable gabe said he set down the receiver wondering if any of those illfated cows being herded down the chute in his dream had looked like him three sets of forty gabe thats a hundred and twenty pushups do you think the president of north korea can do a hundred and twenty pushups how old is he i dont know maybe eighty i think youve probably got him drew believe me id be the happiest man alive if all the worlds political problems could be solved by which countrys leader could do the most pushups im going to look inside your eyes again pick a spot over there on the wall and just stare at it dilates the pupils right you got it good looks fine in there now touch my finger with your right index finger then touch your nose do it five times fast okay now the left index finger good the president sitting beside his bed looking boyish and utterly fit submitted to a physical and neurological examination nothing amiss absolutely nothing gabe tried once again to match the frightening display he had witnessed here thirtysix hours ago with any specific diagnosesa frantic manic disoriented hallucinating hyperactive episode with cardiovascular acceleration that had come about with little warning and resolved after a couple of hours without apparent residual effects mri negative ct scan normalat least according to the coded records at bethesda naval blood work normal although the samples were drawn eight weeks ago during his brief hospitalization hours after his attack most recent bloods drawn by gabe during an attack missing it seemed logical that jim ferendelli had also drawn blood work during one of the episodes he observed but neither the president nor magnus lattimore could recall any tubes being obtained until gabe drew them track down any blood chemistry results gabe made a mental note and filed it with what seemed like an infinite number of other mental notes well doc howd i do you seem fine i feel fine if you go to baltimore i go i wouldnt have it any other way youre my shaman my healer gabe i know you want to treat me very conservatively until you know whats going on but i have this sort of demanding job and i know pal i know im doing my best to work around that demanding job although ill grant you it is a bit like redecorating the bathroom with an elephant in the tub nice image i like it although we really should think in terms of donkeys rather than elephants from now on donkeys in the tub drew there was a message waiting for me in the office the consultant i sent forthe psychologistis going to be here this evening i want him to do an interview and complete battery of what we call neuropsychiatric testing on youintelligenceprobably beginning tomorrow what did you say his name was blackthorn dr kyle blackthorn hes a little um eccentric but hes also incredibly insightful i revere eccentric and insightful bring him on i will gabe fixed his gaze on the president drew do you remember the tubes of blood i took from you the other night not really well i did three of them for what for whatever tests i decided i wanted fine with me except that theyre gone what gone missing they disappeared from the medical clinic refrigerator sometime during the day after i drew them any ideas the president looked genuinely nonplussed i have no clue what could have happened but ill get treat and my staff on it right away it would seem that quite a few people have access to that officethe doctors the nurses the pas plus a couple of paramedics and one admiral gabe added ah yes admiral ramrod well i think if taking tubes of blood isnt in the officers manual of right and proper things to do ellis didnt take them okay gabe said virtually convinced from his patients reaction that the man had no knowledge the tubes had vanished let alone any responsibility for the theft for the time being why dont you just let me keep my eyes and ears open i dont think theres anything to be gained by making a big deal about itat least not yet maybe they got thrown out by accident anythings possible so when and where for todays deal i think ten thirty someone will come by your office to get you admiral wright and whoevers covering today have put together the medical team from now on when were going on the road ill have you do it either way theyll all know that so long as youre around youre in charge i like the way that sounds drew yeah i kind of enjoy hearing that one myself its good to be the king the president immediately picked up on the line from mel brookss history of the world you said it he replied it is good to be the king the two friends shook hands and gabe headed through the foyer toward the elevator he was nearly there when his radio crackled on wrangler wrangler do you read me over wrangler was the radio name he had chosen with the help of the secret service it wasnt used all the timemore often he was referred to as docbut gabe liked it when it was he threw the switch on the speaker attached to the sleeve of his jacket and spoke into it this is wrangler over wrangler this is agent lowellare you available to see a patient in your clinic over im headed there now from mavericks quarters over maverick the flamboyant fearless tom cruise character in top gun was the name given to the president in honor of his war record as a pilot in accordance with white house communications office protocol then all of the first familys call names began with the same letter as the president carol was moondance andrew jr had chosen muscles and rick had picked mindmeld from star trek scotsman magnus lattimore was piper after the instrument he allegedly played quite well though seldom when he was sober well be there in ten minutes do you copy over ten minutes roger that whats the problem whos the patient over the problem is a foreign body of some sort in the eye the patient is bear he has specifically requested you do you know who bear is over i do tell him ill be there to see him in ten minutes over over and out curious bear named gabe figured for his physique or maybe his home state of montana was the vice president he has specifically requested you gabe stepped into the small elevator replaying yesterdays luncheon conversation with lemar stoddard and stoddards warning regarding thomas cooper iii now what he wondered as the gears engaged now what chapter the clinic was being covered by a physicians assistant from the army gabe dismissed her for an hour and then checked the fridge again for the tubes of blood nothing except an army lunch box and a dr pepper it had to have been alison motive opportunity he knew he was stretching the facts to fit his theories about the woman but he was on edgeabout her and in fact about almost everyone else he had met since arriving in dc one main question about the missing tubes refused to go away if alison was indeed responsible for the theft how had she known they were there his plan had been to determine through lattimore and one of the senior docs on the white house staff how to send the blood off for routine chemistries and hematology along with some toxicology without giving any hint as to their source how had alison known about the samples if she had been planted in the office to gain his confidence and learn about the presidents medical status who was pulling her strings the questions far outstripped their answers gabe its not like you think her words rattled around in his head his coolness toward her was hardly subtle but did she understand where it was coming from he warned himself against letting her oblique comment affect his judgment as far as he could tell no onenot the president not the first lady not the chief of staff not alisonhad been absolutely straight with him since he stepped off the plane at andrews afb now it was time to see what lemar stoddards warning was all about tom cooper is a brutus and as things stand hes just waiting until after the election to begin to assert himself and to take credit for drews achievements wrangler wrangler are you on over with all the things gabe had found difficult about his new position one of those things he had absolutely enjoyed was being part of the intricate secret service radio system with its jargon monikers and code words this is wrangler im in my office over well be by with your patient in two minutes over and out during his first week on the job gabe hadnt said ten words to the man who was a heartbeat away from the presidency what gabe knew about him was pretty much what he had heard in the barbershop in tyler and on the car radio while headed into work cooper once the junior senator from montana was in his second term when drew selected him from half a dozen or so possibilities to be his running mate from what gabe remembered the selection was more political than ideological northwest joins southeast impoverished backwoods upbringing joins privilege and vast wealth laconic lincolnesque country music musician joins slick charismatic war hero moderate pragmatist joins intellectual visionary together drew and cooper overcame a doubledigit deficit to nip bradford dunleavy and vp charles christman at the wire now from all gabe could tell drew had kept his campaign promise to revitalize the office of vice president and to use it in such a way that every day and every mission better prepared cooper to step in and lead the country the two men met together regularly and cooper was encouraged to be active and visible especially in the areas of preservation and enhancement of natural resources conscientious improvement and updating of the countrys infrastructure and issues involving immigration and illegal aliens in some circles in fact cooper was viewed as more effectively conciliatory than drew who at times could have a hairtrigger temper one recent poll actually suggested that the vp who everyone assumed was a lock for the head of the ticket in four years might be as electable as his running mate even in this campaign tom cooper is a brutus dr singleton your patients here heather announced through the intercom before gabe could complete the thought have him come on in gabe said curious as to why a man with his own medical team would have specifically asked to be treated by him with a soft knock the vice president of the united states entered the office he was sixfootfour or so and carried an extra twenty or thirty pounds without looking all that out of shape he was wearing a black eye patch over his right eye and was carrying a thin black leather folio which he set down on the corner of the desk before he shook hands so doctor thank you for seeing me on such short notice his voice was low pitched and his speech measured totally presidential gabe decided your timing was perfect he replied in another hour or so ill be off for baltimore i know of course here in dc land everyone knows everything except for those of us who dont gabe flashed on something lemar stoddard had said over lunch in this town youre nobody if you know nobody but if the only person you do know happens to be the man youre still a major somebody yes thats right gabe confirmed with more flatness than he had intended baltimore president stoddard originally asked me to replace him but i have a speech scheduled myself cooper settled into the chair opposite gabe there was a softness to coopers face that seemed to engender trustespecially backed up by the steely manliness of the eye patch still whether it was lemar stoddards brutus warning or the as yet unexplained reason bear chose gabe over the medical people assigned to his care there was tension between the two of them well cooper said we havent had much chance to talk since you arrived here everything okay im still picking my way through the tulips and the buffalo chips but all in all things have been pretty uneventful a totally political response lattimore would be proud good to hear youre from wyoming right tyler thats southeast precisely eighty or so miles north and west of cheyenne ever come up north to montana from time to time the fish there always seemed a little bigger and a little more gullible than the ones around where i live gabe had never had much patience for hidden agendas cloaked in small talk and he felt certain he was confronting one now he also had his medical bag to check over for the trip so he pushed whats the deal with your eye ever since i woke up this morning ive felt as if theres something in itmaybe a lash or something how about we go in the examining room and ill take a look actually cooper said removing the patch to reveal none of the redness that would have quickly developed had a lash or any other foreign body made contact with the eye i think whatever was in there may have washed out theres been a lot of tearing i see gabe felt himself understanding more and more the concern expressed by lemar stoddard thomas cooper iii was not only oblique he was unsubtle and obliquehardly what gabe expected the truth is cooper went on the lash probably washed away pretty quickly but ive had trouble with corneal abrasions before and wanted to have things checked no problem and the vp went on as if gabe hadnt interjected the words i decided to seek you out because theres another matter i wanted to discuss with you two birds and all that at last the other shoe falls ive got to get some things ready for the trip to this wont take long doctor just that quickly any softness there seemed to be about the man vanished gabes internal alarm sounded a strident warning for all his country upbringing and easygoing disarming manner tom cooper was in fact a seasoned politician who had risen to the secondhighest office in the land not long after he turned fortysix it seemed probable that he never spokeobliquely or notwithout knowing precisely what he was saying there was no sense examining his eye even though at some point well past there may have actually been something in it go on gabe said president stoddard never made it to the state dinner the other night we had a press conference about that i know migraine headache and gastroenteritis complicated by his asthma if there was facetiousness in the mans tone gabe couldnt hear it mr vice president i had written permission from the president to speak about those aspects of his medical condition to the public i would never share any information about him otherwiseto anyone i understand and i completely support you in that regard tell me something though did you know that at least twice in the past dr ferendelli and the president withdrew from the public eye for an extended period of time thats not a question i can or will answer for a city of almost six hundred thousand washington is like a small town rumors start rumors spread rumors vanish rumors refuse to die some are total fabrication some have a grain of truth and some much more than that those of us who have been around here for a while have learned that when a rumor surfaces and then resurfaces there is often something to it mr vice president please call me tom itll save time tom i really have to get going soon dr singleton the hot rumor in town at the momentthe one that doesnt seem to want to go awayis that the president is having problems other than migraine headaches and gastroenteritis and asthma no one is speaking out about it at least not yet magnus lattimore and the rest of the presidents spin people have done a remarkable job of keeping the rumor under wraps but it keeps resurfacingand from more than one direction too which i have learned over the years is something worth paying attention to there are those who believe president stoddard may be mentally ill in some way for the moment the rumors are just whispers but i assure you doctor the whispers are getting louder gabe tried for a reaction of bewildered amusement but wasnt at all certain he succeeded as the presidents physician i will not discuss his health in any way he reiterated including to comment on whether he has or has not any mental or other medical problems im sure you expect that same sort of professionalism and respect from your doctor if youre that concerned about rumors you have heard perhaps you should speak with magnus or even with the president himself when i have translated rumor into fact i intend to do just that meanwhile dr singleton you need to know that i have supported drew without hesitation or reservation since the day he chose me to run with him after we won he could have buried me in the political backwater like so many presidents have done with their vice presidents but he chose to make me an important part of his administration he is my friend just as i am his and i would do anything to ensure that his legacy is that of one of the most effective significant leaders our country has ever had his policies and vision for america are mine and when i get my chance i intend to continue them okay then gabe said feeling ill at ease before coopers emotional outpouring of fidelity what can i do for you the vice president opened up the leather folio and slid a document across the desk gabe sensed without looking what it was there is a great deal at stake here doctor and you have a significant role in the drama that may be unfolding as the presidents frantic frightening episode was beginning to resolve lattimore had mentioned that locked within the football along with the electronics and codes necessary to unleash armageddon was an agreement signed by drew and thomas cooper iii outlining those situations in which there was to be a transfer of power from president to vice president according to the provisions of the twentyfifth amendment at that moment gabe had made a mental note to ask the chief of staff for a copy of the document over the ensuing chaotic hours and days he had simply forgotten to do so now on the desk before him was that agreement headed by the four impressively brief sections that made up the exceedingly complex twentyfifth amendmentthe statement believed by many to be the most comprehensive road map of political succession ever put to paper gabe had read the amendment at least half a dozen times during the hours he was caring for the president in his residence now he scanned the first of the two paragraphs composing section whenever the vice president and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as congress may by law provide transmit to the president pro tempore of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives their written declaration that the president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office the vice president shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as acting president following a glance at his watch meant more as a reminder to cooper than to himself gabe flipped through the pages listed in outline form more than described in detail were the scenarios in which the vice president head of the white house military office white house chief of staff chief legal counsel and physician to the president could act in concordance in deciding whether to proceed with the political process of replacing the president against the presidents wishes sixth on the list was mental illness gabe was careful to scan the entire document slowly and evenly so that it wouldnt seem to cooper as if he had spent any extra time on this one scenario though there was no specific delineation of qualifying diagnoses the agreement did state that the president should if possible be medically evaluated by his own physician and also by a qualified doctor of psychology or psychiatry the mandate of these caregivers was to determine whether or not the potuss condition was affecting his ability to do his job without impairment gabe set the pages aside and was about to ask what the vice president wanted from him when cooper saved him the effort i cant give you any specifics yet dr singleton but as i alluded to there are persistent rumors that the president may be mentally ill and if i have heard these rumors you can bet the opposition in the upcoming election has heard them as well there has been a significant slippage in our standing in the latest polls no one is blaming the rumors for the drop in our leadin fact the pattern was more or less expected for this time in the campaign but i dont believe drew and i are strong enough at this point to withstand every challenge to our lead again gabe checked his watch mr vtom i dont want to sound rude but i think youve got to get to the point cooper sighed the point is he said that our polls suggest that as things stand it is early enough in the campaign so that if drew were to drop out now for health reasons and i became the candidate with a carefully chosen running mate i would still be a slight but significant favorite over dunleavy and christman but the closer we get to the election in november and the more confusion there is in our camp the less time the american public has to get used to me and to appreciate the similarities between my political philosophy and drews in other words the later in the campaign we make a change in which democrat is running against brad dunleavy the less chance we have of coming out on top meaning meaning doctor that if there is something wrong with president stoddard the sooner he confronts it and does whats rightthe sooner you confront it and do whats rightthe better for the party and for the country chapter wrangler wrangler do you copy over treat griswolds gravelly voice resonated through gabes earpiece gabe clicked on the microphone clipped to his sleeve raised it to his lips and spoke in the purposeful tone he had learned to use during his first day of orientation to the white house griswold had given him a radio and a detailed inservice on its use rule number one griswold said was never turn the transmit switch on or leave it on by accident the humiliations resulting from an open mike had become the stuff of secret service lore rule number two was never to forget who the system was in place to protect this is wrangler over everyone maverick is on the move from the residence elevator to the west wing exit wrangler do you have your medical bag over right here the fat kit with all necessary resuscitation equipment and supplies will be on the van with the medical team over wrangler copies first aid and trauma kit on board roger that maverick has requested wrangler ride in stagecoach with him stand by your location and well get you loaded over no problem gabe said will moondance be accompanying us over gabe was still somewhat disconcerted over the odd exchange during which the first lady had intimated she might be just as happy if her husband dropped out of the race he would be more at ease at the moment if she werent with them as it was he had been looking forward to his first trip with the chief executive but the session with tom cooper had severely dampened his enthusiasm more and more he was feeling like a man sitting on a keg of dynamite while passersby kept flipping lit matches at him thats a negative an agent other than griswold said moondance will be staying here liberty too over roger that ill be waiting for you over gabe doublechecked that he had turned off his radio then glanced outside to where the motorcade had formed from his vantage point he could see two black limousines parked by the steps leading up to the north portico beyond them on pennsylvania avenue he could make out two of what he knew would be many vans communications counterassault press corps white house staffers medical unit photographers military aides secret service he remembered some of the groups lattimore had told him the fleet of vans would be carrying but not all attention all posts maverick moving toward west wing exit maverick moving over staccato footsteps echoed down the corridor toward gabe just before the first two of the presidents secret service men appeared one of them expertly cradling a submachine gun seconds later drew came into view surrounded by four more agents each one looking as if he took his job very seriously from the moment the entourage appeared gabes attention became fixed on his patientnot without reason though smiling and waving to those white house employees standing back against the wall drew stoddard looked strained and slightly gray gabe moved toward him but almost on cue a petite makeup artist materialized and with the skill of a master conjurer performed a remarkable thirtysecond makeover and just like that drew was the rosycheeked picture of health as he moved to gabe the secret service agents fell away to give them space and something approaching privacy hey cowboy drew said cheerily ready to join the donner party for a little wagon train ride dont even joke about that you okay you examined me this morning you tell me actually i thought you looked a little gray around the gills just now but your makeup girl fixed that problem right up amazing huh when she goes home and washes off her own makeup shes actually a threehundredpound samoan football player having seen her work thats not so surprising how about your breathing you seem to be going a little faster than i would expect ive had a little cough for about an hour or so but its almost gone now maybe im getting a cold not on my watch even you cant do much about a virus did admiral wright talk to you about the medical team not a word why i guess he went ahead and put the team together himself from now on if you want to select the team to accompany us for travel in the states or overseas you just go ahead and do it ill make sure ol ramrod doesnt get in your way mr president treat griswold called out i think wed best get a move on gabe on the ride up to baltimore ive got to go over the speech thats just been written for me i thought there might be time for us to gab during the trip but no such luck you can still ride in stagecoach with us or you can go in spare thats the other limo if you want attention all posts gabe heard griswold say from close by and also through his earpiece maverick moving to stagecoach departure imminent over okay doc mr president ready to roll as gabe stepped out into the bright sunlight he couldnt help but be awed by the clutch of photographers and reporters lining the short walk to the motorcade as well as by the motorcade itself which minus two limousines was parked along the recently renovated stretch of pennsylvania avenue closed to motorized traffic at all times except on occasions like this one a dozen or more huge vans waitednine and twelveseaters gabe guessedalong with eight dc motorcycle police on harleys with blue strobes flashing in baseball the glitter and crowds and private jets and plush clubhouses of the major leagues were often referred to collectively as the show at that moment those words were the only description gabe could think of the show the two identical black cadillac limousines were parked on the driveway that arced to the steps of the white house stagecoach is number one today griswold said hurrying his party of threegabe the president and a young lanky bespectacled speechwriter introduced by stoddard simply as martinto the lead limo as they reached the bottom of the staircase over the roof of the limo gabe caught sight of tim gerrity an air force physicians assistant whom he had gotten to know fairly well over the short time since his arrival at the white house and who seemed to know more medicine than most physicians but was unassuming enough not to show off gerrity was standing in front of what gabe assumed was the medical van today the medical support team had been selected by admiral ellis wright but from now on if gabe so wished the president had decreed he could pick his own team the notion led irrepressibly to thoughts of alison cromartie maybe somewhere down the line if she managed to stick around and if things ever got straightened out with her they could do one of these trips together at that moment as if on cue alison appeared beside gerrity talking amiably and gesturing to the van even at a distance wearing a conservative navy blue pants suit she stood out from the moment she pulled out her secret service id after apparently saving his life gabe had gotten used to feeling bewildered and unsettled around her now even at a distance he felt awkward despite ellis wrights rant at her that evening in the medical office the man apparently had enough regard for her to assign her to the show curious doc come on duck on in here griswold ordered standing by the open door to stagecoach the last sound gabe heard before he slid onto the seat across from martin was the president of the united states coughing softly the last thing he saw turning back toward the white house for one final look was vice president thomas cooper iii flanked by two secret service agents looking down at them intently from the portico chapter signal depart all posts we have a departure of maverick over treat griswold lowered the sleeve transmitter and turned next to him where gabe was sitting you doin okay doc aside from being a little afraid im going to stretch my legs and blow my foot off im fine he gestured to the submachine gun that was lying on the floor of the limousine i told them we should build a gun rack in the limos for these things griswold said or else make your shoulder holsters a lot bigger martin shapiro the young speechwriter glanced up from the passage on which he and the president had been working im always looking for crisp punchy lines doctor he said okay if i appropriate that one if not for this speech then for something down the road i want to see it when you do gabe said here drew said pointing to a spot in the manuscript why make him wait right here where im talking about our korean friend president jong and his goddamn obsession with nuclear reactors lets say something like having him persistently claiming that the massive towers on our surveillance photos are for sewage treatment and not nuclear production is a little like our maintaining that the threefootlong shoulder holsters we have just issued to the secret service have nothing to do with submachine guns shapiro grinned as he finished the thought give me a minute or two to get the wording and the timing right and i think we can use it there you go cowboy drew said just like that youre immortal just like that gabe said genuinely impressed in spite of his longstanding friendship with the president and the secrets he knew about drews mental imbalance and attacks of irrationality throughout the ride from the white house to the baltimore convention center gabe could not help but bask in the true greatness of the man maverick gabe knew the moniker had been chosen because drew had been a stellar pilot but now gabe found himself thinking about the original meaning of the wordthe meaning everyone from wyoming understood a range animal usually a calf or steer who had left the herd and would belong to the first person who could manage to capture and brand it over time the meaning had been expanded to include peoplespecifically a dissenter who refused to abide by the dictates of a group it was an awesome privilege to watch and listen as drew and his writer sculpted a speech that would be delivered to only two hundred or so wellheeled supporters but would be heard instantly around the world the main focus this day was foreign relations but over the course of the thirtyminute presentation drew would touch on a number of the accomplishments of his first term in office the progress that was being made in his vision for america program and several failures of the dunleavy administration which had preceded his he would even manage somewhere along the line to comment on the evolving miracle of the baltimore orioles and washington nationals local teams still leading their respective divisions in baseball and possibly headed to a milliontoone longshot world series matchup by the time the motorcade turned off route and headed into baltimore gabe felt more committed than ever to get to the bottom of drews bizarre breaks with reality and to keep him in office if at all possible a good deal of gabes resolve still depended on the findings and conclusions of kyle blackthorn but as things stood invoking the twentyfifth amendment and effectively elevating tom cooper from running mate to presidential candidate was not a move he was going to make it wasnt as if the vice president had made that terrible an impression on him although it did seem a bit naïve for a man of his stature to expect the presidents doctor to share any information about his patients medical condition it was more that cooper was just eager that was the most descriptive word gabe could think of at the moment eager drew stoddards dry cough quieted down for a time but then picked up again as they entered the outskirts of baltimore it was minimal and would not have been the least bit alarming had it been occurring in someone other than the president of the united states because of the makeup it was impossible for gabe to evaluate stoddards color but his respiratory rate was no more than slightly elevated at eighteen per minute and the beds beneath his fingernails looked reasonably pinka decent sign that he was getting enough oxygen into his circulation gabe felt comfortable speaking about the presidents asthma in front of griswold but not the speechwriter you okay gabe asked after a brief volley of hacking maybe a little wheezy but no big deal stoddard replied you have asthma martin asked ending whatever concern gabe had about making the disclosure lowgrade for years drew replied matteroffactly i have it too used to be bad when i was a kid but it seems to have gotten pretty much better as i get older now i dont think i have it anymore burnout of childhood asthma is quite common gabe offered not taking his eyes off his patient you feel able to go through with this speech mr president of course im really fine you brought an inhaler for me right actually i have several of themboth bronchodilators and cortisone theyre in the fat kit in the medical van griz stoddard asked do you have one of my inhalers with you right here as always the secret service agent patted over the inside breast pocket of his suit coat okay then if i feel like i need a puff of that stuff ill get it from you until the doc here unlocks the medicine case in the van and gets me whatever he has there that okay with you doc i um guess so gabe said reflecting on his conversations with the chief executives father and the vice president and wondering if he should find a way to warn drew to be a bit less cavalier with information regarding his medical status i would like to have a listen to your chest before we do anything but somehow this doesnt seem to be the place for that we have a screenedoff prep area backstage griswold said a place for the president to sit down get his makeup refreshed and get ready for his speech good gabe said thatll probably be fine mr president grab a water bottle from the fridge there and drink at least half of it you want to stay well hydrated got it doc ill get you and the president up to the screenedoff area as soon as we arrive meanwhile mr president if you need any of this alupent inhaler just ask roger that mr shapiro i think weve done as much as we can with this puppy youve done a great job as usual stanford right what was your major there creative writing before anyone could comment the limousine stopped in front of a side entrance to the baltimore convention center attention all posts griswold said to his sleeve maverick moving toward bcc entrance over okay sir doc were going in that door then up to the third floor stairs or elevator stairs will be fine stoddard said lets do the elevator gabe countered before he had even processed the significance of overruling the most powerful man on the planet there was a moment of absolute quiet were going to head directly for the elevator griswold announced through the radio scooping the submachine gun off the floor with his free hand over the limousine doors were opened simultaneously and the four occupants stepped out to be immediately engulfed by a buffer of secret service men griswold ever observant remained positioned next to the president sunlight glinting off the balding area of his pate and the perspiration on the fold of his thick neck gabe flashed briefly on an image of the man looking a bit like the mutant comic book hero the thing exploding through a massive cement and fieldstone wall to get at the source of danger to the president when they were inside gabe switched on his transmitter pleased again to be playing the radio game this is wrangler to medical team wrangler to medical team over were here wrangler alisons satiny voice replied unloading now well meet you on three over be sure you have the fat kit an iv stand and an ohtwo tank over roger that fat kit iv stand and oxygen everything okay over better to not need it and have it gabe said feeling the comfort and security of being a practicing doc once more see you on three over three breathe in now out cloistered behind a tenbytenfoot barrier of dark blue velvet drapes gabe conducted as thorough an exam of his patient as he could manage in the twelve minutes that had been allotted him he wasnt all that alarmed by what he was seeing and hearing but neither was he totally at ease the president was wheezingthe sine qua non symptom of asthma the sound in this case not audible without a stethoscope was caused by narrowing of the mans bronchial tubes the result of a combination of spasm in the muscular wall of the tubes and plugging of the tubes themselves with mucus so how do i sound stoddard asked the more important question is how do you feel not bad really something like this happens every other day i think its mold mold in the limos mold in the residence mold at camp david mold in my cabinet how did they let you fly jets with this i didnt really have it back then but as far as i know most properly treated medical conditions including asthma will still allow a pilot to get a licenseeven a commercial one im not sure of the military though you need a puff or two from your inhaler actually that stuff makes me feel a little speedy id prefer to avoid it if i can theres a couple of million in potential donations to the cause sitting out there thatll make me speedy enough as it is gabe considered his findings and the situation in that case knock em dead pal chapter it is time my friends it is time we joined together with a vision for this country and its people it is time the children of our poor and disenfranchised stop seeking out drugs as the only way to cope with the perceived hopelessness of their situations it is time they seek out their teachers and advisors and hopefully even their parents it is time they learn to use the computers that will be on every desk and work through their fears and concerns and curiosity and dreams in classes that are of a reasonable size it is time there were enough hospital and halfwayhouse beds for our mentally ill and addicted and there were governmentmandated insurance programs to pay for their treatment it is time there were jobs for everyone and anyone who wants one as well as incentives to keep individuals off of public assistance yes my friends it is time for the people of this country to come together with a vision gabe had never had much interest in politics or much faith in politicians and their promises now though he stood off to one side of the thirdfloor hall in the beautifully renovated baltimore convention center marveling at the skill intellect and charisma of the man who had once been his drinking and studying buddyat the time little more than just one of the guys at the academy in the limousine gabe had sat quietly as the president and his bright young speechwriter reviewed the lines of this speech quickly and analytically now he listened to the words againnotes he had seen written on a page now transformed by a virtuoso into a concertomesmerizing and very special i believe him alison cromartie had materialized at gabes elbow ive seen video of kennedy speaking gabe whispered still focused on the podium but well aware of the scent of her ill bet the feelings in the audience back then were the same as here were all set up the way you wanted she whispered good thanks it doesnt look like were going to be needed amen to that he and alison had exchanged a few words during the fifteen minutes before the president headed up to the podium but no sentiments gabe still couldnt or wouldnt get past the lies she had told him on the evening they first met her anxiousness to learn about the presidents health and especially the fact that she was on duty in the office around the time the tubes of the presidents blood disappeared during gabes time backstage with her there had been no mention of the visit to jim ferendellis place or her cryptic statement that things were not as gabe thought and this was clearly not the time or place for him to ask her about it i want to say a few words the president was saying about the middle east peace proposal of ours thats currently being considered by a brief volley of coughing cut the sentence short gabe instantly went on high alert stoddard drank from a glass of water then started speaking again more coughing gabe looked across to where treat griswold was standing and instantly they connected this may be trouble gabe whispered to alison go ahead back and make sure the fat kit is unlocked and the iv and oxygen are ready got it she said stoddard apologized muttered something about a little cold and began speaking again this time gabe could almost hear the wheezing wrangler wrangler are you on top of this griswolds urgent whisper asked im not going to let it get any worse before i pull the plug gabe replied he noticed that several of the attendees were watching him as he spoke into his sleeve and sensed an instant change in the mood of the room our envoy mr chudnofsky is in amman at this the president took a sip of water and glanced over at gabe without hesitating gabe crossed over to him mr president he whispered lets go backstage and sit down before we have a big problem excuse us please he said to the deathly silent audience all of a sudden stoddard whispered hoarsely as gabe led him away my chest just got real tight griswold motioned to the presidential aide to take over and helped gabe guide stoddard off the slightly elevated stage and back around to the chair behind the velvet drapes by the time the aide had begun to tell the attendees to hold their seats a cordon of secret service agents facing outward had formed a tenfoot circle from the edges of the curtains inside the circle alison had opened the fat kit and was readying equipment gabe had already started his evaluation with griswolds help the president removed his shirt ohtwo by mask gabe ordered setting his stethoscope in place six liters griz you have that alupent inhaler i do stoddards chief secret service agent passed the inhaler over to stoddard mr president go ahead and take a couple of puffs from this gabe said in fact make it three alison as soon as you have the oxygen in place please hook him up to the pulse oximeter tape it to the iv pole if you have to so that i can see the readings then get out the cortisone inhaler from the fat kit we have alupent right here so we wont need any more of that mr president youre doing fine its not too bad just take nice slow breaths nice and slow i i couldnt catch my breath for a moment there youre moving air fine now gabe said with steady reassurance probably just some mucus plugs in a couple of your bronchial tubes nothing to be worried about im good at this im glad all that prairie dust keeps people in wyoming wheezing all the time alison as soon as you can lets give him a couple of puffs of the cortisone then wheel over that iv well usea twenty intracath ill put it in so ill need a tourniquet betadine and some tape if we can get him hydrated and bronchodilated quickly this little attack should break in no time alison huh oh oh yes sorry heres the cortisone inhaler check the security seal to make sure its intact and heres the iv pole and iv same thing with the seal on that we have backups for everything if there are any questions ill get the intracath ready thank you gabe replied surprised by her brief but striking lapse in focus considering who their patient was it was hard to believe she would be even the least bit inattentive well he thought at the moment he was attentive enough for both of them he felt the familiar sensations of confronting a medical emergency his vision and hearing seemed much sharper than usual and he was processing information rapidlycorrelating at beyond computer speed what he knew about asthma and about drew stoddard although gabe was definitely keyed up he suspected his pulse might actually have slowed from his very first days in medical school this was the sort of situation he enjoyed the most it was what all those countless hours of study and training and practice were all about now if he could just keep the identity of his patient out of the equation there shouldnt be any problems to his right magnus lattimore had worked his way through the secret service agents and asked the big questions of gabe with his eyes mr president gabe went on speaking as much to the chief of staff as to the man himself what were going to do is to try and break this asthma attack right here right now that would mean no ambulance and no trip to the hospital although were completely ready for both you fix me up doc i dont want any hospital you know how they are im sure theyll keep me hanging around in the waiting room forever yeah youre probably right about that okay heres the deal are you comfortable in that chair otherwise we can have the paramedics bring us a stretcher from the ambulance im fine you always were tough he tightened a tourniquet around the presidents arm located a suitable vein at his wrist and after the obligatory just a little stick now slipped the catheter in easily that didnt even hurt stoddard said you are damn good told you i was you run the country i stick needles in people in my america everyones got to do something were getting this iv going to improve your hydration and loosen up some of the mucus thats causing you trouble as soon as im comfortable things have settled down ill pull it in addition were giving you bronchodilator and cortisone to widen your tubes and let more air in and to reduce any inflammation on a scale where ten is the worst asthma attack imaginable youre maybe a threepointfive i think my breathings already a little easier good gabe said confirming that air movement was certainly no worse thats a definite possibility alison lets go ahead and give him zeropointthree of epinephrine subcutaneously this time she was totally present epi zeropointthree check the security seal on the box and ill open it up and give it subq gabe verified as he had with the cortisone inhaler that the packaging was intact then he unwrapped it and passed it over to alison except for her brief episode of distraction she engendered confidence and was as much of a pleasure to work with as she was to be around gabe its not like you think what in the hell had she meant by that he wondered now five minutes passed gabe stayed focused constantly checking the presidents blood pressure pulse respiratory rate oxygen level and air movement lungs clearing respiratory rate down from to bp oxygen saturation up to from five more minutes half a liter of iv fluid in color good wheezing almost gone o saturation lattimore had returned to the audience gabe could hear him speaking through the microphone but couldnt make out the words whatever he said brought about a healthy round of applause moments later the chief of staff reappeared i just told them you were doing well he whispered to stoddard the vultures want to know if youre coming back no gabe snapped hes not im breathing much better the president said plus that shotwhat is it like adrenaline its exactly adrenaline well its really pumped me up i feel like im about to take off from the deck of a carrier mr president you need to just stay put you were this close to an ambulance ride to johns hopkins if i can pull it together and reappear think about what my press people can do with this the world will love it the world will think youre an absolute nut with no regard for his health and a total incompetent for a doctor listen gabe i cant help it if you happen to be really really good at what you do youve got an iv running all the better ill drag it out there with me just a minute or two for closure and a couple of photos no gabe were talking about a presidential electionmy last shot at really making a difference in this country and the world your doctors head will always opt for the conservative approachwell almost always but please try and look at the big picture youve broken the asthma attack for me you did it i can feel it look i dont even have to gasp for breath between sentences let me just go out there and say thank you and goodbye and show the people that im all right and ill be back in this chair before you know it exasperated but at the same time exhilarated gabe turned to lattimore how long have you been working for this guy he asked long enough to know what the outcome of this ones going to be stoddards chief of staff replied chapter it was a bad dream alison kept telling herself that as she and the paramedics packed up the fat kit and got ready to head for the medical van what she had witnessed the conclusions she was consideringthey had to be nothing more than a bad dream but she knew otherwise treat griswold the legendary treat griswold numberone secret service agent to the president of the united states had reached into his jacket pocket withdrawn an asthma inhaler allowed the president to administer the contents to himself and then put the inhaler back in his pocket it sounded innocent enough and probably looked like no big deal to anyone else who observed the incidentalthough there were few if any in a position to do so the problem was that drugs of any kind when destined for the president had to follow a strict immutable chain of custody the prescription was given by the white house doc or nurse to the administrator of the medical unit who then called it in to a specific highclearance pharmacist using any of half a dozen fictitious names the pharmacist knew the drug was destined for the white house but had no idea if it was for the potus another patient or even the medical clinic in the eisenhower building next door the pharmacist formulated the prescription and if necessary prepared multiple sealed containers which were picked up by a white house driver the driver signed for the drug and turned it over to the nurse in the white house medical office who signed for it and put it in a locked medicine cabinet the presidents physician then retrieved the drug and administered it himself in the case of an inhaler the president might be given one to keep in his residence bathroom other inhalers would be secured on air force one on marine one in his personal physicians bag and at camp david the president might use the inhaler on his own but otherwise its contents should be dispensed only by his physician or the doc covering for him the chain of custody would probably not stand up in a court of law but it was a chain nonetheless based in large measure on the assumption that none of those intimates handling any of the sealed packets would want to harm the president alison had learned the unwritten protocol from a physician who was both showing off and possibly flirting with her but after just a few days in washington it appeared that gabe singleton had yet to be brought up to speed on it admiral wright had been away when gabe arrived on the scene so it was possible that during gabes orientation whoever took wrights place had simply forgotten or neglected to cover the handling of meds perhaps the other medical office docs hadnt thought to mention it either it made sense then that having treat griswold produce an inhaler would have seemed quite natural to gabe who had yet to learn that no one except the presidents physician should be dispensing meds of any kind to the man perhaps she thought she should try to break through gabes fortress of mistrust and tell him although it probably would be better if one of the other docs did it come on alison gerrity the physicians assistant called out ive got the rest of this stuff we have to get down to the motorcade or were going to be left here searching for a cab so we can get home and start searching for jobs alison surveyed the area one final time at the base of the high velvet curtain was a plastic baggiethe one sealed and signed by all who had touched it that had originally contained a cortisone inhaler which was also sealed and signed per the chainofcustody protocol the final step the loop closer was that once the seals had been broken and the medication used on the potus regardless of what that medication was it was to be disposed of immediately and a new chain of custody implemented it was most likely no big deal that treat griswold had control of the presidents inhaler griswold had been a loyal even heroic guardian of presidents for two decades at least the best thing she could do was probably let the matter drop still dr jim ferendelli had vanished and she had been placed undercover in the white house medical unit specifically to keep her eyes and ears open and to report to the head of internal affairs anything out of the ordinaryanything at all the notion of blowing the whistle on anyone let alone griswold was chilling she thought about her horrific experience in the hospital in la she had been in the right thentotally in the right the incompetent surgeon had killed a patient and destroyed a good caring nurse the proof alison had of that was solid if not absolute at least that was what she believed before her life was methodically undermined and sent crashing down around her not this time even if her job was to observe and report there would be no whistleblowing on treat griswold without irrefutable undeniable proof that rules had knowingly and willfully been violated instead she would learn what she could about the man searching for a chink in his armor of competence and devotion to office or else affirming that he was beyond reproach and worthy of the honors bestowed upon him over the years alison this is it we go now or we dont bother she hurried to the elevator and rode down with the pa the career military men who served as white house valets were mess specialiststrained to observe the preparation of the potuss meals and personally serve whichever plate he wound up getting they watched every bit of food he was served and from time to time would taste the meal as well would any of them tolerate a secret service agent showing up in the kitchen carrying and then serving the presidents dinner no chance she had to proceed to look into this situation but to do so cautiously the likelihood was that the president himself had chosen to bend the rules for the sake of convenience and that griswold was simply complying with his commanders wishes when they arrived at the medical van in the motorcade the secret service agents were poised to take off alison glanced up ahead at the lead limo gabe would be settled in next to the guy who had once been his drinking buddy in school and now was the most influential potent person on earth she wondered whether the founding fathers had they known about nuclear weapons and drug abuse homelessness and health insurance space exploration and runaway science would still have chosen to cede such awesome responsibility to just a single individual from the presidents point of view the day had been an incredible success thanks to gabe singletons quickness clinical judgment and quiet competence his asthma attack had been aborted before it could evolve into a fullblown medical crisis once broken the bronchospasm and mucus production abated and within less than half an hour stoddard had tucked his shirt in leaving the collar and cuffs open taken hold of his iv pole and bravely wheeled it out to the podium he stood there bracing himself on the pole just a bit as boisterous applause filled the hall then he explained that his doctor had easily broken what he described as a mild asthma attack and would be removing the iv as soon as the last of the solution had run in stoddard then spoke ad lib for two minutes or somore than enough to gain closure with the donors exposure before the reporters and cameras and alison guessed smiling to herself control of at least percent of the nations asthmatic vote the move to return to his supporters was blatantly theatricalringling brothers all the way but given the potential danger of his asthma attack there was nothing bogus about it and judging from the prolonged enthusiastic response of the audience what could have been something of a body blow to his campaignincreased concern about his healthhad instead become a war cry signaling that he was fearlessly ready to move forward with his vision for america down the road it seemed as if andrew stoddard might point to this day as one in which the many facets of his run for reelection were triumphantly brought together still it seemed possiblejust possiblethat within the ranks of his supporters specifically in the person of his favorite most trusted secret service guard there was potential trouble chapter there was no one who passed the blind man making his way through the throngs at reagan national airport who did not take notice of him he was tall and broad shouldered with a long ebony ponytail protruding from beneath a white cowboy hat that featured an ornate band of turquoise medallions linked by handtooled silver he strode ahead with surprising confidence his thin white cane tapping away at the tiled floor like an insects antenna his face high cheekboned and powerful was the reddish brown of the clay that for centuries had been the bedrock of his people the arapaho as the man emerged from the security zone gabe quietly fell in stride beside him dr singleton i presume dr kyle blackthorn said after just a step or two though there had been no physical contact between them howd you guess it was no guess my friend i assure you of that and i really dont think you want to know which of my senses were at work no no i suppose i dont luggage right here one nights worth of clothes and my testing materials im due back to teach at wind river the day after tomorrow you still go out to the reservation every week just one of the tribulations of being a role model those kids are lucky to have you i am the lucky one just as are you for the work that you do when you dont have to well said thank you for dropping everything and coming so quickly i know how busy you are gabe smiled as one traveler after another turned to watch them pass he had wondered how easy it was going to be to sneak the sixfoot threeinch indian into the presidents residence at the white house now gabe found himself searching for another place the two men could meet for a three or fourhour evaluation as difficult as blackthorn was to hide the president of the united states was even more so their session was simply going to have to be in the white house residence you ready to go to work gabe asked the president blackthorn asked in a near whisper gabe nodded good guess he said not too difficult you were frontpage news in the local rag when you left everyone was talking about it before this they were proud of the things you have done with the children now they are absolutely in awe with no prompting from gabe blackthorn turned toward the stairway leading down to the parking area perhaps it was some telltale sound from the roadway below perhaps an increase in the foot traffic heading in that direction or maybe just a slight gust of breeze whatever senses he was reacting to the psychologist responded with certainty his cane confirming more than directing as far as gabe knew blackthorn had been blind since birth no one in tyler spoke about it very much it was as if no one really saw it as a disabilityat least not in him certainly it was a drawback to be overcome but rather as an inescapable fact of the mans lifesomething to work with rather than around almost like being lefthanded on the way into town from the airport gabe recounted in detail the bizarre and remarkable episode he had observed in drew stoddard before learning from his wife and chief of staff that it was at least the fourth one blackthorn his trademark hat resting on his lap dark glasses shielding whatever there was of his eyes listened quietly but gabe could tell he was processing every word in the courtroom the chief as he had inevitably come to be called away from the stenographers was a forensic expert witness to be reckoned with he was equally adept at exposing defendants attempting to hide behind a plea of insanity and championing with irrefutable logic the defenses claims of diminished capacity you have a sense of how these episodes began he asked when gabe had finished his detailed description i wasnt there but his chief of staff tells me it was quite sudden he reports a twitch or a tic at the corner of the presidents eyethe right one i thinkthen some disjointed wordsalad sentences then suddenly boom a fullblown manic craziness with hallucinations motor irritability and pressured speech by the time i arrived at his bedside he was really quite maddisoriented hyperkinetic sweating blood pressure and pulse headed off the charts then just as quickly it all began to resolve exactly over about twenty or thirty minutes the mania and hallucinations gave way to profound fatigue and soon exhausted sleep there was a prolonged silence eventually ended by the psychologist as they cruised over the george mason bridge and into the city we shall see what the testing blots and the blocks have to tell us he said but off what youve told me it sounds toxic some kind of drug reaction or something thats being secreted in his body like from a tumor i thought about that hes had a normal mri and a ct scan but they were just of his head a chemicalsecreting tumor could be anywhere so what have you chosen to do about all this do well the man does have a fair amount ofhow should i say itresponsibility hes been a hell of a president i agree so do most of the minorities in the country and over the next four years theres no telling how much he can accomplish provided he doesnt go off the deep end and push the shiny big red button i need to find out whats wrong with him kyle ill say you do you sure youre not the one who needs help gabe risked a glance over at the man but the chief was facing stoically ahead i wish i were back home gabe said blackthorn set a hand on gabes shoulder when its time youll come home he said meanwhile the president has the right doctor taking care of him of that i am certain with help from treat griswold gabe had surprisingly little trouble getting blackthorn into the white house and then to the medical clinic which had been closed since before the motorcade to baltimore then after ensuring that there were no reporters or other surprise visitors wandering about griswold stood guard as the two doctors crossed to the elevator and rode up to the presidents residence where the chief executive waited with his wife after brief introductions gabe took advantage of the situation to confirm that stoddards lungs were still clear and that he was in fact ready and able to undergo extensive psychological and neurological testing in case of any problem carol would remain close by in another room and gabe would be in the clinic neither the president nor the first lady showed any particular reaction to blackthorns appearance or his blindness although stoddard did ask the man if he was democrat or republican arapaho was the reply chapter back in his office gabe fished out lily sextons card and called her at lily pad stables the secretarydesignate answered on the first ring prompting gabe to wonder what the caller id read for calls originating in the white house this is lily gabe flashed on the woman elegant alluring and stately in her tuxedoclearly one of a kind despite the drawing in ferendellis desk and the notion that lily and the man were involved with one another the idea of spending some time with her especially on horseback held definite appeal lily its gabe gabe singleton well hi after the other night i was hoping i might hear from you everything all right with the president gabe focused on what he and lattimore had told the world after stoddard missed the state dinner it was no surprise really but the list of those anxious for information on drews health kept growing hes doing fine excellent after we spoke the other night then you rushed away on your mission of caring i decided you needed serious therapy so ive been anxiously waiting to tell you are you that perceptive half the people who know me think i could use a good shrink not a shrink doctor serious therapy hes my best trail horsean absolute hunk and here i thought you had brilliantly diagnosed me after just a few minutes together maybe i have well see what you need after you spend some time on st i hope youll agree this is some horse the presidents ridden him twice before he became the leader of the free world drew and i rode several times at my ranch in wyoming for a navy man he knows his way around a horse pretty well serious therapy sounds perfect for me name the day tomorrow if possible sometime in the late morning or early afternoon serious therapy tomorrow at say one youll love him i suspect i will some tea and maybe a little lunch first that would be perfect one other thing ms lily do you know very much about nanotechnology there was a hesitation before her replyjust a beat but definite at this point before answering im supposed to ask you why you want to know but instead ill just tell you that among certain circles i might be considered something of an expert on the subject thats terrific do you mind if we make our lunch and ride sort of a nanotechnology inservice ive done some reading but i want to know more ill do what i can do you want to tell me why the sudden interest sure its probably nothing but one of the other docs here told me that my predecessor jim ferendelli had a rather large medical library in his house in georgetown i thought i might borrow some of his basic medical textbooks to use in the white house medical office im sort of famous back home for looking things up in front of my patients i figure that if they know im not afraid to admit i dont know something they might lower their expectations a bit anyhow i mentioned the book thing to drew and he had a key to ferendellis place so i went there in addition to just the sort of books i need the doctor had a number of volumes dealing with nanotechnology i brought them home with me and just started reading fascinating fascinating stuff but educating myself has been a slowgoing process i thought maybe you could give me a bit more grounding ill be happy to try lily said its impressive that he should be interested in such an arcane subject did he ever mention that interest to you hardly in fact except for maybe one brief introduction ive never spoken to the man gabe felt himself go cold the drawing in ferendellis desk drawer quite well done with obvious caring was clearly of lily it seemed possible albeit remotely so that he could have done it from photographs but why how could the two of them not have known one another and quite well at that gabe struggled to remain calm and to come up in tempo with just the right words well he managed it sounds like you would have had something in common with him probably so in addition to industrial manufacturing and communications medicine is probably the most promising area of nanotechnologic research gabes mind was swirling through the possible reasons that lily would deny knowing ferendelli he felt desperate to get off the phone before he somehow gave his concern away so then he said tomorrow it will be nanotechnology and serious therapy and tea lily sexton said never forget the tea chapter late afternoon shadows stretched across the esplanade as treat griswold driving a twoyearold silver jeep grand cherokee maneuvered through light traffic half a dozen carlengths behind alison followed warily there was no reason for griswold to suspect he was being tailed but he was a pro and he had seen alison on several different occasions including just that morning in baltimore after her return by motorcade from the convention center alison had spoken to secret service director of internal affairs mark fuller who had originally sent her undercover into the white house medical office careful not to allude to griswold in any way she explained that while she was waiting for something anything to break regarding the ferendelli disappearance she had decided to do background checks on a number of white house employees including several agents fuller considered her request for access to personnel files and then somewhat reluctantly gave her the passwords she needed alison took pains to review the files of a dozen randomly chosen men and women the last thing she wanted anyone to know was that she had a particular interest in any one of themespecially the presidents numberone protector it was frightening to know that she was dealing with perhaps the most thorough effective efficient investigative agency in the country if she had been asked to keep an eye on the white house there was no reason not to suspect that someone had been given the task of keeping an eye on her mixing her subjects and keeping meticulous records as to how long she spent on the files of each she began to piece together the story of the man who had been decorated three times for his service to three different presidents but who also seemed to have surprisingly little life outside of his job griswold a state high school wrestling champion born and raised in kansas and educated in criminal justice at k state had turned fiftyone this past month he had been married and divorced twice before he was thirtytwothe first time after four years the second after just two no children no subsequent marriages he lived in what sounded like an apartment complex in dale city virginia thirty miles south of the capital there was really remarkably little else to be learned about the man he earned a better than decent salary approaching with senior executive service and saicspecial agent in charge of detailpay factored in but didnt seem to live up to his means he was right up to the minute in terms of using his fairly generous allotment of vacation time but as far as she could tell he had never taken a day of sick time never as part of her training alison had taken courses in single and team surveillance keep slightly to the right of the car ahead no sudden lane changes anticipate the moves of the quarry and be ready to react smoothly employing every rule she could remember she followed griswold across the potomac and onto i leading south into virginia on paper and indeed in real life treat griswold seemed almost too good to be true to this point in addition to his not being among the most physically attractive men in the world the only chink in his highly polished armor seemed to be the inhaler he carried in breach of regulations or at least in violation of tradition and unwritten protocol the likely explanation hardly a thrilling one was that the president had simply found it more convenient to do things that way rather than having to scout down the doctor on duty each time he felt wheezy while away from the medicine cabinet in the official residence griswold was driving in no particular hurry but now for the first time something curious had happened he had passed the exit to dale city and was continuing south on the interstate alison pulled her road map up and smoothed it open over the steering wheel there was no doubt about it griswold wasnt headed home five miles ten twenty alison fished two sticks of bubble gumflavored trident from her purse and began working them over with vigor she had been a serious gum chewer since grammar school having made her way from fleers dubble bubble through juicy fruit to wrigleys spearmint and finally to trident sugarfree with an occasional jawbreaker thrown in it wasnt the most attractive habit in the world she knew but she was hooked over the years she had come to chew mostly when she was tense and like a ventriloquist of sorts she had mastered the art of chewing when she had to without visibly moving her jaws they were entering fredericksburg when griswold eased off the highway alison slowed and managed to keep a car between them but the situation was getting dicey still there was no hint from ahead that she had been spotted she risked dropping back half a block according to her map the city was located on the rappahannock river fifty or so miles south of washington and the same distance north of richmond if her memory was right and richmond the capital of the state had also been the capital of the confederacy then fredericksburg must have been in a hell of a tense spot during the civil war they crossed the river and entered a tangle of streets with rows of minimally maintained buildings alison was a block away when griswold suddenly pulled into a short drive in front of a twobay cinderblock garage with separate pairs of doors she ducked down and peered over the dash as he surveyed the street finally apparently convinced that it was safe griswold pulled open the doors of the nearer bay and quickly drove inside the street totally deserted at the moment had a few duplexes and triplexes but hardly seemed like the sort of place where people paid much attention to their neighbors business five minutes passed alison was about to drive past to determine where the man might have gone when he emerged having changed his black suit for a sporty dark windbreaker and tan slacks and his business shoes for a stylish pair of loaferseuropean she guessed his bulk actually seemed somewhat transformed although there was little he could do about his thick stubby neck and bald spot he locked the doors behind him and again warily scanned the street hunched low behind the wheel alison breathed deeply and exhaled slowly trying to calm herself at that moment again apparently satisfied that he was unobserved griswold unlocked the second set of doors hinges badly in need of oiling screeched as he swung the doors open and disappeared again into the garage after a few seconds the subdued thrum of an engine cut through the still air alison slid down even farther until she could just see up ahead from beneath the top of the steering wheel the engine noise continueda low even powerful growl finally the agent rolled backward out of the garage at the wheel of a pristine silver porsche cabriolet convertibleeighty or ninety thousand at least alison guessed clearly anxious to get away as quickly as possible his pate reflecting the sun griswold closed and locked the garage doors swung out of the drive and sped back down the street in the direction they had come passing just a few feet from where alison was huddled under the wheel by the time she dared to sit up and turn her camry around the porsche was gone pessimistic about her chances of reconnecting she guessed that griswold must have headed toward the interstate doing eighty she weaved through traffic back across the rappahannock at the last possible instant she caught sight of the porschea bullet streaking onto i headed south away from dc and toward richmond it took a while to catch up but she strongly sensed she had done it without being spotted by the time they reached the outskirts of the capital of the confederacy she had written down the license number the car the clothes even his swaggerit was as if treat griswold had driven into the rickety garage in fredericksburg and emerged a different man now that man was easing off the interstate into the lowrent district of richmond comfortable with the pattern of his driving and his lack of attention to the road behind him alison pulled over nearly a block away from where the porsche had stopped they were on a street of aging gabled houses that had probably been very special during the civil war but were now all in need of scraping paint and carpentryall that is but one griswold turned right into the driveway of that housean immaculately restored victorian painted gray with maroon trim and white mullions on what had to be at least two dozen windows it was at once massive and elegant perhaps halfagain larger than the other homes on beechtree road the rooflines of its two streetside spires were gracefully curved and the lower two of three stories featured broad circular porches the curtains on most of the windows were drawn although like the street in fredericksburg beechtree seemed like one where the residents kept to their own business by the time alison risked cruising slowly past the drive griswold was gone and the was locked in the garage out of nothing something an asthma inhaler had led her a hundred miles from the white house to to what a brothel of some sort her instincts said no but her instincts had led her astray more than once over the years she noted down the address of the house next to the license plate number of the porsche there was no way to check on the owner of either without giving away information alison needed to keep to herself she would just have to wait until she got back to dc the day might come when she would need to blow the whistle on treat griswold for something illegal but when and if she did her case would be a hell of a lot better documented than the one at the hospital in los angeles had been and she would be a hell of a lot more prepared for the counterattack that was sure to follow now she would just have to settle in be patient and wait for something to happen with the late afternoon sluggishly giving way to dusk she parked down the street replaced her trident with two fresh sticks and settled in three hours she decided sliding in a best of sting cd and seeking out fields of gold if nothing happened after three more hours she would head back to the city and resume her onewoman stakeout another day not surprisingly as the time passed she found herself thinking more and more about gabe singleton there was a sweetness and vulnerability beneath his rugged cowboy exterior that had drawn her in immediately the men in her past had been well slick she acknowledgedsmart selfassured ambitious and almost to a man not totally forthcoming gabe had lost his faith in her honesty the first night they had met when he caught her in the lie she was forced to tell by being undercover still there was no way she could have let him be killed to preserve her status as an undercover agent and no way she could explain her actions that early morning other than with the truth he was even wondering if the whole assassin thing was a setup to gain his confidence and lead him to share some presidential medical secrets those suspicions were totally off base but confronting him and denying his concerns would only strengthen them she also had chosen not to share the rumors she had heard that the president was not mentally well they were grossly unsubstantiatedquestions from medical unit personnel whispered in dim late night tavernshardly the sort of thing she would expect gabe to share with her where her attraction to the man might lead if anyplace was a total mystery at this point what she did know was that there was something special she felt when she was around himan almost littlegirl musing of what it might be like to curl up with him on a chilly winter night but she also wondered why a man as bright handsome and caring wasnt married or a father what secret are you hiding gabe singleton she asked herself now why do you seem so vulnerable an hour passed inside the house lights appeared behind a few of the windows that werent covered by drapes the two functioning streetlights remaining on beechtree road neither of them near where she was parked winked on then just as alison was considering limiting her time there from three hours to two the front porch light came on the front door opened and two people emerged alison brought her field glasses up and focused on their faces one was a statuesque woman with a face about the color of her own latino alison guessed the other was youngermuch younger possibly ten or eleven at the oldest like the older woman she was mocha skinned and dark eyed and also like her she was pretty no not pretty alison suddenly realized stunning with perfect gentle features an incredibly sensual mouth a lithe bodystill more girllike than woman but with breasts that were already well beyond nubs such things were almost always a matter of personal taste she acknowledged but the girl was as beautiful as any young woman alison had ever seen what was treat griswold doing with such an attractive woman and a spectacularly beautiful girl it seemed as if the only ones who could supply the answer to that question were the woman and girl themselves the pair arminarm descended the stairs and began to walk leisurely in the direction away from where alison was parked alison waited sorting out her options then she set the binoculars down turned off the cd and followed chapter another liar an hour had passed following gabes conversation with lily sextona conversation in which she denied knowing a man who possessed a beautifully and accurately rendered charcoal drawing of her in the drawer of his desk the questions came far faster than their answers was it possible the drawing wasnt of her if it was could it have been done from a photographperhaps one in a magazine given her style poise unusual beauty and acknowledged intellect it seemed that if jim ferendelli was obsessed with her from afar he wouldnt have been the first could she simply have been frightened about being connected to any scandal when she was so close to being the subject of a major confirmation hearing in congress that possibility made more than a little sense was it worth confronting her with the drawing and asking for some sort of explanation and finally would it be possible to trust anything that she said questions without answers gabe massaged the sudden throbbing in his temples pulled out the vial of painkillers in his desk drawer then just as quickly put them back again his headache was real enough but the solution lay in getting at the causesdiagnosing the president finding jim ferendelli and getting the hell back to wyoming where most of the time at least hidden agendas werent a way of life maybe the headache would help gabe stay sharp it was a reasonable guess the codeine wouldnt a floor above in the presidential residence his friend kyle blackthorn was administering the neuropsychological tests that would go far in determining whether or not the man entrusted with the safety of every being on the planet was fit to continue in that role blackthorn was a person of great character passion and intellect he had never as far as gabe knew come to a forensic decision regarding a patient or defendant that had proven to be inaccurate vice president cooper magnus lattimore admiral wright lemar stoddard lily sexton and of course alisonwere any of them someone gabe could truly rely upon probably not certainly not in the way he could rely upon the chief gabe sat at his desk biding time by shuffling papers wondering if it was worth contacting alison to arrange a repeat trip to ferendellis brownstone no he decided not with her anyway she was far too eager to learn about the presidents healthat least that was the way it appeared to him it would be terrific absolutely wonderful if he was wrong about her she had never been far from his thoughts since the drive back to her place from ferendellis during the presidents asthma attack she had functioned with quickness medical knowledge and except for a brief moment when she seemed oddly distracted composure cinnie had the same qualities alison seemed to be telling the truth about her role as an undercover agent for the secret service but she might have been forced to improvise after her quick thinking saved his lifeor at least seemed to have saved his life if the shooting wasnt something she had orchestrated she needed an immediate explanation for why she had been following him from the white house in the early morning hours if it werent true the undercover assignment story was brilliant but brilliant improvisation or not it would still have been a lie then there was the matter of the missing tubes of blood how would alison explain that could anyone but she possibly have been responsible another hour passed gabes brain felt as if it were being squeezed in a vise his headachetension he felt certainfailed to respond to some tylenol but still the codeine remained in the drawer i never took a drug that i didnt have a pain for he had once heard a recovering addict say at an aa meeting i never took a drug that i didnt have a pain for it had been a long long while since he last went to a recovery meeting gabe thought now a couple of years at least maybe it was time he started going again the aa program taught not only how to stay away from a drink or a drug for a day but also how to do the right thing when it came to making difficult decisions maybe it was time why in the hell had he stopped going in the first place grateful that he had closed the medical office for the day and diverted all traffic except the president to the eisenhower building clinic gabe returned some routine phone calls then leaned back in his chair and dozed offone of the perks of having such a truncated practice the ringing telephone intruded on a hazy scene in which he and alison were riding across the desert together bareback on what looked to be condor her arms were locked around gabes waist and her cheek was pressed against his back blearily he checked his watch blackthorn had been with the president for four and a half hours dr singleton he answered the words reminding himself of that fact yes sir doctor agent blaisdell here im upstairs in the residence your man has finished with the president sir were checking to see if the coast is clear then well bring your man down everything all right as far as i know sir agent griswold signed out a few hours ago and just asked us to contact you in the office when the president was done with his visitor well then bring him down but be very careful he isnt spotted by anyone gabe hurried to the small bathroom and splashed cold water on his face from the moment magnus lattimore had led him into the presidents bedroom from the moment he had seen his onetime roommate thrashing about sweating profusely and babbling incoherently gabe had felt isolatedalone with his sensibilities and his emotions alone with what seemed right and what felt right alone with the awesome pressure of the twentyfifth amendment now he would at least have an ally he could rely on in the struggle to sort things outa friend with no hidden agenda and nothing at stake except getting to the right diagnosis gabe had just toweled off when without a knock the outer door to the medical office opened and closed hat in hand looking none the worse for his lengthy ordeal kyle blackthorn stood alone in the center of the waiting room he set his valise of testing supplies on the floor by his feet it looked to gabe as if blackthorn were quietly invoking the senses available to him hypertrophied from overuse like the muscles of a weight lifter to get the lay of his situation after just a few seconds he turned directly toward the small bathroom so doctor he said you were napping in my absence gabe stepped into the waiting room actually i what i was doing was okay yes actually yes i was but how did if you hadnt been napping you would have been out here to welcome me back not in there toweling off your face well at least you didnt begin your explanation with elementary my dear singleton i thought about it ready to talk almost five hours that must have been quite a session for an incredibly impatient kinetic man your friend mr stoddard displayed remarkable restraint and a deep desire to get to the bottom of things im not surprised your office the best place gabe flashed on alison working undercover for the secret service was it possible she had somehow managed to bug the medical office it seemed highly unlikely but his trust in anything or anyone had been pulled perilously thin you hungry i can always eat and i could use some fresh air lets go have an early dinner at the old ebbitt grill magnus lattimore the chief of staff here took me there the foods excellent and at its quietest the place is noisy enough so that the only person anyone can hear is the one sitting directly across the table or right beside them i am aware that you are in a hurry to come to an understanding on this matter blackthorn said but i assume you know that my final conclusions will have to wait until i have gone over all the test results and my notes and correlated them notes i have written nothing down but i have used an electronic braille typewriter just hold on to it tightly the moment someone tries to get into my notes without using the right password the machine erases its contents so you want to review your notes and correlate them with the test results makes sense but you have formed some preliminary opinion i have and youll share that with me i will the two men left the white house through the east wing and headed up fifteenth street through fading afternoon sun so gabe said thanks again for doing this i know how busy you are and how much you dont like leaving homeespecially for government work ive never been one to hold a grudge blackthorn said whenever im troubled about the genocide of my people i just think about all those big shiny casinos and how reassuring it is to have organized crime on hand to help take care of us gabe sympathetically patted him on the back he had heard the man eloquently decry the subject of indian genocide in any number of speeches and forums over the years so gabe said over and above the testing what did you think of my patient what do you want me to say gabe i dont know i guess i want you to tell me that as a psychiatrist and a psychologist you found him to be a man of magnificent character who has the potential for true greatness as a leader this time it was blackthorn who patted gabe on the back my dear friend he said to make that pronouncement i would have to be with the person in question for a good deal longer than the few hours i spent with your mr stoddard this afternoon besides if nothing else this is a time for objectivity objectivity gabe echoed as they entered the old ebbitt grill the restaurant refurbished from a midnineteenthcentury saloon still featured darkstained wood marbletopped bars set in brass and a beaux arts facade according to framed pictures and documents on the walls the place had been a favorite of presidents grant cleveland harding and teddy roosevelt gabe wondered how many times issues affecting the future of a presidency and the country had been discussed at its tables certainly few would guess that the tall blind man and his windworn companion were about to become part of that particular history the old ebbitt was neither as crowded nor as noisy as it would probably be in another hour but the young and beautiful movers and shakers of the capital along with the young and beautiful moverandshaker wannabes were already two to three deep along the length of the bar i dont think we have a place quite like this back in tyler gabe said as they were waiting to be shown to a booth blackthorn inhaled deeply through his nose smells like success he said he folded his cane took a seat opposite gabe and asked only for water later after they had talked about almost everyone of interest in tyler and ordered fish gabe could wait no longer so let us not use names at all blackthorn suggested agreed first of all on the surface at least the man really seemed to be trying he certainly had important things to do but he never made me feel as if i were an intrusion on his busy day he was never curt or condescending and as i said before he sincerely seems to want to get to the bottom of what is going on in addition to the actual testing i took an extensive history from him stressing what he remembered from each of the episodes and also an exhaustive history from his wife stressing exactly what she had witnessed allowing for the fact that the husband remembers little of the details their descriptions of each of the events were similar but there were differences in what they described from one event to the next explain i really cant gabe at least not until i put all the test results together but these episodes arent behaving with the consistency of like a seizure with a specific focus in the brain or a tumor gabe glanced around to ensure there was no one he knew or who seemed to be paying undue attention to them the place was filling up but none of the faces were familiar so at this point whats your guess blackthorn leaned forward toxicity he said in a gravelly whisper drugs some kind yes but dont ask gabe because i dont have the answers right now though thats the only thing that makes any sense to me the man is taking something thats causing this or someone is finding a way to get something into his body gabe sighed and exhaled slowly the implications of what the psychologist was suggesting were staggering i dont even begin to know what to do with that those blood samples you drew would be a good place to start i would find the best forensic chemist you can find and have the specimens tested for anything thats not normally found in the human bodyanything and everything gabe felt sick about having allowed the samples to vanish he should have had the presence of mind to take them back to his apartment will do he said wondering if there was anything to be gained by drawing blood from drew in between the attacks certainly a negative report would prove nothing theres more blackthorn said smoothing a few errant wisps of long gray and black hairs from his forehead go on i dont quite know how to say this gabe so im going to start by telling you that you can accept what im going to share or reject it and other than to say that i believe my lack of eyesight since birth has everything to do with what im going to tell you i have no real explanation but i have had enough experience with my unusual ability to believe with certainty that it exists unusual ability the psychologist hesitated perhaps to emphasize that what he was about to disclose was personal and private most but not all the time he said finally i can tell with some consistency when someone is lying call it a sixth sense if you wish although in my case it would be the fifth but i get a strange almost indescribable feeling deep in my thoughts when a person isnt telling the truth or even when they are withholding information and telling a halftruth theres a word that i believe is from zenshingan it means minds eye and refers to the ability to sense a persons thoughts or feelings i believe that i am in touch with my shingan over the years gabe had encountered enough examples of the power of the mindbody connection not to be surprised by anything in that regard but that was the mindbody connection within a person the notion that there were individuals who could read the auras or minds of others still had not taken root for him now a man he respected to the point of reverence was claiming to be something of a living polygrapha psychic of sorts shingan what does this ability have to do with the person in question here gabe managed finally well blackthorn said i am not sure i can completely answer your question but i can tell you that the subject is lying about something or withholding information lying about what i dont know but whatever it is is powerful i felt it almost every time he spoke regardless of the subject there is more to your man than we know or he lets on perhaps much more but it may be that in decoding and interpreting the tests i administered something will become clearer for the moment what i have told you is all there is and you feel pretty strongly about this shingan this ability of yours kyle blackthorn lifted his head so that he was facing gabe directly the lights behind gabe reflected eerily off blackthorns dark glasses i feel as strongly about my ability he said as i do about the fact that you have chosen not to tell me that the blood samples you drew on our patient have disappeared chapter the attractive woman and her striking young companion wandered down beechtree road in no particular hurry speaking nonstop and animatedly often punctuating their conversation with laughter alison had grown up around both spanish and creole french and was competent if not fluent in both from a distance unable to hear distinctly even through the open car window she sensed that they were speaking spanish at the fourth or fifth cross street foster the pair turned right alison cruised past them for two blocks checking their progress through the rearview mirror then turned onto a side street drove half a block down and waited if she had blundered by assuming the pair were going to stay on foster she would have to decide whether it was worth driving around to find them again perhaps she should call off the stakeout for the time being determine the owner of the porsche and of the elegant victorian home on beechtree and try again another time two tense minutes later the women crossed the side street where alison was parked and continued down foster she left her notes and field glasses on the floor of her camry and headed after them foster was a busy commercial street though still with a smallneighborhood feel the facades of the bistros specialty stores and other merchants had been refurbished for a number of blocks giving the area a surprisingly quaint charm walking briskly alison followed the pair from across the street until they turned into a place for nails a small salon one door from the corner of foster and coulter half an hour for the manicure and polish alison figured followed by fifteen or twenty minutes in the drying chair or whatever they used fifty minutesan eternity for someone like her cursed with the patience of a gnat it was doubtful the two would go anyplace that would shed light on who they were and how they were connected to the presidents numberone protector the only option seemed to be to speak to them directly walkins welcome a sign in the window encouraged alison examined her nails which she kept in decent shape for work but did not feel comfortable covering with any color as she approached the girl at the countersoutheast asian as were all the manicurists in the salon alison had gone to shortly after her arrival in dcshe realized that she had caught a huge break there were four manicurists in a place for nails two were starting work on the woman and the girl and one was chattering in badly broken english with a bluehaired woman in her eighties the fourth was at the counter welcoming alison with a cheery smile you have time for me alison asked holding out her nails oh bad very bad the woman said her speech nearly identical to that of the girls at the salon in dc what you do wash dishes build houses from her spot in the first chair the girl from beechtree road peered up to check out the newcomer clearly hispanic she was even more stunning than alison had appreciated through the binoculars it was difficult to tell if she wore any makeup but there was certainly no need her light mocha face was smooth and stress free with dark doelike eyes long lashes and full sensual lips beneath her ochre tank top her breasts were already diverting though not alison guessed nearly as exciting to men as they would be in another year or so the girls older companion was seated with her back to the counter and so missed the brief connection that was taking place her charge if in fact that was their relation smiled somewhat demurely then lowered her wonderful eyes and turned her attention back to the manicure actually alison said to the manicurist still totally uncertain as to what was going to follow the word i run a day care children alison could tell by the womans expression that she was not the least bit interested choose color the woman said motioning to a rack of perhaps eighty small bottles choose then come alison noted that the chair in which she would be done was cattycorner from the older of griswolds females funny she mused that she should think of them that way even though she had absolutely no clue as to how they and the legendary agent were connected she hurried over to the rack and quickly selected marooned on a desert isle she had only a limited time to insert herself into the lives of the two women and if she made a poor choice in colors there was always the salon back in dc soak soak here the waiflike but clearly controlling manicurist ordered what you do to nails she mumbled to herself shaking her head in utter dismay what you do alison risked a glance over at the woman across from her she had probably been too lost in the girl to notice but this woman probably in her early twenties was by anyones standards nearly as striking thin and open in her manner and expression she was a bit darker skinned than the girl the womans eyes were wide and innocent and her high cheekbones and sensuous mouth were the stuff of cover girls okay alison thought to herself be careful but not too careful its showtime what color did you choose she ventured as the icebreaker the woman was clearly used to people starting conversations with her and didnt seem to mind i always use red anything good lately her english was excellent with just enough of a latino edge to make clear that spanish had once been her primary language alison checked the bottle great name great color i work with kids so im happy when my nails make it for a week nails bad the manicurist muttered very bad you run a daycare center i heard when you were at the counter is it near here no actually its outside of fredericksburg i came down to meet some friends for dinner but im early actually alison decided that as often as not the word introduced a lieat least in her world it seemed to actually im an astronaut yeah thats it an astronaut lying had never been pleasant for her and in fact she had never been very good at it but in preparing to go undercover she had been trained in the art and had proven to be quite educable she wondered if when this assignment was done she would be able to undergo some sort of debriefing to reconnect with the honesty she had packed away oh i love children the woman said i look forward to having some myself one day im sure you will my names suzanne error alison realized fredericksburg child care suzanne she had already offered way too much information as facile as she had become at bending and even mauling the truth she had lost sight of the fact that if the woman reported on their adventure at a place for nails griswold had all the resources he needed to assure himself that in all probability no such combination existed having established that fact he might be much more alert than he otherwise had reason to be if nothing else from now on he would be paying much more attention to his rearview mirror and i am constanza connie pleased to meet you connie you two are together she nodded toward the girl yes is she your sister the smallest cloud passed over the womans upbeat expression then vanished no she said benignly beatriz is just a friend i am her she paused searching for the right word tutor she hadnt prefaced her explanation with the word actually but she might as well have alison decided to push things just a bit hello beatriz she said to the girl im suzanne the remarkable beauty smiled over at her hello pleased to meet you she said her english densely accented then she lowered her eyes again to focus on her nails her response was packaged as if she had learned it from a tape or from her tutor hello hello pleased to meet you goodness but she is very beautiful alison commented i know connie said her english is improving but she is still embarrassed by it yours is nearly perfect are you both from the same place keep digging alison exhorted herself keep searching for some sort of opening you can begin to probe yes mexico connie said but not the same city oh i should have been able to tell i spent years as a child living with my grandmother in chihuahua beatriz dónde vas a clase where do you go to school the girl looked up nonplussed she is tutored at home connie said quickly and somewhat uncomfortably the bluehaired lady had repaired to the small drying area and the pair were nearing the end of their manicures they might choose to sit in the drying area as well or they might simply leave they didnt seem like the type who would risk smudging but alison worried that her question about school may have made the tutor willing to take the risk she could back off and hope to learn more another time through surveillance or she could push on and risk further alerting the woman or worse having her inadvertently alert griswold as things were alisons manicurist was in overdrive and she had nearly caught up with the others a young mother wheeled her sleeping infant into the salon and entered into an animated discussion with the available manicurist alison decided to risk a little more probing vives con familia she asked hoping that beatriz might perk up and join the conversation do you live with relatives no well yes the woman replied in terse english an uncle beatriz stood up at that moment extending her glistening wet nails in front of her and turning toward the dryers she was surprisingly tall alison realizedand unselfconsciously regal in her bearing her lithe body highlighted by her designer jeans and tank top was absolutely arresting a surpassingly lovely pubescent mexican girl a beautiful young tutor no relatives in richmond except a probably bogus uncle residence in a magnificent old home that almost certainly belonged to some secret incarnation of treat griswold alison felt queasy as her mind spun through the possibilities more information she thought try for more what does her uncle do here in richmond she asked in english beatriz just a few minutes of drying then we leave connie said in spanish gingerly carrying her cell phone to the seat next to the girl he is a salesman she said over her shoulder to alison there nails were ugly now perfect the bellicose manicurist announced now go dry the drying stations were three opposite three alison took one across from beatriz and connie trying to frame a question that would further elucidate griswolds relationship to the two of them while also gauging when she could ask it without seeming too curious i just broke up with my boyfriend she tried in english he turned out to be a real jerkyou know all he cared about was himself your uncle wouldnt by any chance be single would he beatriz clearly understood because she looked down and was unable to fully stifle an impish grin he is single connie said but he works very hard and has no time for any women except for his niece again the sly smile from beatriz alisons queasiness intensified something was going on between griswold and the girl the deepest parts of alisons intuition were telling her so ah well alison said a man wrapped up in his work is not exactly what i had in mind i want one who will be all wrapped up in me it was time to stop she had been luckier than she could have ever anticipated being now she could drive back to dc and ponder the big question was there any possible connection between what she had learned about the man today and his misuse of the presidents inhaler the ring of connies cell phone la vida loca burst in on alisons thoughts expertly careful of her nails connie answered it speaking in a polite half whisper that it was still impossible for alison not to hear yes we are doing fine shes perfect very happy she chose scarlet ohara your favorite yes she misses you well well be home soon it is still early if you wish to go for a ride in the country with her that would be fine you know how she loves riding with the top down again a restrained smile from beatriz dígale que venga a buscarme the girl said softly tell him to pick me up chapter shingan blackthorn was registering at the front desk of the airport hotel when he first became aware of the man standing not far away to his right it was his heartbeat that first caught blackthorns attentionless than forty a minute with startling power in every contraction the man was standing virtually motionless taking eight or ten deep even breaths each minute power blackthorn thought power and danger blackthorn picked up his overnight bag and briefcase and headed toward the elevator the man followed but stopped as blackthorn knelt and fumbled with the latch on his briefcase until an overweight man and his equally overweight wife moved past him both breathing heavily from just the simple act of moving howre you doing the large man muttered to the dangerous one who grunted irritably in reply the four of them entered the car with the man taking a position far enough to blackthorns right not to make contact he was fivefootten and wore no cologne or other scent blackthorns minds eye conjured an image of dark hair and dark eyes that were constantly focused on him on the third floor the doors glided open to let the large couple out blackthorn waited until the last instant and followed even though his room was a floor above the doors closed completely and didnt reopen eschewing his cane blackthorn followed the couple to where their room was and then passed them and found the staircase at the end of the hall perhaps he had misread the man and the situation he was thinking his instincts werent always perfect trying to envision where his room might be located he entered the corridor of the fourth floor and felt the numbers on the first two rooms he took his electronic key from his pocket and crossed the hall one more the mans voice said quietly and calmly in a pronounced southern drawl fournineteen thats what the registration girl said fournineteen move naturally or youre dead you know ill do that dont you i do the soul of the man was as cold as death blackthorn felt the muzzle of a gun press into his side he felt stunned that he hadnt detected the man in some way when he opened the stairway door it was as if he were made of ice slip the key in the lock open the door and go on in quickly now the mans smooth speech belied his power blackthorn sensed that unless he took action he was not going to live through this encounter he set his briefcase down widened his stance and began nervously attempting to insert the key in its slot the man was a professional he felt certain of that not a professional thiefa professional killer please please blackthorn whimpered as he positioned the key i dont have much money but you can just take what i have and and my watch take my watch the door open it blackthorn knew that in the cluttered hotel room he would be totally at the gunmans mercy whatever he did had to be now right here in the corridor he had taken years of martial artskarate for a time then aikido the way of spiritual harmony he had the skill to reverse the situation against most men but this one this man of ice was different the only advantage he felt certain of was that the man with the slow measured speech couldnt know blackthorn had no intention of allowing them both to enter the room before he engaged the key the psychologist stiffened his body then as he felt the muzzle of the gun move slightly away from his side he spun swinging his overnight bag in a sharp vicious arc against where he knew the gunmans hand and wrist had to be the gun clattered against the wall and blackthorn sensed the man diving for it in one movement blackthorn jammed the key down into the lock opened the door and pulled it closed behind him two bullets snapped through the wood next to the door handle but the bolt held hey whats going on a mans voice called out from down the hallway barbara the guys got a fucking gun get back inside and call the desk blackthorn crawled from the doorway into the bathroom and locked that door if the killer blasted his way into the room it might take a few more seconds for him to get into the bathroom otherwise there wasnt going to be much he could do but there were no more gunshots blackthorn stayed where he was a minute passed then another finally he heard a pounding on his door and voices he had just opened the bathroom door when two security men both with guns drawn burst in you all right im fine what about my briefcase jesus hes blind my briefcase and my glasses blackthorn snapped your glasses are right here one of the guards said setting them against blackthorns hand but theres no briefcase damn the police are on their way whats he ever gonna be able to tell them the other asked he cant see a thing chapter five ten maybe five eleven deep southern accent id bet alabama or mississippi it would seem that he followed us when we drove from the white house to the hotel stunned gabe listened to kyle blackthorns account of the assault in his hotel a professional killer how could he have known about you somehow i dont think that white house of yours is a bastion of safe secrets im just glad you werent hurt and im sorry about your briefcase theyre not going to get much useful information from it besides my memory is a lot better than my eyesight ill get back to you very soon with my conclusions although you can start with what we spoke about im really sorry kyle do you want to stay here tonight theyve put me up in their vip suite and since the guy missed it seems like a fair trade to me ill tell you though hes the coldest human being ive ever encountered who wasnt on a slab in the morgue if youre up against him youve got problems not me though first thing tomorrow im off for cheyenne i wish i were going with you kyle i really miss the plains i havent even fully unpacked and i already want to go home youll do fine just watch your topknot doc not much scares me but this guy did count on it chief gabe set the phone down and paced the apartment the circle was wider than he could ever have imagined now there appeared to be a professional killer involved everybody seemed to know or sense that something was wrong with the president but gratefully to this point at least no one had a handle on precisely what it was or how serious meanwhile the potus himself seemed to be doing fine after dropping kyle at the airport hotel gabe had driven back to the white house and stopped by the residence largely as a result of drews heroics at the baltimore convention center his poll numbers had crept upward for the first time in weeks stoddard himself was feeling fine and magnus lattimore assured gabe that the commander in chief had never been sharper still it seemed like wishful thinking to believe the episodes of altered thinking and bizarre behavior were finished or that there would continue to be ways to cover them up gabe needed answers and he needed them before the twentyfifth amendment once again reared its massive head first things first one day at a time accept the things you cannot change change the things you can funny how in difficult times the old aa slogans kept creeping into his mind more and more lately maybe he thought now a couple of meetings wouldnt hurt he fixed some decaf and padded over to the dining room table where ferendellis nanotechnology library was spread out a little studying would help take his mind off the attack on blackthorn somehow someone knew who he was and what he had been doing in dc it seemed like only a matter of time before rumor and speculation would turn into headlines he pulled a chair up and turned his attention to preparing for the woman who claimed to barely know a man who had a wellrendered sketch of her in the drawer of his desk in the morning gabe would be driving out to lily sextons horse farm not far from flint hill and the shenandoah national park eighty miles or so west of the city if nothing else she should help him understand ferendellis fascination with the science of atomicsize constructions and nanomachines the decaf he chose from lemar stoddards stash was a brazillian blend so rich and aromatic that it was hard to believe it wasnt hightest probably like everything else in this city gabe decided the coffee was a shamloaded with caffeine nanotubes and fullerenes it took time for gabe to shuck frightening thoughts of a professional killer and blackthorns attack from his consciousness enough to concentrate on the material before him but finally he was able to begin taking notes and making some drawings nano came from the greek for dwarf and in scientific terms meant onebillionth as in a billionth of a meter th the diameter of a human hair nearly incomprehensible for a laymaneven one with a background in science nanotubes and fullerenes at the foundation of nanotechnology were carbon atoms the basis of life found ubiquitously in millions of different moleculessolids liquids and gasses the building blocks of the nanomanufacturing process were carbon atoms bound together in submicroscopic tubes of varying lengths and thicknesses and also in soccer balllike molecules containing precisely sixty carbon atoms these molecules perfect spheres were named fullerenes and nicknamed buckyballs after architect buckminster fuller designer of the geodesic dome which the fullerene resembled remarkable absolutely remarkable most of the science was more than gabe wanted to or even could handle but the potential of nanotechnology was as apparent as it was limitless made possible in large measure by the chemical ability of carbon to bond with other atoms and by the invention of futuristic machines such as the scanning tunneling microscope and the transmission electron microscope capable of actually visualizing nanotubes and fullerenes remarkable already there were more than seven hundred commercially available products as varied as cosmetics golf club shafts and bulletresistant shirts all built with nanomaterials nano toothpaste containing nanohydroxy apatite was able to bind to the protein in plaque making it easier to loosen and remove while at the same time it was filling scratches on dental surfaces nanosilver coatings on flatware doorknobs wound dressings water faucets makeup implements and socks impeded or eliminated bacterial growth the list and variety of products were stunning this was not the science fiction of gray goo this was the real deal making its way into the fabric of society on an incredible number of fronts and with a speed that had to be astounding even to those brilliant and visionary nobel laureates who originally created the field somewhere around one in the morning gabe had fallen asleep on his notes at one thirty still seated facedown at the table he was awakened by the ringing telephone dr singleton yes sorry to call you at such an hour sir this is mccabe at security downstairs theres an envelope for you that was just dropped off here by a messenger it says to deliver it to you immediately would you like me to send it up gabe pawed at his eyes and combed his hair with his fingers no no ill be right down a messenger yes sir none of us caught what company he was with and theres no indication on the envelope just the instructions to deliver it to you immediately ill be there in a minute the headache a familiar electric pain behind his eyes seemed to have woken up when he did before he had even fully processed his action he had opened his bureau drawer and taken out the plastic vial of codeine and other pills i never took a pill that i didnt have a pain for the notion stopped him short from the moment his former roommate had stepped out of marine one at the ranch gabes rather straightforward comfortable and uncomplicated life had been transformed to one enmeshed in halftruths and outright lies now according to kyle blackthorn at least it appeared that drews withholding the fact of his mental illness was not his only deception whether the psychologists shingan sense was right or not time would hopefully tell it was becoming increasingly clear to gabe that there was little he could do about those around him except trust none of them there was though something he could do about the deception he had been working on himself there were thousands in aa recovery maybe tens of thousands who managed to deal with routine headaches without leaping for a mindaltering painkiller for years the fallout from the deaths at fairhaven had been a smoldering depression that had cost him in many ways including his marriage he had tried to overcome the feelings by starting lariat and by going on medical missions to central america and he had successfully sworn off booze but the reliance if not dependence on pills was a constant reminder that the depression was always lurking and never very far below the surface he flipped the vial back into the drawer and washed down some extra strength tylenol instead for the time being the motion to give up on the pills had been tabled but at least he could watch himself more carefully as the twelvestep book so eloquently stated recovery was a matter of progress not perfection the fivebyseven manila envelope was completely unadorned except for dr gabe singleton neatly block printed in black ink and the instructions that the envelope was to be delivered immediately printed in the same way beneath it curious more than apprehensive gabe questioned the man who had accepted the delivery and assured himself that he had no information that would be of any help then gabe brought the envelope back to the condo and opened it on the table we must meet tell no one come alone go to the office we both have occupied the meeting time is to be exactly twentyfour hours from now in the office there are four framed photos taken by me examine the third photo from the right i will meet you beneath that structure the nightmare must end jf chapter donald greenfield with each passing hour thanks largely to the internet and courses on its use that she had taken during her training alison grew to know more and more about the man donald greenfield owner of a oneyearold porsche virginia registration number dg garaged on lido court in fredericksburg apparently paid for donald greenfield owner of the fortyonehundredsquarefoot victorian house at beechtree road richmond purchased ten years ago for and recently assessed at refinanced five years ago shared with at least one beautiful mexican woman constanza and one stunning mexican girl beatriz previous residence collins avenue salina kansas home owner there for fourteen years donald greenfield occupation selfemployed social security number mortgage a month no other mortgages no credit card debt no dependent exwives no children no criminal record checking accountbank of america richmond credit rating why so low she wrote beside the number alison flipped through her notes both pleased and dismayed with the results of her first day of investigation she wondered in passing who donald greenfield had been before treat griswold appropriated his name and identity of all the hundredsprobably thousandsof federal agencies there was still none coordinating births and deaths griswold had probably searched the cemeteries for an infant or child who had been born around the same year as had he for a person with his understanding of the workings of the federal government obtaining a social security number in the dead childs name would have been easy and from there fleshing out an identity would have been even easier still questions remaining to be answered included where griswold was getting the money to support his double life and whether there was any connection between what she had uncovered about him and his practice of toting around an inhaler used regularly by the president another gnawing question needing resolution soon was when she was going to share the burden of what she was learning and with whom that was the most perplexing question of all it was after one in the morning her jaws ached from hours of vigorous gum chewing the tension of the day had left her more wired than tired but a glass of merlot was usually all that was needed to nudge her toward sleep she uncorked a new bottlemedium priced with a label she liked from a california vineyard she had never heard of she poured one glass drank it slowly then decided on a second which she dispatched quite a bit quicker st bonifaces winery good label good stuff she wrote down the name and terse evaluation in the small spiral notebook she always carried in her purse no need to specify merlot it was rare that she drank at all and as she was a creature of habit even rarer that she ventured to another grape griswold griswold griswold she murmured settling back in her desk chair whats with you griswold are you really into what i think youre into kidnapping illegal alien trafficking pedophilia statutory rape she reached across her notes to the corner of her desk and extracted a letter from its envelope it was the second time she had read it that night but possibly the twentieth since she had received it about a year ago dear cro do people still call you cro i used to think that was the coolest nickname in the world surprise its me janie this time coming to you from beautiful downtown bakersfield home of the driller diner where i am currently employed waitressing tables the only thing here less appetizing than the patrons is the food its been a few years so i hope this address in texas is still a good one to get this to you as for me this is like the tenth city ive lived in since i got shoved out of my job in the icu at shitcan general hospital and onto the street for doing exactly nothing wrong needless to say since the hammer fell i never have gotten my nurses license back ive had a lot of lousy jobs like this one but thats okay because ive never been able to hang on to any of them for very long you know depression meds worse depression more meds the reason im writing is that my sister sent me the obituary on dr numbnuts corcoran the incompetent bastard who started it all two columns and a photo in the la times no mention at all of the lives he took or the oneminethat he and his cronies in the cognac and cuban cigar club ruined well at least it was cancer i hope it was a slow and painful kind i hope it for all of us thank you for trying to fight them cro at least you tried thats more than anyone else can say and plenty besides you knew i didnt do anything wrong thank you for trying i dont blame you for bailing in the end i never did i hope you know that you tried take care i hope whatever youre doing youre happy me i get to go into la every few months and see how much mykids have grown i was always a good mom and i still love them no matter what keep fighting the good fight janie keep fighting the good fight by the time alison had finished reading the merlot had kicked in good thing sleep wasnt going to come easily now as she padded unevenly to bed she was grateful that fade to black was only minutes away she was in over her headmaybe way over in the end if she kept pushing she might well end up in janieville waiting tables or working at walmart and wondering what in the hell had happened to her life had treat griswold been an la surgeon he most certainly would have been a member of the four cs in the secret service he was the manrespected even revered now she was contemplating trying to take him down there was still time to just drop the whole thing and take the low road out of town and back to the desk in san antonio there was still time baby i want to spend some time upstairs with beatriz donnie honey it is one oclock in the morning shes sleeping so shell wake up ill be gone all day tomorrow therell be plenty of time for her to sleep then ive been working really hard lately and i need a back rub i can give you one i know just how you like them i want her to know how i like them i want her to know how i like everything you know the rules your time with me is coming to an end its your job to help me get her ready then it is your job to manage things until beatriz is ready to take over for you with whoever follows her that is what im doing yes yes baby youre doing a good job as long as you understand the way things work here i do when the time comes i will be ready to leave that times still a ways off now go and wake beatriz and bring her upstairs to the room im going to shower then ill be up i want her showered too her hair also if you think so i understand excellent i love it when you understand i did good telling you about the woman in the nail place yes you did good maybe very good depending on what fingerprints we find on that bottle of nail polish i bought from viang marooned on a desert isle that is what she chose women notice things like that marooned on a desert isle echoed donald greenfield running his hand over constanzas firm breasts and down her lean cocoa body to the smoothly waxed mound between her thighs we shall see what tales our little bottle has to tell us chapter the nightmare must end it was everything gabe could do to keep from racing over to the white house at am to inspect the third photo from the right on his office wall he had enjoyed looking over at the blackandwhite studies but was embarrassed now that he had never examined them in any detail and had no idea that jim ferendelli was the photographer given the quality of the sketch of lily sexton and of the landscape by the upstairs window at the physicians house little about the mans creative abilities was surprising more exciting than being contacted by ferendelli though was the knowledge that he was alive it would be difficult to keep such good news from the president ultimately gabe accepted that after yet another long emotionally grueling day what he needed more than anything else right now was sleep as excited as he was to be moving closer to the end of the ferendelli mystery learning what meeting place his predecessor had chosen could hold until morning gabe already had plans to check the president over first thing and to make an itembyitem approval or rejection of his typically overloaded schedule he also had to sign out to the covering doc and to get drews approval to travel out of range to lily pad stables from late morning until what would probably turn out to be early evening heavylidded he read ferendellis urgent note one more time we must meet tell no one come alone go to the office we both have occupied the meeting time is to be exactly twentyfour hours from now in the office there are four framed photos taken by me examine the third photo from the right i will meet you beneath that structure the nightmare must end jf gabe managed four dreamless hours of sleep after which it looked as if he hadnt once shifted position he awoke wondering if the man who had tried to kill him and the one who had attacked kyle were one and the same the notion made little sense but until he and jim ferendelli stood facetoface gabe knew that nothing much was going to two sets of thirty pushups sandwiched around a hundred situps followed by some freshsqueezed orange juice a prolonged shower and a travel mug of a startlingly rich sumatran blend and he was totally ready for the day something was going to give he told himself as he headed to the garage whether it was news from kyle blackthorn or insight into lily or resolution of the mystery of ferendellis disappearance or even some hint as to what the president might have been holding back during his neuropsych testing before much longer things were going to begin to come together before being summoned to work in the heart of the white house gabe had never even visited the placenot as a tourist not as a student and not even as a midshipman at the academy he wondered how long it would take if ever for him to get used to walking up to the security station being recognized by the guards and after a brief check of his credentials strolling into the seat of the countrys executive power now he smiled inwardly at the notion that with jim ferendelli alive and at least making contact he might be back on his ranch before he ever found out the answer surprisingly the outer door to the medical clinic was unlocked he eased it open and stepped into the reception area from behind the closed door to the bathroom and examination room a woman was singing steamy blues this world aint always tasty like candy her tone was velvet rich and huskya captivating voice made to sing the blues gabe slowed his breathing and listened thats what my mama once told me ferendellis photographs were just through the door to his office but gabe stood there transfixed by the incongruity of hearing such a voice in such a place sometimes itll shake you and bend you try to upend you probably someone from housekeeping he decided someone who had pulled herself up from the wrong side of the tracks and was doing janitorial work to help support her family a woman who would have made it big on american idol if the show had only been airing when she was younger maybe even now friends and family had told her to audition but she just smiled and shook her head these were her blues not something she wanted to share with the world knock you right off of your feet gabe moved slowly through the doorway of his office to his left were the photographs to his right the angle made it impossible to see the woman who was cleaning either the bathroom the cabinets or the countertop the song was too special to interrupt so he moved silently to the wall and jim ferendellis art gabe was hardly a connoisseur of photography but this set each picture labeled on its frame with a small engraved brass plaque was pleasing and in some respects fascinatingstudies in light and shadow in angles and shapes and shading a scene across the reflecting basin a striking closeup of a portion of the capitol the blues he was listening to seemed to fit the grouping perfectly so when those hard times come a calling remember youve got to take the bitter with the sweet the third photo more somber than the others was titled anacostia from the benning street bridge anacostia he had heard the section of dc mentioned from time to time and thought he remembered that it was a poor part of the citymostly blacks and hispanics but he had no idea exactly where it was there was a map in his desk if there was time after examining drew perhaps he could take a ride there and familiarize himself with the bridge and the area beneath it a final examination of the photograph and he turned toward the examining room alison cromartie dressed for work in slacks a light blue blouse and a navy blazer was leaning against the door frame wearing a pair of rubber gloves hi she said until he heard his voice gabe wasnt certain hed be able to speak it felt as if his heart had stopped hi yourself he managed i loved your song thanks when i was younger and thinking about a career in show business i used to moonlight singing in various disreputable placessort of a lowrent lounge lizard now i still love singing but mostly its in the shower the image of that was almost more than gabe could handle he struggled to remind himself that this was someone who had been placed in the medical unit to spy and to deceive and who had almost certainly stolen the bloods he had drawn youre here early he said not really i always come in about now to straighten up and see if anything needs ordering speaking of straightening up she went onto her tiptoes and adjusted his tie my daddy wore ties all the timeall kinds well its pretty obvious that i dont he replied dizzy as he had been that first night from the closeness of her she moved back to survey her handiwork but only half a step i didnt think you were on duty today she said i im not i have an appointment that will take up most of the day i just came in to pick up some papers and check in on the man and the first lady before i leave alison lifted her hands between them slowly pulled off the gloves and flipped them into the leather waste can by his desk although there was no sense that she meant it to be the mundane gesture was at once sensual and incredibly sexy even more sensual were her dark eyes which never left his gabe felt an exquisitely unpleasant fullness in his throat this wasnt like the other instances when they had been togethernot even the first time the connection he was sensing between them was far more intense and mesmerizing he felt at once consumed by the need to touch herto hold herand as awkward as a teen at his first dance you want to sing some more he ventured some other time maybe you can have a command performance gabe closed what little gap remained between them eased his arms around her and set her cheek against his chest her hair smelled like summer and he buried his face in it his lips pressed against her thoughts of her as a spy or even a thief vanished all he wanted was to hold her he ran his hands inside her jacket and up to her shoulders her hold on him intensified she worked her fingers into the muscles of his back i havent been able to stop thinking about you she whispered he reached under her blouse and ran his fingertips over the silky hollow of her back in that moment nothing else seemed to matternothing but her touch and the feel of her skin it had been so long since sex was special he was thinkingso long since a kiss really mattered gabe she whispered tell me therell be time for us he set his lips on the base of her neck i cant believe this is happening therell be time i promise you there willas much time as you need as much time as you want she eased herself back never taking her eyes from his i knew you were out there gabe a smart kind gentle funny man i knew it i dont want you to stop touching me i intend to redefine the term but any moment now the covering doc will be strolling in im not sure this is the way we want him to find us i love that its happening gabe said holding her tightly one last time and i really do promise you therell be time but whats his name up in the residence and his wife are expecting me and i think maybe i should show up there since they are my only patients alison straightened up and tucked in her blouse youre not afraid of me anymore do you mean afraid or mistrustful because i was never afraid she kissed him under his chin and then adjusted his tie once more and smoothed his jacket so what do you want to know she asked suddenly his gaze fixed on hers did you really save me that night or was that whole car thing a setup to gain my confidence there was no setup gabe that was the real deal just like this is she rose to her tiptoes and kissed him lightly on the lips he gently moved her away from him keeping his hands on her shoulders knowing that if she was lying he was hardly in a position to be able to tell still he desperately wanted to ask one more questionprovided he could ask it without giving away privileged information the bloods i drew on the president he suddenly heard himself asking why did you take the tubes from the refrigerator you were one of the few besides me who had access to them alison looked utterly dismayed then suddenly she nodded her understanding gabe i need your trust here i need you not to ask me anything more about the blood but why he insisted did you take the tubes or not i need your promise no more questions about this at least not for now im at the point where i dont trust anyone but if were headed together to where i hope we are im going to promise so long as i have your wordno more lies no more lies baby she whispered in that case no more questions okay then she said i absolutely didnt take the blood but i believe i know who did chapter the drive to lily pad stables route west to took ninety minutes the zip code of the place was probably flint hills but according to lily the house barn other outbuildings and whitefenced pastures stood alone nestled in the foothills of the blue ridge mountains several miles from the actual town after carefully checking over the president and much to the chagrin of magnus lattimore reducing his appointment schedule by half on general principles gabe changed clothes in the lincoln bedroom signed out to the physician on call for the day spread his city map out on the seat of the buick and headed out pennsylvania avenue to anacostia somewhere jim ferendelli was mentally preparing to meet with him without requesting an explanation for why he wanted to know lattimore and the president had filled gabe in on anacostia which encompassed the east and southeast portions of the city primarily occupying the land east of the river for which it was named anacostia was according to both of them an area badly in need of a renaissance and soon to get it if the joint federalmunicipal commission they had instituted had its way for the time being they said as in any inner city it was best to be cautious walking the streets of that neighborhood at night gabe felt virtually certain from the photo and the geography that ferendelli planned to meet him beneath the east end of the bridge his mission before heading off for flint hill was to familiarize himself with the area and to find a place to park that was reasonably close to the base of the bridge and also reasonably close to a streetlight it took only minutes for him to locate a spot with which he was comfortable midmorning was certainly not am but he found anacostia to have a pleasant vibrant neighborhood charm the parking place he selected on clay seemed like it would be safe enough after a brief stop to reconnoiter the space beneath the bridge he worked his way back through the city to pick up route at the roosevelt memorial bridge and headed west there was no need to put on the radio for the drive to lily pad stables the memory of alisons voice kept him company enough it had been so long since a woman had him feeling as fascinated optimistic and excited as she hada natural antidepressant well beyond the equivalent of all the prozac and welbutrin he had taken over the years lilys directions were perfect they had to be because the roads quickly became narrower windier and less well marked if she didnt already have a piedàterre in dc she would certainly need one after her appointment to drews cabinet gabe checked the trip odometer her place had to be close the land along the road was densely wooded with occasional broad pastures and narrow dirt roads that were marked only by a mailbox or handmade sign and immediately disappeared in the summer forest so when those hard times come a calling remember youve got to take the bitter with the gabe stopped singing and slowed completely awed by the picturebook vista that had opened up before him the woodlands had given way to vast rolling pastureland crisscrossed by pristine tworail whitewashed fencing scattered among the meadows were horses at least two dozen of them grazing contentedly to his left a professionally made sign read lily pad stables main entrance an arrow pointed straight up on the other side of the paved drive a second sign with an arrow pointing to the right read lily pad stables rear entrance stables miles all deliveries this way gabe swung the buick to the left drove up a short rise and this time stopped altogether nestled in a verdant valley set against the breathtaking mountains still in the distance was the main house of lily pad stablesa sprawling white farmhouse with black shutters that would not have done the term mansion any discredit but it wasnt the incredible beauty of the place alone that had stopped him short he had seen that exact viewmountains outbuildings pastures and main housebefore it took a moment for him to connect with how that could be but only a moment it was the scene depicted in the oil painting sketch awaiting completion on the easel by the upstairs window of jim ferendellis georgetown brownstone gabe gripped the wheel until his knuckles were white then remained parked on the rise for several minutes composing himself and wondering how he could possibly get at the subject of lilys connection with his predecessor without arousing her suspicion that he might know more than he was letting on finally having failed to come up with any specific plan other than to improvise he eased his foot off the brake and rolled slowly down the first of several gentle grades the driveway to the main house was more than a quarter of a mile long as he approached the broad finely landscaped turnaround the dark blue taurus that had been following him since he pulled out of the watergate garage drove past the main drive and toward the rear entrance to the farm chapter alison spent a sluggish morning in the white house clinic wondering if it was metaphysically and psychologically possible to be absolutely obsessed with two men at the same time her attraction to gabe had been smoldering since the moment they first met now she had trouble focusing her thoughts on anything elseanything that was except for treat griswold or don greenfield or whoever the secret service icon was today actually this was a griswold day or at least a griswold morning she had seen the man take the elevator up to the residence and return soon after with the presidents widely beloved dog a handsome powerful pit bull terrier following dutifully at his heel the two of them had gone into the rose garden for a time and then returned it all seemed so typically normal but nothing involving that man would ever be normal again restless and feeling scattered and distracted alison ran meaningless errands and made two trips to visit with friends in the clinic on the first floor of the eisenhower building next door it was a blessing that to this point in the morning at least nothing medical had happened to the president or to any of the visitors to the white house there was no predicting how she might have responded the physician on duty with her a humorless army major who looked too young to be a doctor let alone a white house doctor kept his nose buried in journals most of the morning her thoughts about griswold inevitably included memories of la her friend janie and the cs surgeons she was hardly prepared yet for the fallout that was sure to accompany any effort to expose the agent and in fact his perversion assuming that was what beatriz represented might well have nothing to do with the president or the bronchodilator inhaler in which case there was really nothing to expose but then again because of her refusal to accept what seemed like a fairly minor break in protocol a path had opened now it would be foolish not to follow that path to the end as the morning had worn on alison had became more and more fixated on the consideration however remote that the inhaler griswold was using might have more inside it than simply alupent at this point the notion made little sense but it had moved in and taken up residence in her mind rumorsthe very rumors that had led her chief to send her into the white house undercoverhad been whispering that drew stoddard was mentally unstable true or not it was her job quietly but quickly to investigate anything related to that possibility if nothing else she decided in addition to fleshing out donald greenfield and his relationship to the women of beechtree road she had to examine the contents of the inhaler griswold carried in the inner breast pocket of his suit coat piece of cake she thought grinning sardonically as she checked supplies and certified that the defibrillator was ready and waiting if treat griswold wasnt the toughest and sharpest of the presidents protectors he was close short of coming on to him in a manner she was absolutely averse to there was no way she was going to get near that inhaler let alone switch it for a duplicate in his transformation from treat griswold to donald greenfield he had either left his suit coat locked in griswolds car in the fredericksburg garage or placed it in the luggage compartment of greenfields porsche it seemed like somewhere in that transformation there might be a moment but no approach was lighting up for her she considered and discarded several other possibilities each time coming back to the one scenario she had absolutely rejected an allout comeon taken far enough to get griswolds jacket off no way she decided emphatically as a secret service agent she had vowed to sacrifice all for president and country but allowing a beast like treat griswold to her thoughts were interrupted abruptly by the germ of an idea for several minutes like an enophile with a new wine she did nothing but explore the possibility from every aspect then she began to savor it at that moment the idea was still a remote possibilitynothing more to make it work would require a number of pieces falling into place followed by a hell of a lot of luck but the best alternative she had been able to come up with to this point was unacceptable she approached the studious young physician in his office and asked to take the rest of the day off to deal with a nearly incapacitating migraine need anything for it he asked barely glancing up from his new england journal of medicine no no i have exactly what i need at home in truth what she needed was right in her purse her address book and in her jacket pocket her cell phone somewhere in that book was the initial step in converting a remote possibility into a planthe phone number of seth owens of san antonio fbi agent seth owens chapter well doctor lily said i cant begin to tell you what a pleasure this has been getting to drink tea and break bread with the most talked about man in dc the most talked about man in dc now thats a little hard to believe well its truenot even a contest in washington it is all about proximity and access to the president nothing more nothing less proximity and access in lesser cases it becomes proximity and access to the ones with proximity and access you sir are not only the new man on campus but you are handsome unassuming and have total access to the big guy now if that doesnt get you talked about i dont know what does she shrugged matteroffactly and held her hands out as if to say thats the way it is no gabe thought the way it is is that you have a relationship with jim ferendelli that youre willing to lie to protect the two of them sat across from one another on fine leather sofas in lilys richly paneled den sipping tea from ample oriental mugs and sampling a variety of tiny pastries and wafers remember we still have tuna steak and salad waiting lily said save some room no problem im ready for lunch and im very ready to feel a saddle beneath my butt im grateful to you for this day lily i havent felt this at ease since the president showed up at my place with the suggestion that i come out here why doctor what a very kind and very gracious thing for you to say okay no more doctor unless you want me to start calling you that im sure you know it but a phd in just about any field is much harder to get than an md anyway if anyone deserves to be called doctor its you guys more tea gabe i guess one more cup i dont usually love tea except iced and then only outside on the hottest days but this is really delicious it converted me from coffee i discovered it on a trip to western china and now i have it shipped in regularly from what ive been told its a variety of camellia sinensis that doesnt grow anywhere else in that country and maybe in the world the closest ive encountered to it is keemun black tea but they really arent that similar she picked up a small bell from the coffee table and shook it once in seconds the smiling robust black woman who had been serving them materialized with another cup of the remarkable brew it was a rich translucent rusty brown with an aroma and taste that reminded gabe of of what cinnamon honey some sort of nut all three guesses were good ones he acknowledged but none of them was quite right he breathed in then exhaled contentedlyalmost a sigh it had been his intention to move any conversation to the dual subjects of interest to himjim ferendelli and nanotechnology but now he realized that his sharp sense of urgency was gone he took another sip of tea then forced himself to sit more upright and to push back against the euphoria and complacency that seemed to have overtaken him helping to bring him back on task was the realization that the unique turquoise necklace lily was wearing today was precisely the one ferendelli had drawn in the charcoal rendering of her why was she lying ready for some lunch she asked reaching for the bell in a moment are you okay you look a little glassyeyed no no im fine a little tired is all would you like to postpone our ride for another time hardly ive been looking forward to it what was the horses name intensive care close hes named serious therapy youll love him gabe was beginning to feel a bit more in control so heres what happened he managed ever since i arrived at the white house ive been trying to piece together the life of jim ferendellito try and get some clue as to what might have happened to him did you know that not only has ferendelli disappeared but his daughter as well she was going to school in new york oh i didnt know thats very frightening you said you had met him just once we didnt have time to get to know one another from what i can tell he seems like quite a guysort of a renaissance man into art photography medicine music fascinating yes well i know that both the fbi and secret service investigators are very involved in the search for him but i decided to walk through his place looking for anything that might have meant something to me as a doc but that the investigators might have passed by and believe it or not i found something on his bookshelfat least i might have go on jim ferendelli had become fascinated with nanotechnologyespecially the medical aspects of nanotechnology he has a collection of books on the subject in his library from nanotechnology for dummies to some fairly sophisticated scientific texts i thought i remembered you mentioning the field when we spoke so i figured i might kill three birds with one stone by seeing you going riding and picking your brain on the subject well i assure you gabe while i may have mentioned nanotechnology as one of the interests of the administration i am far from an academic expert on the subject lily surprised gabe at that moment by once again ringing the tiny bell as if she was dropping the subject altogether maddy she said to her servant is lunch ready all set ms lily good well be there in just a minute i know youve got business in town you can leave for the day as soon as youve taken care of the dishes thank you ms lily and maddy please call william at the stables and tell him well be ready to ride in thirtyfive minutes yes maam gabe tried quite unsuccessfully to imagine himself so at ease dealing with servants he couldnt even deal with his horses on anything but a strictly even basis if lily sexton wasnt born into the role of mistress of the manor she had certainly succeeded in the adaptation it wasnt until they were settled in at one end of her impressive dining room table that she finally brought the subject back to nanotechnology i suppose if youve been studying you have some grounding in the field she said well i know about the eric drexler talk that sort of started it all and i know some of the very basic chemistry and a bit about the potential of the science and how it stands to impact all of our lives but i really still dont know where speculation and potential stop and reality begins well neither does the president or any other government agency for that matter from capitol hill down to the smallest town its one thing to be excited that nanosilver shoe disinfectants is becoming a new industry its another to try and determine what the effect of aerosolized or ingested nanosilver particles would be on human organs so you think new public health laws are needed the president does and thats what counts but what happens if every governmental agency from congress to the east podunk city council starts drafting control legislationespecially when theyre operating with outdated or little or even no scientific information thats exactly what the president is trying to head off at the pass by forming this new cabinet post centralizing control of the new sciences and drafting wellthoughtout comprehensive legislation with curbs on unbridled research we know that industry and especially big pharma would always rather ask forgiveness than permission well be trying to circumvent that without stifling creativity and without smothering what will probably be the most important development in our civilization since fiberoptics and may turn out to be the linchpin of science for the next several centuries the ability to construct beginning with atoms thats some power gabe said as much to himself as his hostess the truth is i dont particularly want the sort of clout and responsibility that would go along with being the secretary of science and technology lily said but the other truth is i dont want anybody else to have it either any ideas why jim ferendelli would have developed such an intense interest in the field lily shook her head he never contacted me about it but you should know that except for maybe understanding the organic chemistry surrounding fullerenes and nanotubes i am no expert and if dr ferendelli had been studying as hard as you say i may not even know as much as he didi mean does i certainly hope does is right gabe said it would have been great to have kyle blackthorn there to help him sort out how much of what lily had been saying was a lie the meeting tonight in anacostia would surely help straighten things out but as his euphoria gradually abated and his focus sharpened gabe found himself wishing more and more for an unencumbered hour or two to look around lilys mansion for any evidence that she knew jim ferendelli more intimately than she claimed want seconds lily asked gesturing to gabes empty plate um no thanks im done she rang one of the ubiquitous little bells and maddy materialized to clear the table ill tell you what ill answer any questions that occur to you during or after our ride maddy just leave the house open when you go well be back in an hourtwo at the most the servant smiled cheerily nodded at her boss then at gabe and quietly receded to the kitchen gabe wondered in passing if maddy was as content with her life as she seemed to be one thing he strongly suspected was that the woman wouldnt be able to remember the last time she caught someone in a lie as monumental as the one lily sexton seemed to be caught in now maybe lily had a man in her life gabe mused and was having an illicit affair with ferendelli he followed her downstairs to a lower level that didnt exist on the front side of the house then out a back door to the stables an illicit affair would fit most if not all of the facts as lily had ordered the horses were ready and waiting serious therapy was a sturdy bay quarter horse with a distinctive blaze along his nose from high on his forehead to his muzzle i like him already gabe said checking the tightness of the cinch and the length of the stirrups before swinging easily onto a handtooled saddle that might have cost as much as his car lily eschewed the offer of a leg up from william the stable man but did use a low step to mount belle starr an elegant steel gray mare side by side lily and gabe began a slow walk past the corrals and out along a slightly shaded trail heading toward denser forest and the hills for five minutes perhaps even longer little was said between them as advertised serious therapy was specialpowerful alert and responsive later when gabe had the chance to reflect on these qualities he concluded that they might well have been responsible for saving his life lost in the perfection of the moment and in thoughts around the mysterious unfathomable woman riding a few feet to the left and in front of him he wasnt certain whether or not he had seen movement ahead of them and to the right quite far into the woods the possibility triggered a small jet of adrenalineenough of a rush so that when the threat became clear his reaction was quick the horses had slowed as they headed up a modest rise the man dressed in black and wearing a black ski mask materialized from behind a tree twentyfive yards or so to their right his rifle with what might have been a hunting sight was aimed directly at gabe lily gabe barked he reflexively pulled his reins back and sharply to the left serious therapy went straight up on his hind legs and pirouetted like a ballet dancer spinning to the left at the same instant the rifle spit off one shot then another gabe heard the second bullet snap into a tree somewhere to his left belle starr reared as had gabes horse but lily was totally unprepared she lost her seat and was airborne before she could respond twisting ungracefully then landing heavily on her left side crying out in pain as she hit the hardpacked dirt gabe clambered to the ground thinking that she had been shot hunched low and weaving he raced to where she lay groaning and in obvious pain belle starr stood dutifully nearby the gunman was gone far to his right gabe thought he saw movement through the distant trees but then there was nothing cautiously his eyes still fixed on the forest he turned to lily she was conscious but in severe pain are you shot i i dont think so my shoulder i think its broken or easy lily your neck hurt no not really well try not to move it anyway her face was ashen and already she was showing the early signs of shock careful to keep her left shoulder as stable as possible gabe checked her quickly for any gunshot wounds then had her move her legs and left arm and finally turned his attention to the shoulder that if she was lucky was fractured just below the head of the humerus and if she was quite unlucky was both fractured and dislocated either way she was shocky and in need of attention he slipped off belle starrs saddle and used it to elevate lilys legs then he stabilized her shoulder with the saddle blanket finally he eased off her boots and slid them toe first one on each side under her neck when he was certain there was at least some splinting action from the boots he warned her not to turn her head or move unless she absolutely had to then he swung up into the saddle with serious therapy galloping the moment his feet were firmly in the stirrups and bolted back down the trail chapter alison stood on the walk at the base of the lincoln memorial alternately pacing impatiently from one side of the broad stairway to the other and gazing up at the profoundly moving statue of the great emancipator with a mixed heritage she had always revered the man his accomplishments and the heartwrenching decisions he had to make seth owenss man was latefifteen minutes late to be exact most days treat griswold went off duty at four some days it seemed at three soon even the remote possibility of moving on him today would be gone yet another group of children from yet another summer camp jostled past her and up the stairs followed by yet another trio of weary perspiring counselors alison checked her watch cast about again and decided to wait five more minutes before calling seth three years ago the two of them had managed to make the difficult transition from being lovers to being just friends at the time seth was on the rebound from a failed marriage and was still very much in love with his exwife although he wouldnt admit it alison still smarting from a failed relationship in la had hoped for an uncomplicated physical connection with no expectations and periodic good times and great sex together quickly though she realized that as therapeutic and adult as such a relationship sounded in principle in practice she was simply not cut out for it alison hoped things with gabe would turn out to have more substance meanwhile it was good to know that the witty intelligent resourceful owens was on her sideespecially in situations like today when the only one who might rapidly be able to fill her needs was an fbi agent owens had been happy to hear from her but made no promises at first however within half an hour he had called her back with a single name lester a time two thirty and a place right where she was standing she reached into her jacket pocket for her cell phone at the moment it began ringing yes alison its seth everything okay well not exactly its like a hundred degrees out here in front of the monument every ounce of love i once had for schoolchildren has been ripped from my bosom by one stampeding horde after another and your man lester has failed to appear are you sure of course im sure very sure uhoh i did mention that lester had a flair for the dramatic didnt i i think you might have said something like that yes so alison my flower what did you call and ask me for i asked you for the best pickpocket on the planetthe man you guys would send out to pluck a prime ministers speech out of his jacket before he got to deliver it thats exactly what you said so why dont you take a look inside your purse inside my the moment she touched her shoulder bag she knew something was wrong she opened it up her wallet was gone so were her notebook her lipstick at least four packs of trident and a minisize copy of a walkers guide to washington in fact the purse was empty completely empty well not exactly lestershe had to assume it was hehad replaced the weight of what he had taken from her with plastic packs of tic tacs at least a dozen of them your right earring gone she said realizing even before she felt for it that it was like you lester is very good at what he does i guess okay owen im a believer where is he see the group of kids at the far end of the stairs yes see the guy entertaining them the one juggling lester he just waved to me without dropping a ball i owe you bigtime owens when i get back to san antonio dinner at paloma blancas on me i thought you didnt want to come back seth said if i screw this up i may be shipped back to wash the urinals gotta go lester just waved to me again this time with an indian club while he was juggling two more with his other hand i think he and i will be able to do business provided he doesnt get busted by the park ranger heading toward him thanks pal chapter the laconic stable man william tall gaunt and in his seventies handled the news of the gunman and lilys injury with anxious composure he called and ordered the police and ambulance to lily pad stables while gabe loaded up with water bandages anything that would pass for a splint and blankets is there any easy way a man with a rifle could have gotten as far into the forest as he did gabe asked swinging back onto serious therapy theys a number a ways actually these hillsre crisscrossed by old logging roads and old mining roads and even old military roads from the warthe civil war that is the bastard couldda taken the one right at the base of that hill over yonder ends up at an abandoned coal mine bout six miles in runs right alongside the yellow brick roadthats this trail here that you was onfor three four mile before cuttin away send the rescue people right out gabe said urging his horse to a full gallop with just a tap of his heels lily was essentially as he had left her eyes closed moaning in pain and looking as if her blood pressure was still quite low for more than half an hour gabe ministered to her replacing the splints protecting her shoulder and neck keeping her warm and as hydrated as she would allow and whispering steady encouragement her injury was severeprobably a fracture dislocation with significant hemorrhagingand as likely as not she would be in the operating room before the night was out having done everything he could think of gabe knelt beside her and peered into the woods toward the spot where the shooter had stood it would be worth taking the police there against the remote chance the man had left anything behind the more gabe thought about the episode the more convinced he became that the gunman who had nearly killed him on the street near the white house and this assailant were the same or at least were working for the same people it was nearly impossible to believe otherwise but why target him trying to come up with an explanation that fit the facts was a shortcut to a migraine hang on lily he said help should be here in just a few minutes can i make it to a hospital in dc she asked her voice weak and raspy in the shape youre in i wouldnt chance it youve probably lost a significant amount of blood into your arm and back into your chest at some point youre almost certainly going to need anesthesia and a procedure to fix your shoulder maybe after youre stabilized you can arrange to be transported to a university medical center for that thanks doctor her eyes closed and again she drifted off breathing sonorously moments later gabe heard an approaching siren and within a minute two cruisers came jouncing up the deeply rutted yellow brick road followed by an ambulance the paramedics as was the case almost everywhere gabe had ever watched their brothers and sisters work in the field were confident efficient and damn good the two of them a young man and an older woman were kind enough to compliment gabe on his makeshift first aid as they immobilized lilys neck started an iv put some oxygen in place did a quick competent check for other injuries and expertly immobilized her shoulder gabe reminded himself of what he already knew well if he was ever injured outside of a medical center he would take a paramedics care over that of any but the most exceptional trauma physician on the way in the team had noted a place to turn around and after loading lily in the back of the ambulance and again praising gabes thoughtful work they backed up toward the spot with one of the flint hill cruisers following not surprisingly there was nothing in the woods or on the road beyond to suggest the identity of the shooter although there may have been a few cracked branches in the area where gabe thought the man had been standing gabe felt obligated to disclose to the policemen the nature of his connection to the president but chose to say nothing to them about the previous attempt on his life he would contact alison as soon as he got back to dc then unless she had strong objections he would speak with magnus lattimore and probably with the president himself with two attempts on gabes life in less than a week it seemed like time for him to get some secret service protection of his own first though he had some business to attend toa search of lily sextons home she had left the house open if her housekeeper was gone as it seemed she would be he would have some time to search for any information regarding jim ferendelli and then head for the hospital to check on lily gabe led lilys horse back to where the stable man was waiting then after muttering something about picking his briefcase up from the den he returned to the house and let himself in he began at the master suite a massive carpeted bedroom and elegant bath located at the rear of the house there was a small desk but no papers of interest on top of it or in the drawers the closets however were more interesting there were two of them one a walkin the other much smaller the walkin was filled with the gowns and casual clothes of a woman who took pains to dress well the smaller closet was taken up with clothing belonging to a mana man who dressed as tastefully as did the mistress of the manor business suits several tuxedoes worn work clothes riding attire and casual shirts and slacks thirtythree waist thirtytwo leg sixteenthirtythree shirts the man gabe estimated was about five eleven one hundred and seventy pounds and in shape gabe had no idea if these were jim ferendellis clothes but he wouldnt be the least surprised later on to find that they were what amounted to the back staircase led down to three guest bedrooms each comfortably apportioned with its own bath with his enthusiasm for finding anything else of significance waning rapidly gabe did a walkthrough of the guest rooms pulling out a drawer here and there and checking the closets all of which were empty but ready for guests with extra blankets and towels he was about to head upstairs to retrieve his briefcase when he stopped in the center of the guest room farthest from the back staircase and directly under the den behind the antique oak bureau and tall mirror was a door in the wall visible from either side of the bureau but only at an acute angle gingerly gabe slid the bureau aside a typed half page was sealed in plastic and tacked to the door which rose no more than five feet from the floor lily pad farm and the underground railroad the construction of the central house of lily pad stables took place between and sheep rancher thaddeus boxley and his sons were the first owners it is unclear whether the family died out or moved away by the mids the farm became the property of abolitionist james sugarman it also became an important cog in the underground railroada series of way stations for slaves trying to make their way from bondage to freedom in the cities of the north and in canada the small room behind this door often held as many as ten men women and children for as long as a day feel free to look inside but please touch nothing the low narrow door constructed of three skillfully conjoined planks slid into the wall on a pair of tracks gabe wondered if the bureau had been there from the beginning it made sense especially given that there was barely room for the furniture in any other arrangement the concealment of the door wouldnt survive anything more than a cursory exam but he could imagine situations where it might have been overlooked gabe opened the drapes to let in more light and switched on the bedside lamp then with extreme care he hooked two fingers into a northsouth groove that had been carved into the righthand margin of the door and pulled the door slid across into the wall with surprising ease revealing a dark somewhat dusty space about eight feet square with a packed red clay floor there were three roughhewn benches against the walls an old straw broom a wooden water bucket and ladle and a second larger bucket with a cover which gabe surmised was to aid in the disposal of bodily waste there was no source of light but if someone stood back from the doorway enough flowed in from the guest room to illuminate most of the space three of the four walls were constructed of the same packed red clay as the floor the fourth to gabes left was some sort of roughhewn wood panel that was all there was to ita way station for slaves virtually unchanged for over years frustrated gabe turned to leave then turned back to be certain he hadnt left any telltale footprints the heels of his boots had in fact made several gouges in the earthen floor the rest of the floor had been brushed smooth possibly with the old broom careful not to track clay back into the small guest room he pulled his boots off and set them aside then he got down on his knees and was smoothing out the defects when he noticed small bits of loose clay around the bases of the legs of the bench leaning against the paneled wall it appeared as if the bench had been dragged forward and then pushed back again he crawled cautiously to the bench and pulled it toward him it was fixed to the wall with just enough space at one end to admit his fingers a stronger pull and an invisible low doorway opened on almost invisible hinges revealing a tunnel similar to the room itself supported every ten yards or so by upright railroad ties and a crossbeam the tunnel was quite dark but was faintly lit from somewhere in the distance electing not to put on his boots gabe crossed the small chamber with one step and entered the tunnel with the next in total silence his senses keyed up he moved through the deep gloom toward the faint glow in the distance he had traveled perhaps a hundred yards when he began to hear the thrum of machinery the faint light he now realized was coming from beneath a heavy drape of some kind cautiously he eased the drape aside a few inches just beyond it a brushedsteel door with glass in the upper half separated him from a gleaming tiled brightly lit corridor along the corridor on the righthand side were five doors identical to the one before him each was identified by a letter and number painted just above the glass in addition there were name plaques in brass just below several of the panes gabe inhaled held his breath opened the door and slipped inside the steady mechanical humming was coming from the far end of the corridor otherwise there was neither sound nor movement he angled himself to be able to see through the glass of the first door labeled b below the glass a bronze plate read dr k rawdon the room gleaming beneath white fluorescent lights was clearly a lab of some sort devoid at the moment of people there were several computer terminals set alongside a complex apparatus that was a tangled arrangement of thick and thin highly polished metal tubes connected by numerous rivets and bolts and constructed around a series of lenses and eyepieces the effect was as if he were looking at the inner workings of a nuclear submarine but gabe knew better his study of the materials borrowed from jim ferendellis library had disclosed a number of images of equipment nearly identical to the apparatus in room b the instrument was he felt certain a scanning tunneling microscope capable of mapping the surface of materials atom by atom it was this instrument more than any other that was elemental in the design and construction of nanoscale systems it had become in essence the basis of the entire field of nanotechnology chapter lester howre you doing grateful for her handsoff headset alison worked the wrapper off a stick of trident and slipped it into her mouth to join the two sticks already there from the moment she spotted treat griswold heading for his car she knew this was going to be a threestick operation three at least im just passing dale city lester said is he out yet hes out just getting into his car lester listen are you sure you want to go through with this she already knew the answer everything about the man said that the greater the challenge the more he welcomed it he was slightly built with bright dark eyes that suggested he was up to something even when he was just sitting still after connecting with him by the lincoln memorial alison had treated him to some coffee from a kiosk and found a bench where they could talk the deal to move ahead was consummated after just a few minutes lester had told her not to worry about his last name only the threehundreddollar fee they had agreed uponthis after she had offered him five hundred he was a busker he saida street performer with simple tastes nothing more nothing less alison strongly sensed there was much more to the man but he admitted only to being an entertainer who did contract work from time to time for the fbi to keep his juices flowing why would i not want to go through with it he said now alison waited until two cars had inserted themselves between her and griswolds jeep and then eased into the flow lester this is not any normal man hes built like a small ox hes trained to kill and hes armed i know youre the one whos putting himself in harms way but im getting cold feet in that case lester said lets make it three twentyfive okay okay three twentyfive it is well traffics not bad were almost out of the city as soon as our man passes the exit to his place up here well know hes headed to fredericksburg you dressed appropriately just like you wanted plus a little jack daniels cologne to heighten the effect i know a good idea when i hear one this is going to work alison piece of cake lester who are you she could almost see him grinning like i told you in the park just someone who needs a little danger and excitement in his life every now and then and who owes your friend seth a favormake that a couple of favors he said you were the real deal and wouldnt be setting this up if it werent important thats all i have to know your call now were talking in that case i would think seths glowing recommendation would qualify me to learn how you did that thing with the tic tacs a congressional medal of honor wouldnt qualify you for that one hows it going with our man were coming to the exit hed be taking to his house up here and and hes driven past it were on my friend okay i have the fredericksburg street map spread out right here im going to find a safe place to leave this jalopy of mine not too far from the garage then ill walk over there and practice looking like im picking the lock until he gets there the righthand door hes not as likely to take you apart for trying to open that one rather than the one with the porsche behind it just dont get busted by any of the local police ill call and let you know when hes getting off of ninetyfive good enough but then im going to leave my cell phone under the seat you just relax and have a tic tac despite the gum alisons mouth seemed dry as she followed the jeep from three carlengths behind traffic was perfectnot too dense not too light as they approached the dumfries exit griswold suddenly broke with the pattern alison had anticipated he would be following at the last possible moment he whipped the jeep to the right and down the exit ramp she could almost see him scanning the rearview mirror for any sudden movement from any of the cars behind him if she duplicated his move she would be giving herself away helpless she tapped the brake once and continued down the highway as she dialed lesters number to warn him something was wrong and they should consider backing off and trying another time there was no answer with a dreadful sinking in her gut she accelerated and pulled out into the passing lane chapter treat griswold had no idea why he suddenly turned off at the dumfries exit except that he had been feeling edgy since an unknown exoticlooking woman with light copper skin had struck up a conversation with constanza and beatriz in the manicure parlor they had strict instructions to avoid prolonged conversations with anyone and to report any unusual contacts to him this they had done he swung onto the exit ramp too rapidly and felt the jeeps center of gravity lurch to the right but even though the years had been somewhat unkind when it came to the muffin top overlapping his belt his coolness in crisis and his reflexes were as sharp as ever there was no rollover and from all he could tell through the rearview mirror there was no one following him either he was a little paranoid he told himself thats all just a little paranoid not that he didnt have every reason to be whoever had tailed him last yeara hell of a thorough private eye he guessed or maybe someone from one of the other agencieshad mapped out his secret richmond life in agonizing detail complete with photos and video the night the phone rang for him at the beechtree road house the man on the other end had his ducks in an absolutely perfect row there was to be no debate no arguing no denying no protesting the voice said griswold was to go along with what was being demanded of him or he would be finishedexposed suspended from his job in the secret service and in all likelihood prosecuted on the other hand if he did as he was told there would be more than enough cash to ensure that in a few years when beatriz had grown old and tiresome he would have the resources to recruit and develop her replacement griswold maneuvered the jeep through back roads he knew well and rejoined i at garrisonville a little paranoid that was all the lab had promised him a report on the prints retrieved from the marooned on a desert isle nailpolish bottle as soon as today suzanne child care fredericksburg that was the information he had to work with he had already begun a discreet inquiry into the woman but as yet none of his sources had come through with anyone who fit the description they would though he assured himself if she was for real they would in all likelihood though he was making mountains out of molehills nothing more than that griswold settled back and relaxed with vivid images of what his evening with beatriz held in store she was a quick learner and easy as hell to program with the use of selected drugs cia brainwashing techniques and of course constanza another six months and the girl would be providing him with the most sensual devoted custommade companionship imaginable in fact in many ways she already was a final glance in the mirrors suggested nothing out of the ordinary griswold slipped in a grateful dead cd and dialed up truckin his alltime favorite cut by the time the song was done he was nearing the garage he licked his lips at the prospect of getting behind the wheel of the porsche again the jeep was serviceable and predictable but the porsche was well beatriz he turned onto lunt street and immediately spotted a man with a pry bar trying to open the lock on the empty righthand side of his garage the man not impressively built looked like a derelict with sneakers shabby pants a worn tan windbreaker and a nondescript blue baseball cap over the years the government had treated griswold to a variety of courses and refresher courses in defensive and offensive driving most given in conjunction with firearms training at a reconditioned racetrack in rural virginia informally referred to as crash and bang he had practiced the maneuver he reflexively chose a dozen times and accelerated into it without hesitation engine roaring he barreled directly toward the man who stood as if transfixed staring wideeyed at the fastapproaching grille at the last possible moment griswold slammed on the brake and spun the steering wheel hard to the right if he handled the maneuver correctly the rear end of the jeep would spin around and the thief would be virtually pinned to the garage door if he missed even a little the mans lower body and the heavy wooden door would become one the spin was perfect tires screeching and smoking the cherokee spun just over degrees tapping gently to a stop against the garage and cutting off the derelict from any escape except to his left that route vanished before the man could react as griswold pistol in hand leapt from the jeep raced around to where the grimy intruder still stood grabbed him by the front of the jacket and slammed him against the garage door the pry bar clattered to the pavement the look in the mans eyes was unmistakable panic he smelled densely and unpleasantly of alcohol and hard times pplease dont hurt me what in the fuck are you doing everything all right a womans voice called from somewhere down the street do you want me to call the police i saw everything no griswold snapped over his shoulder i can handle this well i i was just lookin for somethin i could sell the man managed his speech thick and clumsy these are hard times you know griswold jammed the barrel of his pistol up under the intruders ribs you lying to me you lie to me and i swear ill blow you away whyd you pick this place i i couldnt get into the one over there i was just workin the street honest mister i was just workin the street at that instant griswolds cell phone began ringing with his gun still pressed firmly against the mans gut griswold released the windbreaker checked the caller id and set the phone against his ear griswold here griz its harper at the lab i think weve found a match for those prints on the nailpolish bottle can you hold on for a minute sure but hurry up i think youre going to want to hear this just hang on griswold turned his attention back to the thief who now was beginning to cry pplease im living on the fucking street im sorry im really sorry it wont happen a if i see you around here again youre dead got that dead griswold stepped back opening a way out for the man tentatively the derelict moved forward a few steps then in an awkward stumbling gait he headed down the street waiting until he was around the corner before cracking a smile okay griswold said again pressing the phone to his ear what gives what gives the crime lab specialist said is that the prints match a fed a what a fed in fact if im not mistaken shes secret service just like you chapter astonished and bewildered by what he had discovered gabe stood beside the recessed doorway to lab b willing his pulse to slow and his sense of what was smart to take over get back to the house get back and regroup he was alone in the brightly lit corridor of an underground laboratory that had at least one tunneling scanning microscopethe pricey highly technical sine qua non centerpiece of nanotechnology research the facility carved into the foothills of the blue ridge mountains not far from the shenandoah valley was reached from one direction through a littleused hidden entrance in the guest wing of lily sextons opulent country home there had to be one or more other entrances as well but how far they were from this one was anybodys guess go back two things were all too clear at this point the brilliant elegant beguiling ms sexton had far more than a passing interest in nanotechnologyone of the sciences she was slated to try to place under government control should she become the countrys first secretary of science and technology in addition she quite probably had more than the passing acquaintance she claimed to have had with dr jim ferendelli gabe was equidistant between the door back to lily sextons house and the next doorway on the corridor which he could see was b his best approach would be to head back and as soon as possible check some real estate ledgers and maps involving the area but the part of him that had always caused trouble was urging him onat least to the next room this is dumb and risky he warned himself as he inched along the wall toward b risky and dumb he felt the adrenaline rush that had long ago stopped being a significant part of his life but had led him to any number of dangerous decisions along the way the last thing he needed just seven hours before he was scheduled to meet ferendelli was to get caught down here he moved ahead several more feet the recessed b doorway was identical in every respect to bbrushed steel and hightech with thick glass filling the top half he peered into the brightly lit room which was another deserted lab featuring another research apparatus he recognized from his studies of nanotechnologya scanning electron microscope the sem was capable of creating remarkably welldefined images of invisibly tiny nanotubes and fullerenes by bombarding them with a stream of electrons the brass plaque beneath the glass read simply electron microscopy no nameplate gabe speculated that dr k rawdon of the tunneling microscope lab was probably the head of this unit as well distracted gabe was a step slower than he might have been in reacting to the voices and footsteps echoing down the hallway from someplace ahead and to the right he held his breath and flattened himself within the recessed doorway of b just as two men in security guard uniforms emerged from a corridor chatting and laughing they each wore sidearms did you understand a word they were saying in there one asked no but thats why theyre eggheads and earning the big bucks and we arent i did love the stuff dr rosenberg was showing though real living brains without bodies could you believe that i heard he was keeping them in his lab on a wing but thats the first time i actually saw them yeah i wonder what theyre thinking maybe something like gosh its dark in here yeah and hey i cant hear a damn thing either where in the hell is everybody both men laughed roundly if either of them had turned to his left he would have been looking directly at gabe who was just thirty feet away and unable to conceal himself fully in the recessed doorway instead they turned to their right away from him and exited corridor b through a pair of swinging steel doors gabes desperate need for answers again began doing battle with his common sense the silence that followed the guards departure was not complete gabe could still hear the low machinelike hum and also some voices real living brains without bodies fascinating there was no way he could retreat now without trying to get even a little more information his common sense had been routed just a little more information just a little more hanging on pegs near the scanning electron microscope were two kneelength lab coats gabe tested the knob to the room and the heavy door swung open seconds later he emerged wearing one of the white coats with his boots back at the beginning of the tunnel his dark socks protruded from beneath his jeans looking rather foolish but at the same time making it easier to move silently up the corridor still it seemed as if anyone within earshot would be able to hear his heart slamming against the inside of his chest room b fiefdom of a dr p wilansky was another empty lab filled with sophisticated equipment there was a branching corridor ahead and to the rightthe hallway from which the guards had come the low machine hum was more pronounced as was a mans voice loud enough now to make out some words note brain stained immunofluorescence gabe inched around the corner and peered down the corridor at the end were two more doors identical to the others the right one was closed and the left one open pressed against the wall every muscle tensed he moved ahead if someone came through the doors behind him now there would be no retreat and in all likelihood no meeting with ferendelli still he had to see this slide is a photo taken two months after the subjects were dosed with ten micrograms of fullerenes coated with antibodies specifically coded to hypothalamus neuroprotein administration in this subject was oral but the results for intravenous and aerosolized fullerene administration were virtually the same as you can see there has been virtually no change in the location and concentration of immunofluorescence even after thirty days when these little fellows attach they stay pretty well attached although there is a very gradual leeching out gabe thought the line about the little fellows and the way rosenberg delivered it might have engendered at least a chuckle or two but the assemblage remained stonily silent five more feet gabe was just a few steps from the closed door now through the glass he could see seven whitecoated scientistsfive men and two womentheir backs to him standing shoulder to shoulder at the far end of a carpeted room that was about a twentyfivefoot squareprobably a conference room with the chairs removed turn around and leave leave while you have the chance a slide was being projected on a screen before the small gathering from what gabe could see the image was a cross section of brain with the jade green glow of an immunofluorescent marker dye scattered over an area that apparently was the hypothalamus at his very sharpest in neuroanatomy which would have been a few minutes after finishing the course in med school he could have easily identified the structures in the brain slice now though those days were long past and he would have to take dr rosenbergs word a grainy slide with fluorescent marker was hardly the real living brains without bodies that the security guards had talked about gabe inched closer at that moment as if on cue one of the scientists at the center of the line stepped back turned to her left and coughed deeply several times through the opening she had created gabe saw three large glass cylinders four feet high and a foot in diameter they were filled to near the top with a translucent golden liquidserum or some other form of nutrient he guessedwhich was being aerated by a bubbler built into the base the source of the mechanical hum a large number of monitoring wires snaked over the lips of each cylinder connecting outside them with elaborate monitoring equipment at least one of which was an eegan electroencephalogramthat was showing continuous brainwave activity the other ends of the wires were implanted in brainsone in each cylinder suspended by some sort of transparent lucite frame each brain included not only the cerebrum and cerebellum but also the brain stem and eight inches of spinal cord gosh its dark in here indeed functioning metabolizing brains living thinking brains they could have been human but gabes kneejerk assessment was that if they were they werent the brains of fully grown humans before he could further assess their nature or any other aspect of the macabre setup the woman stopped coughing and stepped back into her slot in the chorus line of whitecoated scientists now go this time he began a slow measured retreat back to the b corridor and out of the laboratory there would be time to sort out what he had just seen and heard but for now his focus had to be on getting out of the lab and back to dc his attention still fixed on the conference room doorway gabe moved backward checking over his shoulder with every step anticipating the return of the security guards instead the danger came from the room itself with little more than a brief perfunctory round of applause the scientists turned and without much conversation filed out through the already open door and directly toward where he was standing not more than twentyfive feet away gabe had at best a few seconds to react his instinct was simply to turn and run but even if he made it back down the tunnel to lily sextons there was a good chance the armed security guards would catch up to him before he had gone too far if he did manage to get away there were bound to be repercussions when lily learned what he had done still fleeing seemed like his only option and he was set to do that when he flashed on his first cellmate at mci hagerstown danny james a canny jewel thief who had entered a mansion during a lavish party wearing a tuxedo marched up to the master bedroom located the family safe behind a mirror cracked it pocketed what jewels the hostess wasnt wearing and then stayed for a round of hors doeuvres before strolling out to his car he would have made an absolutely clean escape had he not taken the jewels from his pocket and set them on the passenger seat to admire only moments before being accidentally rearended by a police cruiser everyone with even half a life is always wrapped up in his own business james said one evening after final lockdown the trick is to be bold and to look like you know what youre doing so they can continue to think about their two favorite topicsthemselves and their work the next day dressed as a garbageman and gabe assumed acting like a garbageman james managed to ride a waste disposal truck out of the prison and into the sunset when gabe was released at the end of his year to the best of his knowledge danny james had still not been caught the trick is to be bold and look like you know what youre doing almost instinctively ignoring his stocking feet gabe stopped preparing to run instead he strode forward toward the first of the group a gangling stoopedshouldered professor with thick glasses and an unruly thatch of pure white hair that looked like the product of an electric shock you all done in there with dr rosenberg gabe asked cheerfully the man perhaps sixty glanced at him momentarily mumbled something about the session taking far too long and walked past him followed lemminglike by the others it was not at all clear if he or any of the rest noticed that the man threatening to intrude on their thoughts and their concerns about the runover session was wearing no shoes and had no identification badge hanging from his neck it was all gabe could do to keep from continuing his spontaneous performance by marching into the conference room to question dr rosenberg about his research and whether the brains were in fact human but it seemed unlikely that any of the security team would be as selfabsorbed as the scientists or as accepting that anyone in a lab coat had to be one of the good guys shoes or no shoes the extensive underground laboratory devoted at least in part to nanotechnology research and to neurobiology made no sense yet but certainly it had to be connected to the books he had taken from jim ferendellis library for days questions had been piling up like autumn leaves now in just a few hours there would finally be answersprovided of course that he could get out cautiously he made his way to corridor b and then to the swinging door back to lily pad stables as he passed laboratory b he could see dr k rawdon hunched over the oculars of the scanning tunneling microscope on the wall above the scientist was an ornately painted sign in a simple black lacquer frame which gabe had missed on his first pass by the lab think small the sign read in lowercase letters think small chapter this is the pharmacist your name alison asked mccarthy duncan mccarthy alison checked the list of qualified pharmacists pasted innocuously in the back of the white house clinic patient ledger mccarthys name was there please fill the full alupent inhaler prescription thats on file for alexander may may was the code name for a prescription that was going to the white house and full meant seven identical inhalers the name of the driver who will be picking it up cromartie alison spelled the name alison cromartie ill present my id when i come time tonight no no wait tomorrow ill stop by the hospital to pick it up tomorrow morning very well the pharmacist said ill be here alison set down the receiver on the examining room phone and entered the doctors officegabes office it was nearing seven and there was no sign of him she wished that somewhere along the line she had thought to get his cell phone number there was much for them to talk about still it might have been for the best that she hadnt called him yet she had time now to think over how much she wanted to discloseto him or to head of internal affairs mark fuller she had evidence that treat griswold was probably involved in a perversion involving young girlsor at least one particular young girl that in itself made him an easy mark for extortion in addition she had hard evidence that griswold had broken with unwritten white house law by repeatedly handling the presidents medicationsspecifically his inhaler whether or not there was a connection between the inhaler and any psychiatric problems the president might be having would depend on what a sophisticated analysis of the contents revealed what she had at this point might have been enough to present to fuller but there was no way she was going to put her career on the line and go up against the most powerful and respected agent in the secret service without more than indirect evidence and speculation she needed proof of his relationship to the girls on beechtree road and she needed a positive analysis of the contents of the inhaler he had repeatedly given the president to use lester had done his job well although according to him his life may have been spared by a fortuitous call on griswolds cell phone if she was to move at all against the presidents numberone secret service man she needed absolute proof of wrongdoing los angeles had taught her that having unsubstantiated knowledge good intentions and the willingness to engage in a she saidhe said confrontation simply wasnt enough to blow the whistle on anyone with clout her plan was to have the contents of several alupent inhalers analyzed including the one lester had taken from griswold but there was no way she could risk going through mark fuller or anyone else connected with the secret service to do so it seemed fuller had done a decent job of protecting her identity until now but despite what he had told her it was hard to believe no one except fuller knew that she had been sent into the white house undercover the service was very closely knit and with a man of griswolds stature involved sooner rather than later there were bound to be leaks lester had guarded his words closely when they first spoke if he was actual fbi would she be giving him up by asking him to come forward and speak to fuller using an fbi operative to trap a secret service agent wasnt going to sit well no matter what was there any way around doing that at the moment the inhaler was wedged beneath the seat of her car was there any lab outside of the government with sophisticated analytical capabilities that she could trust for both reliability and discretion the answer was most certainly yes but she had no idea how to locate such a lab or how to approach the people working there the internet she wondered possibly she could probably get some idea of the reliability of a place from a phone call to whoever was in charge but with so much at stake and only one sample she wanted to know that whatever place she chose was the best a better idea would be gabe it was time she trusted someone and he was the obvious choice she had already blown her cover to him sharing her concerns about griswold would probably be safe and with luck gabe would have had experience in his practice with just the sort of blood chemistry lab she needed she took an envelope and a sheet of gabes stationery from the desk important stuff to talk about big fella please call me anytime day or night a she added her home and cell numbers sealed it wrote his name and title on the envelope and set it carefully on the corner of his desk blotter at that moment she heard the door to the reception area softly open and close gabe she called out nothing alison checked the placement of the envelope one more time and took several steps toward the outer room through the doorway the room looked empty had she really heard something she felt her pulse accelerate gabe is somebody out there she stepped through the office doorway into the reception area directly across from her the door to the outside corridor was closed at that instant she sensed movement from her right she started to turn but far too late a thick powerful arm locked across her throat tightening with dizzying force cutting off her breathing and making it impossible to scream a cloth saturated with some sort of liquid was pressed over her mouth the arm across her neck loosened just enough for her to inhale griswold she tried to say thrashing against his cinderblock body and ineffectually pounding backward at him with her fists and feet griswold no what do you think of this stuff cromartie huh griswold asked in a coarse whisper stateoftheart liquid inhaled anesthesiatasteless odorless rapid onset long acting invented by our own people just for us field operatives if you could get it over a water buffalos mouth and nose hed be on the ground in half a minute you dont know about it oh sorry i guess they dont tell snitch nurses just the real agents were kept up on every new drug as youll see quickly alisons terror gave way to impotence and then to a strange detachment she tried to hold her breath to continue kicking backward against griswolds shin she drove her elbows against his barrel chest she attempted to bite the hand that was forcing the cloth even tighter against her mouth crushing her lips against her teeth waves of dizziness and nausea made it impossible to continue struggling she was going to throw up throw up and aspirate and choke to death she was the fear helplessness and intense nausea gave way to a giddy lightheadedness and ennui then moments later to blackness the last things she heard from the lips beside her ear were griswolds grunting breathing and guttural speech they gave you up alison all i had to do was make one phone call and they gave you up hows that for respect chapter so enter the hero the president of the united states wearing a white terrycloth robe and matching flipflops greeted gabe in the living room of the white house residence even though it was only ten in the evening two or three hours before stoddards bedtime the weariness enveloping his eyes seemed even more pronounced than usual hero gabe asked evon mayo lily sextons assistant called and told us what happened she said the doctors told her your treatment in the woods might well have saved lilys life apparently in addition to her broken shoulder she punctured a lung and was in danger of bleeding to death there really wasnt that much i could do out there but i make it a policy never to dissuade people from thinking im a hero for some reason i dont think i believe either part of that statement stoddard said i stayed at fauquier hospital in warrenton with her until they had inserted a chest tube given her a unit of blood and she was stabilized for a small placeor even a big place for that matterthat hospitals really quite terrific reminds me of ours back home if you could send out a presidential something or other to them i know theyd appreciate it done the president said without even writing a memo and gabe had no doubt it would be good hospital or not he said lily wants university people to take care of her shoulder and they have a helipad right next to the er so tomorrow morning if shes ready to travel shell be flown to georgetown so what happened out there lilys a hell of an experienced rider ive been out on those trails with her myself and shes come riding with me and carol from the stables near camp david a couple of times as well makes me look like a tenderfoot gabe had been preparing for this moment throughout the drive from warrenton back to the capital it was time drew learned some of what was swirling around him not all yet but some a man shot at us from the woods a rifle black ski mask black clothes wasnt much of a marksmancertainly not by wyoming standards from the distance separating us and him he should have at least hit one of the horses but he hit nothing except a tree trunk eight or so feet from us lilys horse reared and threw her i suppose mine was already wornout from lugging me up the trail he just stayed put black ski mask black clothes out there in the woods where you two just happened to be doesnt sound like a whacko to me i dont think he was so was he trying to kill lily me gabe said simply stoddards look of surprise was fleeting you sounded sure it was a he he said i had the feeling you had more to tell me gabe paused as he prepared to pull his finger from the dike to say his onetime roommate had more than enough on his plate was a gross understatement but now it was time to pour on a little more this is the second time since i arrived here that someone has tried to kill me gabe said finally i think they were the same guy eyes narrowed stoddard listened impassively as gabe reviewed the botched shooting on g street he saved his questions until gabe was done you said this man would have killed you if you hadnt been rearended at that exact moment thats correct assuming its the same man after watching him with a rifle i dont think hes any kind of a professional hit man but even he couldnt have missed me from five feet and the collision was a fortuitous accident stoddard as usual was right on top of things gabe was prepared for the question first alison then the call from ferendelli and finally the bizarre finding off the lower level of lily sextons home he was beginning to buckle under the weight of the secrets he was keeping from the man who had brought him to washington during the ride back from the hospital in warrenton he had worked out what he was going to share with the president and where he was going to draw the lineat least until he had more information the person who banged into me and probably saved my life was following me purposefully he said tailing me to hurt you no i think to protect me do you want to tell me who that was i dont drew i sort of promised to think carefully before i told anyone but im prepared to now again gabe could see stoddards intellect rapidly processing the information as it had been presented so far whoever this is was tailing you from the white house at two in the morning yes secret service gabe wasnt surprised at how quickly the president put things together this was a man who after the accident at fairhaven had gone from being a middleofthepack student at annapolis to first in his class to a governorship and finally to the presidency working undercover gabe replied to what end at whose order i can answer the second question but im not so certain about the first the head of internal affairs sent the agent in i think the goal was to learn how much truth there was to to the rumors that i was going nuts stoddard said yes sir plus maybe to search for information that might shed some light on what happened to jim ferendelli again gabe could almost feel the president working through the facts reasoning out the possibilities its that woman isnt it he said suddenly that nurse my pal mike posnick in california called me about asking me to set her up in the secret service alison cromartie yes mr president it is and she was in baltimore with us right i thought i knew her from someplace else id only met her once maybe a couple of years ago interesting looking i have to agree stoddard glanced over at gabe with something of a glint he grinned momentarily then just as quickly his expression darkened theyre closing in gabe he said like goddamn hyenas smelling the rot theyre closing in he took a computer printout from the floor next to him and passed it over it was a nationally syndicated column from the montgomery mirror based on the latest gallup poll numbers which indicated a drop in the democrats lead from to percentthe smallest gap since shortly after the republican convention where theres schmuck theres fire question what chief executive risked his health and the leadership of this country in a grandstand play at a baltimore meeting of bigbucks liberal supporters you see the chief executive in question was in the midst of an asthma attack severe enough to cause him to break off his speech in the middle and we all know how severe that must have been was it the behavior of a rational man to return to the podium after just a few minutes of treatment i think not perhaps the rumors swirling about the nations capital have some truth to themmaybe a lot of truth the rumors are telling us that a good deal of the time the man in the golden chair with the golden boy looks and the liberal suckgoldfromtheworkingman philosophy is showing an irrationality that can only be called nixonesque thats right thats right tricky dick was a republican and here i am bashing him in a way most foulby lumping him in with he who should not be named well crazy is nondenominational and apolitical and if our chief executive the man with his pointer finger on the big button is losing it i dont care what party he is so prez i say be afraid of these latest poll numbers be very afraid the american public is getting concerned about what i have known all alongnamely that you are not all there youre not the first chief exec to try and keep big secrets from us lawabiding wage earners and you undoubtedly wont be the last i suspect that by the time your poll numbers and brad dunleavys cross for the final time well know the truth gabe set the printout down and exhaled audibly hyenas is the word he said weve got to get to the bottom of this before it blows up in our face im working on it drew i really am and i need another day then well talk have you heard from your psychologist friend gabe stiffened at the question among the many things he had decided to keep from drew at least for the time being was the attack on blackthorn at the airport hotel and especially the missing briefcase hopefully as blackthorn had promised there was no accessible information in there i havent spoken to him since he returned to tyler gabe said but his initial impression was that somehow a toxic chemical was intermittently entering your body like poison not necessarily there are other explanations drew youre the boss here but i really would rather get some more data before telling you what ive been able to learn youre the doc but make it quick gabe you read that column i understand believe me i do just tell me a couple of things do you think the guy who tried to kill you killed jim tomorrow gabe had decided tomorrow after he and ferendelli had spoken he would bring drew up to speed on the situation for the moment as ferendelli had requested he would tell no one its possible he said but if he was as inept at jims assassination as he was with mine theres a good chance jims still alive and the woman alison im hoping to speak to her tonight or tomorrow as far as i know she hasnt uncovered anything but shes sharp i think very sharp you falling for her too early to tell stoddards expression grew steely just remember who youre working for okay i have to know that i come first you come first my friend gabe said now i have a question go ahead is there anything of importance that youre holding back from me anything at all stoddard momentarily looked at him somewhat queerly then shook his head whats that all about he asked kyle blackthorn told me he has like a sixth sense about peoplewhether theyre being totally on the level or not he wondered if you might be holding something back or maybe not telling the whole truth about something i mean when we first talked in wyoming you did manage to hold something rather big from me again the flicker of that odd look well not this time stoddard said if i know something of any importance youll know it now keep me posted and if you need resources that are at my disposal just say the word and theyll be at yours the closer to the vest we play this the better gabe replied ill see you tomorrow then the friends stood and shook hands tomorrow gabe said before heading to the office to prepare for his rendezvous with ferendelli on the ride down in the small elevator he acknowledged two things one was that it was very unlikely that he had any heightened or additional senses as did blackthorn but the other was that almost certainly despite stoddards protestation to the contrary the president was either holding something back from him or lying outright chapter important stuff to talk about big fella please call me anytime day or night a there was something wrong with alisons note propped up against his desk lamp gabe dialed her home and cell phone numbers again nothing how long ago had she been in the clinic what sort of important stuff did she mean big fella made it sound as if she was enthused and in a good space why couldnt he reach her now it was nearing eleven fifteen an hour and fortyfive minutes before hopefully the mystery of jim ferendellis disappearance and his relationship to lily sexton would be unraveled for gabe between the events earlier in the day at lily pad stables and now his strong feeling that the president was either lying to him or holding something back this had already been a hell of a trying day now alison wasnt answering either of her phones where in the hell was she at this time of night as often happened in stressful situations gabes temples were beginning to throbone howitzer shell burst for each heartbeat what possible sanguine explanation could there be for alison leaving the note she did then not being available on her home phone or cell it had to be something simple like a low battery or other malfunction of her damn phone back in wyoming he carried a cell phone because every doc on the hospital staff was expected to but he didnt trust themnot in tyler and not here that had to be it he tried to convince himselfher cell phone his jaws clenched against the frustration and concern without any rummaging in his desk drawer that he was aware of suddenly the vial of various pills was in his hand it was like a number of patients with weight problems had told him over the yearsthe sad recurrent tale of finding themselves standing in front of the open refrigerator and having absolutely no recollection of how they got there what in the hell was he a supposedly sober alcoholic doing with pills in his hand every time the going got difficult for him he needed to face the fact that just as some people were functional active alcoholics managing to hold down a job and maybe keep a marriage going despite their drinking he was functioning despite the smoldering depression that had stunted his spirit for decades since the nightmare of fairhaven and the inestimable horror of having taken the lives of a woman and her unborn child one valium five milligrams would take the edge off it wasnt really that much the manufacturer made a damn ten milligram he dialed both of alisons numbers for a third time leaving a concerned message with each it was right there beside where he was sitting that she had tied his tieright there where she had stood on her tiptoes kissed him softly and pleaded to let there be time for them now she was missing and he was preparing to respond to the crisis by taking yet another pill she deserved better she deserved better and so did he he took his secret stash into the bathroom poured the pills into the toilet and flushed them away darkness duct tape and rats for some time after she regained consciousness all alison was aware of was the duct tape pulled tightly across her mouth and binding her wrists elbows ankles and legs to some sort of heavy chair then as the fog lifted from her senses she became aware of the feet scurrying from one side of the space she was in to another and at least twice she felt certain brushing against her with time her vision was able to make use of a small amount of light slipping beneath a door she was in a cluttered rooma storeroom of some kind it seemed the air which she had to work to draw in through her nose into her lungs was cool and slightly musty across from her she could discern the distinctive outline of a harp then of a hat rack and finally behind them a large sign that read happy birthday mr president she was still in the white housea prisoner in a storage room in the basement or even the subbasement if there was one held there by the numberone guardian of the president being uncomfortably bound and having to strain for each breath were distracting enough to keep her from being as frightened as she might have been even with the rats she should have written more in the note to gabe she chastised herself nowat least mentioned that there were problems with treat griswold she had been too paranoid to do so one by one she tested her restraints no chance even the tape over her mouth had been wrapped tightly around her head and then reinforced in front with something firm to keep her from biting through at the moment only two things were clearshe was absolutely helpless and she wasnt dead she wondered how griswold could have caught on to her the answer was elusive what was clear though was that unless griswold was satisfied that she had told him everything she knew and why she had been prying into his life in all likelihood she was going to get a lesson as to how much pain she could endure would griswold risk holding her here in the white house however unlikely it had to be unpredictable when someone might happen to need something from this room there was a light outside the door that meant her prison wasnt all that isolated an hour or so later her questions were answered with a soft click the door opened flooding the room with light from a concrete corridor outside treat griswold slipped inside flicked on the single bare overhead bulb and eased the door closed behind him time to hit the road lady he rasped his lips beside her ear but first a little something to keep you from getting carsick without another word he stepped around behind her buried a needle to the hilt at the base of her neck and injected the contents of a syringe into her muscle after just a minute the room began to spin viciously chapter on the way into dc from the hospital in warrenton gabe had taken a half an hour detour and driven into anacostia for a second time then across the benning street bridge once a soughtafter middleclass section of the city according to sources on google and of course wikipedia anacostia began its evolution from percent white to over percent black in the mids even though parts of the area had seen much better days certain blocks still featured neatly maintained homes and yards and a distinct turnofthetwentiethcentury charm dr john torrence a black major in the army and part of the white house medical team had grown up in anacostia and still had family there white or black he told gabe walking around anacostia after midnight isnt something id recommend doing on a regular basis but if for any reason i absolutely had to i would like most inner cities there are some gangs and drug crazies but mostly there are very good people there the evening was moonless and unseasonably cool on his earlier reconnaissance gabe had identified a place to park that was as close as possible to the area beneath the benning street bridge he arrived at the spot twenty minutes before one it was a narrow street running alongside the anacostia reservation a broad field that just a few hours ago was alive with picnickers softball and touch football games soaring kites and frisbees the lighting around the park was far from optimal and may have been at least one of the reasons ferendelli chose the place to meet ten minutes gabe lowered the window of the buick there was almost no one about twice he heard voices and once he saw the shadows of three or four peopleboys he thoughtmaking their way across the field up on the bridge itself there was a steady rumble of traffic as his eyes adjusted he could easily make out the river a tributary of the potomac and the centerpiece for what was to be a rejuvenation of this part of the city just a mile or so to the south east capitol street crossed the river its westbound lanes headed into capitol hill the mall and of course the white house just a mile gabe managed a thin smile at the irony a meeting was about to take place in these hardscrabble surroundings that could affect the world as much as any that had been held in those staid and hoary buildings it wouldnt be long now for a time the attack on blackthorn nagged at him how could the killer have known where blackthorn was staying at the psychologists urging gabe had asked treat griswold to have his condo checked over for listening devices reportedly none had been found two minutes the field remained deserted there was no movement that gabe could discern anywhere underneath the bridge he wondered what he would do if ferendelli failed to show perhaps he would pay a visit to lily sexton and offer to set her broken shoulder without anesthesia should she hold out on him anymore it seemed as if ferendelli had carefully chosen the photograph in the medical office to ensure that gabe would know with certainty that the meeting was with him still gabe was regrettably learning not to trust anything or anybody when it came to the president careful to keep the interior light from going on and wondering if he had been unwise not to bring along a blunt weapon of some sort gabe locked the buick left it and headed across the field toward the blackness beneath the bridge overhead the whoosh of passing cars grew louder as he approached headlights flashed by from his left the scent of the river grew stronger as he neared the bridge he suddenly found himself picturing the desert and condor at a full gallop bearing him effortlessly across the parched ground toward a burnt orange setting sun soon he thought soon it will be over the field itself seemed to be in excellent shape and reasonably free of debris but the underside of the benning street bridge smelled of stale beer river muck and urine broken glass crunched beneath his boots gabe stepped into the dense shadow just under the edge of the bridge then he turned toward the field and waited for the man he had succeeded in the white housethe renaissance man who many felt was dead i have a gun a soft cultured voice said from behind him lift your hands where i can see them dont turn around whats your name singleton dr gabe singleton how do you get up to the residence from the office the elevator across the hall could you have been followed i didnt see anyone but i didnt take any special evasive precautions either you should have im sorry walk over there to that support keep your hands up gabe did as he was ordered turn around slowly with your hands up again gabe did as he was asked the gaunt unshaven man confronting him carried no gun instead he extended his bony hand and gripped gabes with surprising force his hair was unkempt and at that moment he looked considerably older than fiftysixthe age gabe had read in his personnel file what gabe could discern of his expression was grim he was jittery and badly in need of a shower his tension was nearly palpable i cant tell you how relieved i am to find that you are alive dr ferendelli he said we are in a crisis of immense proportions dr singleton our president is under attack his life is in danger every day then his psychiatric breaks are if by psychiatric you mean a disease of some sorta spontaneous malfunction in his brainhis problems are not psychiatric at all but even through the gloom gabe could see the intensity glowing in ferendellis eyes president stoddard is not insane ferendelli said hes being poisoned dosed with a psychoactive drugno no make that a number of psychoactive drugs i wondered about that when i witnessed one of his episodes gabe said so i drew some blood for analysis but the tubes were stolen from the refrigerator in our office stolen do you know by whom no do you i have some ideas dr ferendellijimare you all right right now i mean are you ill i have not slept for more than two hours at a time in weeks im in as much danger as the president is they could kill me just as they could kill him with with the push of a button ferendelli looked furtively about are you sure you werent followed something about the question was bothersome to gabe but he could not discern precisely what no im not sure that i wasnt followed he said i told you that listen i have a car right over there let me take you to a hospital or or to my place just talk to me ferendelli said talk to me and listen to me theyve poisoned me doctor just like the president theyve poisoned me i havent come in because i dont know precisely who they are and i havent run because i owe it to my president and the country not to is your daughter all right yes shes fine as far as i know when all of this began to happen i feared they might use her to get at me so i had her go away to stay with friends so long as she stays where she is no one will find her now please listen to me ill listen dr ferendelli but try to stay focused whore they is one of them lily sexton mention of the womans name hit ferendelli like a sucker punch for some time he said nothing when he finally did speak there was a noticeable tremor in his voice i pray sir that you have had no contact with that woman ill tell you of my connection with her when you finish please jim please from the beginning oh this is bad ferendelli said very bad youve seen her havent youbeen with her i have but please compose yourself and tell me whats been going on inventor physician artist intellectual the renaissance man gabe had heard so much about was a nervous shell as if reading gabes thoughts ferendelli took a calming breath i have a friend named wysocki he said zeke wysocki hes an analytical chemist and owns a small lab just outside of durham hes a loner with not one whit of social skills but he is a wizard of a chemist and a hell of a poker player thats how we metplaying poker at a small private game he liked to talk about some of the contract work cases he did for the police and the fbicases that no regular labs could handle so on a lark when the analysis of the presidents blood came back negative i sent one of the split samples i had kept to wysocki he found something a number of things actually i drew bloods after two of the presidents attacks there were traces of several different hallucinogens in each sample only not the same ones go on jim youre doing great ferendelli was again becoming jittery he pulled a small bottle of spring water from his jacket pocket and managed a shaky prolonged swallow gabe wondered if the bottle might contain vodka but didnt ask ferendelli wasnt intoxicated just frightenedfrightened and totally spent you sure you werent followed ive been getting bad vibes about this place since you arrived gabe glanced out at the empty field i dont see how but if you want to go someplace else or maybe just drive and talk we can do that i i guess we can stay here go on jim tell me what your friend found this is all beginning to come together for me were going to get to the bottom of things i promise you we are and whatever you and the president need to be okay were going to get it for you ive got a friend in the secret service we can trust if we can find her i hope so you did the right thing to contact me jim youre safe now and i assure you you are not alone now please go on im not alone ferendelli said marginally more calm i like the sound of that a block away a nondescript white van lights off rolled down the street the antenna on its roof rotating slowly chapter alison knew the pain was coming but was helpless to stop it she lay on her back her gaze transfixed on the syringe in treat griswolds hand in horror she watched as once again he slid the needle attached to it into the rubber port on the iv tubing i know youre not particularly fond of this stuff nurse alison griswold said but i really have to know whats going on and frankly to this point i havent been all that satisfied with your answers what i told you was everything she pleaded aware of the sudden wash of perspiration beneath her arms and across her upper lip everything please i have nothing else to tell please dont do that again she was on a creaky metal military cot with her wrists and ankles uncomfortably bound to the frame the thin sheetless mattress reeked of mold the roomclearly for storagewas brightly lit from a bare overhead bulb and was less cluttered than the one in the white house at some point she had been dressed in light blue surgical scrubs possibly taken from the clinic her clothes were neatly folded nearby with her bra and panties carefully laid on topgriswolds not so subtle reminder of her helplessness almost certainly she had decided the two of them were in the basement of the house on beechtree road in richmonddonald greenfields house this would be the third injection griswold had administered to her over what might have been two hours or two days the thought of having to endure the spasms and the pain again brought bile percolating into her throat he had told her the name of the chemical in the syringe but it was not one she recognized in fact he had mentioned that it was still somewhat experimental developed by friends of his in the cia after she was allowed to awaken from whatever anesthetic he had given her in the white house griswold listed the questions he was going to ask her and then without waiting for answers he injected what he called a quarterstrength amount of the drug into the rubber port of the tubing draining intravenous fluid into her arm in less than a minute the muscles in alisons body began to twitch then suddenly they cramped every one of them as brutal as any cramps she had ever experienced with her movement restricted there was no position she could get to that would make the spasms go away her quadriceps muscles tightened into rockhard balls her hamstrings pulled just as viciously in the opposite direction the contractions in her abdominals were especially merciless her jaw was clenched so firmly she was unable to open her mouth to scream it was possiblelikely eventhat not long after the second injection she had passed out from the unremitting pain she awoke chilled from evaporating sweat feeling as if she had been beaten with a twobyfour now griswold was about to dose her for a third time griswold treat listen dammit please listen she pleaded her speech rapid and forced i was placed in the white house because mark fuller in internal affairs wanted to know what might have happened to dr ferendelli he also asked me to see if the rumors they had heard about the presidents mental problems had any element of truth also i was to keep my eyes open and follow up on anything unusual that i encountered fuller never mentioned any secret service agent specificallycertainly not you now please dont use that stuff on me again im begging you why did you follow me i already told you you were the only one ive encountered who did anything even the slightest bit unusual carrying the inhaler against regulations exactly it may or may not be a specifically written rule but in the clinic we all know that no one except us and the president himself is supposed to handle his meds and certainly youve been around long enough to know the same thing too alison had said nothing about the pickpocket lester or about having successfully switched inhalers if griswold got even the slightest scent of that one and if there was in fact anything unusual about the inhaler he had been carrying she was in for more pain than she could possibly endure she stared up at his massive head framed by the aurora of the overhead light and at the deep fold in his truncated neck and she hated him more even than she had come to hate the surgeons in la silently she chastised herself for being too cautious and scarred from her prior experiences not to say something about the legendary agent to gabe or even to fuller himself for a time neither of them spoke griswold just stood there looking down at her with no particular emotion alison felt a glimmer of hope it seemed to her as if he might be considering her responses please she thought please please dont do it again she tried unsuccessfully to get a better read on his intentions in her life she had shown some courage and some pain tolerance but not she guessed much more than average please please dont finally griswold shook his massive head and shrugged his buffalo shoulders i dont know why nurse alison but try as i may i just cant shake the notion that youre holding out on me he lifted up the iv tubing and gazed at the rubber injection port as if it were some sort of precious delicate blossom then he sighed and quickly emptied the contents of the syringe into alisons body at the first sight of his thumb tightening on the plunger alison began to scream chapter ketamine psilocybin lsd methamphetamine dipt atropine mescaline pcp jim ferendellis chemist had found traces of eight different mindaltering drugs in the blood of president andrew stoddard eight zeke likes to say that performing analytical chemistry is similar to doing a differential diagnosis on a patient ferendelli said if you dont look for it youll never find it i totally agree with that gabe replied presumptions and assumptions are as dangerous in a physician as arrogance and ignorance well zeke took things one step further once he started getting positive results he anticipated the obvious question as to how these drugs could have gotten into the presidents blood in such minute concentrations he decided that the amounts administered would be far too small to have any neurological effect unless they were delivered to precisely the part of the brain where they were the most effective the best he could come up with was a theory summarized in several articles he gave me nanotechnology gabe said almost breathless at the way the pieces were at last dropping into place i didnt find any articles but i found your books on the subject while i was searching through your place for clues about what might have happened to you and ive been studying them im still an amateur on the subject but im a lot more knowledgeable than i was when i started for the first time ferendelli managed a smile he reached out and patted gabe approvingly on the shoulder i would bet you are an excellent physician he said i feel the same way about you initially you went to see lily sexton to learn about nanotechnology didnt you this time at least mention of the womans name didnt provoke as much agitation from what i read ferendelli said it seemed as if using molecularsize nanobots to deliver drugs directly to cancers or to specific sites in the body was still very much on the drawing boards and in the minds of futurists i went to her to see if there was something i didnt know about the status of the field i also needed to develop some sort of possible explanationa hypothesisto answer the question if the president was being dosed with microamounts of psychoactive drugs how were the chemicals being introduced into his body how were the drugs able to seek out the area of his brain where they would be most effective and perhaps most urgent and frightening how could their release be triggered on cue its not in the future gabe wanted to shout flashing back to the disembodied brains in dr rosenbergs glass cylinders and the immunofluorescent deposits on his slides its hereright now but first gabe needed to learn how his predecessorand drewhad come to be in such danger already it was clear to gabe what a hero jim ferendelli was in an incredibly short time he had accumulated an astounding amount of information in trying to save the presidency of his patient and longtime friend in the process jim had placed his own life in jeopardy at this point the man should be standing on a golden pedestal in front of congress and the american people awaiting the highest honors this country could bestow not skulking in the shadows here amid the beer bottle shards and fetid odors emaciated unkempt and fearful what happened jim gabe asked softly picturing the lovingly drawn portrait in the mans desk what happened with lily sexton when i contacted lily about picking her brain regarding nanotechnology she invited me out to her stables for a ride in fact i went out there several times it was difficult because i had to speak to lily in generalities and not mention the president in any way even though i suspected she had quickly put two and two together we both know that my only patients are the president and his family there have been a growing number of rumors over recent months regarding the state of drews mental health and lilys a very perceptive person youll get no argument from me there gabe said well she didnt have that much to add to what i already knew about the field of nanotechnology its advancing at an incredible pace and the high rollers are beginning to speculate throwing incredible sums of money at the possibilities but the field is still much more theoretical and potential than actual lily arranged for me to visit a research and manufacturing site in new jersey and to speak with several of the scientists and even two major investors manufacturing its a company that manufactures nanotubes of various diameters and lengths and several different sizes of fullerenes theres a huge demand for them right now in industries and laboratories all over the world the people in new jersey sell them by weight like bananas youre doing great jim can you go on ferendelli stepped out of the shadow of the bridge and scanned furtively through the gloom they can kill me dr singleton he said a note of shrillness returning to his voice with the push of a button they can kill me almost anytime they want and they can kill the president too anytime they want to they can kill him just like that gabe reached out and gently guided ferendelli back into the darkness who are they he asked i have some theories but they are no more than that i i continued to visit lily at her place we never saw one another in dc only at lily pad stables gabe knew what was coming next you fell in love with her didnt you he said i feel so stupid nonsense i dont know if ive ever met a woman more interesting and attractive nothing ever happened between ussexually i mean she kept encouraging me to visit her and ride with her but each time i tried to advance our relationship she alluded to being in a relationship that needed resolving before she could move on to another meanwhile i kept doing research speaking with experts and secretly running tests on drews blood i refused to believe that my relationship with lily had no future and she still wanted to see me now i know she was the one who was pumping me for information not the other way around im sorry jim gabe said im so sorry i was a fool not to see the truth long before i did my judgment and my ethics were warped by the feelings i had for her i had been so lonely since my wife passed away i gabe put his hands on the mans shoulders its okay jim you did what was best for your patient no one could ever fault you for that well finally in a lastditch effort to win her over i decided to take her into my confidence i mean she was a friend of drews and he was going to nominate her to be in his cabinet so i told her what i had learned and what i was theorizing and what i planned to do about it again ferendelli crossed to the edge of the bridge shadow and peered at the scene he had photographed so sensitively the white noise and vibrations from traffic speeding overhead were in sharp contrast with the emptiness of the field and the stillness of the river feeling the connection between them strengthening gabe moved forward and stood shoulder to shoulder with his predecessor the two of them silhouetted in the strobes of passing headlights how did she respond to that he asked ferendelli glanced over at him his fear and sorrow nearly palpable she told me i would be doing nothing of the sortthat id be doing exactly what she told me to do nothing more nothing less she said it was in the tea she served each time before we went riding now it was in melocked in place in my brain gabe felt himself go numb the tea lily had been so proud of her teaso excited when he wanted another cup what do you mean it he asked barely able to get the words out fullereneshollow nanoball molecules carrying drugs she told me her tea was laced with just enough narcotic to make me love it relax and want to drink more oh god gabe murmured almost inaudibly so thats how she got the fullerenes into my body i dont know how she did it with drew and i dont know how the fullerenes with their microdoses of drugs end up exactly where they would have the most devastating effect im afraid i can answer that one gabe said not bothering at this point to recount his experience with the scientists in lilys nanotech laboratory the fullerenes are coated with antibodies specific to neuroproteins or neurotransmittersmaybe those in the thalamus the basal ganglia and the caudate nucleus maybe other places in the brain as well the fullerenes float through the bloodstream until they encounter those specific proteins then they just latch on until some signal or other tells them to open up by breaking the chemical bonds that had kept them perfectly round but the state of the science isnt remotely close to that level of sophisticated biotechnology ferendelli said it is trust me it is jim listen do you have any idea how the fullerenes are commanded to open sound they have a transmitter of some sort that must send out a specific frequencythe signal for the fullerenes to open up perhaps the transmitters send out different frequencies for different drugs lily said that chemicals had been placed in my brain stem over time and also the presidents brain stem as well that could stop our heart or our breathing or both with just the press of a button from a transmitter like opening a garage door oror changing a television channel she actually showed one to me then she said i should just go about my business and nobody would be hurtespecially not the president but you didnt buy that once i began to sense what she wanted i couldnt believe the president wasnt going to be harmed anymore so i took off at the very least i knew what she had done i didnt think lily and her people would do anything to harm the president as long as i was on the loose and hadnt said anything to anyone about her what did she want you to do i dont know for certain but from pieces of what she said i had the feeling that at some time in the near future they were going to ask me to invoke the twentyfifth amendment and spearhead the movement to replace drew because of his mental illness oh man but why do you think bradford dunleavy could be behind this possible i suppose how about tom cooper i dont know he seems sincere enough and hes been a loyal vice president but i also know hes very ambitious and were talking about the presidency of the united states very folksy but very smart i agree a couple of days ago he came by the office and pumped me for information on drews mental health did you tell him anything no no i certainly didnt jim why did you stay around dc ive been waiting for what for youfor this meeting i dont trust anyone dr singletonanyone that is besides you explain someone close to the president is involved in this i mean someone very closecloser to him than lily i have no reason to believe drew has been having tea with hercertainly not enough to account for all the attacks he has had according to lily the chemicals have to be delivered over timemultiple doses that means somebody has been dosing drew continuously with the drugloaded fullerenes and also has been causing them to break open and deliver their payload probably on cue someone has to trigger the transmitter to do that gabe couldnt bring himself to tell the man that there was every reason to believe that like ferendelli and the president he was now a walking time bomb too at least to the extent that a couple of cups of lilys tea could deliver what people are you talking about who might be in a position to do this to drew he asked the list is an imposing one the presidents wife and children the twentyfive or so people in the kitchen the chief of staff and his office the staff secretary and her office the cabinet the military office that would be my pal ellis wright ah yes the admiral ferendelli said i hope your relationship with him is cheerier than mine no chance gabe said he clearly cant abide anyone he cant control this list of yours is getting quite long oh im just getting started there are thirty or so in the medical office and think of the dozens of housekeepers and other servantspeople who just come and go virtually unnoticed and the secret service i dont know any exact numbers for them but probably a few hundred have direct access to the president at one time or another and of all these people you just listed it only takes one it only takes one ferendelli echoed sadly and i think he or she has got to be pretty close for the transmitter to work how do you know that a man has been after mea professional hit man gabe felt a chill how do you know hes a professional he uses a silencer a week or ten days ago i stopped by my place in georgetown for some papers i hadnt been there for twenty minutes when i heard him opening the front door with a damn key probably one lily had made i managed to get out the basement and down to the potomac where i hid along the bank then just a couple of days ago he showed up at a hobo village where i was hiding while i figured out how to contact you he killed one of the guys there shot him in the face just like that again i got out before he found me later i went back the guys told me he used a transmitter i couldnt have been more than fifty or seventyfive yards away when he did but nothing happened fifty yards gabe said now consumed by a sense of foreboding jim is there anything else you can tell me about the man anything at all i only saw him in the tunnelnot in the house and its pretty gloomy down there but there was one thinghe was southern no doubt about that heavy accent georgia maybe maybe alabama im not good at those things trouble the same man had gone after both ferendelli and blackthorn instinctively gabe scanned from the river across the field to the street and back at that instant from somewhere far behind them came a soft almost inaudible crunch of glass a homing device gabe thought suddenly the killer had to have fixed some sort of homing device to his car jim he whispered urgently hes heresomewhere behind us get ready to run toward my car its way to the left near that streetlight but gabe could wait no longer he grabbed ferendelli by the arm and pulled him out into the field there they are a southern voice behind them called out loudly over there right over there chapter there they are over there right over there there were at least two of them gabe thought as he halfguided halfdragged ferendelli across the field of the anacostia river basin a homing device on the buick that had to be it that explained how the killer had found blackthorns hotel and if the shooter on the trail by lilys stables didnt directly tail him to flint hill he could have easily followed gabe using some sort of gps device gabe couldnt clear the notion from his mind of the mess he had made of things by not being more vigilant although ferendelli was just a few years older than gabe was his weeks of hiding seemed to have broken him physically his reaction time was delayed and he was gasping for air after just a few strides i see them the southern voice from behind them yelled theyre headed across the field toward you toward you gabe peered ahead to where the buick was parked coming around the rear end of the car was a man a gun in his right handor maybe gabe realized it was the ultrasonic transmitter ferendelli had told him about the transmitter that could end either or both of their lives he glanced over his shoulder just emerging from the darkness beneath the bridge was the professional killer ferendelli had told him about also holding up something in his right hand oh god gabe muttered jim lets head this way toward the river its our best chance cant come on you can youve got to ferendelli was staggering now almost deadweight grunting and lurching from side to side gabe risked another check of their pursuers both men were gaining on them he could feel himself beginning to flag and to panic a severe stitch in his right side had materialized and with every breath began slicing into him like dagger thrusts go ferendelli gasped i cant do this come on jim dammit come on they were still perhaps fifty yards from the river then what gabe asked himself what if they made it again he glanced back there was still some distance between them and each man but the one coming from the bridge the hit man was far closer than the other and closing fast if it was a pistol in the killers hand they were already near being in range either the men had instructions not to draw attention to the field with gunshots or they were intent on capturing him and ferendelli alive of course there was another possibility if the range of the transmitters was thirty yards or less both pursuers would be in range soon ferendelli stumbled tried to recover with his extended arm and then fell to one knee totally spent gabe operating on a rush of adrenaline grabbed the mans other arm and jerked him unceremoniously to his feet their run was awkward and uncoordinated but they were definitely closing in on the river suddenly ferendelli threw his hands up against his temples cried out pitched forward and fell heavily facedown emitting a dreadful gurgling sound gabe dropped down and checked his carotid pulse if there was any it was so faint as to be nearly undetectable ferendelli was still breathing but not effectively in any other circumstance gabe would be initiating cpr but there was only a second or two to make a decision the hit man coming from the bridge the one who had two near misses trying to kill ferendelli had stopped about twenty yards away he had been aiming something at them that was clearly not a gun then he lowered his arm even through the gloom gabe felt certain he could see the man smiling stop you bastard gabe screamed stop it there was nothing to stop the lethal weapon undoubtedly a transmitter had done what it was supposed to ferendelli facedown on the summer grass was twitching his agonal liquidy breaths had quickly grown totally ineffective the pulse in his neck was gone on all fours knowing that he might be moments away from death himself gabe moved several feet away then scrambled to his feet to his left he could see the second man eggbald still sprinting across the field from the buick he looked taller and more athletic than the one confronting him go ahead the taller man cried out go ahead and do it the killer raised the transmitter once more gabe whirled and in a half crouch bolted ahead toward the river weaving from right to left to right again like the running back he had once been did you do it he heard the man behind him cry i did the one with the drawl shouted back it may need to recharge or or he may be out of range i dont think so at that instant gabe became aware of an odd not totally unpleasant aroma that seemed to be coming from deep within his nose and a corresponding taste on the back of his tongue his body felt lighter and more responsive head down he charged ahead weaving when he managed to remember to do so the two voices seemed far away now the sound garbled and unclear ahead the lights from across the river were blurred and in motion he was an athlete an olympian sprinting ahead faster than he would ever have thought possible his feet barely touching the ground the terror at ferendellis apparent murder and his own mortal fears had all but vanished he felt euphoric and was getting more so every second suddenly the moonless night exploded in colorstreaks of red and gold orange and green and white shot across the sky then burst over the river like fireworks pinwheels of light now with sound skimmed across the top of the water there were no voices now only the rich even sounds of his breathingin out in out he was flyingrunning on air invincible he was hercules batman indiana jones splashing through the dark chilly water then diving ahead even with his eyes shut tightly the colors blazed bathing the inside of his lids and warming them shooting down his throat and into his soul the water was his home he pulled through it effortlessly drawing it in through his nose and spitting it out his mouth he was a fish a shark aquaman he was immortal he was a god chapter mister hey mister the words were an annoyance penetrating the void prodding at gabes consciousness until it finally responded hey mister wake up are you hurt are you drunk do you want my momma to call an ambulance heavylidded gabe groaned rolled to his back and blinked until his vision began to clear the first thing he saw was the grayblue sky of early morning the second was the concerned face of the young black boy who was kneeling beside him fragment by fragment shards of the nightmare with ferendelli drifted into place whwhere am i the boy perhaps ten had an expressive face that featured huge dark eyes he wore a thin navy blue windbreaker and a redskins cap with the brim pulled fortyfive degrees to one side youre up against the fence in the vacant lot at the end of my street gabe pushed himself up onto one elbow and began to take stock his clothes were sodden and his shoes were gone as well as his radio cell phone and wallet the lot that the boy had described as vacant was hardly that it was more the before in a commercial for urban neighborhood reclamationstrewn with junk trash and garbage halfway across to a row of ramshackle twodecker houses gabe saw a squirrelsize rat scurry from one hiding place to another is this anacostia he was sitting now lightheaded and nauseous with a terrible dirt taste in his mouth and his pulse pummeling the inside of his eyes a course its anacostia the boy said whatd you think it was man i thought you was dead for a while i cut through this lot on the last half of my paper route i seen some wild things at this time of day but never a dead white guy all pressed against a fence im not dead not now you aint but how was i supposed to know gabe pawed at the filth grating in his eyes whats your name louis whats yours gabe louis do you know what time it is about five a little after i guess i aint supposed to talk to strangers you know you drunk or what good question gabe said i think the answers or what he sighed deeply and remorsefully as more details of the attack by the benning street bridge drifted into place almost certainly jim ferendelli was deadkilled in the exact way that the president would be killed at the whim of whoever was holding the appropriate transmitter killed by lily sexton and by two thugs who would have never found them if dr gabe singleton had been more cautious and vigilant and had taken the time to try to work out an explanation for an eventthe assault on kyle blackthornthat most certainly demanded one now there was another question that needed an answer why wasnt gabe dead too from what he could remember the ferocious psychedelic response he experienced to having the chemical time bomb in his head set off was not anything like the virtually instant cardiac death induced in ferendelli it was far closer to what drew had probably been experiencing one explanation was that like the president ferendelli had been dosed a number of times while gabe had only been inoculated with the drugcarrying fullerenes during that one session other possibilities crossed his mindhigher chemical concentration more variety of pharmaceuticals different target organs in their brains perhaps such sophisticated controls built into the fullerenes and the transmitters that different frequencies triggered the specific release of different drugs god damn them gabe tried to haul himself to his feet but a wave of dizziness and nausea drove him back onto the dirt he pushed to his hands and knees again and then without warning threw upa mixture of river water bile and bits of undigested food from louiss reaction it was clear he had seen worse thats gross you know he said clinically my uncle robbie throws up all the time momma says its because he drinks too much louis how far are we from the river few blocks three maybe and how far from your house its just down the end of the street can you take me there my momma would kill me for bringing a stranger homeand a bum at that besides i have to finish my paper route i hardly have enough customers to make any money as is youre right louis go ahead and finish your route im fine if im still here when youre done well talk the youth started away then returned oh heck i aint got school anyway my friend omar doesnt even start his route until seven avoiding the small pool of vomit louis helped gabe to his feet then let him brace against the fence until he was ready to take a step finally arminarm with louis taking some of gabes weight they made their way up the block i think mommas still in bed louis whispered as they tiptoed through the front door of a modest clapboard duplex with peeling gray paint and a dirt front yard ill try not to wake her gabe said speaking softly and following louis into a small neatly kept kitchen with chintz curtains and a formica table i just need to wash my hands and face in the sink and then i need a minute to think think about what about how to get ahold of my boss you got a job in a manner of speaking with no id and no phone numbers that he could remember contacting the president of the united states wasnt going to be easy it was possible to cut some sort of a deal with louis for cab fare but he would not have been at all proud of the boy if he agreed to part with his paper route money no matter how good the deal sounded besides the best he could do would be filthy and soaked to approach one of the uniformed secret service agents at one of the white house checkpoints and beg to be let in he took the phone from the wall and dialed information as soon as he could he would make up the cost of the call and then some city and state please the electronic operator asked washington dc say the name of the business you want or just say residence the white house gabe could see louiss eyes widen as he was patched through to an automated switchboard with another automated operator giving him a menu of six choices none of which was to speak with a fleshandblood operator much less to the president whats going on here startled gabe whirled louiss mother in bare feet wearing a thin tattered robe arms folded across her chest was staring at him from the doorway to the hall she was a dark expansive woman who probably looked quite engaging when she was smiling which at this moment she most certainly was not hes calling his boss at the white house louis gushed the white house and did you reach him mr singleton gabe said smiling sheepishly dr gabe singleton the woman had already heard enough she fixed a glare on her son louis its five thirty in the morning and you havent finished your route and how many times have i told you never to talk to strangers i know i know but he was lying by the fence in the lot down the street and and i thought he was dead or at least drunk hes neither just someone who throws up and needs help to call his boss in the white house gabe could see the woman softening and knew that she had probably never stayed angry at her son for very long in the white house gabe echoed can i explain the woman studied him for a few moments then without a word she turned and walked back down the hall returning with a pair of sweatpants a towel and a black longsleeved t these belong to louiss brother shaun she said hes working nights stocking shelves until he goes away to school in the fall they should fit even though shauns taller sorry we got no extra shoes you can change down the hall in the bathroom put your clothes into this plastic bag then well talk about just who you are and how we might be able to help you once in the bathroom gabe headed to the sink then took a quick look at himself in the mirror and chose to shower instead he absolutely had to connect with drew it seemed clear that at some point lily sexton or whoever she worked with employing scientific techniques that drew was planning on placing under strict government controls was going to either end the presidents life or ruin his career ironic the question now was whether or not ferendellis death and gabes escape would alter some sort of timetable if so drew might be in immediate danger quite possibly from someone close to him and gabe having exchanged information with ferendelli before his murder was now undoubtedly considered a serious threat he toweled off and put on shauns clothes which werent at all the mismatch his mother had predicted probably unkempt filthy and sodden gabe was unimposing enough to appear smaller than he was now thats better louiss mother said surveying gabe she handed him a mug of coffee determined that he drank it black and introduced herself as sharon turner mrs turner gabe said im very grateful to louis and i cant tell you how much i appreciate your trust and all youve done it must have been quite a shock seeing me like i was now what do you want to know i want to know the name of the man you recently replaced at the white house she said with some mirth in her expression at his surprise ferendelli dr james ferendelli my sisters husband herman works in the laundry at the white house i called and asked him about you he said he never met you but that you just came on board he couldnt remember the name of the doctor you replaced but you answered me quickly enough to seem genuine immediately gabes mind began to race is he home now he asked herman actually hes just getting ready to head into work gabe could barely conceal his excitement do you think i could speak with him sharon turner picked up the phone dialed then handed it across to him herman gabe said after introducing himself can you get a piece of paper and a pencil or pen great i need you to get a short note to the president do you think you can do that we have people that bring the linens up to the residence i help sometimes id rather have you deliver the note personally if its possible okay you ready the note should read the man who rides condor needs you to call him then i want you to write down sharons number at the bottom of the note if for any reason your supervisor wont let you go up to the residence see if you can get one of the secret service people to deliver the note but it would be much better if you do it any questions herman said there werent and gabe set the receiver back on the wall then he settled back with his coffee trying to conjure up a way to separate the president from all those who might be a threat to him including his secret service protectors by the time the phone rang in just over fortyfive minutes an idea had germinated and begun to grow it was an idea that would take some quick planning and some incredible luck but given what was at stake it was an idea that had to be made to work sharon answered the phone listened for a few moments and then rather shakily handed it across to gabe its for you she said man on the other end says hes thats who he is gabe said managing a grin at her reluctance to give the caller a name or a title whats the address here gabe asked sharon grabbed a piece of paper and wrote it down that you gabe the president asked in the flesh ive been trying to reach you all night where in the hell have you been long story ill tell you when i see you roger that good move with that condor note i never forget a horse mr president i need you to send someone out to get me ill send a car right out terrific gabe read the address twenty minutes stoddard said and send along a couple of photosone signed to the turners and one a thankyou to louis turner sometime soon i want you to have mrs turner here and her family over for dinner done any friends of yours are friends of the stoddards great hey what were you trying to reach me about something bad stoddard said very bad a few hours ago we got notified that your patient lily sexton was found dead in her hospital bed chapter the two friends sat across from one another enveloped in a somber silence twentyfive years ago they might have been in their room in bancroft hall at the naval academy chatting about women or an upcoming exam now they were alone together in the presidential study in the white house residence mulling over the significance of frightening and deflating newsthe deaths of former white house physician jim ferendelli and the secretarydesignate of science and technology lily sexton the police and secret service investigators dont report finding anything unusual or suspicious below the benning street bridge stoddard said finally im not surprised these people whoever they are are organized and professional youre certain jims dead im as sure as i can be without a body to examine i dont know much but after all these years as a doc i know dead it was really quite horrible we were running and suddenly he grabbed the sides of his head uttered a cry straight out of edgar allan poe and went down when i knelt to check him he wasnt reacting at all he was not breathing effectively and he didnt have any pulse that i could discern it only took like ten or fifteen seconds i think they stopped his heart either directly or through the connections in his brain the two men were coming at us fast thats when i took off running away from jim like i did was a reflex reaction but im certain that if i didnt one way or another either from some chemical they put into me or from a bullet id be dead now im sorry drew i really am im sorry too jim was a very good man sounds like he went through hell these past weeks and he said jennifer was someplace safe he wouldnt tell me where but yes thats what he said i hope we find his body except for jenny he didnt have much family but especially for her sake i want to find it an autopsy might help us answer some questions about you too autopsy the word hit stoddard like a slap this is terrible gabe he said just terrible listen i want you to go over things one more time just to be certain i have it all straight patiently gabe again reviewed the events leading up to the meeting in anacostia with ferendelli starting with the note that had been left for him at the watergate for the moment he only alluded to his illfated ride with lily sexton and the remarkable search of her house that followed the details he would fill in when it was clear the president had come to terms with the certainty of ferendellis stunning and horrific death as gabe proceeded stoddard stopped him frequently asking for clarification of the half hour or so that gabe spent with ferendelli and the mans unrequited love for lily after stoddard was satisfied he knew all there was to know he listened attentively to the account of the arrival of the two killers the chase to the river ferendellis collapse the explosion of hallucinogenic drugs in gabes brain and finally the moment louis turner found him unconscious in the vacant lot when gabe felt comfortable that the president had processed the death of his friend and physician as well as he was going to he took stoddard stepbystep through the discovery of the underground passageway and the nanotechnology laboratory it took most of an hour and a number of diagrams of drugcarrying fullerenes and brain sketches to bring stoddard up to speed on how his irrational episodes gabes powerful hallucinations and ferendellis death were related at last the president sank back in his highbacked leather easy chair and stared out the window breathing deeply and slowly through his nosea calming exercise gabe remembered from their days at the academy sorry about the car gabe said on the way back here we drove by where i had left it but it was gone i think my father has insurance stoddard quipped gabe who could it be whos doing this to me and why as you and every other president and presidents physician knows there are no limits to the number of whys all i can tell you drew is that ferendelli felt that in order to dose you with drugcarrying fullerenes and then to fire off the transmitter that causes them to open up at least one of the people responsible had to be someone close to youpossibly someone in the background of your life like an aide or a valet or a secretary possibly someone quite visible like one of your advisors a secret service agent or even a cabinet member im getting a damn migraine just thinking about this speaking of secret service agents theres another problem im really concerned and frightened about alison cromartie the undercover agent working in the medical clinic may have vanished she left me a note saying to contact her at one of two numbers but she wasnt answering either before i left for anacostia lord can you try again now im afraid her note was in my pocket when i went for my little swim maybe whoever rolled me took it but i have a staff list in the clinic i can get her numbers from there good ill contact mark fuller at the secret service offices right away and get people on this thanks id appreciate that im sorry gabe i hope shes all right first jim now lily and alisons disappeared ive been thinking the same thing what happened at the hospital with lily i dont have much to tell she was transferred sometime last night to the medical center here in dc from whats been reported to me she was perfectly stable at some point today she was due to have her shoulder operated on then a few hours after she was admitted she was found dead in bed so far no ones been reporting having seen a thing i told you these guys are professionals you think she was murdered magnus was told they were thinking embolismthe sort that happens sometime when bones are broken or operated on fat embolism gabe said its the fat in the bone marrow pardon me for my skepticism but two people who are connected to you and knew each other well are dead within a few hours of one another im just not big on coincidence with an iv line and a chest tube in place there were plenty of ways to see to it she didnt talk theres an autopsy scheduled for later today dont bank on its finding too much these people are good i just dont believe this gabe what should i do for a time gabe studied his hands the filth from the river and the vacant lot still embedded under some of his nails seemed to underscore the direness of the situation someone physically close to the president at least intermittently had the virtually unstoppable capability of either driving him insane or killing him the problem is gabe said we dont know if ferendellis death has changed the rulesmaybe caused whoever is behind this to alter their goals or their timetable do you think it could be tom cooper it would seem hes got a lot to gain if i go bonkers or worse or dunleavy or the koreans or the psycho terrorists or the drug lords or or or if youre right gabe than you might be in danger too i might but im not the president of the united states and to tell you the truth drew at the risk of hurting your feelings i wouldnt want to be it requires a special kind of madness youre making a difference my friend theres a spirit of optimism throughout much of this country weve got to keep you healthy and in the game i knew i brought you here for a reasonits to remind me of stuff like that the way i see it we need to start grilling the scientists and administrators in that lab attached to lilys placefind out who theyre working for other than lily and what they might know that will help get those fullerenes in you neutralized or eliminated but before we do that i really think we should find a place to hide you away from anybody who might possibly be behind this what do you mean by anybody just that my wife my secret service protection my staff the country drew youre no good to any of us dead at the moment virtually everyone connected with you in any way is a suspect excuse me my friend but havent you seen what life is like for me except for here in our little temporary apartment im not able to go to the bathroom without a phalanx of agents standing by its their job and they do it well gabe tapped his fingers together and worked through the idea that had taken root in his mind i have an idea for a way we might be able to get you separated from everyoneeveryone except me that is pardon me for my skepticism but ive seen the secret service in action i dont believe you can do that i didnt say it was going to be easy gabe stared out the window and again played through the scenario he had concocted you have figured out a way to kidnap the president of the united states drew said its not kidnapping if the president goes along with itmore like borrowing what we need is a place to goa place where you might be able to hide out for a few days we would have to notify tom cooper that hes about to become president nonsense its his job to be ready to become president thats why you picked him besides as you suggested he might be the last person we want to tell anything to drew the constitution and the laws of the land have been put together to handle situations involving you having to take a break from running the country i suppose i cant believe that my ratty ol cowboy pal is lecturing me on constitutional law believe me sir your ratty ol cowboy pal has been busy making himself something of an expert on this now if were to succeed in separating you from the world it will have to be soon should be today but ill need time to get some things together so tomorrow ill try and stay in here alone or with carol as much as possible until then gabe flashed on the unsettling exchange with the first lady the night of drews psychotic episode with carol would be better he managed i dont want you to be alone if you can id appreciate it if you make your main priority mobilizing people to help find alison im really worried about her count on it just keep the rest of the world as far away as possible and please tell her as little as you can get away with gabe our marriage just doesnt work like that i understand do what feels right remember the person we need to be frightened of could just as easily be one of carols connections as one of yours now what we need most of all is a place we can escape to where the minimum number of people if any at all will get a look at you specifically im looking for a place within say a hundred miles of camp david what camp david tomorrow afternoon or maybe evening were going to escape from camp david it cant be done maybe not but maybe so ill go over the details with you and then see what you think but first we need a place within a hundred miles of camp david more or less im actually wondering how sharon turners house would work out back here in dc i dont want to put her or her family in harms way stoddard said and as neat as that woman sounds there arent many who could go without saying to some friend or relative oh by the way guess whos staying over at the house for a couple of days ferendellis brownstone that would be one of the first places the secret service would look as investigators those guys are the best hopefully youll see that when they set out to find alison stoddard hesitated a resigned expression on his face i know of a place we can go to he said almost reluctantly its in berkeley county in west virginia about thirty miles west of hagerstown gabe said i know the area i spent a year of my life there much of the time studying maps against the day when i reached the end of my rope and decided to make a break for it oh god im sorry for not being more sensitive gabe im really sorry no need to be there just happened to be a prison there and i just happened to be in it what have you got in mind the place is called the aerie its a castle a real medieval castle complete with moat set on the top of a high hill or maybe you could call it a low mountain right in the middle of some of the wildest densest forest this country has it was built by my grandfathermy fathers father so its secluded nobody goes there anymore but its still in the family theres like some sort of family trust but it only meets every couple of years and hardly anyone comes i think someone comes in every month or two to do battle with the cobwebs and dust off my grandfathers collection of armor and weapons i dont know for sure but i am a trustee and i do have a key electricity as far as i know either way theres a generator sounds promising gabe are you sure this is necessary are you sure that it isnt okay okay and try not to worry too much about alison im sure theres a simple logical explanation why you havent been able to connect chapter hatred there were no windows in alisons prison only the unadorned concrete walls the scattered pieces of junk and the bare bulb hanging directly over her head making it unpleasant to open her eyes after four sessions of griswolds droning interrogation each followed by a dose of the unbearable muscletearing intravenous drug he had left and not returned alison had discerned from her own sense of time and some remark he had casually dropped as he was heading off that it was morning now she guessed it was evening again thirtysix hoursmaybe more she remained strapped on her back drifting in and out of wakefulness her wrists and ankles were expertly secured by rope to the metal frame of her cot she was helpless and in throbbing pain throughout her body with her arms stretched above her head and barely able to move her shoulders were especially uncomfortable whenifshe finally did get to lower her arms she wondered if they might simply fall off at some point during the endless hours or perhaps during the actual torture that had preceded them she had wet herself griswold if he was aware of that fact had made no attempt before he left to change her or to help her change beside her two plastic intravenous bottles hooked in parallel drained saline into her arm one crystal drop at a time why would griswold ever want her to dehydrate to death and deprive him of his sport during the time she was conscious alison was consumed by a hatred for treat griswold more powerful than any other emotion she had ever known being a quarter black she had encountered racism from time to time but never had it taken the form of overt hatred in los angeles there was no question as she watched her friend janies life be decimated that alison hated the arrogant selfserving surgeons who were masterminding the onslaught but never enough to kill them this time she wasnt at all sure the presidents numberone protector was a master at tortureat breaking his subject down until every statement every revelation was certain to be the truth clearly he did not yet feel he had reached that point with her the doses were progressively larger and more excruciating by the end of the allnight session the muscles throughout her body were no longer able to relax fully between injections the persistent spasms of her jaws threatened to pulverize her teeth her scalp muscles to crush her skull who else knows about this why did you follow me did someone specifically tell you to investigate me tell me again about the inhaler what was it i did that made you suspicious what did constanza and beatriz tell you who else knows about this who else knows about this even now in the dense silence his voice was salt on the raw exposed wound of her mind and yet with each passing second each agonizing minute she felt her power to resist grow if as it seemed now she was going to die she was going to die victorious with her secret and her selfesteem intact maybe sometime after her death lester would come forward and the fbi would find and thoroughly search her car maybe they would find the inhaler maybe they would test it and determine that there was something out of the ordinary about it maybe alison smiled savagely at the notion that it was the very hatred griswold had created in her that had kept her from disclosing what he wanted to know it was the pain he caused that made her fight back it was the knowledge that there was probably no way he could let her live that would keep her from ever telling him about lester and what precious little she did know about the inhaler tucked beneath the drivers side seat of her car still she feared the pain when she needed to she passed the hours by focusing her hatred on griswolds visagehis basketball head his balding pate his pinched face and his small despicable eyes she tried lifting her head off the thin military pillow the muscles in the back of her neck allowed the movement but only at a painful price how could one human do this to another it was a stupid question humans had been torturing other humans for as long as there had been the means to do it and god made man in his own image and god saw that it was good not this time mercifully her eyes closed and sleep descended as she was drifting off she found herself focusing on why griswold seemed so insistent on questioning her over and over regarding the inhaler she had answered his questions not only plausibly but with the truth beyond the fact that griswold had been handling the inhalers at all she knew of nothing that he had done wrong now his persistence in not believing her had her wondering by the time she had been able to surrender and doze off alison had decided that no matter what she said about the inhaler griswold was unlikely to believe her sooner or later regardless of what she divulgedtruth or liehe was going to kill her by torturing her the way he had he had more or less crossed the line and had left himself no other option at the very least she decided with nothing to lose she should do what she could to unsettle himto drag things out and to make him wonder if she might not be the only one who knew about him when she opened her eyes again the monster was there staring down at her still dressed in his shirt and tie and black secret service suit long day he asked go to hell i dont know why but for some reason i dont think you like me being a pervert pedophile and a sadist would be enough to accomplish that but youre a traitor too nearly submerged beneath the fleshy folds of his brows griswolds eyes flashed why would you say that you know why tell me go to hell griswold filled the large syringe with his torture drug tell me he said sweetly inserting the needle into the rubber port on the iv tubing ive been workin on the railroad she sang as loudly as her stressed vocal cords could manage all the livelong day ive been smiling in a most unsettling way griswold pulled the needle out and set the syringe aside ive got a better idea he said suddenly looking very full of himself theatrically he reached into the inside breast pocket of his suit coat and produced an alupent inhaler the alupent inhaler alison hoped edgily she pressed her lips together testing how vigorously she was going to be able to resist i think its time griswold said that you and our fearless leader developed a common bond i dont have the time or frankly the interest in explaining this little beauty to you but it sure will be fun to see how you handle itnow and in the near future i knew it alison thought the inhaler i knew it i knew it i knew it you are really slime actually griswold said i sort of like the big guy i voted for him and i never would have agreed to go along with this if i hadnt been threatened with exposure because of this little babylove peccadillo youve got going on here that was your biggest sin of allleaving yourself open to blackmail and extortion griswold you are just so stupid thats why im standing here and youre lying there he said seeming a bit rattled what goes around comes around youll get yours whos blackmailing you whats in that inhaler call it a hightech time release capsule certain chemicals in here enter your bloodstream and settle in throughout your brain where i can set them off with a push of any of these little buttons some of them will make you act loopy in any of a number of amusing ways one of them will make you act wild one pair will kill you dead he produced a stubby black remote transmitter and held it up for her to see it reminded alison of an icecream sandwich and had seven or eight creamcolored diamondshaped control buttons lined up in two columns along one surface at last griswold had done it at last she knew for certain what was going on even if she had no idea how the chemicals got to where they were intended or who was blackmailing the man to administer them or why she searched desperately for some wayany wayshe could get free at least long enough to get word to gabe about what was happening treat give it up give it up and no ones the worse for what youve done give it up and i can tell people how you cooperated you okay lady he said pinching her nostrils closed until they hurt ive heard enough big breaths now he rested his massive hand against her chin pried her mouth open and jammed the business end of the inhaler between her teeth then he sealed the opening in place with his hand and waited until she breathed in to send a jet of mist into her throat and lungs alison was in no condition to put up much resistance the first jolt of the stimulant tasted like rusty water the second made her dizzy and the third made her dizzier still griswolds grip tightened another spray then another her heart was pounding sending shock waves through her head acid jetted up into her throat and she struggled to swallow it again rather than to aspirate it and have it scald the inside of her lungs instead of opening up her bronchioles the repeated dosing now seemed to send them into spasm smothering her another dose and she knew her nervous system was going to explode into a fullblown grand mal seizure she managed one final glare at her nemesis hoping that image of his face might stay with her into the hereafter then she closed her eyes tightly and waited to die chapter any word about her gabe asked stoddard shook his head mark fuller from internal affairs says its too soon to be worried thats nuts somethings happened to her he says tomorrow morning hell start putting people on it i dont want to wait any longer than that first thing tomorrow ill check on it myself good enough i hear you carry some weight around here im counting on you to keep it that way now what are we up against it took most of two hours for gabe and stoddard to work out the details of the plan that would in just over twentyfour hours separate the president of the united states from a grave threat to his health and possibly to his life in the process he would also be separated from his wife and from the presidency itself vice president tom cooper a major suspect in gabes eyes would assume the duties of the office though hopefully not for long once stoddard was ensconced in a place of absolute security and safety gabe would speak with the first lady and tell her where her husband was gabe would also enlist her help in quickly mobilizing the force that would raid the nanotechnology laboratory adjacent to lily pad stablesthe lab indirectly responsible for the death of her physician and the transient episodes of insanity that had been threatening to destroy her husband with luck the scientists in the lab once they were isolated and interrogated by professionals would cooperate with luck investigators would quickly determine who had hired them and who was paying them with luck whoever was poisoning stoddard and controlling the transmitter would be arrested and finally with luck those ultimately responsible would be brought down two days gabe said hopefully less with the whole world looking for you we need you out of sight for two days can the aerie accomplish that you may have read or heard about my grandfather bedard joe stoddard he made a fortune in mining patents of all kinds and manufacturing by being uncompromising in his business practices and in his opposition to the unions some would and did say ruthless opposition like many geniuses bj was more than a little eccentric and also like many geniuses there were detractors who felt he often crossed over that invisible line between eccentricity and madness most of my family simply skipped the eccentric step gabe said well at some point bj decided he needed a refuge that was both isolated and secure thats why he built the aeriemodeled stonebystone after a medieval castle in northern england he once visited and photographed he brought in trainloads of foreign laborersmostly the chinese who had worked on the railroads he designed the maze of dirt roads leading into the forest himself most of them simply stopped or became endless loops the roads that eventually would make it up to the aerie were and are a closely guarded secret but theyre marked on the map you gave me i dont think there are more than a half a dozen copies of that map in existence so take good care of it if the press finds out thats where you were hiding therell be more gawkers making their way up there than to the grand canyon hopefully theyll all get lost in the forest the whole project took eight years to complete stoddard went on decades later my father spent many more years upgrading the place adding to bjs bizarre collection of medieval weapons and instruments of torture and increasing security there he once told me that in the event of a nuclear attack i was to eschew the bunker here at the white house and get the heck up to the aerie which he called the safest place in the world sounds like just what the doctor ordered gabe said realizing only after he had invoked the platitude that it was actually funny how often does your father use the place essentially never hes much more into entertaining and wheelerdealing on his yacht its been a long time since i was last there but even then the place had fallen into pretty sad disrepair sounds perfect for us gabe said it is perfectespecially if you get off on cobwebs plus the arcane and macabre wait until you get a load of it im aimin to do just that before it gets dark tonight now i need two things from you name them i want your promise to hole up here with carol for the time being please please tell her as little as possible she may not believe that this business is as serious as it is but she never got to watch jim ferendelli die like i did also lily sexton was her friend it may take some doing for her to believe lilys involvement in all this i dont know the range of those transmitters but i dont want to take any chances on losing my only patient i dont know what killed lily either but if someone wants you dead being a patient in a hospital is only slightly safer than sleeping on a firing range you think she was a loose end as soon as ferendelli made contact with me and i got away i think the rules might have changed from make drew look crazy to make drew be dead thats why im so worried about you i appreciate that okay then back to carol clear everyone out of this apartment no help no valets no secret service agents have her intercept anyone who makes it past the agents downstairs and watch them as they go back down in the elevator any argument from anyone even someone like magnus and she needs to call the palace guards immediately you have my word whats the second thing money cash ill need lots of it and maybe a few wallets to stick it in can you do that i have a reliable banker at first washington trust ill give you a check and make a phone call just dont tell him why i dont think ill have to walter really belongs in one of those banks in switzerland or grand cayman he loves the chance to be discreet almost as much as he loves having people know how discreet he is then youre going to arrange for our evening ride yes as soon as you leave ill set things up weve got some damn fine horses out at the stables near camp david i want it to get dark an hour or so after we disappear at first well need to see what were doing but then i want to make it as difficult as possible for the people who are looking for you now why would they want to be doing that beats me youre only the president drew i know this has got to be hard for you its tough getting bossed around when youre used to being the capo del capo but please believe me were doing the right thingthe only thing why cant we just just what arrest everyone it was horrible watching jim collapse and stop breathing the way he did he could have had a hundred secret service men around him a thousand and the outcome would have been the same stoddard drummed his fingertips together and gabe could tell that he was scanning every possibility for how he might deal with the threat to his health and life and still remain president you have the map i drew marking where you should leave the atv he asked finally right here remember i havent been there for years so theres no vouching for accuracy im planning on making a trial run up there later today just call if you get lost that reminds me do you have a cell phone i can borrow mine was in my pocket along with my wallet when i went for the big swim drew padded to the bedroom and returned with a check and a cell phone careful now he said handing the cell phone over push the concealed button by mistake and you wipe out moscow the two friends stood quietly for a time then shook hands and finally embraced wherere you going to start stoddard asked i have some errands to run but first im going to see just how easy it is to buy a car and get it on the road when all i have is cash my moneys on you i just spoke a little to carol and told her whats in store for us she says she trusts you to do whats best for her husband thank her for me drew i knew i did the right thing bringing you out here from wyoming and i knew i did the right thing voting for you chapter b ig al the car buyers pal the slogan complete with a caricature of the man was painted on a sign that rose from the top of a shacklike office overlooking a lot of forty or so used cars festooned with red white and blue balloons while gabe was working over and over through the elements of the plan that was designed to save the presidency of andrew stoddard and possibly the mans life as well big al kagan was working over every cliché in his automobile buyers blue book in an effort to sell gabe a latemodel bordeaux red chevrolet impala with cd changer power sunroof factory alloys and cruise control all you need to do big al was saying is just take this baby out for a drive just a quick spin around the block and out sixtysix for a few miles and youll be belting yourself in for the long haul what do you need just your license and ill hook a dealers plate on this puppy and youre off i um dont have a license right now my wallet was stolen id gabe thought about the handwritten introductory note folded in his pocket from the president to banker walter immelmana note he never even had to use to get twenty thousand dollars in cash nope do you have a tradein no i sold my other car well then you must have the plates i well yes yes i do have one one is enough if i get the plate can i just take the car of course once i get a little paperwork done but dont you want to take her for a little stoddards cell phone cut the bewildered dealer short it was playing hail to the chief give me a couple of minutes big al gabe said walking ten yards away to lean against a silver infiniti with air cd changer low mileage bridgestone turanzas and a red balloon ellen hey there cowboy thanks for getting back to me so quickly gabe pictured the trim seasoned veterinarian seated in her pinepaneled office just outside of tyler surrounded by photos and childrens drawings and paintings of horses dozens and dozens of horses in fact her office chair and those in her modest waiting room were handtooled western saddles transformed with backs and legs by the grateful owner of a patient in no time at all youve become a legend in these parts gabe i promise to undo that misconception just as soon as i get back home before you go and do any undoing my kids will want your autograph and a signed photo of your boss tell them if they want a legend they dont have to look any further than their mom okay okay harry and sarah with an h harry and sarah make it one for each done you want one too only if hes on a horse in that case itll be to dr ellen k and gilbert f williams gilbert hates being left out the middle initialsll make sure people know it aint just any ol ellen and gilbert williams done so you mentioned your call has something to do with your patient now pardon me for saying it but thats intriguing what can an ol veterinary sawbones do for you and our esteemed president i need you to put a potion together for me and ship it out here so that i have it in my hands by noon tomorrow any later will probably be ng exactly whats this potion supposed to do watching big al kagan pace about his otherwise deserted sales lot gabe went over the details of his requirements seventeen hundred miles to the west dr ellen k williams listened intently thats it he said thats all i need thats it huh well doc let me ask you something what would you say to me if i called you longdistance and asked if you could do this to a bunch of humans gabe felt himself sink he had been so immersed in the logistics and potential of his plan that he did not think for a moment that ellen williams whom he had known professionally and socially for years and who was on the board of lariat would be morally unwilling to go along with a scheme that might end up killing horses desperately he searched his mind for alternatives the best he could come up with on the spot was finding a largeanimal specialist locally and opening one of the wallets full of cash he was carrying he knew that there was no way a bribe of any size would work on williams youre right ellen he said finally if i were even going to consider such a request id want to know detailsdetails and exactly what was at stake well unfortunately i cant tell you all the details but i can say that the life of the man i am caring for may be at stake and i am desperate enough to beg but not desperate enough to ask you to compromise your professionalism and love of animals as a physician i completely understand why you would have misgivings a long silence followed youll be careful i promise youve been out to my place weve even ridden together you know how i feel about horses okay gabe she said finally ill do the compounding myself and see to it that the mixture is at your dc address by noon it will be a blend of ketamine nembutal and maybe some fentanyl although im not sure yet how much of each ill have to make my best guess as to when each drug will do what it does and how they will work together theres a couple of rescued animals here i might be able to try various combinations on they could use some rest i owe you doc gabe said and i think the country owes you as well he gave her the address of the watergate slipped the cell phone into the jeans stoddard had lent him and turned his attention back to big al feeling not that pleased about what he had just coerced a very wonderful doctor into doing listen ba he said im going to run home and pick up my old plate then ill be back im glad i didnt throw it out me too big al called out as gabe was leaving the lot when he reached the street gabe glanced about casually then he began the evasive action he had started the moment he left the white house the lesson learned in anacostia was an indescribably painful one but it was a lesson nevertheless except for what he had seen in the movies and read in some thrillers he was a rank amateur in the cloakanddagger business but he was logical and in most circumstances he wasnt dumb down uncrowded sidewalks through stores and restaurants with back exits into one cab then another with each move he fought against complacency and against allowing the pressure of time to make him careless as things stood with what he knew he might be as much a target as drew now leaving big als he moved thoughtfully ducking into a doorway from time to time and flagging down a cab for a zigzag fiveminute ride to no place in particular after a twoblock walk he stopped in a hardware store emerging from the alley entrance with both slotted and phillips head screwdrivers parked against one of the walls in the alley looking as if it might not have been driven for a while was an old chevrolethardly a perfect match for the car he was about to buy but a match of sorts nonetheless he ducked behind the junker and in just a minute emerged with its plate if nothing else he had just made big als day finally after returning to the lot screwing the plate on the impala paying al off and freeing the balloon it was time to use some more of the presidents hardearned cash to brighten up someone elses daythis time it would be lily sextons stable man william chapter gabe had first seen the muddy fourwheel allterrain vehicle parked outside the barn at lily pad stables it would be perfect for negotiating the rutted dirt roads up flat top mountain to the aerie where it could then be easily concealed in the forest but first it had to be trucked from flint hill to the mountain fifty or so miles away now after an explanation that included the assurance that lending gabe the atv was what lily sexton would have wanted he was in his newly purchased impala leading lilys stable man william up i toward the west virginia border tied down in the back of williams ford pickup was the atva honda quite similar to the one gabe used on his ranch if things worked out tomorrow the way he and drew planned they would go from horseback to the chevy and after an hours drive leave the car concealed at the base of the mountain and head up to the castle on the atv at the least as soon as word got out that the president was missing the sky would be dotted with helicopters and fixedwing aircraft and the roads jammed with cruisers sooner or later some bright investigator might come across mention of the aerie someplace and contact lemar stoddard but by then hopefully drew would be ready to come back out into the open their best bet drew suggested would be to stay off the roads as much as possibleeven the tangle of dead ends and other dirt roads that his grandfather had built around the aerie drew had owned offroad motorcycles and later atvs from the time he was a child and even though he hadnt been up to the castle since before his election he still felt confident that he could negotiate the narrow hiking paths winding up through the forest and concealed from overhead by the dense canopy of foliage william a laconic septuagenarian had been born and raised in the shenandoah valley and had been working at lily pad stables when lily took it over nearly ten years before he had no idea what if anything he should charge gabe for the atv which gabe promised to return when his use for it was done in the end the stable man settled for a thousand dollars which he said he would send along to his niece in harrisonburg gabe added an additional two hundred of the presidents money after william promised to keep that amount for himself just past winchester they crossed from virginia into west virginia now gabe began using his trip odometer and consulting the map stoddard had drawn somewhere off to the left on a high hill named flat top mountain was the aerie gabe slowed and took exit thirteen william followed at miles the narrow twolane road curved off to the right to the left barely visible a rutted dirt road cut off into the forest fifty or a hundred feet in on the right stoddard had said is one of those deadend roads i told you about that my grandfather built thats where well leave the atv covered with branches later well leave your car there and put the branches on it saying nothing to william of his intentions gabe stopped before reaching the deadend spur together they unloaded the atv gabe started it up and with william squeezed in behind him they made a quartermile test run down the paved road and then back the machine seemed a bit sluggish at first but then rallied depending on the steepness of the paths up to the aerie gabe decided he and drew ought to have a decent shot at making it after again expressing his regrets over lilys sudden and tragic death and having william refuse his offer of another hundred dollars gabe stood by the atv and watched as the truck rattled back down the road toward virginia then amid lengthening shadows he used the seveninch blade of a newly acquired hunting knife to cut down the branches that would conceal the impala tonight and again tomorrow finally a bit winded from the effort he leaned against the trunk of a mature hickory and listened to the noisy quiet of the west virginia woods it was time to familiarize himself with the aerie tomorrow he would buy a pair of western boots and then arrange for a messenger service to pick up the package from ellen williams at the watergate and deliver it to him at their office he would avoid the white house and his condo then the next time he would surface would be at camp david in the catoctin mountains of maryland fiftyfive miles from where he was standing now through the gathering night gabe clutched drews map to the handlebars as the atv jounced upward over rutted dirt tracks that were just wide enough for a car the woods on either side of the road were truly the forest primeval of poets and songwriters as dense as any he could remember with the panoply of leaves overhead blocking what little daylight remained his love of fishing had led to a solid knowledge of the outdoors and in particular of trees as he rumbled along gabe picked out cedar and black oak white ash beech and cherry basswood aspen and birch twice the surroundings and atmosphere overwhelmed his impatience to reach the summit and he shut off the engine to stand by the roadside and listen breathing in the cool sweet air tomorrow drew would guide them to the aerie not on these roads but along rooty paths through the thick foliage and undergrowtha cinch gabe suspected compared to floating a million jet onto the deck of a pitching carrier he accelerated and leaned into the sharp turns getting more and more connected with the rhythm of riding the fourwheel stallion the forest began to thin as the summit neared rock formations grew larger and more spectacular suddenly the vegetation fell away completely and as if born from the ground itself the aerie appeareda massive brooding gothic fortress of gray stone rising to a height well above the surrounding trees the footprint of the castle was nearly square with towers at each corner and battlements running the length of the walls the entire structure was surrounded by a tenfootwide moat crossed by a drawbridge leading to a huge portcullis eccentric indeed gabe left the atv near the tree line and crossed the drawbridge through one of the narrow windows he could see light as the president had promised the power was on and the lights on timers gabe used drews key and entered a musty massive great hall supported by exposed postandbeam trusses the walls were lined with motheaten flags and mannequins in tarnished suits of armor one of them sitting astride a sixteen or seventeenhandhigh model horse also in full armor adorned by dense cobwebs if as drew had said a caretaker came in every month or so the cycle had to be at its end gabe made a brief tour of the place using a flashlight he located in the kitchen where he could easily locate a light switch he used it he inspected the ancient pipe organ in the great hall and then moved into the expansive dining room with a long dustcovered table that once might have seated twenty out the far side of that room up a short flight of stairs was an empty pool hewn out of rock and at least ten feet deep moss was growing along the insides each of gabes bootsteps echoed eerily off the stone and concrete walls skipping a lot of exploring he went down a dark staircase to the underground levels in the basement was a security room with monitor screens none of which seemed operational there was also an intensely creepy hall containing seven or eight medieval machines of torture many of them festooned with cobwebs but it was on the level beneath that one that he found what he had come down there to seethe bunker that he planned would be home to the president for as long as they needed it to be it was a room twelvebytwelve that had only a minimal layer of dust and few cobwebs there were two rustic single beds and a bookshelf containing several hundred volumes a builtin television dozens of movies mostly old videotapes but some dvds and a stereo console along the base of the walls were large bottles of water and in a small pantry enough canned goods to keep a family going for weeks the refrigerator was plugged in but empty and the roomy bathroom was tiled and surprisingly homey gabe found the switch for the air conditioner and turned it on as drew had suggested reinforced walls six feet thick he had said with filtered air built originally by bedard stoddard himself and modernized by lemar in the eighties weve been told that anyone inside here during a nuclear blast will survive as long as the generators keep going even if the warhead hit as close as washington gabe spent twenty minutes wiping down the space drew groused about having it be his room but in the end agreed that his safety was what their mission was all about before he headed back upstairs gabe made one final survey of the quarters three stories below the ground surrounded by solid granite and six feet of reinforced concrete his kneejerk reaction was that despite serious efforts to make it comfortable and inviting the space gave him claustrophobic jitters still he acknowledged it would be the perfect sanctuary for the president or the perfect coffin chapter the noise from the stairway behind alison was faintthe opening of the door a footstep on the top stair the sound was significant it meant in all likelihood that she wasnt dead she had no idea how many hours it had taken for her cardiac respiratory and nervous systems to recover from having been overdosed with metaproteranolthe pharmacoactive drug in alupent she still felt jittery sick to her stomach although she hadnt eaten for thirtysix hours or more and profoundly ill at ease her muscles ached terribly even though she could not recall having been injected after the inhaler overdose it was doubtful that griswold had any idea of what dosage of metaproteranol a person could survive more likely was that he had simply kept forcing the medication into her lungs and bloodstream until the apparatus had run dry it was a miracle her body hadnt simply given inher lungs exploding her heart ceasing to beat her brain shutting off altogether she had to find a way outto cause griswold to make a mistake of some sort the footsteps continued down the stairs the monster was back for another session she had beaten him this fareven gotten him to boast that there were in fact various drugs adulterating the presidents alupentand somehow she vowed she would beat him again or die softly she began to hum singing the words in her mind preparing herself for whatever was to come this world aint always tasty like candy thats what my mama once told me another step then another alison tightened her eyes shut and clenched her fists sometimes itll shake and bend you the footsteps ended on the concrete floor then she heard a woman gasp ay dios mío constanza came into alisons sight i cant believe he let you down here alison rasped through parched split lips constanza lifted the back of alisons head and gave her a sip from a bottle of spring water the jeans and black beaded sweater she wore looked elegant on her but her gentle exotic face was dark with anguish and concern donald doesnt know i am down here she said he has forbidden it but i know where the key is i have lived here in this house for ten years there is little i dont know beatriz and i heard you screaming last night and the night before from upstairs even though this room is below the basement it was very frightening he has caused me terrible pain alison replied and he plans to continue torturing me until he is convinced i have told him all that he wants to know and why wont you tell him because then he will kill me sooner or later he plans to kill me anyway i cant believe that about donald constanza please please listen to me you must listen and help me help me or i will die donald works for the government no he is a businessman does this look like something a businessman would do who are you i remember you from the nail shop what is your name please i wont last much longer my name is alison i work for the government toojust like donald im sorry he had to do this to you alison studied the womans face but could see no sign that she was lyingthat she had been sent down by griswold to accomplish what his muscletearing chemical and the alupent overdose could not he didnt have to do this to me constanza he wanted to please untie me i am in so much pain donald is sending us away the beauty said pointedly ignoring alisons pleas you and beatriz yes there is a woman in mexico city he knows we are to leave to go there in just a few minutes and wait until he sends for us we are all packed we have money he is sending a car to take us to the airport dont bother coming back to this house alison was thinking its not going to be here soonmaybe as soon as tonightyour donald is going to see to it that this place mysteriously burns to the ground that is what people like him are expert atcovering up and then counterattacking it was one thing to blow the whistle and bring charges against such highly connected people it was another to come up with the evidence to make them stick what time is it now she asked almost nine in the morning donald has gone to work constanza listen to me please dont leave me like this i know donald has been good to you but he has hurt me he has hurt me badly and hes not done he will continue to hurt me until he is convinced i have told him all i know then he will kill me but donald will be furious with me he sometimes has a short temper and he can get very angry alison continued desperately fumbling for the right words think of of how you would feel being tied down like this constanza did think for a time then she shook her head turned and headed back toward the stairs im sorry she murmured over her shoulder alison felt her heart sink chapter so far so good so far so good as gabe showered the mantra flowed steadily through his head so far so good he got no cell phone signal in the castle but he did outside he dialed both of the numbers he had for alison halfexpectingor was it prayingto hear her voice no answer at either the mantra slowed then stopped was there anyone he could call to report that she was missing anyone he could ask he briefly wondered if he should try to reach the admiral possibly ellis wright knew something the third number he dialed was answered on the first ring yes drew its gabe hey calling from the aerie by the moat theres no signal inside what do you think charming little bungalow a monument to benign neglectsort of like me look at the bright side you could have grown up there everything okay with my patient never better ive been up for an hour did a little stretching drank some coffee did a few situps vetoed some bills you know how it is with this job you ready to ride im ready to put this whole business behind me i feel so damn helpless what good is it being president if you cant control everything and boss everyone around not to worry youll be back martineting before you know it just remember until we know who and why everyone is a potential assassin no matter how meek or innocent they might seem keep your eyes open and keep your plans guarded until the very last minute ill be coming into the city to run some more errands then im going to find a safe place to stash my new wheels just off one of the riding trails you going to be able to find the car again once were galloping through the woods i intend to go to the stables as soon as i can and to convince the stable masterwhats his name again rizzo joe rizzo to let me go for a brisk solo ride to clear my head ill make a call and set that up for you you have that map i drew showing where the stables are its a break that theyre outside the compound will they be bringing our horses to us probably any special horses or should i pick you pick i dont know them well enough meanwhile everythings going okay yes im not so sure gabe said no alison nothing its been more than two days now i promised to call mark fuller and get some people on this and i will right now right now im sorry this is happening gabe shes all right just wait and see some sort of misunderstanding thanks for doing this gabe reiterated his plea for vigilance then rinsed out a cup and poured the first of what would undoubtedly be a number of cups of coffee he paced as he drank mentally ticking off his todo list the most critical item was picking up the mixture sent by ellen williams if for any reason the tranquillizer didnt arrive on time he and drew would have to find a way to delay everything for a day when every minute meant more danger not just for the president but for gabe as well sunset would be at seven fortyfivelater than he would have liked but likely to be of some help before they reached the aerie the less daylight when they hit the riding trail the better if possible he would find some way to communicate to drew the need to stall for a few more minutes of dusk details details by six fifteen he was back on the atv rumbling down the mountain to where the impala was hidden not enough cover he decided easily picking it out from a dirt road that was virtually untraveled anyway using his hunting knife he cut a dozen more branches then pulled the car out and replaced it with the atv which instantly became swallowed by the forest when he covered it up with no idea whether or even why he might need them he added the knife to some rope and tools and two bottles of water stashed in a small backpack he had left on the seat of the chevy also in the pack were some apples and sugar cubes for the horses details at ten fortyfive when the call came in to his cell phone from the front desk at the watergate that a package had arrived for him via fedex he was walking the streets of dc breaking in a new pair of calfskin boots that needed no real breaking in and might have cost as much as the total of all the other boots he had ever owned he had chosen a messenger service on l street and had paid them well to have the messenger bring the package from the watergate to their office and then have a different messenger take the package out the back door to the lot three blocks away where gabe had parked the impala on the way there gabe gave in to his fears and frustration and tormented himself by trying alisons numbers again nothing once at the lot he ducked behind a van and scanned the street for anything or anyone unusual they couldnt have followed him here he was thinking at the same time he was picturing jim ferendelli collapsing to his knees then pitching forward onto his face they couldnt have followed him there either the messenger arrived and the exchange was quick and uneventful gabe tipped the man fifty dollars of the presidents money and then added a second fifty for the one who had picked up the package at the watergate one final check of the lot and gabe slid behind the wheel of the impala and set the package on the passenger seat it was time twentyfive miles outside the city he was convinced enough that he wasnt being followed to pull off into a rest area on i and open the package from ellen williams the carefully wrapped box consisted of a tupperware container with five sealed plastic baggies each containing two large gauze pads soaked with liquid special mixture the label on the tupperware read apply one or two as needed gabes heart told him one but his head insisted on two if things didnt work for him and drew stoddard there would not be a second chance word would get out that the president had behaved irrationally and within no time a button would be pushed by someone and the first patient would suffer either a public episode similar to the one gabe had witnessed in the white house or worse one identical to the episode he had witnessed in ferendelli with that notion grimly dominating his thoughts gabe set the package aside and checked the map drew had given him locating the stables then staying well under the speed limit he headed north to thurmont maryland and just beyond it camp david chapter im sorry the words had been spoken so softly barely more than a whisper had constanza really said them alison wondered or was it the fallout from the drugs griswold had forced into her could the woman have possibly just left her in such a horrible situation the answer of course was yes ten years that was how long constanza had been under treat griswolds control ten years battling to breathe and to keep her leg muscles from seizing up alison closed her eyes and drifted off the pain was so much more tolerable that way when she awoke after a few minutes or a few hours she was still spreadeagled on her back her wrists and ankles still tightly bound the visit from constanza had been a dream she realized despondentlyonly a chemically induced dream then she felt the knife resting in her palm slowly painfully she closed her fingers around the handle and craned her head to the right to see it was a sturdy kitchen knifeblack plastic handle serrated sixinch blade and it was almost certainly not a dream why hadnt constanza simply cut the rope the answer wasnt hard to discern alison had already experienced griswolds power and lack of caring for human life and pain he was a patient master at bending subjects to his will in less than fortyeight hours he had all but broken her what had ten years of manipulation chemicals and abuse done to constanza it seemed highly likely that the poor woman couldnt bring herself to go through with such an act of rebellion against the man who had taken her from her home before she had even reached her teens setting the knife in place was simply the best she could manage now it was alisons job to go the rest of the way for a while she lay still and listened preparing herself there was only stillnessan intense silence the house was empty she felt certain of it constanza and beatriz were gone slowly desperate not to let the blade slip away she turned the handle in her swollen stiff fingers until the serrations lay against the rope then no more than a fraction of an inch with each stroke not worrying whether she cut rope or flesh she began to saw there would be no resting she vowed no taking the chance that sleep would overcome her her muscles ached terribly and she had little strength but treat griswold had given her the power to cut through the cords he had given her the hatred twenty minutes thirty an hour alison would never know how long it took she would only know that she never stopped a fraction of an inch with each awkward stroke the blade cut through her skin but the pain was nothing compared to what she had already endured her biggest fears were that she would saw through a tendon or hit an artery at the moment when it felt like even her hatred for griswold wasnt going to be enough to keep her fingers moving the cord snapped apart she sat on the edge of the cot for a long time waiting for the dizziness to subside and for her legs to give her some sort of a sign that they were ready to bear her weight then she cut several strips of pillowcase and stanched the blood flow at her wrist finally using the bed frame for support she pushed to her feet just as quickly her legs buckled at the knees her quadriceps muscles all but spent a second try again dropped her awkwardly to the concrete floor the third time her legs wobbled then held her clothes were still neatly folded by the wall her pocketbook and wallet werent there nor was her id lanyard but there was one thing griswold had not yet disposed of or hidden one thing he hadnt counted on that she would ever need or use again with consummate effort she sat on the edge of the tawdry cot and dressed herself then once again she stood her legs were stronger this time more willing she took a step toward the staircase then halted her smile was vicious the moment she had stopped believing would ever come was here im coming for you you son of a bitch she rasped testing the battery on griswolds mistake her twoway radio then hooking it to her belt im coming for you chapter three hours to go so far so good the mantra had started up again of its own accord as gabe adjusted himself in the saddle of a muscular black stallion named grendel opened the trail map that the stable head joe rizzo had given him and headed off into the state forest to plan where he and the president might break away from his secret service guardians gabe had parked the impala in town and taken a cab to the visitors entrance to camp david then cleared for entry by the president he walked straight through the acre compound and out the guarded north entrance to the nearby stables there would probably be three agents accompanying them on their ride drew had saidall decent riders and armed with handguns that they knew quite well how to use if things went as gabe projected by the time the agents realized that their mounts were not responding to their commands to speed up and the president and his doctor werent responding to their commands to slow down they would be too confused and too far out of range to risk a shot if he was wrong about that the first shot one of the agents did take would undoubtedly be at him so far so good his concern for alison remained acute but for the moment there was nothing he could do and the task ahead was daunting there were so many variables to considerso much that could go wrong in just three hours if things went as he hoped he would have become the second most wanted man on the planet the afternoon was cool and overcast grendel was anxious to pick up the pace but responded nicely when gabe called for a walk his first goal was to determine how far out on the trail they would be after twentyfive minutes at that point with luck the secret service horses would be in no shape to match the speed with which he and drew would take off after their break from the agents on the first acceptable trail to the left the two of them would cut toward the paved road which was smudged on the map but might have been route twentyfive minutes gabe had subtracted five minutes from the thirty ellen williams had estimated in order to make up for the time it would take them to get back to the stables from where they would have mounted up at the rear entrance to camp david twentyfive minutes gabe grinned at the notion of treating this operation as if this were some sort of science the size of the horses minus twice the weight of the agents plus the rate of absorption of the williams potion squared minus the angle of the sun equaled twentyfive minutes no problem at the spot on the trail twentyfive minutes out gabe stopped grendel sharpened his hunting knife on a whetstone from his backpack and marked several trees at horsemans eye level they then proceeded at a careful walk scanning along the left tree line for an opening with luck the next time he traveled over this portion of the trail he and drew stoddard would be moving at a full gallop he felt his mouth go dry at the prospect is there any other way he asked himself for the thousandth time is there any other way now there were just three more piecesa trail going off to the left toward the highway a place to leave the horses where they would eventually be found and finally a concealed spot just off route to leave the impala gabes best guess was that the car would have to remain undiscovered by the park rangers for at least two hours if they found it and had it watched or towed some trucker would have a hell of a tale to tell about the two guys he picked up hitchhiking the first piece a trail to the left was a narrow track that had some dried hoofprints but didnt look as if it were used much it was just a few minutes from where gabe hoped he and stoddard would be leaving their possecloser than he would have liked but far enough to work and perfect in every other respect the tree marks here were critical in that he would have to see them at a gallop he made a few cuts then dismounted and built a subtle cairn of stones on the right side of the main trail ten yards before the path when the secret service men secured helpprobably in the form of some sort of fourwheeldrive vehiclehe didnt want to make the pursuit too easy once he and drew were in the car every mile they could put between themselves and the end of the path would widen the circle of possibilities the agents and police would have to consider and make it that much less likely that one of the roadblocks would snag them the final two pieces were easier to find than gabe had expected a small clearing ten feet off the path and twenty yards from the paved roadway would be the perfect place to leave the horses and a partially overgrown rest area just thirty or forty yards to the north offered some concealment for the chevy without having it appear too suspicious now there was just the matter of getting the car to the rest area from where he had left it in thurmond putting a sign on the windshield that it was disabled and awaiting a tow truck and walking back to the stables to do what he could to help the stable man get ready for the presidents early evening ride first though it was time to let patient grendel have his head gabe swung up into the saddle whispered a few words of encouragement into the stallions ear and then prodded him with a gentle nudge from his new boots the horse hesitated for a beat then shot back down the trail toward home like a missile chapter alison spotted the man parked half a block down from her apartment the moment the cabdriver from richmond taxi turned onto her street keep going she demanded ducking down onto the floor she instructed the driver on a circuitous route around several blocks and watched to ensure they werent followed then she had him pull over in front of an apartment on the next block the man in front of her place was either secret service sent there by gabe or much less likely someone put in place by griswold as the result of a change of heart on constanzas part either way alison wanted no part of him the driver took the hundred in cash they had agreed on for the trip and left the garden apartment complex by a different route alison had found the moneyfour hundred altogetherin the sock drawer of griswolds bureau as she had anticipated when she made it upstairs from the basement constanza and beatriz were gone alison gave passing thought to a thorough search of the house but in the end decided that she had neither the strength nor the time for it it sickened her even to touch his clothes he had violated her in ways as vicious dehumanizing and unfeeling as rape and somehow soon he was going to pay there was one room she did opt to visit before calling for the cabthe attic space where the bulk of the training of donald greenfields girls had taken place the room straight out of the sixties she imagined was repulsive enough so that she could only last a few minutes there circular water bed red satin sheets ceiling mirror dense psychedelic curtains various mood lights and lamps sound system and a huge hdtv with a large collection of video pornography most involving older men and girls surprisingly there were no camerasat least none that she could see she thought about the person who was blackmailing griswold if there had been a camera at some point it seemed possible even likely that the blackmailer had the film she couldnt bring herself to open any of the drawers if as she expected he would griswold burned the place to the ground the world would be the better for it during the cab ride up to arlington she tried to piece together everything she knew about the man griswold seemed once to have been a devoted effective public servant who had fallen prey to his own perversity and to someone with the intelligence to document that perversity and to force him to violate his oath as a protector of the president perhaps as his porsche second home and other activities suggested there was a payoff involved as well at this point there was no way to know griswolds mandate appeared to be the administration of psychedelic drugs to the president by way of his alupent inhaler remarkably though the drugs remained inactive until triggered by some sort of handheld transmitter thus making the commander in chief a marionette who could be caused to go insane by the push of a button ironically by another marionette it was incredible technologywell beyond griswolds ken she thought even though almost certainly it had been griswold who had stolen the blood samples gabe had placed in the clinic refrigerator unanswered at the moment was how could she provide proof of what she knew to be true and exactly who was the master puppeteer pulling griswolds strings what she knew with certainty was that she was not going to go up against a man with griswolds reputation and clout without hard no impenetrable evidence she assumed her car was in the white house parking area where she had left it the inhaler beneath her seat might get the ball rolling provided it was still there and was found to be contaminated by drugs and marked by griswolds fingerprints but she needed more than thatif there were any lessons to be learned from her la experience probably much more meanwhile she also needed to protect herself from becoming a victim once again this time in every sense of the word griswold was no less powerful and respected and probably even more ruthless than the four cs surgeons in la if she was going to bring him down and uncover the identity of his puppeteer she was going to need to move quickly and keep griswold worried and off balance she also needed help from someone she could trust and the list of people she could safely approach in that regard was shortvery short as soon as possible she and gabe had to talk alison crossed between two units and carefully approached hers through the backyard then she used her elbow and punched in a window panel in her rear door reached inside and turned the lock the neat little twobedroom had been expertly ransacked every drawer had been emptied onto the floor the rugs had been pulled up the cupboards swept clean the pillows on the living room sofa slashed open broken glass was everywhere and what few personal items she had brought up from san antonio had been destroyed could griswold possibly have figured out the switch she and lester had pulled off or was he just being thoroughlooking for anything she might have uncovered at first alison battled back tears as if griswold were watching and she didnt want to give him any satisfaction then shuffling to the bathroom to shower she finally allowed herself a thorough cleansing cry the condition of her place didnt matter she decided as she toweled off from now until her war with treat griswold was over she would not be staying herenot for a minute she found a clean pair of jeans and a navy longsleeved t then she set about looking for the only two things she needed from the place the first a spare set of keys to her car she found on the kitchen floor beneath a bowl the second was right where she had hidden ita short efficient mm glock tucked neatly in front of a kneelength nylon in one of a pair of fourinch spiked heels that she never wore for fear of breaking her ankles tucked in the other shoe also behind a rolledup stocking were two full magazines of ammunition finally she remembered that she was now in range and turned on her radio the first voice she heard was one she was listening for attention all posts griswold was saying this is special agent in charge griswold prepare for maverick departure on marine one wheels up in two hours repeat two hours before departure marine one griswold had said nothing about their destination andrews air force base camp david a speech somewhere no matter when she was ready she would find them first though she needed to contact gabe the apartment phone was still working standing amid the wreckage she took up the receiver and dialed the white house medical clinic chapter rotors just a couple of weeks had passed since the president had dropped in at his ranch for a visit gabe had been on horseback then and he was on horseback now helping joe rizzo the stable master and joes tenyearold son pete lead four horses from the stable to the rear entrance of camp david for the presidents early evening ride with his physician the difference between this ride and the many others that various presidents had taken along this trail over the years since when camp davidor shangrila as it was called before president eisenhower renamed it after his grandsonofficially became a presidential retreat was that this time the president would not be coming back in just an hour or so president andrew stoddard among the true visionaries who had ever held the office would confirm those rumors that he was mentally unstable by escaping his secret service protectors totally pleased with the horse gabe had asked permission to ride grendel again pete with whom gabe instantly connected especially after he taught the boy a couple of neat rope tricks with the lariat he had brought in the backpack promised he could make that happen with a rubdown a cooling sponge bath and an extra helping of oats joe rizzo too clearly enjoyed having a man around who was both a doctor and a cowboy when gabe checked out the horses and suggested the president might like a ride on a dapple gray thoroughbred named mr please the stable master readily agreed the horse gabe saw was long in the neck and legsa mover if ever there was one it was good money that grendel and mr please could beat the secret service horses in a straightup race to say nothing of a contest where their three opponents were floating on clouds of nembutal ketamine and fentanyl theyve landed rizzo exclaimed in his charming accent as the distant thrumming slowed then stopped it should be a very beautiful ride dr gabe a little breeze not too many bugs they wouldnt dare to bite the president of the united states anyway gabe said there was a hitching post near the rear gate to the compound gabe helped tie the horses up and then made preparations for what would be the daunting task of slipping drugsoaked gauze pads beneath the saddle blanket of each one without being seen and without having even the slightest bit of white showing from his backpack he took a pair of riding glovessomething he would never wear if he werent trying to keep himself from absorbing enough mixture through his palms to topple from his own saddle while rummaging through the backpack he eased the top off the tupperware container separated out three packets of soaked gauzetwo pads in eachand replaced the top at that instant his radio crackled to life actually startling him doc this is griswold are you there over griz gday mate im here at the rear gate got some mighty fine mounts for you over well be there in five minutes just as soon as the nurse and corpsman finish loading up the van over and out gabe felt himself go cold joe what kind of van is he talking about the medical van of course the president never goes out on the trail without three or four secret service agents and the medical van hey wait a minute arent you the doctor the new doctor gabe corrected his mind swirling ive never been out on the trail before so much for carefully contrived scientific formulas how in the hell could drew not have mentioned that there was going to be a van tagging along gabe began rapidly flipping through what little he knew about disabling cars the best he could come up with on the spot was dropping the sugar lumps he was carrying into the gas tank and hoping for the best ludicrous joe what happens with the van if we go on a narrower trail he asked the van waits where it can a couple of years ago one of the horses threw a guest and the man broke his leg the agents had to carry him back down the trail to the van no help what a mess gabe glanced at his watch even if he and drew managed to disable the horses and take off the van would be able to haul the agents back to camp in a matter of minutes the two of them might not even be in the impala before a massive pursuit began with the secret service prominently represented in marine one why in the hell did he ever think he could pull this off doc griswold here the vans all set were on our way over and out damn joe he said handing over the two apples could you give these to grendel and mr please im going to check the saddles one last time im in no mood to play doctor out there moving quickly he crossed behind the horses feigning a check of the blankets stirrups and cinches while at the same time sliding the gauze as far up under the saddle blankets as possible he was just easing the third pack into place when the presidents entourage appeared and approached the guardhouse gabe glanced at his watch and mentally started timing absorption of the drugs thirty minutes trailing behind the three agents and the president as they reached the guardhouse was a small vana mitsubishi with a nurse and corpsman inside he had met each in the white house clinic the thirty minutes were down to twentynine maybe even twentyeight stay cool gabe urged himself just stay cool and think he approached the president and shook his hand warmly why didnt you tell me about the van he whispered through nearly clenched teeth it took several precious seconds for the significance of the vehicle to register in the heat of all that planning i just never thought of it stoddard said are we dead gabe glanced over at the van from where he stood he could see the spare that was mounted on the rear i need a minute alone by the van he whispered suddenly can you get me that watch me without hesitating the president doubled over grabbed his throat and crossed unsteadily over to the entrance then using a corner of the guardhouse to brace himself he started to cough and cough the moment the agents realized what was happening they raced to him by then gabe had slid the hunting knife from his backpack a bug one of the agents called out he says a bug or a bee went down his windpipe the racking cough continuedacademy award quality gabe acknowledged now completely concealed from the agents and the medical team he set the knife handle against his chest and leaned against the sidewall of the spare with all his weight and all his strength the powerful blade easily slid through the rubber and became buried to the hilt he withdrew it and had it back in his pack when griswold called to him from beside stoddard hey doc whats going on get over here im coming im coming without bothering to explain the delay he raced over to the group all of whom were standing helplessly around the hunchedover distressed sputtering commander in chief gabe set one hand on the front and one on the back of stoddards chest its okay now mr president he whispered he applied a slight quick thrust with each hand instantly the hacking stopped stoddard sputtered once for effect then stood up smiling gone he said damn but that was scary the entourage amazed and totally impressed turned to gabe kind of a wyoming version of the heimlich maneuver he said matteroffactly now lets ride with six minutes gone they mounted and headed up the trail one tire down gabe was thinking at least one to go quickly the secret service trio dropped back allowing twenty or thirty yards to open between them and the two riders ahead nice acting job mr president gabe said just like the olden days remember those coeds from goucher this was better did you accomplish anything i disabled the spare now i have to get at one or two of the other tires and weve got a chance sorry i forgot about the van nonsense listen drew i am just so grateful you are trusting me with all this i know it isnt easy for you im scared to death with what were doing and id be just as scared if we werent doing it gabe checked the time with any luck weve got fifteen or twenty minutes the farther away we are from camp david the better if nothing happens to their horses i think we have to abort but if the sedatives kick in im going to go back there i want you to keep steadily putting distance between us ill go back to check on their horses thats when im going to try and take care of the van questions when do i take off keep drifting ahead then when you see me move you hit the gas theres a trail to the left somewhere up there thatll take us to the car ive set up a pile of stones on the right about thirty or forty feet before the trail keep an eye out for it also ive marked the trees at eye level where were supposed to turn by then i should have caught up with you id feel less frightened trying to elude my secret service people in a jet youre doing fine for some minutes the two rode in silence then gabe leaned over slightly toward his onetime roommate drew theres something i want to say i dont know how to put this in any delicate way but i want you to know that for years and years even though i havent had a drop of alcohol ive been popping pillsnever without a reason mind you headaches insomnia and the likebut you can probably guess that those reasons are more like justifications or excuses i should have told you when you came to the ranch do you really think that would have mattered to me look at all the things youve done with your life the funny thing is since i had to watch jim die and focus on what was being done to you and to the country and deal with alisons disappearance i havent wanted to take a pill no matter how tense or frightened or sleepless ive been its like jims death was a slap of perspective for mea shot across the bow of my life telling me that i wasnt doing any justice to the lost lives of that woman in fairhaven and her child by systematically destroying mine i just needed to say it before we doc this is griswold his radio boomed you two slow down and get back here theres something wrong with the horses were on stoddard exclaimed god bless ellen williams okay mr president just keep walking ahead slow and steady without bothering to respond by radio gabe gave grendels reins the slightest righthand tug and then urged him ahead the powerful animal spun like a seasoned rodeo performer and charged back down the trail gabe was pleased to see the size of the gap that had opened up between them and the agents if they were paying as much attention to the president as they were to their horses which wasnt likely it would still be hard for them to realize or to believe that he was still moving away confusion and distraction those were his biggest allies now confusion and distraction even at a distance he could see that the agents horses were in no condition to keep going two were standing still muzzles hanging down almost to the ground their riders still sitting in their saddles urging them forward the third griswolds mount was leaning against a hickory contentedly rubbing his shoulder against the shaggy bark griswold was standing by the tree looking into the horses eye but best of all both the corpsman and the nurse were out of the van checking to see if they could be of any help be calm gabe urged himself as he dismounted and led grendel toward the van be calm and look like you know what youre doing the handle of the hunting knife was in his palm the blade concealed up along his forearm would somebody go after the president griswold ordered this guy wont move one of the agents said gabe bent over and hammered the broad blade through the sidewall of the left rear tire soundlessly the van sank toward that side then get down and run griswold was shouting never mind never mind ill get him myself hey mr president stop of the three agents special agent in charge griswold was carrying the most bulk exactly what shape he was in gabe mused would be determined momentarily griswold threw off his windbreaker and started sprinting after stoddard with everyone watching griswold gabe was able to take out the right rear tire with a single adrenalinedriven thrust the van dropped to its rear end like a prizefighter who had just taken one to his glass jaw ill get him gabe hollered to no one in particular ill get him he couldnt remember the last time he had done a running mount but he never hesitated with massive grendel charging from standstill to full gallop in a single step gabe grasped the dense mane with his left hand and the saddle horn with his right and jammed his left foot into the stirrup he went to push off his right foot but he was already airborne sailing along beside the powerful horse like a streamer a second later using strength he never would have guessed he had he was upright in the saddle thundering past griswold ill get him gabe hollered up ahead the president glanced back at him and smiled then he gathered the reins and prodded the gray with a single brisk kick against the animals flanks keep going gabe shouted pulling alongside they galloped that way shoulder to shoulder for another minute before gabe spotted the marker he had built and pointed first to it then to the woods on the left where the narrow trail would materialize the president pumped his fist gabe tried to look as enthusiastic but he knew he missed he was consumed by a voice in his head that kept shouting one thing over and over what in the hell have you done chapter with the lights off the president of the united states driving and his personal physician hanging on behind the atv negotiated the crooked dirt roads and trails up flat top mountain to the aerie it was dark by the time they reached the castle and parked the fourwheeler in a concealed spot just inside the edge of the woods for a few moments the two men stood by the drawbridge over the moat and watched what were probably three helicopters and a couple of fixedwing aircraft circling off to the east we made it stoddard exclaimed i cant believe it we made it it must be absolute chaos back there in washington like i said this country is built to go from one leader to another at a moments notice and with the minimum of chaos if all that twentyfifth amendment reading i did when i first arrived in dc taught me anything it taught me that the country is and always will be bigger than any one man maybe so still id like to think im being missed right about now im sure you are youre doing an incredible job thanks speaking of missed ive got to call carol i left her an envelope of instructions including the numbers of a chief with the virginia state police whom i trust and a federal magistrate judge as well carol can contact them and they can get the warrants we need and some reliable officers to serve them theyll meet you at lilys place first thing tomorrow perfect youve been a real hero drew i cant imagine what it must be like to have to walk away from your job im certainly hoping to get it back as long as we keep you safe from those transmitters im sure you will speaking of heroes youve been one too and more youve been a hell of a friend gabe better than i deserve what an odd thing to say gabe thought nonsense he said go reassure carol that youre okay and im not a madman then i want to show you where ye olde royal physician has decreed youll be spending the night i already think i know for another minute the two remained immersed in the noisy silence of the forest trying to wrap their minds around the enormity of what they had just accomplished finally stoddard motioned gabe to stay nearby and called his wife in just a couple of minutes he passed the phone over you really think someone on our staff is behind this gabe carol stoddard asked i think someone who regularly gets physically close to drew is involved thats the most i can say and you think lily iswasinvolved too im sure of it i saw firsthand evidence when i was at her place and jim ferendelli told me himself before he was killed but but lily was one of my dearest friendslike family im sorry carol and you think she was murdered too i do alive she was a threat to someone once i discovered the laboratory tunnel from her place she became a loose end gabe this is an awful lot for me to digest i understand it would be for me too if i hadnt seen it all meet me tomorrow at lilys farm at say noon with the warrants and the men we need and youll see for yourself for the moment drew is safe and thats all that matters i suspect we can keep him safe for another twentyfour or even thirtysix hours if we need to but its just a matter of time before someone figures out where we are id rather get this business moving and over before anyone has time to react gabe waited until the first lady had nothing left to say and then mouthing the words i dont know passed the phone back to her husband i love you sweetheart stoddard said believe me gabe has done an amazing piece of work for us youll see gabe felt certain that whatever carol stoddard said wasnt a ringing endorsement of his theories or their actions thank you honey stoddard replied thanks for trusting us this much when you speak to the boys just tell them im safe and i love them nothing else though okay okay he put the phone away and turned to gabe that tunnel to the nanobot factory better be where you say it is or like ricky ricardo says to lucy were gonna have some splainin to do the two men entered the aerie youre planning on putting me in the bunker downstairs arent you drew said whoever murdered jim and lily and has been doing this to you is remorseless and resourceful if anything goes wrong i want you safe thats all i cleaned the place up last night whoever murdered jim and lily the words reopened his fears regarding alison as soon as things were resolved tomorrow he vowed to spend every minute searching for her for as long as it took i think its overkill stoddard said we pulled it off gabe we kidnapped me right from under the nose of everyone now how about a room with a view there are posters on the wall of the bunker god but i hate taking orders probably not as much as i dislike giving them weve come this far mr president lets not risk screwing everything up by getting complacent your safety is what this is all about stoddard sighed and allowed himself to be escorted downstairs to the bunker during the minutes that followed gabe felt himself hit a wall the adrenaline rush of their escape was still churning but it was merging with an intense exhaustion that his body had probably been storing up for days it was a tribute to elevenhundreddollar boots that he was barely aware of having been in them walking and riding since early that morning he trudged up the spiral stone staircase of the west tower hauling along the backpack of supplies that had served him so well the highceilinged circular bedroom was cool and comfortable gabe slipped off his boots lay on the bed and awaited the return of his exhaustion by flipping through the pages of a threeyearold copy of field stream a troutfishinginthetetons article made him profoundly homesick and he decided it would be worth petitioning the president for a replacement as soon as the warrants were handed out and the arrests began although they had never spoken about it he strongly suspected that alison would love pulling on a pair of waders and stepping into a crystal wyoming river fly rod in hand it was nearly midnight when he finally set the magazine aside and headed for the bathroom on the way the spiral metal staircase leading up to the battlements caught his eye and suddenly he wanted one last view of the magnificent panorama that had contributed to giving the castle its name not bothering with his boots he climbed up and opened the heavy door leading outside the sky was somewhat overcast but the view from the tower might have been fifty miles on a clear day he was looking mostly out to the distant west and north although there was nearly a degree panorama available it was almost by chance that he gazed directly downward when he did there past the moat at the edge of the forest he saw a figure moving furtively among the trees in an instant any fatigue he was feeling vanished stop right there he called out i can see you and i have a gun his words seemed to be swallowed by the night below the figure vanished into the forest then from gabes right he saw a second shadow moving parallel to the first these werent kids looking for mischief every fiber in his being said that whoever was down there was trouble for a minute gabe continued peering through the dark then he raced down the staircase pulled on his boots and crossed to the door he was about to open it when he glanced down at his backpack he removed the hunting knife and slipped on the pack with its rope and collection of tools then hefting the knife in his hand he slipped out of the bedroom and moved cautiously silently down the stone staircase chapter it had been stupid to yell out from the tower the way he had absolutely stupid hunting knife in hand gabe reprimanded himself as he cautiously descended to the main floor what now he tried without success to get his brain around the answer to who could have found them within just six hours drews belief that few if any outside his immediate family knew of the aerie had to have been misguided someone else knew and had put the pieces together gabe had heard that of all the investigative services including the cia and fbi the secret service was the most resourceful efficient and imaginative it wouldnt surprise him to learn that the aerie was in one of their files along with its history and maybe even some blueprints hopefully secret service agents were the ones who were laying siege to the castle right now in truth although gabe had chosen to suspect anyone and everyone as betraying drew the presidents protective detachment would have been the ones he trusted first one thing gabe was certain ofthe forms outside werent his mind playing tricks he envisioned a secret service swat team or the equivalent silently positioning themselves in the night it would take some serious work and preparation to breach the walls of the castle probably whoever was out there would take the more straightforward approach of simply setting aside stealth and blowing the massive portcullis to toothpicks what in the hell have i done gabe wondered once again the west tower staircase opened into the far end of the dining room to reach drew he would have to cross the great room to the basement staircase gabe frantically tried to reason out what there was to be gained by alerting drew before he knew what they were up against would drew agree to stay where he was until it was clear how much of a threat there was to him at least for the moment he was locked in the bunker and reasonably secure but he also had the cell phone gabe considered and quickly rejected the possibility of trying to sneak out and get down the mountain to ask for help maybe whoever was outside would be unable to breach the walls or blow up the portcullis maybe they were just kids looking for mischief maybe harsh whispers echoing from the kitchen no more than twenty feet away stopped him short how in the hell had they gotten in a siege tunnel gabe felt certain of it most medieval castles had one or more secret ways to go around or behind a besieging army to escape or to bring in supplies and weapons it would have been a surprise if eccentric bedard stoddard had not built one crackowski what in hell happened to you back there the heavy southern drawl was one gabe recognized immediately his heart stopped considered remaining that way then slowly started up again missing every few beats i smashed my fucking head in that fucking tunnel the other man crackowski said shit its bleeding thats what you get for shaving your head fuck you carl when weve taken care of business here im gonna shave your head itll be really hard to do that with a bullet through your eye now lets get this over with you take the front half out there ill take the rear any lights you find turn them on whoever yelled knows were here so were not going to take anyone by surprise one alive one dead one alive one dead jim ferendellis killer echoed gabe silently backed away and into the great room where there were some swords and a spear or two plus a number of places he could conceal himself if he understood the orders from the man named crackowski the other killer carl would be coming his way one alive one dead gabe had little trouble believing that he was the throwaway with the nanotechnology at their disposal it seemed that whoever was behind the transmitters could deal with the president any time they wanted of course it was still possible that drew was the real target and not just his presidency as ferendelli believed but like lily sexton gabe had become a dangerous loose end the two killers knew about the siege tunnel did they know about the bunker as well if drew remained locked inside getting at him would be a hell of a problem unless they were able to shut off his air with the skipped heartbeats increasing again gabe pressed himself against the wall behind the huge armored stallion and rider and forced himself to calm down and focus much as he had done over the years when faced with medical crises chances were that he was going to die but the two men were going to have to earn their kill at that moment carl moved cautiously into the great room his heavy pistol ready gabe clutched his hunting knife and tried unsuccessfully to imagine any scenario where he might have even a slight advantage he ducked down and moved deeper into the shadows behind the mannequin steed and its rider as the gunman approached fifteen feet ten five any second carl would be able to see him gabe braced himself against the armor covering the haunch of the horse and tightened his grip on the handle of the hunting knife preparing for an overhand stab between horse and rider there had to be at least two hundred pounds of steel probably more he had to bring the setup down quickly and accurately one more step just one and gabe drove his shoulder into the armor as if he were trying to take out an onrushing lineman carls reaction not unexpectedly was to whirl and fire the impact of the armor sent him stumbling backward and he fell heavily with much of the horse collapsing down on him gabe dove on top of the armor slashing randomly downward with the heavy blade again and again until he felt it hit flesh and heard carls cry then an instant later gabe was shot the bullet one of a volley of wild shots from carls pistol tore through the tissue just above gabes right hip spinning him backward and off the horse above the armor he could see the killer trying to set for another more accurate shot but through the gloom he also saw the hunting knife protruding from the mans thigh gabe managed to get his feet onto the mannequin and pushed it against the killer as hard as he could then gabe rolled over and stumbled to his feet gasping at the pain from his wound at the same moment carl was screaming you fucker you stabbed me ill kill you you fucking bastard ill kill you several more shots exploded echoing through the vast hall dragging his leg gabe lurched toward the dining room and headed for the short stairway leading up to the second level away from where he suspected the other gunman crackowski would be coming his jeans were rapidly soaking through with blood and he felt blood dripping down into his boot still no matter what he had gotten one in for jim ferendelli the pain from his wound was intense but manageable using the stone banister he hauled himself up to the second floor and around to the balcony surrounding the empty pool from twelve feet above it was easy to imagine drew his father and his grandfather as well as family and friends jumping and diving from the balcony into the pool which included drew had told him an overhead grid of pipes used to simulate a rainstorm on cue in fact the pipes were still there illuminated to some extent by light reflecting off the clouds and coming through a glass canopy as large as the pool with the glimmer of an idea beginning to form gabe ignored the burning pain in his hip and managed to stand on the balcony wall propping himself against one of the pillars that supported the glass canopy then he tested the main pipe which seemed solidly anchored to a metal frame that came down from the roof whether or not it could hold more than double a mans weight was anyones guess but that was what he would be asking it to do the knife was gone and he was hardly mobile enough to go foraging for another weapon but he did have a weaponat least a potential onein his backpack and he knew damn well how to use it carefully he removed the rope he had used to entertain and educate the stable masters son peteforty feet of excellent lariat cord purchased in the store where gabe had gotten his boots then he took one end and swung it over the pipe finally he tied that end around his waist and used it and the descending length to test the pipe and lower himself back to the balcony floor no problem it would be a hell of a throw but somewhere in a box in his basement were dozens of tarnished trophies that said he could make it spent from the pain and the effort gabe sank onto the stone floor of the balcony and waited trying not to gasp out loud with each breath it seemed likely that when carl was upright the two killers would separate again the knife wound to carls leg would have them angry anxious and even a little shakena recipe for error all gabe could hope for now was that one of them didnt come up to the balcony he shifted his position and felt a daggerlike pain from his wound into his groin he was about to check to see if there was an exit hole when he heard noise and sensed movement from below peering between the cement balustrades he could make out a mans form moving cautiously along the pool no limp then light through the canopy glinted off his shaved pate crackowski gabe shifted again checked the knot that fixed the lariat around his waist then the slipknot he had tied at the business end of the rope a glance overhead to ensure everything was in place and he gathered in the slack moved into an agonizing crouch and waited as a step at a time the killer headed toward the spot just beneath where the rope looped over the rain pipe under ordinary circumstances gabe knew he could make the throw ten times out of tenbut that was without walls behind him and overhead and allowing for a few warmup spins and finally provided the subject to be roped wasnt holding a gun this time gabe would have one chance and only one a miss and he would be trying to outrun a professional gunman on a leg that was barely functional he hefted the lasso and tried to imagine the moves he would make to close the loop as he was dropping over the balcony wall using crackowski as counterweight to keep him from smashing to the concrete poolside just another sunday hangin in dodge no mercy he pleaded with himself no mercy no hesitation he took a step back then leaned over the balcony swung the lasso once to open a small loop and floated it around the killers head before crackowski could react gabe toppled off the balcony grasping the rope from the rain pipe with all his strength the drop was rapid the snapping neck sickening and crackowskis death instantaneous gabe hit the concrete floor with force but only enough to stun him he released the rope still tied to his waist the killer crumpled to the floor beside him the stench of excrement already filling the air for most of a minute gabe stayed dazed on the floor trying to orient himself from what he knew had to be a concussion finally thoughts and images of carl worked themselves into his hazy consciousness intermixed with images of gabes high school coach kneeling over him administering smelling salts and asking if he knew where he was and if he was able to go back into the game he had to move carl was painfully wounded but he was mobile and he had a gun for a moment gabe became excited about finding crackowskis pistol then he vaguely remembered seeing it clatter down into the empty pool had that really happened groaning with every movement he crawled to the edge of the concrete hole and peered down he could barely make out what he thought was the bottom and could not discern anything else perhaps he was wrong maybe the gun was still nearby maybe it was under crackowskis body gabe knew he wasnt thinking clearly but he was unable to focus any better his head was pounding and the wound beside his hip made turning especially unpleasant he crawled over to crackowskis body the killers eyes were bulging nearly out of his head and his protruding tongue looked like a plum blocking out the odor gabe rolled the corpse over once then again no gun still trying to shake the fog from his brain he tried to rise then fell back to his knees when he turned back to the pool carl was standing there watching him curiously his heavy pistol resting loosely in his hand now this heres a scene you just dont see every day he drawled the jolt of adrenaline dispelled gabes fogginess like sunlight that knife in your thigh hurt he asked not nearly as much as youre going to such a wit from time to time gabe wondered what his patients might have been feeling at the moment of their death now he acknowledged that it really wasnt all that bad carl whatever his last name was was going to pull the trigger and gabe singleton wasnt going to exist anymore it was as simple as that stand up im not going to make it easy carl gabe was thinking i promise you im not do i look like i can stand up he said stand up or i swear ill shoot through every joint in your body starting from the toes up gabe had heard enough let it end here he was thinking let it end here for both of us without hesitation he planted the right toe of his boot and drove his head with all his remaining strength into the mans groin carl went over the edge of the pool backward with gabe clinging to him like a chimpanzee to its mother somewhere during the fall there might have been a gunshot gabe felt another tearing painthis one through his shoulder then there was a fearsome impact with air exploding from his lungs then there was nothing chapter stilettoes of bright light penetrated gabes lids and pierced his eyes he felt himself coming to like a patient in the recovery room following major surgery only without any analgesia bit by bit he was able to catalogue the pain his right hip was throbbing but no less than his left shoulder the top of his head and space behind his eyes were like cardiac monitors recording every heartbeat with a totally unpleasant pulsation bile and acid grated across the back of his throat he opened his eyes a slit squinting at the glare and was surprised to see the chandeliers and tattered pennants of the great room bit by bit visions of his struggles with the two killers came into focus he forced his eyes to open wider quite a mess you made in there doc you should have seen ol carls brains splattered all over the bottom of that pool gabe stiffened but made no attempt to turn toward the voice there was no need do you think youll be in line for another performance citation for this griswold gabe asked we each gotta do what we each gotta do and you just gotta destroy the life of the man youve sworn to protect with no small discomfort gabe rolled over and managed to get up to his hands and kneesactually his hand and knees his left shoulder simply refused to bear much weight there was a highbacked dark wood chair not far away he crawled to it and pulled himself up with no help from griswold blood was congealing in gabes jeans and shirt dont tell me about destroying lives griswold snapped two kills before you went to prison another two kills here youre like a death machine ill bet youre murder on your patients enough mr griswold a familiar authoritative voice said from the shadows of the columns at the end of the room ill take over from here carrying a large thin case lemar stoddard stepped into the light gabe stared at the man in utter disbelief his mind unwilling to accept the magnitude of what he was witnessing first the hit men then treat griswold and finally at the top of the pyramid the first father i assume the president is downstairs in the bunker lemar said gabe shook his head in utter disgust and dismay unless im missing something gabe replied that president you speak of is also your son stoddard wearing khakis and a nautical windbreaker strode regally across the hall set the oddly shaped case down and positioned himself to griswolds left six or seven feet in front of gabe his eyes were a piercing electric blue and gabe felt slightly unsettled before their power he also felt confused and on edge the list of people he had been worried about did not include drews father although strangely at this moment especially after spending some time with the man gabe wasnt finding the notion all that hard to believe i assure you doctor no one knows that fact better than i then why are you trying to kill him not kill him why would i ever want to do that i love him i just cant have him spend another four years imposing his version of communism on the people of this country so you want us all to believe that he is going insane in a manner of speaking yes in another manner of speaking he is kurt vonnegut once wrote we are what we pretend to be so your son behaving as if he were insane means that he is precisely oh thats just sweet but dad vice president cooper shares almost all of drews political philosophy and the polls say he would probably beat dunleavy if the election were held today ah but the election is not being held today stoddard said as if the obvious were a revelation by the time president stoddards mental instability is exposed and he is forced to drop out of the race the election will be almost upon us in the resultant chaos i feel certain that the american voters led by the resurgent religious right and others in the silent majority will cast their lots heavily with president dunleavy so these episodes your son has been having are merely experiments to work out the most effective combination of medications lemar finished the sentence drugs gabe corrected not medications drugshallucinogenic debilitating deadly drugs that you have been feeding into the body of your only child and just because he went and changed parties and politics on you that is really disgusting politically expedient yes lemar said but hardly disgusting we have been playing political tricks on our candidates for as long as there have been candidates for the first time his speech seemed somewhat pressured as if his own rhetoric was getting more and more difficult for him to believe and to express gabe forced himself to meet the moguls imperious gaze something isnt right gabe was thinking the man seemed perfectly capable of vindictiveness that was a given but the extent to which he was taking revenge on his son seemed out of proportion to the hurt drews political metamorphosis had probably caused lemar it was as if he had chosen to retaliate against a fly with an elephant gun something isnt right something in that exact moment gabe took note of the way the man was dressedhis shoes his slacks his designer shirt his carefully pressed windbreaker they were the sort of clothes gabe had seen recentlyvery recently thoughts that had been freefloating suddenly began dropping into place those were your clothes i saw in the closet at lilys farm werent they gabe said suddenly or should i say your farm i dont know what youre you were her loverher sugar daddy you were the one who pushed the president and your daughterinlaw to nominate her for the new cabinet post just in case for any reason your scheme failed and your son got elected nonsense lemar said but his lie was a weak one but why gabe went on why no wait wait ill tell you why because you own that underground lab thats why the greatest medical nanotechnology scientists the world has to offer all brought together in secrecy and under one roof if the scientific world is still at alpha in the area of nanodrug delivery you and your operation are approaching omega youve lapped the field dad monopolies are us lemar moved to deny the conclusion then finally just took a step back his arms folded across his chest his expression proud youve learned a great deal in a remarkably short amount of time doctor gabe wasnt nearly done how much did that underground bastion of science and all those geniuses cost you to buy and develop dad it had to be what billions tens of billions as i recall forbes doesnt think you have quite that much what did you do to get the money how leveraged are you dad stop that you rolled the dice on this didnt you being in the top ten or top twenty wasnt enough you wanted to be numero unothe czar of the largest pharmaceutical empire the world has ever known and your liberal sons platform of government control of nanotechnology would have forced you and your lab out into the open before you were ready how many years will be lost if his policies are implemented lemar how much of your money will go down the drain most of it all of it how many secrets will you have to share with the scientific community if your son gets reelected this was never about political ideologies how foolish of me to think it was lemar stoddard seemed suddenly restless his demeanor less confident was he squinting i need you gabe he blurted out suddenly what i need you i can make you rich beyond your imagination need me for what i need you to keep quiet about what youve learned and i need you to tell the world when its time that the rumors are true and the president and vice president have been deceiving the american public about the presidents mental health it was all about money gabe said ignoring the plea completely not one whit of political principle just money lily sexton was your lover your confidante did you just pick up the phone and order her killed because she had become a liability which of those animals did you pick to do the job crackowski carl thats ridiculous is it you arrogant sonofabitch how many laughs have you gotten out of the irony that the very fullerenes and nanotubes that are going to make you rich beyond even your standards are the tools you and your stooge there used to deliver toxic chemicals to your sons brain you ungrateful little turd lemar bellowed his face suddenly flushed his voice up half an octave after all i did for you when you were in such troublethe money the attorneys the payoffs to reduce your sentence to the minimum yes my naïve friend there were payoffs and and now too convincing the president to bring you to washington my apartment my car the rhythmic squinting seemed more noticeable now and his cheeks were nearly crimson gabe thought back to all the pills the tycoon was taking for high blood pressure take them back lemar gabe said the car the apartmentthe price tag is way too high ttake it from me gabe this president is not worthy of his office what is going on with his speech the voters are supposed to decide that dad gabe said you dont understand i tell you this presidency is not worth saving let me reason with him griswold cut in brandishing his pistol i promise hell come to understand no you creep a womans voice cried out from the side of the hall i promise youll come to understand from the corridor to the portcullis alison stepped into the room her pistol leveled at griswold from perhaps twentyfive feet away alison gabe cried out set the gun down griswold set it on the floor and kick it away hard griswold seemed to be weighing his options then slowly he did as alison demanded as you wish maam he muttered my my my my my you should never have left me my radio griz i caught up with you when you left all the others and flew back from camp david to the white house seemed fishy then seems fishy now those naughty girls griswold said smiling in a most unsettling way they know perfectly well that insubordination will not be tolerated i think a spanking is in order now if you will be so kind agent cromartie it is my turn to demand that you put down your gun he lifted up his left hand to display a transmitter what do you expect to do with that alison asked expect to do well for starters i expect to push these buttons here and release the chemicals that my trusty inhaler deposited along your brain stem and other areas in your cute little noggin enough chemicals i would say to blow your mindliterally and figuratively many times more than what weve been giving to the prez drop the transmitter griswold or i swear ill put a bullet between your eyes from there in the heat of battle with a dainty little what have you got a glock a glock twentysix maybe you must be kidding at this range with your hand shaking like a leaf and death staring you in the face in the form of me youd be lucky to hit the wall behind me now im going to count to three put your gun on the floor or i push these buttonsall of em at once one two three griswold depressed the buttons on the transmitter his narrow eyes widened they widened even more when alison held up the baggie containing the presidents inhaler guess what this is she said you never should have let that pickpocket at your garage in fredericksburg get away he made the switch you pig the alupent you almost killed me with was nothing more than thatalupent im glad you pushed those buttons though that makes this selfdefense you fucking bi griswold reaching for a pistol in his belt got no further alison dropped to one knee extended both arms aimed and fired the glock oncejust once instantly a perfect hole materialized in the center of griswolds expansive forehead he stared at alison in utter disbelief until life had faded completely from his eyes then he pitched facefirst to the stone floor its not going to come down to your word against mine griswold alison was thinking savagely not this time not ever she walked cautiously over to the agent and nudged his corpse with her foot then she turned to gabe and quickly surveyed his wounds dont worry honey she said embracing him im not always this disagreeable well get you to a hospital right away well get you put back together alison meet lemar stoddard drews loving father he didnt have enough money so i heard back there gabe pplease listen to me lemar said miss yyou listen too listen and youll both work with me llisten and youll see that the the president isnt fit for his office i ppromise you will he bent down and retrieved the oddly shaped leather case from next to treat griswolds corpse gabe sighed i cant think of anything you could possibly say that i would want to hear dad but go ahead the squinting and stuttering continued something was going on inside lemars head gabe was sensing something very bad the mans blood pressure had to be off the chart okay then stoddard went on hheres what i have to say you werent driving the car that killed that woman and her unborn child that night in fairhaven the man sleeping downstairs in the bunker was thats impossible but even as he uttered the kneejerk response gabe knew that lemars statement was not only possible it was true blackthorn had warned him and his own instincts had told him drew was lying about somethingsomething important your llife has been ruined by by an accident that the the president was guilty of yyou were in an alcoholinduced blackout that night but the president wasnt hhe knew what had happened hhe knew who was driving the two of you were ffound down an embankment in a muddy ditch a hhundred feet from the accident you hhad a bad hhead injury and no memory whatsoever the stuttering thick speech and blinking were worsening i cant believe drew would be aware of what happened and not say anything he he was ffrightened of the consequences if he confessed he he asked me to help i couldnt say no he was my son i saved his lifehis his career i took care of what policemen i had to and and then look what andrew did he has made me look like a fool all these years a ffool and now he is threatening to ttake everything from meeverything lemars speech was intensely rushed and pressured now and the slurring of his speech was more pronounced he was still animated and speaking with his hands but gabe could see now that his right arm was not moving nearly as much as his left in fact it was barely moving at all lemar later i did what i ccould to be certain it didnt go too hhard for you ii got you the best lawyers ii talked to the judge on the case and hhelped him with a little matter ii got you the minimum sentence possible his stroke was clearly evolving now his speech thicker and more forced his arm was hanging limp mr stoddard alison said urgently racing to support the man before he fell over but lemar stoddard ranted on making his tongue and his lips form thick clumsy words it seemed by the sheer power of his will i have proof i have proof what he did he began fumbling with the brass zipper on the case all the while muttering i have proof i have proof his leg gave way completely so that alison could no longer bear his weight gently she lowered him to the floor gabe was out of his chair now kneeling beside the man he checked the pulses in lemars carotid arteries both were present i think hemorrhage not clot he said to alison but i guess it could still be either the case the case gabe slid back the zipper and removed a large sealed heavy plastic bag containing the steering wheel from a caran old car there were smudges of powder in various spots from the accident he asked the car you bborrowed only his fingerpprints none yours kept in a safe all these years lemar stoddard could speak no more his eyes closed and his head lolled to one side spittle appeared at the corner of his mouth alison took her jacket and folded it between his ear and the floor his breathing became deep and sonorous gabe slipped the steering wheel back into its case and stood up painfully then he held alison closely i was so sure something had happened to you nothing that matters now she said stroking his hair away from his forehead do you want to call the cops he asked will you be all right for now ive got to go downstairs and have a serious talk with the man in the bunker chapter gabe only had to push the electronic buzzer by the bunker door once in seconds a narrow panel in the center of the door slid open hey doc the president said fully awake with the immediacy and clarity of an emergency physician or a head of state why so early weve had visitors drew but its okay now the threats over the heavy bolt on the inside slid open in the dim light it took several seconds for the extent of gabes injuries to register stoddard quickly helped him inside and into a chair were they after me stoddard asked not really gabe replied they were after me i knew too much and i slept through the whole thing probably just as well stoddard wearing cotton pajamas and a light robe poured some water for each of them tell me he said uncertain how much longer he could remain upright gabe gave a terse though complete account of the attack on the aerie by two killers employed to protect the secrecy of a massive scientific facility exclusively owned and run by drews father the two men are both dead you did that i dont even want to think about it treat griswold is dead too the president looked surprised but not shocked you again alison she was following him he tried to kill her im glad shes all right no thanks to griswold he tortured her but she escaped we can talk more about that later turns out griswold was the one we came here to get away fromthe one with the transmitter your father had found a way to blackmail him into poisoning you griswold kidnapped young girls from mexico and kept them for his pleasure treat and my father stoddard said who can you trust well clearly not them i wish i were more stunned to learn it was my father is he still alive for the moment initially theres no way to know with strokes and his is a big one dad had that heliport built on the roof the aerie was so well constructed that almost no shoring up had to be done ill call rescue do that tell them they may have to make two trips how bad are you hurt for someone whos been shot twice and bashed around not so bad will lemar make it he might no matter what his life as master of all he surveys is over given the best hell have to look forward to i think he would opt for a quick end im sorry no matter what hes still my father it doesnt seem like he ever had his priorities straight well my friend you certainly have gone above and beyond the hippocratic oath in this one gabe shifted in his seat to find a position he could handle for a few minutes more drew im not sure how much longer i can remain upright but before we go upstairs i want you to have this he handed over lemars case and the president opened it peered in at its contents then slowly pulled the zipper closed from fairhaven your father got ahold of it after the accident he says your fingerprints are all over it none of mine i was going to speak to you about fairhaven after this businessthe electionwas over stoddard said its been hard for me drew its been hard for me i i was so frightened of my father that night of what might happen turns out he knew all the time he said you petitioned him to keep you out of trouble i well maybe i did its been a long time gee its been just that long since i was in prison and i remember every detail of every day i spent there drew i remember my father being too ashamed to speak to me right up until the day he died i remember going to aa meetings and lying to everyone by saying i was clean and sober when i couldnt stop popping pills all the time youre fortunate that your blackout seems to have been more selective and lasted much longer than mine i tried to make up for what i did by the way i conducted my life the country is grateful to you youve been a hell of a president are you going to go public with what i did you know i wont have a prayer at getting reelected if you do i dont know drew right now i dont know anything except that im almost fiftythree years old and more than half my life has been lived under the cloud of two murders i didnt commit stoddard crossed to where his jeans were hanging and from the pocket pulled an envelope folded in half this letter reached me soon after i was elected four years ago i was going to give it to you when i told you about the accident then right before i left for camp david yesterday i took it with me gabe took the envelope and extracted a single sheet of plain typing paper written in pen in uneven print mr president irina kursova and i were ready to get married when she was killed by a car you were in my son dimitri in her womb died also i cannot find the man singleton who was the driver with you that night if i could i would kill him i know you are protecting him but if you send his address to milton care of nolan street annapolis i will do the rest the man who tried to kill metwice gabe said someone must have showed him that article in the paper announcing i had joined your team after all these years suddenly there i was back in town his name isnt milton its leon leon uretsky he works as a baker in bowie the address belongs to friends of his the secret service found him pretty easily but aside from a few threats there wasnt anything they could do i didnt know he had gone after you until you told me about the attempted shootings you could have told me about this letter when you flew to tyler drew gabe said wearily you could have told me a number of things that you chose not to im sorry truly i am more than thirty years such pain to want to kill even after thirty years did this man ever marry not as far as i know i want his contact information drew i want it as soon as you can get it to me gabe listen i and you know what else i want i want you to find him and go to him but tomorrow drew i want you to find leon uretsky and go to him and tell him that it was you who was driving that night do that or i swear you will have made the decision for me and im going straight to the papers and anyone else who will listen but youre going to see him too yes if hell let me he and i need to talk we need to talk about pain and loss we need to talk about you it will finish me gabe if this gets out it will finish me and everything i have stood for maybe gabe pulled himself up and hobbled toward the door maybe it will chapter it was the first time gabe had been in fairhaven maryland since the accident working off a mapquest printout he removed his sling and negotiated the streets through a steady drizzle his mood was as somber as the evening in the trunk of his rented honda his bags were packed in the early morning he would leave alison in the hotel room they were sharing and head to the airport for the trip home to wyoming three days had passed since the nightmare at the aerie he had not returned to the white house nor did he ever intend to enter the place again he had spoken to the president only long enough to ensure that he had honored gabes demand to personally visit leon uretsky it had required more than an hour in the operating room to debride the wounds in gabes hip and shoulder gratefully there was nothing critical to repair and he left the hospital twelve hours later after that he had spent as much time as possible with alison when he wasnt giving statements to the investigators from the secret service and police what alisons plans were after everything was cleared up remained uncertain but he was hopeful they would somehow include him the shot that had brought down treat griswold she told himthe improbable remarkable shotwas one she had made over and over in her mind as she lay tied up humiliated and in continuous agony in the basement of the house on beechtree road during those endless hours what little hope she hung on to became focused in that shot none of the hundreds she imagined ever missed its mark several times during the nights they had spent together gabe held her and dried her tears at the notion of having taken a life the way she dideven one as monstrous as treat griswolds the story she shared of her battles in la to clear the name of a fellow nurse and also her subsequent torture at the hands of griswold more than justified her actions in gabes eyes but there were tears nonetheless gabes own reaction to having killed the men sent to kill him was far more temperedcertainly less anguished than on the two occasions in his life as a physician when his decisions forced during raging medical emergencies contributed to the death of a patient pine grove cemetery with a heaviness in his heart and even some trepidation gabe left his car on the street and entered the small cemetery through a wroughtiron arch using a cane for support in his other hand he carried a single rose through the gloom and the persistent drizzle he could make out the silhouette of a man standing motionless by one of the stones thirty years the man about gabes height but thinner had his head bowed he looked up as gabe approached his face was narrow his posture proud singleton gabe all right if you wish gabe i accept you calling me leon uretsky spoke with just the hint of a russian accent and eastern european phrasing thank you for seeing me like this i have twice tried to kill you meeting you seems the least i could do im glad you werent so good with your guns the truth is doctor i am quite good i was a marksman in the russian army before i moved here at age twentyfive the weapons i used those two times were mine bought some years ago for target practice to stay sharp for all those years i thought about revenge then at the last minute both times i just could not do it thirty years ago i could have i believe i tried to find you after you left prison but i was a recent immigrant and had little means each trail took me no place and cost me money finally i just gave up but i never forgot then when a friend showed me the article about you he was unable to continue gabe moved a step nearer to uretsky unsure whether the moisture on his own cheeks was from the drizzle or from his eyes one thing was certain in that instant he felt an indescribable closeness to the man you loved her very much gabe said i was put on this earth to love her uretsky replied he motioned to the headstone which had both the names irina kursova and dimitri uretsky inscribed and i believed you took her from me her and my son we had no right to drink like we did and no right to drink at all then drive no one does you sent the president out to see me because you knew id never believe you if you told me he was the one do you believe me now i do for thirty years i have had to live with irinas and dimitris deaths if not as painfully as you have then nearly so stoddard did you a deep wrong not to tell the truth from the beginning i agree i cant begin to tell you what getting kicked out of college and then spending a year in a maximumsecurity prison was like in some ways though leon you have broken the spiral of tragedy by your unwillingness to take my life there is nothing more wonderful you could have done for your irina perhaps uretsky said perhaps you are right are you still leaving as you said on the phone i am first thing in the morning i have had enough of washington and politics do you think we should let the public know the secret of the man they have entrusted with their country i havent really decided you i need to thinkto go back to baking my bread and to think irina had only been in this country for six months when she died she had already made great progress with her english i think we should keep in touch you and ispeak every week or two i would like to get to know you
