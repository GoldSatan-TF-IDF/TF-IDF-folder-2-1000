the grapes of wrath by john steinbeck to carol who willed this book to tom who lived it chapter to the red country and part of the gray country of oklahoma the last rains came gently and they did not cut the scarred earth the plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks the last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover in the last part of may the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated the sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet the clouds appeared and went away and in a while they did not try any more the weeds grew darker green to protect themselves and they did not spread any more the surface of the earth crusted a thin hard crust and as the sky became pale so the earth became pale pink in the red country and white in the gray country in the watercut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams gophers and ant lions started small avalanches and as the sharp sun struck day after day the leaves of the young corn became less stiff and erect they bent in a curve at first and then as the central ribs of strength grew weak each leaf tilted downward then it was june and the sun shone more fiercely the brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs the weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots the air was thin and the sky more pale and every day the earth paled in the roads where the teams moved where the wheels milled the ground and the hooves of the horses beat the ground the dirt crust broke and the dust formed every moving thing lifted the dust into the air a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his waist and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it the dust was long in settling back again when june was half gone the big clouds moved up out of texas and the gulf high heavy clouds rainheads the men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind and the horses were nervous while the clouds were up the rainheads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared in the dust there were drop craters where the rain had fallen and there were clean splashes on the corn and that was all a gentle wind followed the rain clouds driving them on northward a wind that softly clashed the drying corn a day went by and the wind increased steady unbroken by gusts the dust from the roads fluffed up and spread out and fell on the weeds beside the fields and fell into the fields a little way now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust and the wind felt over the earth loosened the dust and carried it away the wind grew stronger the rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the fields and drove gray plumes into the air like sluggish smoke the corn threshed the wind and made a dry rushing sound the finest dust did not settle back to earth now but disappeared into the darkening sky the wind grew stronger whisked under stones carried up straws and old leaves and even little clods marking its course as it sailed across the fields the air and the sky darkened and through them the sun shone redly and there was a raw sting in the air during a night the wind raced faster over the land dug cunningly among the rootlets of the corn and the corn fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the roots were freed by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind the dawn came but no day in the gray sky a red sun appeared a dim red circle that gave a little light like dusk and as that day advanced the dusk slipped back toward darkness and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn men and women huddled in their houses and they tied handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out and wore goggles to protect their eyes when the night came again it was black night for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards now the dust was evenly mixed with the air an emulsion of dust and air houses were shut tight and cloth wedged around doors and windows but the dust came in so thinly that it could not be seen in the air and it settled like pollen on the chairs and tables on the dishes the people brushed it from their shoulders little lines of dust lay at the door sills in the middle of that night the wind passed on and left the land quiet the dustfilled air muffled sound more completely than fog does the people lying in their beds heard the wind stop they awakened when the rushing wind was gone they lay quietly and listened deep into the stillness then the roosters crowed and their voices were muffled and the people stirred restlessly in their beds and wanted the morning they knew it would take a long time for the dust to settle out of the air in the morning the dust hung like fog and the sun was as red as ripe new blood all day the dust sifted down from the sky and the next day it sifted down an even blanket covered the earth it settled on the corn piled up on the tops of the fence posts piled up on the wires it settled on roofs blanketed the weeds and trees the people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their noses from it and the children came out of the houses but they did not run or shout as they would have done after a rain men stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn drying fast now only a little green showing through the film of dust the men were silent and they did not move often and the women came out of the houses to stand beside their mento feel whether this time the men would break the women studied the mens faces secretly for the corn could go as long as something else remained the children stood near by drawing figures in the dust with bare toes and the children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and women would break the children peeked at the faces of the men and women and then drew careful lines in the dust with their toes horses came to the watering troughs and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust after a while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant then the women knew that they were safe and that there was no break then they asked whatll we do and the men replied i dont know but it was all right the women knew it was all right and the watching children knew it was all right women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole the women went into the houses to their work and the children began to play but cautiously at first as the day went forward the sun became less red it flared down on the dustblanketed land the men sat in the doorways of their houses their hands were busy with sticks and little rocks the men sat stillthinkingfiguring chapter a huge red transport truck stood in front of the little roadside restaurant the vertical exhaust pipe muttered softly and an almost invisible haze of steelblue smoke hovered over its end it was a new truck shining red and in twelveinch letters on its sidesoklahoma city transport company its double tires were new and a brass padlock stood straight out from the hasp on the big black doors inside the screened restaurant a radio played quiet dance music turned low the way it is when no one is listening a small outlet fan turned silently in its circular hole over the entrance and flies buzzed excitedly about the doors and windows butting the screens inside one man the truck driver sat on a stool and rested his elbows on the counter and looked over his coffee at the lean and lonely waitress he talked the smart listless language of the roadsides to her i seen him about three months ago he had a operation cut somepin out i forget what and shedoesnt seem no longer than a week i seen him myself looked fine then hes a nice sort of a guy when he aint stinko now and then the flies roared softly at the screen door the coffee machine spurted steam and the waitress without looking reached behind her and shut it off outside a man walking along the edge of the highway crossed over and approached the truck he walked slowly to the front of it put his hand on the shiny fender and looked at the no riders sticker on the windshield for a moment he was about to walk on down the road but instead he sat on the running board on the side away from the restaurant he was not over thirty his eyes were very dark brown and there was a hint of brown pigment in his eyeballs his cheek bones were high and wide and strong deep lines cut down his cheeks in curves beside his mouth his upper lip was long and since his teeth protruded the lips stretched to cover them for this man kept his lips closed his hands were hard with broad fingers and nails as thick and ridged as little clam shells the space between thumb and forefinger and the hams of his hands were shiny with callus the mans clothes were newall of them cheap and new his gray cap was so new that the visor was still stiff and the button still on not shapeless and bulged as it would be when it had served for a while all the various purposes of a capcarrying sack towel handkerchief his suit was of cheap gray hardcloth and so new that there were creases in the trousers his blue chambray shirt was stiff and smooth with filler the coat was too big the trousers too short for he was a tall man the coat shoulder peaks hung down on his arms and even then the sleeves were too short and the front of the coat flapped loosely over his stomach he wore a pair of new tan shoes of the kind called army last hobnailed and with halfcircles like horseshoes to protect the edges of the heels from wear this man sat on the running board and took off his cap and mopped his face with it then he put on the cap and by pulling started the future ruin of the visor his feet caught his attention he leaned down and loosened the shoelaces and did not tie the ends again over his head the exhaust of the diesel engine whispered in quick puffs of blue smoke the music stopped in the restaurant and a mans voice spoke from the loudspeaker but the waitress did not turn him off for she didnt know the music had stopped her exploring fingers had found a lump under her ear she was trying to see it in a mirror behind the counter without letting the truck driver know and so she pretended to push a bit of hair to neatness the truck driver said they was a big dance in shawnee i heard somebody got killed or somepin you hear anything no said the waitress and she lovingly fingered the lump under her ear outside the seated man stood up and looked over the cowl of the truck and watched the restaurant for a moment then he settled back on the running board pulled a sack of tobacco and a book of papers from his side pocket he rolled his cigarette slowly and perfectly studied it smoothed it at last he lighted it and pushed the burning match into the dust at his feet the sun cut into the shade of the truck as noon approached in the restaurant the truck driver paid his bill and put his two nickels change in a slot machine the whirling cylinders gave him no score they fix em so you cant win nothing he said to the waitress and she replied guy took the jackpot not two hours ago threeeighty he got how soon you gonna be back by he held the screen door a little open weekten days he said got to make a run to tulsa an i never get back soon as i think she said crossly dont let the flies in either go out or come in so long he said and pushed his way out the screen door banged behind him he stood in the sun peeling the wrapper from a piece of gum he was a heavy man broad in the shoulders thick in the stomach his face was red and his blue eyes long and slitted from having squinted always at sharp light he wore army trousers and high laced boots holding the stick of gum in front of his lips he called through the screen well dont do nothing you dont want me to hear about the waitress was turned toward a mirror on the back wall she grunted a reply the truck driver gnawed down the stick of gum slowly opening his jaws and lips wide with each bite he shaped the gum in his mouth rolled it under his tongue while he walked to the big red truck the hitchhiker stood up and looked across through the windows could ya give me a lift mister the driver looked quickly back at the restaurant for a second didnt you see the no riders sticker on the winshield surei seen it but sometimes a guyll be a good guy even if some rich bastard makes him carry a sticker the driver getting slowly into the truck considered the parts of this answer if he refused now not only was he not a good guy but he was forced to carry a sticker was not allowed to have company if he took in the hitchhiker he was automatically a good guy and also he was not one whom any rich bastard could kick around he knew he was being trapped but he couldnt see a way out and he wanted to be a good guy he glanced again at the restaurant scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend he said the hitchhiker flopped down out of sight and clung to the door handle the motor roared up for a moment the gears clicked in and the great truck moved away first gear second gear third gear and then a high whining pickup and fourth gear under the clinging man the highway blurred dizzily by it was a mile to the first turn in the road then the truck slowed down the hitchhiker stood up eased the door open and slipped into the seat the driver looked over at him slitting his eyes and he chewed as though thoughts and impressions were being sorted and arranged by his jaws before they were finally filed away in his brain his eyes began at the new cap moved down the new clothes to the new shoes the hitchhiker squirmed his back against the seat in comfort took off his cap and swabbed his sweating forehead and chin with it thanks buddy he said my dogs was pooped out new shoes said the driver his voice had the same quality of secrecy and insinuation his eyes had you oughtn to take no walk in new shoeshot weather the hiker looked down at the dusty yellow shoes didnt have no other shoes he said guy got to wear em if he got no others the driver squinted judiciously ahead and built up the speed of the truck a little goin far uhuh id a walked her if my dogs wasnt pooped out the questions of the driver had the tone of a subtle examination he seemed to spread nets to set traps with his questions lookin for a job he asked no my old man got a place forty acres hes a cropper but we been there a long time the driver looked significantly at the fields along the road where the corn was fallen sideways and the dust was piled on it little flints shoved through the dusty soil the driver said as though to himself a fortyacre cropper and he aint been dusted out and he aint been tractored out course i aint heard lately said the hitchhiker long time said the driver a bee flew into the cab and buzzed in back of the windshield the driver put out his hand and carefully drove the bee into an air stream that blew it out of the window croppers going fast now he said one cat takes and shoves ten families out cats all over hell now tear in and shove the croppers out hows your old man hold on his tongue and his jaws became busy with the neglected gum turned it and chewed it with each opening of his mouth his tongue could be seen flipping the gum over well i aint heard lately i never was no hand to write nor my old man neither he added quickly but the both of us can if we want been doing a job again the secret investigating casualness he looked out over the fields at the shimmering air and gathering his gum into his cheek out of the way he spat out the window sure have said the hitchhiker thought so i seen your hands been swingin a pick or an ax or a sledge that shines up your hands i notice all stuff like that take a pride in it the hitchhiker stared at him the truck tires sang on the road like to know anything else ill tell you you aint got to guess now dont get sore i wasnt gettin nosy ill tell you anything i aint hidin nothin now dont get sore i just like to notice things makes the time pass ill tell you anything names joad tom joad old man is ol tom joad his eyes rested broodingly on the driver dont get sore i didnt mean nothin i dont mean nothin neither said joad im just tryin to get along without shovin nobody around he stopped and looked out at the dry fields at the starved tree clumps hanging uneasily in the heated distance from his side pocket he brought out his tobacco and papers he rolled his cigarette down between his knees where the wind could not get at it the driver chewed as rhythmically as thoughtfully as a cow he waited to let the whole emphasis of the preceding passage disappear and be forgotten at last when the air seemed neutral again he said a guy that never been a truck skinner dont know nothin what its like owners dont want us to pick up nobody so we got to set here an just skin her along less we want to take a chance of gettin fired like i just done with you preciate it said joad ive knew guys that done screwy things while theyre drivin trucks i remember a guy use to make up poetry it passed the time he looked over secretly to see whether joad was interested or amazed joad was silent looking into the distance ahead along the road along the white road that waved gently like a ground swell the driver went on at last i remember a piece of poetry this here guy wrote down it was about him an a couple of other guys goin all over the world drinkin and raisin hell and screwin around i wisht i could remember how that piece went this guy had words in it that jesus h christ wouldnt know what they meant part was like this an there we spied a nigger with a trigger that was bigger than a elephants proboscis or the whanger of a whale that proboscis is a noselike with a elephant its his trunk guy showed me a dictionary carried that dictionary all over hell with him hed look in it while hes pulled up gettin his pie an coffee he stopped feeling lonely in the long speech his secret eyes turned on his passenger joad remained silent nervously the driver tried to force him into participation ever know a guy that said big words like that preacher said joad well it makes you mad to hear a guy use big words course with a preacher its all right because nobody would fool around with a preacher anyway but this guy was funny you didnt give a damn when he said a big word cause he just done it for ducks he wasnt puttin on no dog the driver was reassured he knew at least that joad was listening he swung the great truck viciously around a bend and the tires shrilled like i was sayin he continued guy that drives a truck does screwy things he got to hed go nuts just settin here an the road sneakin under the wheels fella says once that

mattergot a girl well sure but i want to get ahead anyway i been training my mind for a hell of a long time the whisky seemed to loosen joad up he rolled another cigarette and lighted it i aint got a hell of a lot further to go he said the driver went on quickly i dont need no shot he said i train my mind all the time i took a course in that two years ago he patted the steering wheel with his right hand suppose i pass a guy on the road i look at him an after im past i try to remember everthing about him kind a clothes an shoes an hat an how he walked an maybe how tall an what weight an any scars i do it pretty good i can jus make a whole picture in my head sometimes i think i ought to take a course to be a fingerprint expert youd be suprised how much a guy can remember joad took a quick drink from the flask he dragged the last smoke from his raveling cigarette and then with callused thumb and forefinger crushed out the glowing end he rubbed the butt to a pulp and put it out the window letting the breeze suck it from his fingers the big tires sang a high note on the pavement joads dark quiet eyes became amused as he stared along the road the driver waited and glanced uneasily over at last joads long upper lip grinned up from his teeth and he chuckled silently his chest jerked with the chuckles you sure took a hell of a long time to get to it buddy the driver did not look over get to what how do you mean joads lips stretched tight over his long teeth for a moment and he licked his lips like a dog two licks one in each direction from the middle his voice became harsh you know what i mean you give me a goinover when i first got in i seen you the driver looked straight ahead gripped the wheel so tightly that the pads of his palms bulged and the backs of his hands paled joad continued you know where i come from the driver was silent dont you joad insisted wellsure that ismaybe but it aint none of my business i mind my own yard it aint nothing to me the words tumbled out now i dont stick my nose in nobodys business and suddenly he was silent and waiting and his hands were still white on the wheel a grasshopper flipped through the window and lighted on top of the instrument panel where it sat and began to scrape its wings with its angled jumping legs joad reached forward and crushed its hard skulllike head with his fingers and he let it into the wind stream out the window joad chuckled again while he brushed the bits of broken insect from his fingertips you got me wrong mister he said i aint keepin quiet about it sure i been in mcalester been there four years sure these is the clothes they give me when i come out i dont give a damn who knows it an im goin to my old mans place so i dont have to lie to get a job the driver said wellthat aint

get off there sure i know youre wettin your pants to know what i done i aint a guy to let you down the high hum of the motor dulled and the song of the tires dropped in pitch joad got out his pint and took another short drink the truck drifted to a stop where a dirt road opened at right angles to the highway joad got out and stood beside the cab window the vertical exhaust pipe puttered up its barely visible blue smoke joad leaned toward the driver homicide he said quickly thats a big wordmeans i killed a guy seven years im sprung in four for keepin my nose clean the drivers eyes slipped over joads face to memorize it i never asked you nothin about it he said i mind my own yard you can tell about it in every joint from here to texola he smiled so long fella you been a good guy but look when you been in stir a little while you can smell a question comin from hell to breakfast you telegraphed yours the first time you opened your trap he spatted the metal door with the palm of his hand thanks for the lift he said so long he turned away and walked into the dirt road for a moment the driver stared after him and then he called luck joad waved his hand without looking around then the motor roared up and the gears clicked and the great red truck rolled heavily away chapter the concrete highway was edged with a mat of tangled broken dry grass and the grass heads were heavy with oat beards to catch on a dogs coat and foxtails to tangle in a horses fetlocks and clover burrs to fasten in sheeps wool sleeping life waiting to be spread and dispersed every seed armed with an appliance of dispersal twisting darts and parachutes for the wind little spears and balls of tiny thorns and all waiting for animals and for the wind for a mans trouser cuff or the hem of a womans skirt all passive but armed with appliances of activity still but each possessed of the anlage of movement the sun lay on the grass and warmed it and in the shade under the grass the insects moved ants and ant lions to set traps for them grasshoppers to jump into the air and flick their yellow wings for a second sow bugs like little armadillos plodding restlessly on many tender feet and over the grass at the roadside a land turtle crawled turning aside for nothing dragging his highdomed shell over the grass his hard legs and yellownailed feet threshed slowly through the grass not really walking but boosting and dragging his shell along the barley beards slid off his shell and the clover burrs fell on him and rolled to the ground his horny beak was partly open and his fierce humorous eyes under brows like fingernails stared straight ahead he came over the grass leaving a beaten trail behind him and the hill which was the highway embankment reared up ahead of him for a moment he stopped his head held high he blinked and looked up and down at last he started to climb the embankment front clawed feet reached forward but did not touch the hind feet kicked his shell along and it scraped on the grass and on the gravel as the embankment grew steeper and steeper the more frantic were the efforts of the land turtle pushing hind legs strained and slipped boosting the shell along and the horny head protruded as far as the neck could stretch little by little the shell slid up the embankment until at last a parapet cut straight across its line of march the shoulder of the road a concrete wall four inches high as though they worked independently the hind legs pushed the shell against the wall the head upraised and peered over the wall to the broad smooth plain of cement now the hands braced on top of the wall strained and lifted and the shell came slowly up and rested its front end on the wall for a moment the turtle rested a red ant ran into the shell into the soft skin inside the shell and suddenly head and legs snapped in and the armored tail clamped in sideways the red ant was crushed between body and legs and one head of wild oats was clamped into the shell by a front leg for a long moment the turtle lay still and then the neck crept out and the old humorous frowning eyes looked about and the legs and tail came out the back legs went to work straining like elephant legs and the shell tipped to an angle so that the front legs could not reach the level cement plain but higher and higher the hind legs boosted it until at last the center of balance was reached the front tipped down the front legs scratched at the pavement and it was up but the head of wild oats was held by its stem around the front legs now the going was easy and all the legs worked and the shell boosted along waggling from side to side a sedan driven by a fortyyearold woman approached she saw the turtle and swung to the right off the highway the wheels screamed and a cloud of dust boiled up two wheels lifted for a moment and then settled the car skidded back onto the road and went on but more slowly the turtle had jerked into its shell but now it hurried on for the highway was burning hot and now a light truck approached and as it came near the driver saw the turtle and swerved to hit it his front wheel struck the edge of the shell flipped the turtle like a tiddlywink spun it like a coin and rolled it off the highway the truck went back to its course along the right side lying on its back the turtle was tight in its shell for a long time but at last its legs waved in the air reaching for something to pull it over its front foot caught a piece of quartz and little by little the shell pulled over and flopped upright the wild oat head fell out and three of the spearhead seeds stuck in the ground and as the turtle crawled on down the embankment its shell dragged dirt over the seeds the turtle entered a dust road and jerked itself along drawing a wavy shallow trench in the dust with its shell the old humorous eyes looked ahead and the horny beak opened a little his yellow toe nails slipped a fraction in the dust chapter when joad heard the truck get under way gear climbing up to gear and the ground throbbing under the rubber beating of the tires he stopped and turned about and watched it until it disappeared when it was out of sight he still watched the distance and the blue airshimmer thoughtfully he took the pint from his pocket unscrewed the metal cap and sipped the whisky delicately running his tongue inside the bottle neck and then around his lips to gather in any flavor that might have escaped him he said experimentally there we spied a nigger and that was all he could remember at last he turned about and faced the dusty side road that cut off at right angles through the fields the sun was hot and no wind stirred the sifted dust the road was cut with furrows where dust had slid and settled back into the wheel tracks joad took a few steps and the flourlike dust spurted up in front of his new yellow shoes and the yellowness was disappearing under gray dust he leaned down and untied the laces slipped off first one shoe and then the other and he worked his damp feet comfortably in the hot dry dust until little spurts of it came up between his toes and until the skin on his feet tightened with dryness he took off his coat and wrapped his shoes in it and slipped the bundle under his arm and at last he moved up the road shooting the dust ahead of him making a cloud that hung low to the ground behind him the right of way was fenced two strands of barbed wire on willow poles the poles were crooked and badly trimmed whenever a crotch came to the proper height the wire lay in it and where there was no crotch the barbed wire was lashed to the post with rusty baling wire beyond the fence the corn lay beaten down by wind and heat and drought and the cups where leaf joined stalk were filled with dust joad plodded along dragging his cloud of dust behind him a little bit ahead he saw the highdomed shell of a land turtle crawling slowly along through the dust its legs working stiffly and jerkily joad stopped to watch it and his shadow fell on the turtle instantly head and legs were withdrawn and the short thick tail clamped sideways into the shell joad picked it up and turned it over the back was browngray like the dust but the underside of the shell was creamy yellow clean and smooth joad shifted his bundle high under his arm and stroked the smooth undershell with his finger and he pressed it it was softer than the back the hard old head came out and tried to look at the pressing finger and the legs waved wildly the turtle wetted on joads hand and struggled uselessly in the air joad turned it back upright and rolled it up in his coat with his shoes he could feel it pressing and struggling and fussing under his arm he moved ahead more quickly now dragged his heels a little in the fine dust ahead of him beside the road a scrawny dusty willow tree cast a speckled shade joad could see it ahead of him its poor branches curving over the way its load of leaves tattered and scraggly as a molting chicken joad was sweating now his blue shirt darkened down his back and under his arms he pulled at the visor of his cap and creased it in the middle breaking its cardboard lining so completely that it could never look new again and his steps took on new speed and intent toward the shade of the distant willow tree at the willow he knew there would be shade at least one hard bar of absolute shade thrown by the trunk since the sun had passed its zenith the sun whipped the back of his neck now and made a little humming in his head he could not see the base of the tree for it grew out of a little swale that held water longer than the level places joad speeded his pace against the sun and he started down the declivity he slowed cautiously for the bar of absolute shade was taken a man sat on the ground leaning against the trunk of the tree his legs were crossed and one bare foot extended nearly as high as his head he did not hear joad approaching for he was whistling solemnly the tune of yes sir thats my baby his extended foot swung slowly up and down in the tempo it was not dance tempo he stopped whistling and sang in an easy thin tenor yes sir thats my saviour jesus is my saviour jesus is my saviour now on the level s not the devil jesus is my saviour now joad had moved into the imperfect shade of the molting leaves before the man heard him coming stopped his song and turned his head it was a long head bony tight of skin and set on a neck as stringy and muscular as a celery stalk his eyeballs were heavy and protruding the lids stretched to cover them and the lids were raw and red his cheeks were brown and shiny and hairless and his mouth fullhumorous or sensual the nose beaked and hard stretched the skin so tightly that the bridge showed white there was no perspiration on the face not even on the tall pale forehead it was an abnormally high forehead lined with delicate blue veins at the temples fully half of the face was above the eyes his stiff gray hair was mussed back from his brow as though he had combed it back with his fingers for clothes he wore overalls and a blue shirt a denim coat with brass buttons and a spotted brown hat creased like a pork pie lay on the ground beside him canvas sneakers gray with dust lay near by where they had fallen when they were kicked off the man looked long at joad the light seemed to go far into his brown eyes and it picked out little golden specks deep in the irises the strained bundle of neck muscles stood out joad stood still in the speckled shade he took off his cap and mopped his wet face with it and dropped it and his rolled coat on the ground the man in the absolute shade uncrossed his legs and dug with his toes at the earth joad said hi its hottern hell on the road the seated man stared questioningly at him now aint you young tom joadol toms boy yeah said joad all the way goin home now you wouldnt remember me i guess the man said he smiled and his full lips revealed great horse teeth oh no you wouldnt remember you was always too busy pullin little girls pigtails when i give you the holy sperit you was all wropped up in yankin that pigtail out by the roots you maybe dont recollect but i do the two of you come to jesus at once cause of the pigtail yankin baptized both of you in the irrigation ditch at once fightin an yellin like a couple of cats joad looked at him with drooped eyes and then he laughed why youre the preacher youre the preacher i jus passed a recollection about you to a guy not an hour ago i was a preacher said the man seriously reverend jim casy was a burning busher used to howl out the name of jesus to glory and used to get an irrigation ditch so squirmin full of repented sinners half of em like to drowned but not no more he sighed jus jim casy now aint got the call no more got a lot of sinful idearsbut they seem kinda sensible joad said youre bound to get idears if you go thinkin about stuff sure i remember you you use ta give a good meetin i recollect one time you give a whole sermon walkin around on your hands yellin your head off ma favored you more than anybody an granma says you was just lousy with the spirit joad dug at his rolled coat and found the pocket and brought out his pint the turtle moved a leg but he wrapped it up tightly he unscrewed the cap and held out the bottle have a little snort casy took the bottle and regarded it broodingly i aint preachin no more much the sperit aint in the people much no more and worsen that the sperit aint in me no more course now an again the sperit gets movin an i rip out a meetin or when folks sets out food i give em a grace but my heart aint in it i ony do it cause they expect it joad mopped his face with his cap again you aint too damn holy to take a drink are you he asked casy seemed to see the bottle for the first time he tilted it and took three big swallows nice drinkin liquor he said ought to be said joad thats factry liquor cost a buck casy took another swallow before he passed the bottle back yes sir he said yes sir joad took the bottle from him and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank he squatted on his hams and set the bottle upright against his coat roll his fingers found a twig with which to draw his thoughts on the ground he swept the leaves from a square and smoothed the dust and he drew angles and made little circles i aint seen you in a long time he said nobodys seen me said the preacher i went off alone an i sat and figured the sperits strong in me ony it aint the same i aint so sure of a lot of things he sat up straighter against the tree his bony hand dug its way like a squirrel into his overall pocket brought out a black bitten plug of tobacco carefully he brushed off bits of straw and gray pocket fuzz before he bit off a corner and settled the quid into his cheek joad waved his stick in negation when the plug was held out to him the turtle dug at the rolled coat casy looked over at the stirring garment what you got therea chicken youll smother it joad rolled the coat up more tightly an old turtle he said picked him up on the road an old bulldozer thought id take im to my little brother kids like turtles the preacher nodded his head slowly every kid got a turtle some time or other nobody cant keep a turtle though they work at it and work at it and at last one day they get out and away they gooff somewheres its like me i wouldnt take the good ol gospel that was just layin there to my hand i got to be pickin at it an workin at it until i got it all tore down here i got the sperit sometimes an nothin to preach about i got the call to lead people an no place to lead em lead em around and around said joad sling em in the irrigation ditch tell em theyll burn in hell if they dont think like you what the hell you want to lead em someplace for jus lead em the straight trunk shade had stretched out along the ground joad moved gratefully into it and squatted on his hams and made a new smooth place on which to draw his thoughts with a stick a thickfurred yellow shepherd dog came trotting down the road head low tongue lolling and dripping its tail hung limply curled and it panted loudly joad whistled at it but it only dropped its head an inch and trotted fast toward some definite destination goin someplace joad explained a little piqued goin for home maybe the preacher could not be thrown from his subject goin someplace he repeated thats right hes goin someplace mei dont know where im goin tell you whati used ta get the people jumpin an talkin in tongues and gloryshoutin till they just fell down an passed out an some id baptize to bring em to an thenyou know what id do id take one of them girls out in the grass an id lay with her done it ever time then id feel bad an id pray an pray but it didnt do no good come the next time them an me was full of the sperit id do it again i figgered there just wasnt no hope for me an i was a damned ol hypocrite but i didnt mean to be joad smiled and his long teeth parted and he licked his lips there aint nothing like a good hot meetin for pushin em over he said i done that myself casy leaned forward excitedly you see he cried i seen it was that way an i started thinkin he waved his bony bigknuckled hand up and down in a patting gesture i got to thinkin like this heres me preachin grace an heres them people gettin grace so hard theyre jumpin an shoutin now they say layin up with a girl comes from the devil but the more grace a girl got in her the quicker she wants to go out in the grass an i got to thinkin how in hell scuse me how can the devil get in when a girl is so full of the holy sperit that its spoutin out of her nose an ears youd think thatd be one time when the devil didnt stand a snowballs chance in hell but there it was his eyes were shining with excitement he worked his cheeks for a moment and then spat into the dust and the gob of spit rolled over and over picking up dust until it looked like a round dry little pellet the preacher spread out his hand and looked at his palm as though he were reading a book an theres me he went on softly theres me with all them peoples souls in my hanresponsible an feelin my responsibilityan ever time i lay with one of them girls he looked over at joad and his face looked helpless his expression asked for help joad carefully drew the torso of a woman in the dirt breasts hips pelvis i wasnt never a preacher he said i never let nothin go by when i could catch it an i never had no idears about it except that i was goddamn glad when i got one but you wasnt a preacher casy insisted a girl was just a girl to you they wasnt nothin to you but to me they was holy vessels i was savin their souls an here with all that responsibility on me id just get em frothin with the holy sperit an then id take em out in the grass maybe i should of been a preacher said joad he brought out his tobacco and papers and rolled a cigarette he lighted it and squinted through the smoke at the preacher i been a long time without a girl he said its gonna take some catchin up casy continued it worried me till i couldnt get no sleep here id go to preachin and id say by god this time i aint gonna do it and right while i said it i knowed i was you should a got a wife said joad preacher an his wife stayed at our place one time jehovites they was slep upstairs

such pain i quit an went off by myself an give her a damn good thinkin about he doubled up his legs and scratched between his dry dusty toes i says to myself whats gnawin you is it the screwin an i says no its the sin an i says why is it that when a fella ought to be just about muleass proof against sin an full up of jesus why is it thats the time a fella gets fingerin his pants buttons he laid two fingers down in his palm in rhythm as though he gently placed each word there side by side i says maybe it aint a sin maybe its just the way folks is maybe we been whippin the hell out of ourselves for nothin an i thought how some sisters took to beatin theirselves with a threefoot shag of bobwire an i thought how maybe they liked to hurt themselves an maybe i liked to hurt myself well i was layin under a tree when i figured that out and i went to sleep and it come night an it was dark when i come to they was a coyote squawkin near by before i knowed it i was sayin out loud the hell with it there aint no sin and there aint no virtue theres just stuff people do its all part of the same thing and some of the things folks do is nice and some aint nice but thats as far as any man got a right to say he paused and looked up from the palm of his hand where he had laid down the words joad was grinning at him but joads eyes were sharp and interested too you give her a goinover he said you figured her out casy spoke again and his voice rang with pain and confusion i says whats this call this sperit an i says its love i love people so much im fit to bust sometimes an i says dont you love jesus well i thought an thought an finally i says no i dont know nobody name jesus i know a bunch of stories but i only love people an sometimes i love em fit to bust an i want to make em happy so i been preachin somepin i thought would make em happy an theni been talkin a hell of a lot maybe you wonder about me using bad words well they aint bad to me no more theyre jus words folks use an they dont mean nothing bad with em anyways ill tell you one more thing i thought out an from a preacher its the most unreligious thing and i cant be a preacher no more because i thought it an i believe it whats that joad asked casy looked shyly at him if it hits you wrong dont take no offense at it will you i dont take no offense cept a bust in the nose said joad what did you figger i figgered about the holy sperit and the jesus road i figgered why do we got to hang it on god or jesus maybe i figgered maybe its all men an all women we love maybe thats the holy speritthe human speritthe whole shebang maybe all men got one big soul everbodys a part of now i sat there thinkin it an all of a suddenti knew it i knew it so deep down that it was true and i still know it joads eyes dropped to the ground as though he could not meet the naked honesty in the preachers eyes you cant hold no church with idears like that he said people would drive you out of the country with idears like that jumpin an yellin thats what folks like makes em feel swell when granma got to talkin in tongues you couldnt tie her down she could knock over a fullgrowed deacon with her fist casy regarded him broodingly somepin i like to ast you he said somepin that been eatin on me go ahead ill talk sometimes wellthe preacher said slowlyheres you that i baptized right when i was in the glory rooftree got little hunks of jesus jumpin outa my mouth that day you wont remember cause you was busy pullin that pigtail i remember said joad that was susy little she bust my finger a year later welldid you take any good outa that baptizin was your ways better joad thought about it nooo cant say as i felt anything welldid you take any bad from it think hard joad picked up the bottle and took a swig they wasnt nothing in it good or bad i just had fun he handed the flask to the preacher he sighed and drank and looked at the low level of the whisky and took another tiny drink thats good he said i got to worryin about whether in messin around maybe i done somebody a hurt joad looked over toward his coat and saw the turtle free of the cloth and hurrying away in the direction he had been following when joad found him joad watched him for a moment and then got slowly to his feet and retrieved him and wrapped him in the coat again i aint got no present for the kids he said nothin but this ol turtle its a funny thing the preacher said i was thinkin about ol tom joad when you come along thinkin id call in on him i used to think he was a godless man how is tom i dont know how he is i aint been home in four years didnt he write to you joad was embarrassed well pa wasnt no hand to write for pretty or to write for writin hed sign up his name as nice as anybody an lick his pencil but pa never did write no letters he always says what he couldn tell a fella with his mouth wasnt worth leanin on no pencil about been out travelin around casy asked joad regarded him suspiciously didnt you hear about me i was in all the papers noi never what he jerked one leg over the other and settled lower against the tree the afternoon was advancing rapidly and a richer tone was growing on the sun joad said pleasantly mights well tell you now an get it over with but if you was still preachin i wouldnt tell fear you get prayin over me he drained the last of the pint and flung it from him and the flat brown bottle skidded lightly over the dust i been in mcalester them four years casy swung around to him and his brows lowered so that his tall forehead seemed even taller aint wantin to talk about it huh i wont ask you no questions if you done something bad id do what i doneagain said joad i killed a guy in a fight we was drunk at a dance he got a knife in me an i killed him with a shovel

come back where they got a few conveniences an he eats regular he says it makes him feel lonesome out there in the open havin to think what to do next so he stole a car an come back joad got out his

the stirbug i got for a cell mate is doin me an some guys had a strang band goin good one guy said we ought to go on the radio an this mornin i didnt know what time to get up jus laid there waitin for the bell to go off casy chuckled fella can get so he misses the noise of a saw mill the yellowing dusty afternoon light put a golden color on the land the cornstalks looked golden a flight of swallows swooped overhead toward some waterhole the turtle in joads coat began a new campaign of escape joad creased the visor of his cap it was getting the long protruding curve of a crows beak now guess ill mosey along he said i hate to hit the sun but it aint so bad now casy pulled himself together i aint seen ol tom in a bugs age he said i was gonna look in on him anyways i brang jesus to your folks for a long time an i never took up a collection nor nothin but a bite to eat come along said joad pall be glad to see you he always said you got too long a pecker for a preacher he picked up his coat roll and tightened it snugly about his shoes and turtle casy gathered in his canvas sneakers and shoved his bare feet into them i aint got your confidence he said im always scared theres wire or glass under the dust i dont know nothin i hate so much as a cut toe they hesitated on the edge of the shade and then they plunged into the yellow sunlight like two swimmers hastening to get to shore after a few fast steps they slowed to a gentle thoughtful pace the cornstalks threw gray shadows sideways now and the raw smell of hot dust was in the air the corn field ended and dark green cotton took its place dark green leaves through a film of dust and the bolls forming it was spotty cotton thick in the low places where water had stood and bare on the high places the plants strove against the sun and distance toward the horizon was tan to invisibility the dust road stretched out ahead of them waving up and down the willows of a stream lined across the west and to the northwest a fallow section was going back to sparse brush but the smell of burned dust was in the air and the air was dry so that mucus in the nose dried to a crust and the eyes watered to keep the eyeballs from drying out casy said see how good the corn come along until the dust got up been a dinger of a crop ever year said joad ever year i can remember we had a good crop comin an it never come grampa says she was good the first five plowins while the wild grass was still in her the road dropped down a little hill and climbed up another rolling hill casy said ol toms house cant be moren a mile from here aint she over that third rise sure said joad less somebody stole it like pa stole it your pa stole it sure got it a mile an a half east of here an drug it was a family livin there an they moved away grampa an pa an my brother noah like to took the whole house but she wouldnt come they only got part of her thats why she looks so funny on one end they cut her in two an drug her over with twelve head of horses and two mules they was goin back for the other half an stick her together again but before they got there wink manley come with his boys and stole the other half pa an grampa was pretty sore but a little later them an wink got drunk together an laughed their heads off about it wink he says his house is at stud an if well bring ourn over an breed em well maybe get a litter of crap houses wink was a great ol fella when he was drunk after that him an pa an grampa was friends got drunk together ever chance they got toms a great one casy agreed they plodded dustily on down to the bottom of the draw and then slowed their steps for the rise casy wiped his forehead with his sleeve and put on his flattopped hat again yes he repeated tom was a great one for a godless man he was a great one i seen him in meetin sometimes when the sperit got into him just a little an i seen him take tentwelve foot jumps i tell you when ol tom got a dose of the holy sperit you got to move fast to keep from gettin run down an tromped jumpy as a stud horse in a box stall they topped the next rise and the road dropped into an old watercut ugly and raw a ragged course and freshet scars cutting into it from both sides a few stones were in the crossing joad minced across in his bare feet you talk about pa he said maybe you never seen uncle john the time they baptized him over to polks place why he got to plungin an jumpin jumped over a feeny bush as big as a piana over hed jump an back hed jump howlin like a dogwolf in moon time well pa seen him an pa he figgers hes the bes jesusjumper in these parts so pa picks out a feeny bush bout twicet as big as uncle johns feeny bush and pa lets out a squawk like a sow litterin broken bottles an he takes a run at that feeny bush an clears her an bust his right leg that took the sperit out of pa preacher wants to pray it set but pa says no by god hed got his heart full of havin a doctor well they wasnt a doctor but they was a travelin dentist an he set her preacher give her a prayin over anyways they plodded up the little rise on the other side of the watercut now that the sun was on the wane some of its impact was gone and while the air was hot the hammering rays were weaker the strung wire on crooked poles still edged the road on the righthand side a line of wire fence strung out across the cotton field and the dusty green cotton was the same on both sides dusty and dry and dark green joad pointed to the boundary fence that theres our line we didnt really need no fence there but we had the wire an pa kinda liked her there said it give him a feelin that forty was forty wouldnt of had the fence if uncle john didnt come drivin in one night with six spools of wire in his wagon he give em to pa for a shoat we never did know where he got that wire they slowed for the rise moving their feet in the deep soft dust feeling the earth with their feet joads eyes were inward on his memory he seemed to be laughing inside himself uncle john was a crazy bastard he said like what he done with that shoat he chuckled and walked on jim casy waited impatiently the story did not continue casy gave it a good long time to come out well whatd he do with that shoat he demanded at last with some irritation huh oh well he killed that shoat right there an he got ma to light up the stove he cut out pork chops an put em in the pan an he put ribs an a leg in the oven he et chops till the ribs was done an he et ribs till the leg was done an then he tore into that leg cut off big hunks of her an shoved em in his mouth us kids hung around slaverin an he give us some but he wouldnt give pa none by an by he et so much he throwed up an went to sleep while hes asleep us kids an pa finished off the leg well when uncle john woke up in the mornin he slaps another leg in the oven pa says john you gonna eat that whole damn pig an he says i aim to tom but im scairt some of herll spoil fore i get her et hungry as i am for pork maybe you better get a plate an gimme back a couple rolls of wire well sir pa wasnt no fool he jus let uncle john go on an eat himself sick of pig an when he drove off he hadnt et much moren half pa says whynt you salt her down but not uncle john when he wants pig he wants a whole pig an when hes through he dont want no pig hangin around so off he goes and pa salts down whats left casy said while i was still in the preachin sperit id a made a lesson of that an spoke it to you but i dont do that no more what you spose he done a thing like that for i dunno said joad he jus got hungry for pork makes me hungry jus to think of it i had jus four slices of roastin pork in four yearsone slice ever christmus casy suggested elaborately maybe tomll kill the fatted calf like for the prodigal in scripture joad laughed scornfully you dont know pa if he kills a chicken most of the squawkin will come from pa not the chicken he dont never learn hes always savin a pig for christmus and then it dies in september of bloat or somepin so you cant eat it when uncle john wanted pork he et pork he had her they moved over the curving top of the hill and saw the joad place below them and joad stopped it aint the same he said looka that house somepins happened they aint nobody there the two stood and stared at the little cluster of buildings chapter the owners of the land came onto the land or more often a spokesman for the owners came they came in closed cars and they felt the dry earth with their fingers and sometimes they drove big earth augers into the ground for soil tests the tenants from their sunbeaten dooryards watched uneasily when the closed cars drove along the fields and at last the owner men drove into the dooryards and sat in their cars to talk out of the windows the tenant men stood beside the cars for a while and then squatted on their hams and found sticks with which to mark the dust in the open doors the women stood looking out and behind them the childrencornheaded children with wide eyes one bare foot on top of the other bare foot and the toes working the women and the children watched their men talking to the owner men they were silent some of the owner men were kind because they hated what they had to do and some of them were angry because they hated to be cruel and some of them were cold because they had long ago found that one could not be an owner unless one were cold and all of them were caught in something larger than themselves some of them hated the mathematics that drove them and some were afraid and some worshiped the mathematics because it provided a refuge from thought and from feeling if a bank or a finance company owned the land the owner man said the bankor the companyneedswantsinsistsmust haveas though the bank or the company were a monster with thought and feeling which had ensnared them these last would take no responsibility for the banks or the companies because they were men and slaves while the banks were machines and masters all at the same time some of the owner men were a little proud to be slaves to such cold and powerful masters the owner men sat in the cars and explained you know the land is poor youve scrabbled at it long enough god knows the squatting tenant men nodded and wondered and drew figures in the dust and yes they knew god knows if the dust only wouldnt fly if the top would only stay on the soil it might not be so bad the owner men went on leading to their point you know the lands getting poorer you know what cotton does to the land robs it sucks all the blood out of it the squatters noddedthey knew god knew if they could only rotate the crops they might pump blood back into the land well its too late and the owner men explained the workings and the thinkings of the monster that was stronger than they were a man can hold land if he can just eat and pay taxes he can do that yes he can do that until his crops fail one day and he has to borrow money from the bank butyou see a bank or a company cant do that because those creatures dont breathe air dont eat sidemeat they breathe profits they eat the interest on money if they dont get it they die the way you die without air without sidemeat it is a sad thing but it is so it is just so the squatting men raised their eyes to understand cant we just hang on maybe the next year will be a good year god knows how much cotton next year and with all the warsgod knows what price cotton will bring dont they make explosives out of cotton and uniforms get enough wars and cottonll hit the ceiling next year maybe they looked up questioningly we cant depend on it the bankthe monster has to have profits all the time it cant wait itll die no taxes go on when the monster stops growing it dies it cant stay one size soft fingers began to tap the sill of the car window and hard fingers tightened on the restless drawing sticks in the doorways of the sunbeaten tenant houses women sighed and then shifted feet so that the one that had been down was now on top and the toes working dogs came sniffing near the owner cars and wetted on all four tires one after another and chickens lay in the sunny dust and fluffed their feathers to get the cleansing dust down to the skin in the little sties the pigs grunted inquiringly over the muddy remnants of the slops the squatting men looked down again what do you want us to do we cant take less share of the cropwere half starved now the kids are hungry all the time we got no clothes torn an ragged if all the neighbors werent the same wed be ashamed to go to meeting and at last the owner men came to the point the tenant system wont work any more one man on a tractor can take the place of twelve or fourteen families pay him a wage and take all the crop we have to do it we dont like to do it but the monsters sick somethings happened to the monster but youll kill the land with cotton we know weve got to take cotton quick before the land dies then well sell the land lots of families in the east would like to own a piece of land the tenant men looked up alarmed but whatll happen to us howll we eat youll have to get off the land the plowsll go through the dooryard and now the squatting men stood up angrily grampa took up the land and he had to kill the indians and drive them away and pa was born here and he killed weeds and snakes then a bad year came and he had to borrow a little money an we was born here there in the doorour children born here and pa had to borrow money the bank owned the land then but we stayed and we got a little bit of what we raised we know thatall that its not us its the bank a bank isnt like a man or an owner with fifty thousand acres he isnt like a man either thats the monster sure cried the tenant men but its our land we measured it and broke it up we were born on it and we got killed on it died on it even if its no good its still ours thats what makes it oursbeing born on it working it dying on it that makes ownership not a paper with numbers on it were sorry its not us its the monster the bank isnt like a man yes but the bank is only made of men no youre wrong therequite wrong there the bank is something else than men it happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does and yet the bank does it the bank is something more than men i tell you its the monster men made it but they cant control it the tenants cried grampa killed indians pa killed snakes for the land maybe we can kill bankstheyre worse than indians and snakes maybe we got to fight to keep our land like pa and grampa did and now the owner men grew angry youll have to go but its ours the tenant men cried weno the bank the monster owns it youll have to go well get our guns like grampa when the indians came what then wellfirst the sheriff and then the troops youll be stealing if you try to stay youll be murderers if you kill to stay the monster isnt men but it can make men do what it wants but if we go wherell we go howll we go we got no money were sorry said the owner men the bank the fiftythousandacre owner cant be responsible youre on land that isnt yours once over the line maybe you can pick cotton in the fall maybe you can go on relief why dont you go on west to california theres work there and it never gets cold why you can reach out anywhere and pick an orange why theres always some kind of crop to work in why dont you go there and the owner men started their cars and rolled away the tenant men squatted down on their hams again to mark the dust with a stick to figure to wonder their sunburned faces were dark and their sunwhipped eyes were light the women moved cautiously out of the doorways toward their men and the children crept behind the women cautiously ready to run the bigger boys squatted beside their fathers because that made them men after a time the women asked what did he want and the men looked up for a second and the smolder of pain was in their eyes we got to get off a tractor and a superintendent like factories wherell we go the women asked we dont know we dont know and the women went quickly quietly back into the houses and herded the children ahead of them they knew that a man so hurt and so perplexed may turn in anger even on people he loves they left the men alone to figure and to wonder in the dust after a time perhaps the tenant man looked aboutat the pump put in ten years ago with a gooseneck handle and iron flowers on the spout at the chopping block where a thousand chickens had been killed at the hand plow lying in the shed and the patent crib hanging in the rafters over it the children crowded about the women in the houses what we going to do ma where we going to go the women said we dont know yet go out and play but dont go near your father he might whale you if you go near him and the women went on with the work but all the time they watched the men squatting in the dustperplexed and figuring the tractors came over the roads and into the fields great crawlers moving like insects having the incredible strength of insects they crawled over the ground laying the track and rolling on it and picking it up diesel tractors puttering while they stood idle they thundered when they moved and then settled down to a droning roar snubnosed monsters raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it straight down the country across the country through fences through dooryards in and out of gullies in straight lines they did not run on the ground but on their own roadbeds they ignored hills and gulches water courses fences houses the man sitting in the iron seat did not look like a man gloved goggled rubber dust mask over nose and mouth he was a part of the monster a robot in the seat the thunder of the cylinders sounded through the country became one with the air and the earth so that earth and air muttered in sympathetic vibration the driver could not control itstraight across country it went cutting through a dozen farms and straight back a twitch at the controls could swerve the cat but the drivers hands could not twitch because the monster that built the tractors the monster that sent the tractor out had somehow got into the drivers hands into his brain and muscle had goggled him and muzzled himgoggled his mind muzzled his speech goggled his perception muzzled his protest he could not see the land as it was he could not smell the land as it smelled his feet did not stamp the clods or feel the warmth and power of the earth he sat in an iron seat and stepped on iron pedals he could not cheer or beat or curse or encourage the extension of his power and because of this he could not cheer or whip or curse or encourage himself he did not know or own or trust or beseech the land if a seed dropped did not germinate it was nothing if the young thrusting plant withered in drought or drowned in a flood of rain it was no more to the driver than to the tractor he loved the land no more than the bank loved the land he could admire the tractorits machined surfaces its surge of power the roar of its detonating cylinders but it was not his tractor behind the tractor rolled the shining disks cutting the earth with bladesnot plowing but surgery pushing the cut earth to the right where the second row of disks cut it and pushed it to the left slicing blades shining polished by the cut earth and pulled behind the disks the harrows combing with iron teeth so that the little clods broke up and the earth lay smooth behind the harrows the long seederstwelve curved iron penes erected in the foundry orgasms set by gears raping methodically raping without passion the driver sat in his iron seat and he was proud of the straight lines he did not will proud of the tractor he did not own or love proud of the power he could not control and when that crop grew and was harvested no man had crumbled a hot clod in his fingers and let the earth sift past his fingertips no man had touched the seed or lusted for the growth men ate what they had not raised had no connection with the bread the land bore under iron and under iron gradually died for it was not loved or hated it had no prayers or curses at noon the tractor driver stopped sometimes near a tenant house and opened his lunch sandwiches wrapped in waxed paper white bread pickle cheese spam a piece of pie branded like an engine part he ate without relish and tenants not yet moved away came out to see him looked curiously while the goggles were taken off and the rubber dust mask leaving white circles around the eyes and a large white circle around nose and mouth the exhaust of the tractor puttered on for fuel is so cheap it is more efficient to leave the engine running than to heat the diesel nose for a new start curious children crowded close ragged children who ate their fried dough as they watched they watched hungrily the unwrapping of the sandwiches and their hungersharpened noses smelled the pickle cheese and spam they didnt speak to the driver they watched his hand as it carried food to his mouth they did not watch him chewing their eyes followed the hand that held the sandwich after a while the tenant who could not leave the place came out and squatted in the shade beside the tractor why youre joe daviss boy sure the driver said well what you doing this kind of work foragainst your own people three dollars a day i got damn sick of creeping for my dinnerand not getting it i got a wife and kids we got to eat three dollars a day and it comes every day thats right the tenant said but for your three dollars a day fifteen or twenty families cant eat at all nearly a hundred people have to go out and wander on the roads for your three dollars a day is that right and the driver said cant think of that got to think of my own kids three dollars a day and it comes every day times are changing mister dont you know cant make a living on the land unless youve got two five ten thousand acres and a tractor crop land isnt for little guys like us any more you dont kick up a howl because you cant make fords or because youre not the telephone company well crops are like that now nothing to do about it you try to get three dollars a day someplace thats the only way the tenant pondered funny thing how it is if a man owns a little property that property is him its part of him and its like him if he owns property only so he can walk on it and handle it and be sad when it isnt doing well and feel fine when the rain falls on it that property is him and some way hes bigger because he owns it even if he isnt successful hes big with his property that is so and the tenant pondered more but let a man get property he doesnt see or cant take time to get his fingers in or cant be there to walk on itwhy then the property is the man he cant do what he wants he cant think what he wants the property is the man stronger than he is and he is small not big only his possessions are bigand hes the servant of his property that is so too the driver munched the branded pie and threw the crust away times are changed dont you know thinking about stuff like that dont feed the kids get your three dollars a day feed your kids you got no call to worry about anybodys kids but your own you get a reputation for talking like that and youll never get three dollars a day big shots wont give you three dollars a day if you worry about anything but your three dollars a day nearly a hundred people on the road for your three dollars where will we go and that reminds me the driver said you better get out soon im going through the dooryard after dinner you filled in the well this morning i know had to keep the line straight but im going through the dooryard after dinner got to keep the lines straight andwell you know joe davis my old man so ill tell you this i got orders wherever theres a family not moved outif i have an accidentyou know get too close and cave the house in a littlewell i might get a couple of dollars and my youngest kid never had no shoes yet i built it with my hands straightened old nails to put the sheathing on rafters are wired to the stringers with baling wire its mine i built it you bump it downill be in the window with a rifle you even come too close and ill pot you like a rabbit its not me theres nothing i can do ill lose my job if i dont do it and looksuppose you kill me theyll just hang you but long before youre hung therell be another guy on the tractor and hell bump the house down youre not killing the right guy thats so the tenant said who gave you orders ill go after him hes the one to kill youre wrong he got his orders from the bank the bank told him clear those people out or its your job well theres a president of the bank theres a board of directors ill fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank the driver said fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the east the orders were make the land show profit or well close you up but where does it stop who can we shoot i dont aim to starve to death before i kill the man thats starving me i dont know maybe theres nobody to shoot maybe the thing isnt men at all maybe like you said the propertys doing it anyway i told you my orders i got to figure the tenant said we all got to figure theres some way to stop this its not like lightning or earthquakes weve got a bad thing made by men and by god thats something we can change the tenant sat in his doorway and the driver thundered his engine and started off tracks falling and curving harrows combing and the phalli of the seeder slipping into the ground across the dooryard the tractor cut and the hard footbeaten ground was seeded field and the tractor cut through again the uncut space was ten feet wide and back he came the iron guard bit into the housecorner crumbled the wall and wrenched the little house from its foundation so that it fell sideways crushed like a bug and the driver was goggled and a rubber mask covered his nose and mouth the tractor cut a straight line on and the air and the ground vibrated with its thunder the tenant man stared after it his rifle in his hand his wife was beside him and the quiet children behind and all of them stared after the tractor chapter the reverend casy and young tom stood on the hill and looked down on the joad place the small unpainted house was mashed at one corner and it had been pushed off its foundations so that it slumped at an angle its blind front windows pointing at a spot of sky well above the horizon the fences were gone and the cotton grew in the dooryard and up against the house and the cotton was about the shed barn the outhouse lay on its side and the cotton grew close against it where the dooryard had been pounded hard by the bare feet of children and by stamping horses hooves and by the broad wagon wheels it was cultivated now and the dark green dusty cotton grew young tom stared for a long time at the ragged willow beside the dry horse trough at the concrete base where the pump had been jesus he said at last hell musta popped here there aint nobody livin there at last he moved quickly down the hill and casy followed him he looked into the barn shed deserted a little ground straw on the floor and at the mule stall in the corner and as he looked in there was a skittering on the floor and a family of mice faded in under the straw joad paused at the entrance to the toolshed leanto and no tools were therea broken plow point a mess of hay wire in the corner an iron wheel from a hayrake and a ratgnawed mule collar a flat gallon oil can crusted with dirt and oil and a pair of torn overalls hanging on a nail there aint nothin left said joad we had pretty nice tools there aint nothin left casy said if i was still a preacher id say the arm of the lord had struck but now i dont know what happened i been away i didnt hear nothin they walked toward the concrete wellcap walked through cotton plants to get to it and the bolls were forming on the cotton and the land was cultivated we never planted here joad said we always kept this clear why you cant get a horse in now without he tromps the cotton they paused at the dry watering trough and the proper weeds that should grow under a trough were gone and the old thick wood of the trough was dry and cracked on the wellcap the bolts that had held the pump stuck up their threads rusty and the nuts gone joad looked into the tube of the well and listened he dropped a clod down the well and listened she was a good well he said i cant hear water he seemed reluctant to go to the house he dropped clod after clod down the well maybe theyre all dead he said but somebodyd a told me id a got word some way maybe they left a letter or something to tell in the house would they of knowed you was comin out i don know said joad no i guess not i didnt know myself till a week ago les look in the house shes all pushed out a shape something knocked the hell out of her they walked slowly toward the sagging house two of the supports of the porch roof were pushed out so that the roof flopped down on one end and the housecorner was crushed in through a maze of splintered wood the room at the corner was visible the front door hung open inward and a low strong gate across the front door hung outward on leather hinges joad stopped at the step a twelvebytwelve timber doorsteps here he said but theyre goneor mas dead he pointed to the low gate across the front door if ma was anywheres about that gated be shut an hooked thats one thing she always doneseen that gate was shut his eyes were warm ever since the pig got in over to jacobs an et the baby milly jacobs was jus out in the barn she come in while the pig was still eatin it well milly jacobs was in a family way an she went ravin never did get over it touched ever since but ma took a lesson from it she never lef that pig gate open less she was in the house herself never did forget notheyre goneor dead he climbed to the split porch and looked into the kitchen the windows were broken out and throwing rocks lay on the floor and the floor and walls sagged steeply away from the door and the sifted dust was on the boards joad pointed to the broken glass and the rocks kids he said theyll go twenty miles to bust a window i done it myself they know when a house is empty they know thats the fust thing kids do when folks move out the kitchen was empty of furniture stove gone and the round stovepipe hole in the wall showing light on the sink shelf lay an old beer opener and a broken fork with its wooden handle gone joad slipped cautiously into the room and the floor groaned under his weight an old copy of the philadelphia ledger was on the floor against the wall its pages yellow and curling joad looked into the bedroomno bed no chairs nothing on the wall a picture of an indian girl in color labeled red wing a bed slat leaning against the wall and in one corner a womans high button shoe curled up at the toe and broken over the instep joad picked it up and looked at it i remember this he said this was mas its all wore out now ma liked them shoes had em for years no theyve wentan took everthing the sun had lowered until it came through the angled end windows now and it flashed on the edges of the broken glass joad turned at last and went out and crossed the porch he sat down on the edge of it and rested his bare feet on the twelvebytwelve step the evening light was on the fields and the cotton plants threw long shadows on the ground and the molting willow tree threw a long shadow casy sat down beside joad they never wrote you nothin he asked no like i said they wasnt people to write pa could write but he wouldnt didnt like to it give him the shivers to write he could work out a catalogue order as good as the nex fella but he wouldnt write no letters just for ducks they sat side by side staring off into the distance joad laid his rolled coat on the porch beside him his independent hands rolled a cigarette smoothed it and lighted it and he inhaled deeply and blew the smoke out through his nose somepins wrong he said i cant put my finger on her i got an itch that somepins wrongern hell just this house pushed aroun an my folks gone casy said right over there the ditch was where i done the baptizin you wasnt mean but you was tough hung onto that little girls pigtail like a bulldog we

but you was tough sometimes a tough kid grows up with a big jolt of the sperit in him a lean gray cat came sneaking out of the barn and crept through the cotton plants to the end of the porch it leaped silently up to the porch and crept lowbelly toward the men it came to a place between and behind the two and then it sat down and its tail stretched out straight and flat to the floor and the last inch of it flicked the cat sat and looked off into the distance where the men were looking joad glanced around at it by god look whos here somebody stayed he put out his hand but the cat leaped away out of reach and sat down and licked the pads of its lifted paw joad looked at it and his face was puzzled i know whats the matter he cried that cat jus made me figger whats wrong seems to me theres lots wrong said casy no its moren jus this place whynt that cat jus move in with some neighborswith the rances how come nobody ripped some lumber off this house aint been nobody here for

bastard jus set on that injun pilla an says let albert come an get her why he says ill take that squirt and wring im out like a pair of drawers the cat crept close between the men again and its tail lay flat and its whiskers jerked now and then the sun dropped low toward the horizon and the dusty air was red and golden the cat reached out a gray questioning paw and touched joads coat he looked around hell i forgot the turtle i aint gonna pack it all over hell he unwrapped the land turtle and pushed it under the house but in a moment it was out headed southwest as it had been from the first the cat leaped at it and struck at its straining head and slashed at its moving feet the old hard humorous head was pulled in and the thick tail slapped in under the shell and when the cat grew tired of waiting for it and walked off the turtle headed on southwest again young tom joad and the preacher watched the turtle gowaving its legs and boosting its heavy highdomed shell along toward the southwest the cat crept along behind for a while but in a dozen yards it arched its back to a strong taut bow and yawned and came stealthily back toward the seated men where the hell you spose hes goin said joad i seen turtles all my life theyre always goin someplace they always seem to want to get there the gray cat seated itself between and behind them again it blinked slowly the skin over its shoulders jerked forward under a flea and then slipped slowly back the cat lifted a paw and inspected it flicked its claws out and in again experimentally and licked its pads with a shellpink tongue the red sun touched the horizon and spread out like a jellyfish and the sky above it seemed much brighter and more alive than it had been joad unrolled his new yellow shoes from his coat and he brushed his dusty feet with his hand before he slipped them on the preacher staring off across the fields said somebodys comin look down there right through the cotton joad looked where casys finger pointed comin afoot he said cant see im for the dust he raises who the hells comin here they watched the figure approaching in the evening light and the dust it raised was reddened by the setting sun man said joad the man drew closer and as he walked past the barn joad said why i know him you know himthats muley graves and he called hey muley how ya the approaching man stopped startled by the call and then he came on quickly he was a lean man rather short his movements were jerky and quick he carried a gunny sack in his hand his blue jeans were pale at knee and seat and he wore an old black suit coat stained and spotted the sleeves torn loose from the shoulders in back and ragged holes worn through at the elbows his black hat was as stained as his coat and the band torn half free flopped up and down as he walked muleys face was smooth and unwrinkled but it wore the truculent look of a bad childs the mouth held tight and small the little eyes half scowling half petulant you remember muley joad said softly to the preacher whos that the advancing man called joad did not answer muley came close very close before he made out the faces well ill be damned he said its tommy joad whend

the sky was brilliant over the spot where it had gone and a torn cloud like a bloody rag hung over the spot of its going and dusk crept over the sky from the eastern horizon and darkness crept over the land from the east the evening star flashed and glittered in the dusk the gray cat sneaked away toward the open barn shed and passed inside like a shadow joad said well we aint gonna walk no eight

pants pocket and produced a large hornhandled pocket knife tom joad took it from him opened a blade and smelled it he drove the blade again and again into the ground and smelled it again wiped it on his trouser leg and felt the edge with his thumb muley took a quart bottle of water out of his hip pocket and set it on the porch go easy on that there water he said thats all there is this here wells filled in tom took up a rabbit in his hand one of you go get some bale wire outa the barn well make a fire with some a this broken plank from the house he looked at the dead rabbit there aint nothin so easy to get ready as a rabbit he said he lifted the skin of the back slit it put his fingers in the hole and tore the skin off it slipped off like a stocking slipped off the body to the neck and off the legs to the paws joad picked up the knife again and cut off head and feet he laid the skin down slit the rabbit along the ribs shook out the intestines onto the skin and then threw the mess off into the cotton field and the cleanmuscled little body was ready joad cut off the legs and cut the meaty back into two pieces he was picking up the second rabbit when casy came back with a snarl of bale wire in his hand now build up a fire and put some stakes up said joad jesus christ im hungry for these here creatures he cleaned and cut the rest of the rabbits and strung them on the wire muley and casy tore splintered boards from the wrecked housecorner and started a fire and they drove a stake into the ground on each side to hold the wire muley came back to joad look out for boils on that jackrabbit he said i dont like to eat no jackrabbit with boils he took a little cloth bag from his pocket and put it on the porch joad said the jack was clean as a whistlejesus god you got salt too by any chance you got some plates an a tent in your pocket he poured salt in his hand and sprinkled it over the pieces of rabbit strung on the wire the fire leaped and threw shadows on the house and the dry wood crackled and snapped the sky was almost dark now and the stars were out sharply the gray cat came out of the barn shed and trotted miaowing toward the fire but nearly there it turned and went directly to one of the little piles of rabbit entrails on the ground it chewed and swallowed and the entrails hung from its mouth casy sat on the ground beside the fire feeding it broken pieces of board pushing the long boards in as the flame ate off their ends the evening bats flashed into the firelight and out again the cat crouched back and licked its lips and washed its face and whiskers joad held up his rabbitladen wire between his two hands and walked to the fire here take one end muley wrap your end around that stake thats good now lets tighten her up we ought to wait till the fires burned down but i cant wait he made the wire taut then found a stick and slipped the pieces of meat along the wire until they were over the fire and the flames licked up around the meat and hardened and glazed the surfaces joad sat down by the fire but with his stick he moved and turned the rabbit so that it would not become sealed to the wire this here is a party he said salt muleys got an water an rabbits i wish he got a lot of hominy in his pocket thats all i wish muley said over the fire you fellasd think im touched the way i live touched nothin said joad if youre touched i wisht

the pieces of meat over on the wire the juice was dripping now and every drop as it fell in the fire shot up a spurt of flame the smooth surface of the meat was crinkling up and turning a faint brown smell her said joad jesus look down an just smell her muley went on like a damn ol graveyard ghos i been goin aroun the places where stuff happened like theres a place over by our forty in a gully

where my own pas blood is part of it he paused uneasily you fellas think im touched joad turned the meat and his eyes were inward casy feet drawn up stared into the fire fifteen feet back from the men the fed cat was sitting the long gray tail wrapped neatly around the front feet a big owl shrieked as it went overhead and the firelight showed its white underside and the spread of its wings no said casy youre lonelybut you aint touched muleys tight little face was rigid i put my han right on the groun where that blood is still an i seen my pa with a hole through his ches an i felt him shiver up

silent his thin lips still moving his chest still panting he sat and looked down at his hands in the firelight ii aint talked to nobody for a long time he apologized softly i been sneakin aroun like a ol graveyard ghos casy pushed the long boards into the fire and the flames licked up around them and leaped up toward the meat again the house cracked loudly as the cooler night air contracted the wood casy said quietly i gotta see them folks thats gone out on the road i got a feelin i got to see them they gonna need help no preachin can give em hope of heaven when their lives aint lived holy sperit when their own sperit is downcast an sad they gonna need help they got to live before they can afford to die joad cried nervously jesus christ les eat this meat fore its smallern a cooked mouse

wire heres for the preacher he said i tol you i aint no preacher well heres for the man then he cut off another piece here muley if you aint too goddamn upset to eat this heres jackrabbit toughern a

meat maybe i oughtn to atalked like that he said fella should maybe keep stuff like that in his head casy looked over his mouth full of rabbit he chewed and his muscled throat convulsed in swallowing yes you should talk he said sometimes a sad man can talk the sadness right out through his mouth sometimes a killin man can talk the murder right out of his mouth an not do no murder you done right dont you kill nobody if you can help it and he bit out another hunk of rabbit joad tossed the bones in the fire and jumped up and cut off the wire muley was eating slowly now and his nervous little eyes went from one to the other of his companions joad ate scowling like an animal and a ring of grease formed around his mouth for a long time muley looked at him almost timidly he put down the hand

would said muley the preacher stared into the fire and his high forehead was white in the settling dark the flash of little flames picked out the cords of his neck his hands clasped about his knees were busy pulling knuckles joad threw the last bones into the fire and licked his fingers and then wiped them on his pants he stood up and brought the bottle of water from the porch took a sparing drink and passed the bottle before he sat down again he went on the thing that give me the mos trouble was it didn make no sense you dont look for no sense when lightnin kills a cow or it comes up a flood thats jus the way things is but when a bunch of men take an lock you up four years it ought to have some meaning men is supposed to think things out here they put me in an keep me an feed me four years that ought to either make me so i wont do her again or else punish me so ill be afraid to do her againhe pausedbut if herb or anybody else come for me id do her again do her before i could

the road folks with no lan no home to go to they got to have some kind of home maybe he stood over the fire the hundred muscles of his neck stood out in high relief and the firelight went deep into his eyes and ignited red embers he stood and looked at the fire his face tense as though he were listening and the hands that had been active to pick to handle to throw ideas grew quiet and in a moment crept into his pocket the bats flittered in and out of the dull firelight and the soft watery burble of a night hawk came from across the fields tom reached quietly into his pocket and brought out his tobacco and he rolled a cigarette slowly and looked over it at the coals while he worked he ignored the whole speech of the preacher as though it were some private thing that should not be inspected he said night after night in my bunk i figgered how shed be when i come home again i figgered maybe grampa and granmad be dead an maybe thered be some new kids maybe pad not be so tough

grayed among the stars and the pale late quartermoon was insubstantial and thin tom joad and the preacher walked quickly along a road that was only wheel tracks and beaten caterpillar tracks through a cotton field only the unbalanced sky showed the approach of dawn no horizon to the west and a line to the east the two men walked in silence and smelled the dust their feet kicked into the air i hope youre dead sure of the way jim casy said id hate to have the dawn come and us be way to hell an gone somewhere the cotton field scurried with waking life the quick flutter of morning birds feeding on the ground the scamper over the clods of disturbed rabbits the quiet thudding of the mens feet in the dust the squeak of crushed clods under their shoes sounded against the secret noises of the dawn tom said i could shut my eyes an walk right there ony way i can go wrong is think about her jus forget about her an ill go right there hell man i was born right aroun in here i ran aroun here when i was a kid theys a tree over therelook you can jus make it out well once my old man hung up a dead coyote in that tree hung there till it was all sort of melted an then dropped off dried up like jesus

johns place by sunrise they walked along in silence for a time and the late owls flew over toward the barns the hollow trees the tank houses where they hid from daylight the eastern sky grew fairer and it was possible to see the cotton plants and the graying earth damn if i know how theyre all sleepin at uncle johns he ony got one room an a cookin leanto an a little bit of a barn must be a mob there now the preacher said i dont recollect that john had a fambly just a lone man aint he i dont recollect much about him lonest goddamn man in the world said joad crazy kind of sonofabitch

an we knowed hed come cause jus as sure as he come thered be a pack a gum in the bed right beside ever one of us we thought he was jesus christ awmighty the preacher walked along head down he didnt answer and the light of the coming morning made his forehead seem to shine and his hands swinging beside him flicked into the light and out again tom was silent too as though he had said too intimate a thing and was ashamed he quickened his pace and the preacher kept step they could see a little into gray distance ahead now a snake wriggled slowly from the cotton rows into the road tom stopped short of it and peered gopher snake he said let him go they walked around the snake and went on their way a little color came into the eastern sky and almost immediately the lonely dawn light crept over the land green appeared on the cotton plants and the earth was graybrown the faces of the men lost their grayish shine joads face seemed to darken with the growing light this is the good time joad said softly when i was a kid i used to get up an walk around by myself when it was like this whats that ahead a committee of dogs had met in the road in honor of a bitch five males shepherd mongrels collie mongrels dogs whose breeds had been blurred by a freedom of social life were engaged in complimenting the bitch for each dog sniffed daintily and then stalked to a cotton plant on stiff legs raised a hind foot ceremoniously and wetted then went back to smell joad and the preacher stopped to watch and suddenly joad laughed joyously by god he said by god now all dogs met and hackles rose and they all growled and stood stiffly each waiting for the others to start a fight one dog mounted and now that it was accomplished the others gave way and watched with interest and their tongues were out and their tongues dripped the two men walked on by god joad said i think that updog is our flash i thought hed be dead come flash he laughed again what the hell if somebody called me i wouldnt hear him neither minds me of a story they tell about willy feeley when he was a young fella willy was bashful awful bashful well one day he takes a heifer over to graves bull everbody was out but elsie graves and elsie wasnt bashful at all willy he stood there turnin red an he couldnt even talk elsie says i know what you come for the bulls out in back a the barn well they took the heifer out there an willy an elsie sat on the fence to watch purty soon willy got feelin purty fly elsie looks over an says like she dont know whats a matter willy willys so randy he cant hardly set still by god he says by god i wisht i was adoin that elsie says why not willy its your heifer the preacher laughed softly you know he said its a nice thing not bein a preacher no more nobody use ta tell stories when i was there or if they did i couldn laugh an i couldn cuss now i cuss all i want any time i want an it does a fella good to cuss if he wants to a redness grew up out of the eastern horizon and on the ground birds began to chirp sharply look said joad right ahead thats uncle johns tank cant see the winmill but theres his tank see it against the sky he speeded his walk i wonder if all the folks are there the hulk of the tank stood above a rise joad hurrying raised a cloud of dust about his knees i wonder if ma they saw the tank legs now and the house a square little box unpainted and bare and the barn lowroofed and huddled smoke was rising from the tin chimney of the house in the yard was a litter piled furniture the blades and motor of the windmill bedsteads chairs tables holy christ theyre fixin to go joad said a truck stood in the yard a truck with high sides but a strange truck for while the front of it was a sedan the top had been cut off in the middle and the truck bed fitted on and as they drew near the men could hear pounding from the yard and as the rim of the blinding sun came up over the horizon it fell on the truck and they saw a man and the flash of his hammer as it rose and fell and the sun flashed on the windows of the house the weathered boards were bright two red chickens on the ground flamed with reflected light dont yell said tom lets creep up on em like and he walked so fast that the dust rose high as his waist and then he came to the edge of the cotton field now they were in the yard proper earth beaten hard shiny hard and a few dusty crawling weeds on the ground and joad slowed as though he feared to go on the preacher watching him slowed to match his step tom sauntered forward sidled embarrassedly toward the truck it was a hudson supersix sedan and the top had been ripped in two with a cold chisel old tom joad stood in the truck bed and he was nailing on the top rails of the truck sides his grizzled bearded face was low over his work and a bunch of sixpenny nails stuck out of his mouth he set a nail and his hammer thundered it in from the house came the clash of a lid on the stove and the wail of a child joad sidled up to the truck bed and leaned against it and his father looked at him and did not see him his father set another nail and drove it in a flock of pigeons started from the deck of the tank house and flew around and settled again and strutted to the edge to look over white pigeons and blue pigeons and grays with iridescent wings joad hooked his fingers over the lowest bar of the truck side he looked up at the aging graying man on the truck he wet his thick lips with his tongue and he said softly pa what do you want old tom mumbled around his mouthful of nails he wore a black dirty slouch hat and a blue work shirt over which was a buttonless vest his jeans were held up by a wide harnessleather belt with a big square brass buckle leather and metal polished from years of wearing and his shoes were cracked and the soles swollen and boatshaped from years of sun and wet and dust the sleeves of his shirt were tight on his forearms held down by the bulging powerful muscles stomach and hips were lean and legs short heavy and strong his face squared by a bristling pepper and salt beard was all drawn down to the forceful chin a chin thrust out and built out by the stubble beard which was not so grayed on the chin and gave weight and force to its thrust over old toms unwhiskered cheek bones the skin was as brown as meerschaum and wrinkled in rays around his eyecorners from squinting his eyes were brown blackcoffee brown and he thrust his head forward when he looked at a thing for his bright dark eyes were failing his lips from which the big nails protruded were thin and red he held his hammer suspended in the air about to drive a set nail and he looked over the truck side at tom looked resentful at being interrupted and then his chin drove forward and his eyes looked at toms face and then gradually his brain became aware of what he saw the hammer dropped slowly to his side and with his left hand he took the nails from his mouth and he said wonderingly as though he told himself the fact its tommy and then still informing himself its tommy come home his mouth opened again and a look of fear came into his eyes tommy he said softly you aint busted out you aint got to hide he listened tensely naw said tom im paroled im free i got my papers he gripped the lower bars of the truck side and looked up old tom laid his hammer gently on the floor and put his nails in his pocket he swung his leg over the side and dropped lithely to the ground but once beside his son he seemed embarrassed and strange tommy he said we are goin to california but we was gonna write you a letter an tell you and he said incredulously but youre back you can go with us you can go the lid of a coffee pot slammed in the house old tom looked over his shoulder les surprise em he said and his eyes shone with excitement your ma got a bad feelin she aint never gonna see you no more she got that quiet look like when somebody died almost she dont want to go to california fear shell never see you no more a stove lid clashed in the house again les surprise em old tom repeated les go in like you never been away les jus see what your ma says at last he touched tom but touched him on the shoulder timidly and instantly took his hand away he looked at jim casy tom said you remember the preacher pa he come along with me he been in prison too no i met im on the road he been away pa shook hands gravely youre welcome here sir casy said glad to be here its a thing to see when a boy comes home its a thing to see home pa said to his folks the preacher amended quickly we stayed at the other place last night pas chin thrust out and he looked back down the road for a moment then he turned to tom howll we do her he began excitedly spose i go in an say heres some fellas want some breakfast or howd it be if you jus come in an stood there till she seen you howd that be his face was alive with excitement dont les give her no shock said tom dont les scare her none two rangy shepherd dogs trotted up pleasantly until they caught the scent of strangers and then they backed cautiously away watchful their tails moving slowly and tentatively in the air but their eyes and noses quick for animosity or danger one of them stretching his neck edged forward ready to run and little by little he approached toms legs and sniffed loudly at them then he backed away and watched pa for some kind of signal the other pup was not so brave he looked about for something that could honorably divert his attention saw a red chicken go mincing by and ran at it there was the squawk of an outraged hen a burst of red feathers and the hen ran off flapping stubby wings for speed the pup looked proudly back at the men and then flopped down in the dust and beat its tail contentedly on the ground come on said pa come on in now she got to see you i got to see her face when she sees you come on shell yell breakfast in a minute i heard her slap the salt pork in the pan a good time ago he led the way across the finedusted ground there was no porch on this house just a step and then the door a chopping block beside the door its surface matted and soft from years of chopping the graining in the sheathing wood was high for the dust had cut down the softer wood the smell of burning willow was in the air and as the three men neared the door the smell of frying sidemeat and the smell of high brown biscuits and the sharp smell of coffee rolling in the pot pa stepped up into the open doorway and stood there blocking it with his wide short body he said ma theres a coupla fellas jus come along the road an they wonder if we could spare a bite tom heard his mothers voice the remembered cool calm drawl friendly and humble let em come she said we got aplenty tell em they got to wash their hans the bread is done im jus takin up the sidemeat now and the sizzle of the angry grease came from the stove pa stepped inside clearing the door and tom looked in at his mother she was lifting the curling slices of pork from the frying pan the oven door was open and a great pan of high brown biscuits stood waiting there she looked out the door but the sun was behind tom and she saw only a dark figure outlined by the bright yellow sunlight she nodded pleasantly come in she said jus lucky i made plenty bread this morning tom stood looking in ma was heavy but not fat thick with childbearing and work she wore a loose mother hubbard of gray cloth in which there had once been colored flowers but the color was washed out now so that the small flowered pattern was only a little lighter gray than the background the dress came down to her ankles and her strong broad bare feet moved quickly and deftly over the floor her thin steelgray hair was gathered in a sparse wispy knot at the back of her head strong freckled arms were bare to the elbow and her hands were chubby and delicate like those of a plump little girl she looked out into the sunshine her full face was not soft it was controlled kindly her hazel eyes seemed to have experienced all possible tragedy and to have mounted pain and suffering like steps into a high calm and a superhuman understanding she seemed to know to accept to welcome her position the citadel of the family the strong place that could not be taken and since old tom and the children could not know hurt or fear unless she acknowledged hurt and fear she had practiced denying them in herself and since when a joyful thing happened they looked to see whether joy was on her it was her habit to build up laughter out of inadequate materials but better than joy was calm imperturbability could be depended upon and from her great and humble position in the family she had taken dignity and a clean calm beauty from her position as healer her hands had grown sure and cool and quiet from her position as arbiter she had become as remote and faultless in judgment as a goddess she seemed to know that if she swayed the family shook and if she ever really deeply wavered or despaired the family would fall the family will to function would be gone she looked out into the sunny yard at the dark figure of a man pa stood near by shaking with excitement come in he cried come right in mister and tom a little shamefacedly stepped over the doorsill she looked up pleasantly from the frying pan and then her hand sank slowly to her side and the fork clattered to the wooden floor her eyes opened wide and the pupils dilated she breathed heavily through her open mouth she closed her eyes thank god she said oh thank god and suddenly her face was worried tommy you aint wanted you didnt bust loose no ma parole i got the papers here he touched his breast she moved toward him lithely soundlessly in her bare feet and her face was full of wonder her small hand felt his arm felt the soundness of his muscles and then her fingers went up to his cheek as a blind mans fingers might and her joy was nearly like sorrow tom pulled his underlip between his teeth and bit it her eyes went wonderingly to his bitten lip and she saw the little line of blood against his teeth and the trickle of blood down his lip then she knew and her control came back and her hand dropped her breath came out explosively well she cried we come mighty near to goin without ya an we was wonderin how in the worl you could ever find us she picked up the fork and combed the boiling grease and brought out a dark curl of crisp pork and she set the pot of tumbling coffee on the back of the stove old tom giggled fooled ya huh ma we aimed to fool ya and we done it jus stood there like a hammered sheep wisht grampad been here to see looked like somebodyd beat ya between the eyes with a sledge grampa would a whacked imself so hard hed a throwed his hip outlike he

they can jus get up an step outside when they feel like it pa run on out an tell em tommys home grampas a favorite of him a course said pa i should of did it before he went out the door and crossed the yard swinging his hands high tom watched him go and then his mothers voice called his attention she was pouring coffee she did not look at him tommy she said hesitantly timidly yeah his timidity was set off by hers a curious embarrassment each one knew the other was shy and became more shy in the knowledge tommy i got to ask youyou aint mad mad ma you aint poisoned mad you dont hate nobody they didn do nothin in that jail to rot you out with crazy mad he looked sidewise at her studied her and his eyes seemed to ask how she could know such things nooo he said i was for a little while but i aint proud like some fellas i let stuff run offn me whats a matter ma now she was looking at him her mouth open as though to hear better her eyes digging to know better her face looked for the answer that is always concealed in language she said in confusion i knowed purty boy floyd i knowed his ma they was good folks he was full of hell sure like a good boy oughta be she paused and then

over his teeth he looked down at his big flat hands no he said i aint like that he paused and studied the broken nails which were ridged like clam shells all the time in stir i kep away from stuff like that i ain so mad she sighed thank god under her breath he looked up quickly ma when i seen what they done to our house she came near to him then and stood close and she said passionately tommy dont you go fightin em alone theyll hunt you down like a coyote tommy i got to thinkin an dreamin an wonderin they say theres a hunerd thousand of us shoved out if we was all mad the same way tommythey wouldnt hunt nobody down she stopped tommy looking at her gradually dropped his eyelids until just a short glitter showed through his lashes many folks feel that way he demanded i dont know theyre jus kinda stunned walk aroun like they was half asleep from outside and across the yard came an ancient creaking bleat puraise gawd fur vittory puraise gawd fur vittory tom turned his head and grinned granma finally heard im home ma he said you never was like this before her face hardened and her eyes grew cold i never had my house pushed over she said i never had my fambly stuck out on the road i never had to selleverthinghere they come now she moved back to the stove and dumped the big pan of bulbous biscuits on two tin plates she shook flour into the deep grease to make gravy and her hand was white with flour for a moment tom watched her and then he went to the door across the yard came four people grampa was ahead a lean ragged quick old man jumping with quick steps and favoring his right legthe side that came out of joint he was buttoning his fly as he came and his old hands were having trouble finding the buttons for he had buttoned the top button into the second buttonhole and that threw the whole sequence off he wore dark ragged pants and a torn blue shirt open all the way down and showing long gray underwear also unbuttoned his lean white chest fuzzed with white hair was visible through the opening in his underwear he gave up the fly and left it open and fumbled with the underwear buttons then gave the whole thing up and hitched his brown suspenders his was a lean excitable face with little bright eyes as evil as a frantic childs eyes a cantankerous complaining mischievous laughing face he fought and argued told dirty stories he was as lecherous as always vicious and cruel and impatient like a frantic child and the whole structure overlaid with amusement he drank too much when he could get it ate too much when it was there talked too much all the time behind him hobbled granma who had survived only because she was as mean as her husband she had held her own with a shrill ferocious religiosity that was as lecherous and as savage as anything grampa could offer once after a meeting while she was still speaking in tongues she fired both barrels of a shotgun at her husband ripping one of his buttocks nearly off and after that he admired her and did not try to torture her as children torture bugs as she walked she hiked her mother hubbard up to her knees and she bleated her shrill terrible war cry puraise gawd fur vittory granma and grampa raced each other to get across the broad yard they fought over everything and loved and needed the fighting behind them moving slowly and evenly but keeping up came pa and noahnoah the firstborn tall and strange walking always with a wondering look on his face calm and puzzled he had never been angry in his life he looked in wonder at angry people wonder and uneasiness as normal people look at the insane noah moved slowly spoke seldom and then so slowly that people who did not know him often thought him stupid he was not stupid but he was strange he had little pride no sexual urges he worked and slept in a curious rhythm that nevertheless sufficed him he was fond of his folks but never showed it in any way although an observer could not have told why noah left the impression of being misshapen his head or his body or his legs or his mind but no misshapen member could be recalled pa thought he knew why noah was strange but pa was ashamed and never told for on the night when noah was born pa frightened at the spreading thighs alone in the house and horrified at the screaming wretch his wife had become went mad with apprehension using his hands his strong fingers for forceps he had pulled and twisted the baby the midwife arriving late had found the babys head pulled out of shape its neck stretched its body warped and she had pushed the head back and molded the body with her hands but pa always remembered and was ashamed and he was kinder to noah than to the others in noahs broad face eyes too far apart and long fragile jaw pa thought he saw the twisted warped skull of the baby noah could do all that was required of him could read and write could work and figure but he didnt seem to care there was a listlessness in him toward things people wanted and needed he lived in a strange silent house and looked out of it through calm eyes he was a stranger to all the world but he was not lonely the four came across the yard and grampa demanded where is he goddamn it where is he and his fingers fumbled for his pants button and forgot and strayed into his pocket and then he saw tom standing in the door grampa stopped and he stopped the others his little eyes glittered with malice lookut him he said a jailbird aint been no joads in jail for a hell of a time his mind jumped got no right to put im in jail he done just what id do sonsabitches got no right his mind jumped again an ol turnbull stinkin skunk braggin how hell shoot ya when ya come out says he got hatfield blood well i sent word to him i says dont mess around with no joad maybe i got mccoy blood for

said they aint a gonna keep no joad in jail i says tommyll come abustin outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence an you done it get outa my way im hungry he crowded past sat down loaded his plate with pork and two big biscuits and poured the thick gravy over the whole mess and before the others could get in grampas mouth was full tom grinned affectionately at him aint he a heller he said and grampas mouth was so full that he couldnt even splutter but his mean little eyes smiled and he nodded his head violently granma said proudly a wicketer cussiner man never lived hes goin to hell on a poker praise gawd wants to drive the truck she said spitefully well he aint goin ta grampa choked and a mouthful of paste sprayed into his lap and he coughed weakly granma smiled up at tom messy aint he she observed brightly noah stood on the step and he faced tom and his wideset eyes seemed to look around him his face had little expression tom said how ya noah fine said noah how a you that was all but it was a comfortable thing ma waved the flies away from the bowl of gravy we aint got room to set down she said jus get yaself a plate an set down wherever ya can out in the yard or someplace suddenly tom said hey wheres the preacher he was right here whered he go pa said i seen him but hes gone and granma raised a shrill voice preacher you got a preacher go git him well have a grace she pointed at grampa too late for himhes et go git the preacher tom stepped out on the porch hey jim jim casy he called he walked out in the yard oh casy the preacher emerged from under the tank sat up and then stood up and moved toward the house tom asked what was you doin hidin well no but a fella shouldnt butt his head in where a fambly got fambly stuff i was jus settin athinkin come

quietly youre welcome and pa said youre welcome have some breakfast grace fust granma clamored grace fust grampa focused his eyes fiercely until he recognized casy oh that preacher he said oh hes all right i always liked him since i seen him he winked so lecherously that granma thought he had spoken and retorted shut up you sinful ol goat casy ran his fingers through his hair nervously i got to tell you i aint a preacher no more if me jus bein glad to be here an bein thankful for people thats kind and generous if thats enoughwhy ill say that kinda grace but i aint a preacher no more say her said granma an get in a word about us goin to california the preacher bowed his head and the others bowed their heads ma folded her hands over her stomach and bowed her head granma bowed so low that her nose was nearly in her plate of biscuit and gravy tom leaning against the wall a plate in his hand bowed stiffly and grampa bowed his head sidewise so that he could keep one mean and merry eye on the preacher and on the preachers face there was a look not of prayer but of thought and in his tone not supplication but conjecture i been thinkin he said i been in the hills thinkin almost you might say like jesus went into the wilderness to think his way out of a mess of troubles puraise gawd granma said and the preacher glanced over at her in surprise seems like jesus got all messed up with troubles and he couldnt figure nothin out an he got to feelin what the hell good is it all an whats the use fightin an figurin got tired got good an tired an his sperit all wore out jus about come to the conclusion the hell with it an so he went off into the wilderness amen granma bleated so many years she had timed her responses to the pauses and it was so many years since she had listened to or wondered at the words used i aint sayin im like jesus the preacher went on but i got tired like him an i got mixed up like him an i went into the wilderness like him without no campin stuff nighttime id lay on my back an look up at the stars morning id set an watch the sun come up midday id look out from a hill at the rollin dry country evenin id foller the sun down sometimes id pray like i always done ony i couldn figure what i was prayin to or for there was the hills an there was me an we wasnt separate no more we was one thing an that one thing was holy hallelujah said granma and she rocked a little back and forth trying to catch hold of an ecstasy an i got thinkin ony it wasnt thinkin it was deeper down than thinkin i got thinkin how we was holy when we was one thing an mankin was holy when it was one thing an it ony got unholy when one misable little fella got the bit in his teeth an run off his own way kickin an draggin an fightin fella like that bust the holiness but when theyre all workin together not one fella for another fella but one fella kind of harnessed to the whole shebangthats right thats holy an then i got thinkin i dont even know what i mean by holy he paused but the bowed heads stayed down for they had been trained like dogs to rise at the amen signal i cant say no grace like i use ta say im glad of the holiness of breakfast im glad theres love here thats all the heads stayed down the preacher looked around ive got your breakfast cold he said and then he remembered amen he said and all the heads rose up amen said granma and she fell to her breakfast and broke down the soggy biscuits with her hard old toothless gums tom ate quickly and pa crammed his mouth there was no talk until the food was gone the coffee drunk only the crunch of chewed food and the slup of coffee cooled in transit to the tongue ma watched the preacher as he ate and her eyes were questioning probing and understanding she watched him as though he were suddenly a spirit not human any more a voice out of the ground the men finished and put down their plates and drained the last of their coffee and then the men went out pa and the preacher and noah and grampa and tom and they walked over to the truck avoiding the litter of furniture the wooden bedsteads the windmill machinery the old plow they walked to the truck and stood beside it they touched the new pine sideboards tom opened the hood and looked at the big greasy engine and pa came up beside him he said your brother al looked her over before we bought her he says shes all right whats he know hes just a squirt said tom he worked for a company drove truck last year he knows quite a little smart aleck like he is he knows he can tinker an engine al can tom asked wheres he now well said pa hes

nights for a week grampa fumbling with his chest had succeeded in buttoning the buttons of his blue shirt into the buttonholes of his underwear his fingers felt that something was wrong but did not care enough to find out his fingers went down to try to figure out the intricacies of the buttoning of his fly i was worse he said happily i was much worse i was a heller you might say why they was a

aint gonna go far got a couple of wore out spares pick stuff up along the road i guess the sun driving straight down stung with its rays the shadows of the truck bed were dark bars on the ground and the truck smelled of hot oil and oilcloth and paint the few chickens had left the yard to hide in the tool shed from the sun in the sty the pigs lay panting close to the fence where a thin shadow fell and they complained shrilly now and then the two dogs were stretched in the red dust under the truck panting their dripping tongues covered with dust pa pulled his hat low over his eyes and squatted down on his hams and as though this were his natural position of thought and observation he surveyed tom critically the new but aging cap the suit and the new shoes did you spen your money for them clothes he asked them clothes are jus gonna be a nuisance to ya they give em to me said tom when i come out they give em to me he took off his cap and looked at it with some admiration then wiped his forehead with it and put it on rakishly and pulled at the visor pa observed thems a nicelookin pair a shoes they give ya yeah joad agreed purty for nice but they aint no shoes to go walkin aroun in on a hot day he squatted beside his father noah said slowly maybe if you got them sideboards all true on we could load up this stuff load her up so maybe if al comes in i can drive her if thats what you want tom said i drove truck at mcalester good said pa and then his eyes stared down the road if i aint mistaken theres a young smart aleck draggin his tail home right now he said looks purty wore out too tom and the preacher looked up the road and randy al seeing he was being noticed threw back his shoulders and he came into the yard with a swaying strut like that of a rooster about to crow cockily he walked close before he recognized tom and when he did his boasting face changed and admiration and veneration shone in his eyes and his swagger fell away his stiff jeans with the bottoms turned up eight inches to show his heeled boots his threeinch belt with copper figures on it even the red arm bands on his blue shirt and the rakish angle of his stetson hat could not build him up to his brothers stature for his brother had killed a man and no one would ever forget it al knew that even he had inspired some admiration among boys of his own age because his brother had killed a man he had heard in sallisaw how he was pointed out thats al joad his brother killed a fella with a shovel and now al moving humbly near saw that his brother was not a swaggerer as he had supposed al saw the dark brooding eyes of his brother and the prison calm the smooth hard face trained to indicate nothing to a prison guard neither resistance nor slavishness and instantly al changed unconsciously he became like his brother and his handsome face brooded and his shoulders relaxed he hadnt remembered how tom was tom said hello jesus youre growin like a bean i wouldnt of knowed you al his hand ready if tom should want to shake it grinned selfconsciously tom stuck out his hand and als hand jerked out to meet it and there was liking between these two they tell me youre a good hand with a truck said tom and al sensing that his brother would not like a boaster said i dont know nothin much about it pa said been smartalecking aroun the country you look wore out well you got to take a load of stuff into sallisaw to sell al looked at his brother tom care to ride in he said as casually as he could no i cant said tom ill help aroun here well betogether on the road al tried to control his question diddid you bust out of jail no said tom i got paroled oh and al was a little disappointed chapter in the little houses the tenant people sifted their belongings and the belongings of their fathers and of their grandfathers picked over their possessions for the journey to the west the men were ruthless because the past had been spoiled but the women knew how the past would cry to them in the coming days the men went into the barns and the sheds that plow that harrow remember in the war we planted mustard remember a fella wanted us to put in that rubber bush they call guayule get rich

horsesso beautifula packet of bitterness to grow in your house and to flower some day we could have saved you but you cut us down and soon you will be cut down and therell be none of us to save you and the tenant men came walking back hands in their pockets hats pulled down some bought a pint and drank it fast to make the impact hard and stunning but they didnt laugh and they didnt dance they didnt sing or pick the guitars they walked back to the farms hands in pockets and heads down shoes kicking the red dust up maybe we can start again in the new rich landin california where the fruit

will all be going the same way and theyll all walk together and therell be a dead terror from it the tenant men scuffed home to the farms through the red dust when everything that could be sold was sold stoves and bedsteads chairs and tables little corner cupboards tubs and tanks still there were piles of possessions and the women sat among them turning them over and looking off beyond and back

they loaded up the cars and drove away drove in the dust the dust hung in the air for a long time after the loaded cars had passed chapter when the truck had gone loaded with implements with heavy tools with beds and springs with every movable thing that might be sold tom hung around the place he mooned into the barn shed into the empty stalls and he walked into the implement leanto and kicked the refuse that was left turned a broken mower tooth with his foot he visited places he rememberedthe red bank where the swallows nested the willow tree over the pig pen two shoats grunted and squirmed at him through the fence black pigs sunning and comfortable and then his pilgrimage was over and he went to sit on the doorstep where the shade was lately fallen behind him ma moved about in the kitchen washing childrens clothes in a bucket and her strong freckled arms dripped soapsuds from the elbows she stopped her rubbing when he sat down she looked at him a long time and at the back of his head when he turned and stared out at the hot sunlight and then she went back to her rubbing she said tom i hope things is all right in california he turned and looked at her what makes you

it and leaned against the wall and tom and casy leaned back against the house wall and the shadow of the afternoon moved out from the house in the late afternoon the truck came back bumping and rattling through the dust and there was a layer of dust in the bed and the hood was covered with dust and the headlights were obscured with a red flour the sun was setting when the truck came back and the earth was bloody in its setting light al sat bent over the wheel proud and serious and efficient and pa and uncle john as befitted the heads of the clan had the honor seats beside the driver standing in the truck bed holding onto the bars of the sides rode the others twelveyearold ruthie and tenyearold winfield grimefaced and wild their eyes tired but excited their fingers and the edges of their mouths black and sticky from licorice whips whined out of their father in town ruthie dressed in a real dress of pink muslin that came below her knees was a little serious in her youngladiness but winfield was still a trifle of a snotnose a little of a brooder back of the barn and an inveterate collector and smoker of snipes and whereas ruthie felt the might the responsibility and the dignity of her developing breasts winfield was kidwild and calfish beside them clinging lightly to the bars stood rose of sharon and she balanced swaying on the balls of her feet and took up the road shock in her knees and hams for rose of sharon was pregnant and careful her hair braided and wrapped around her head made an ashblond crown her round soft face which had been voluptuous and inviting a few months ago had already put on the barrier of pregnancy the selfsufficient smile the knowing perfectionlook and her plump bodyfull soft breasts and stomach hard hips and buttocks that had swung so freely and provocatively as to invite slapping and strokingher whole body had become demure and serious her whole thought and action were directed inward on the baby she balanced on her toes now for the babys sake and the world was pregnant to her she thought only in terms of reproduction and of motherhood connie her nineteenyearold husband who had married a plump passionate hoyden was still frightened and bewildered at the change in her for there were no more cat fights in bed biting and scratching with muffled giggles and final tears there was a balanced careful wise creature who smiled shyly but very firmly at him connie was proud and fearful of rose of sharon whenever he could he put a hand on her or stood close so that his body touched her at hip and shoulder and he felt that this kept a relation that might be departing he was a sharpfaced lean young man of a texas strain and his pale blue eyes were sometimes dangerous and sometimes kindly and sometimes frightened he was a good hard worker and would make a good husband he drank enough but not too much fought when it was required of him and never boasted he sat quietly in a gathering and yet managed to be there and to be recognized had he not been fifty years old and so one of the natural rulers of the family uncle john would have preferred not to sit in the honor place beside the driver he would have liked rose of sharon to sit there this was impossible because she was young and a woman but uncle john sat uneasily his lonely haunted eyes were not at ease and his thin strong body was not relaxed nearly all the time the barrier of loneliness cut uncle john off from people and from appetites he ate little drank nothing and was celibate but underneath his appetites swelled into pressures until they broke through then he would eat of some craved food until he was sick or he would drink jake or whisky until he was a shaken paralytic with red wet eyes or he would raven with lust for some whore in sallisaw it was told of him that once he went clear to shawnee and hired three whores in one bed and snorted and rutted on their unresponsive bodies for an hour but when one of his appetites was sated he was sad and ashamed and lonely again he hid from people and by gifts tried to make up to all people for himself then he crept into houses and left gum under pillows for children then he cut wood and took no pay then he gave away any possession he might have a saddle a horse a new pair of shoes one could not talk to him then for he ran away or if confronted hid within himself and peeked out of frightened eyes the death of his wife followed by months of being alone had marked him with guilt and shame and had left an unbreaking loneliness on him but there were things he could not escape being one of the heads of the family he had to govern and now he had to sit on the honor seat beside the driver the three men on the seat were glum as they drove toward home over the dusty road al bending over the wheel kept shifting eyes from the road to the instrument panel watching the ammeter needle which jerked suspiciously watching the oil gauge and the heat indicator and his mind was cataloguing weak points and suspicious things about the car he listened to the whine which might be the rear end dry and he listened to tappets lifting and falling he kept his hand on the gear lever feeling the turning gears through it and he had let the clutch out against the brake to test for slipping clutch plates he might be a musking goat sometimes but this was his responsibility this truck its running and its maintenance if something went wrong it would be his fault and while no one would say it everyone and al most of all would know it was his fault and so he felt it watched it and listened to it and his face was serious and responsible and everyone respected him and his responsibility even pa who was the leader would hold a wrench and take orders from al they were all tired on the truck ruthie and winfield were tired from seeing too much movement too many faces from fighting to get licorice whips tired from the excitement of having uncle john secretly slip gum into their pockets and the men in the seat were tired and angry and sad for they had got eighteen dollars for every movable thing from the farm the horses the wagon the implements and all the furniture from the house eighteen dollars they had assailed the buyer argued but they were routed when his interest seemed to flag and he had told them he didnt want the stuff at any price then they were beaten believed him and took two dollars less than he had first offered and now they were weary and frightened because they had gone against a system they did not understand and it had beaten them they knew the team and the wagon were worth much more they knew the buyer man would get much more but they didnt know how to do it merchandising was a secret to them al his eyes darting from road to panel board said that fella he aint a local fella didn talk like a local fella clothes was different too and pa explained when i was in the hardware store i talked to some men i know they say theres fellas comin in jus to buy up the stuff us fellas got to sell when we get out they say these new fellas is cleaning up but there aint nothin we can do about it maybe tommy should of went maybe he could of did better john said but the fella wasnt gonna take it at all we couldnt haul it back these men i know told about that said pa said the buyer fellas always done that scairt folks that way we jus dont know how to go about stuff like that mas gonna be disappointed shell be mad an disappointed al said when ya think were gonna go pa i dunno well talk her over tonight an decide im sure glad toms back that makes me feel good toms a good boy al said pa some fellas was talkin about tom an they says hes parole an they says that means he cant go outside the state or if he goes an they catch him they send im back for three years pa looked startled they said that seem like fellas that knowed not jus blowin off i dont know said al they was just atalkin there an i didnt let on hes my brother i jus stood an took it in pa said jesus christ i hope that aint true we need tom ill ask im about that we got trouble enough without they chase the hell out of us i hope it aint true we got to talk that out in the open uncle john said tom hell know they fell silent while the truck battered along the engine was noisy full of little clashings and the brake rods banged there was a wooden creaking from the wheels and a thin jet of steam escaped through a hole in the top of the radiator cap the truck pulled a high whirling column of red dust behind it they rumbled up the last little rise while the sun was still halfface above the horizon and they bore down on the house as it disappeared the brakes squealed when they stopped and the sound printed in als headno lining left ruthie and winfield climbed yelling over the side walls and dropped to the ground they shouted where is he wheres tom and then they saw him standing beside the door and they stopped embarrassed and walked slowly toward him and looked shyly at him and when he said hello how you kids doin they replied softly hello all right and they stood apart and watched him secretly the great brother who had killed a man and been in prison they remembered how they had played prison in the chicken coop and fought for the right to be prisoner connie rivers lifted the high tailgate out of the truck and got down and helped rose of sharon to the ground and she accepted it nobly smiling her wise selfsatisfied smile mouth tipped at the corners a little fatuously tom said why it rosasharn i didnt know you was comin with them we was walkin she said the truck come by an picked us up and then she said this is connie my husband and she was grand saying it the two shook hands sizing each other up looking deeply into each other and in a moment each was satisfied and tom said well i see you been busy she looked down you do not see not yet pa tol me whens it gonna be oh not for a long time not till nex winter tom laughed gonna get im bore in a orange ranch huh in one a them white houses with orange trees all aroun rose of sharon felt her stomach with both her hands you do not see she said and she smiled her complacent smile and went into the house the evening was hot and the thrust of light still flowed up from the western horizon and without any signal the family gathered by the truck and the congress the family government went into session the film of evening light made the red earth lucent so that its dimensions were deepened so that a stone a post a building had greater depth and more solidity than in the daytime light and these objects were curiously more individuala post was more essentially a post set off from the earth it stood in and the field of corn it stood out against all plants were individuals not the mass of crop and the ragged willow tree was itself standing free of all other willow trees the earth contributed a light to the evening the front of the gray paintless house facing the west was luminous as the moon is the gray dusty truck in the yard before the door stood out magically in this light in the overdrawn perspective of a stereopticon the people too were changed in the evening quieted they seemed to be a part of an organization of the unconscious they obeyed impulses which registered only faintly in their thinking minds their eyes were inward and quiet and their eyes too were lucent in the evening lucent in dusty faces the family met at the most important place near the truck the house was dead and the fields were dead but this truck was the active thing the living principle the ancient hudson with bent and scarred radiator screen with grease in dusty globules at the worn edge of every moving part with hub caps gone and caps of red dust in their placesthis was the new hearth the living center of the family half passenger car and half truck highsided and clumsy pa walked around the truck looking at it and then he squatted down in the dust and found a stick to draw with one foot was flat to the ground the other rested on the ball and slightly back so that one knee was higher than the other left forearm rested on the lower left knee the right elbow on the right knee and the right fist cupped for the chin pa squatted there looking at the truck his chin in his cupped fist and uncle john moved toward him and squatted down beside him their eyes were brooding grampa came out of the house and saw the two squatting together and he jerked over and sat on the running board of the truck facing them that was the nucleus tom and connie and noah strolled in and squatted and the line was a halfcircle with grampa in the opening and then ma came out of the house and granma with her and rose of sharon behind walking daintily they took their places behind the squatting men they stood up and put their hands on their hips and the children ruthie and winfield hopped from foot to foot beside the women the children squidged their toes in the red dust but they made no sound only the preacher was not there he out of delicacy was sitting on the ground behind the house he was a good preacher and knew his people the evening light grew softer and for a while the family sat and stood silently then pa speaking to no one but to the group made his report got skinned on the stuff we sold the fella knowed we couldnt wait got eighteen dollars only ma stirred restively but she held her peace noah the oldest son asked how much all added up we got pa drew figures in the dust and mumbled to himself for a moment hundred fiftyfour he said but al here says we gonna need better tires says these here wont last this was als first participation in the conference always he had stood behind with the women before and now he made his report solemnly shes old an shes ornery he said gravely i gave the whole thing a good goinover fore we bought her didn listen to the fella talkin what a hell of a bargain she was stuck my finger in the differential and they wasnt no sawdust opened the gear box an they wasnt no sawdust test her clutch an rolled her wheels for line went under her an her frame aint splayed none she never been rolled seen they was a cracked cell in her battery an made the fella put in a good one the tires aint worth a damn but theyre a good size easy to get shell ride like a bull calf but she aint shootin no oil reason i says buy her is she was a poplar car wreckin yards is full a hudson supersixes an you can buy parts cheap could a got a bigger fancier car for the same money but parts too hard to get an too dear thats how i figgered her anyways the last was his submission to the family he stopped speaking and waited for their opinions grampa was still the titular head but he no longer ruled his position was honorary and a matter of custom but he did have the right of first comment no matter how silly his old mind might be and the squatting men and the standing women waited for him youre all right al grampa said i was a squirt jus like you afartin aroun like a dogwolf but when they was a job i done it youve growed up good he finished in the tone of a benediction and al reddened a little with pleasure pa said sounds rightsideup to me if it was horses we wouldnt have to put the blame on al but als the ony automobile fella here tom said i know some worked some in mcalester als right he done good and now al was rosy with the compliment tom went on id like to saywell that preacherhe wants to go along he was silent his words lay in the group and the group was silent hes a nice fella tom added weve knowed him a long time talks a little wild sometimes but he talks sensible and he relinquished the proposal to the family the light was going gradually ma left the group and went into the house and the iron clang of the stove came from the house in a moment she walked back to the brooding council grampa said they was two ways a thinkin some folks use ta figger that a preacher was poison luck tom said this fella says he aint a preacher no more grampa waved his hand back and forth once a fellas a preacher hes always a preacher thats somepin you cant get shut of they was some folks figgered it was a good respectable thing to have a preacher along ef somebody died preacher buried em weddin come due or overdue an theres your preacher baby come an you got a christener right under the roof me i always said they was preachers an preachers got to pick em i kinda like this fella he aint stiff pa dug his stick into the dust and rolled it between his fingers so that it bored a little hole theys more to this than is he lucky or is he a nice fella pa said we got to figger close its a sad thing to figger close les see now theres grampa an granmathats two an me an john an mathats five an noah an tommy an althats eight rosasharn

or a lift on the road to anybody that asked theys been mean joads but never that mean pa broke in but spose there just aint room he had twisted his neck to look up at her and he was ashamed her tone had made him ashamed spose we jus cant all get in the truck there aint room now she said there aint room for moren six an twelve is goin sure one more aint gonna hurt an a man strong an healthy aint never no burden an any time when we got two pigs an over a hundred dollars an we wonderin if we kin feed a fella she stopped and pa turned back and his spirit was raw from the whipping granma said a preacher is a nice thing to be with us he give a nice grace this morning pa looked at the face of each one for dissent and then he said want to call im over tommy if hes goin he ought to be here tom got up from his hams and went toward the house calling casyoh casy a muffled voice replied from behind the house tom walked to the corner and saw the preacher sitting back against the wall looking at the flashing evening star in the light sky calling me casy asked yeah we think long as youre goin with us you ought to be over with us helpin to figger things out casy got to his feet he knew the government of families and he knew he had been taken into the family indeed his position was eminent for uncle john moved sideways leaving space between pa and himself for the preacher casy squatted down like the others facing grampa enthroned on the running board ma went to the house again there was a screech of a lantern hood and the yellow light flashed up in the dark kitchen when she lifted the lid of the big pot the smell of boiling sidemeat and beet greens came out the door they waited for her to come back across the darkening yard for ma was powerful in the group pa said we got to figger when to start sooner the better what we got to do fore we go is get them pigs slaughtered an in salt an pack our stuff an go quicker the better now noah agreed if we pitch in we kin get ready tomorrow an we kin go bright the nex day uncle john objected cant chill no meat in the heat a the day wrong time a year for slaughterin meatll be sof if it don chill well les do her tonight shell chill tonight some much as shes gonna after we eat les get her done got salt ma said yes got plenty salt got two nice kegs too well les get her done then said tom grampa began to scrabble about trying to get a purchase to arise gettin dark he said im gettin hungry come time we get to california ill have a big bunch a grapes in my han all the time anibblin off it all the time by god he got up and the men arose ruthie and winfield hopped excitedly about in the dust like crazy things ruthie whispered hoarsely to winfield killin pigs and goin to california killin pigs and goinall the same time and winfield was reduced to madness he stuck his finger against his throat made a horrible face and wobbled about weakly shrilling im a ol pig look im a ol pig look at the blood ruthie and he staggered and sank to the ground and waved arms and legs weakly but ruthie was older and she knew the tremendousness of the time and goin to california she said again and she knew this was the great time in her life so far the adults moved toward the lighted kitchen through the deep dusk and ma served them greens and sidemeat in tin plates but before ma ate she put the big round wash tub on the stove and started the fire to roaring she carried buckets of water until the tub was full and then around the tub she clustered the buckets full of water the kitchen became a swamp of heat and the family ate hurriedly and went out to sit on the doorstep until the water should get hot they sat looking out at the dark at the square of light the kitchen lantern threw on the ground outside the door with a hunched shadow of grampa in the middle of it noah picked his teeth thoroughly with a broom straw ma and rose of sharon washed up the dishes and piled them on the table and then all of a sudden the family began to function pa got up and lighted another lantern noah from a box in the kitchen brought out the bowbladed butchering knife and whetted it on a worn little carborundum stone and he laid the scraper on the chopping block and the knife beside it pa brought two sturdy sticks each three feet long and pointed the ends with the ax and he tied strong ropes double halfhitched to the middle of the sticks he grumbled shouldnt of sold those singletreesall of em the water in the pots steamed and rolled noah asked gonna take the water down there or bring the pigs up here pigs up here said pa you cant spill a pig and scald yourself like you can hot water water about ready jus about said ma aw right noah you an tom an al come along ill carry the light well slaughter down there an bring em up here noah took his knife and al the ax and the four men moved down on the sty their legs flickering in the lantern light ruthie and winfield skittered along hopping over the ground at the sty pa leaned over the fence holding the lantern the sleepy young pigs struggled to their feet grunting suspiciously uncle john and the preacher walked down to help all right said pa stick em an well run em up and bleed an scald at the house noah and tom stepped over the fence they slaughtered quickly and efficiently tom struck twice with the blunt head of the ax and noah leaning over the felled pigs found the great artery with his curving knife and released the pulsing streams of blood then over the fence with the squealing pigs the preacher and uncle john dragged one by the hind legs and tom and noah the other pa walked along with the lantern and the black blood made two trails in the dust at the house noah slipped his knife between tendon and bone of the hind legs the pointed sticks held the legs apart and the carcasses were hung from the twobyfour rafters that stuck out from the house then the men carried the boiling water and poured it over the black bodies noah slit the bodies from end to end and dropped the entrails out on the ground pa sharpened two more sticks to hold the bodies open to the air while tom with the scrubber and ma with a dull knife scraped the skins to take out the bristles al brought a bucket and shoveled the entrails into it and dumped them on the ground away from the house and two cats followed him mewing loudly and the dogs followed him growling lightly at the cats pa sat on the doorstep and looked at the pigs hanging in the lantern light the scraping was done now and only a few drops of blood continued to fall from the carcasses into the black pool on the ground pa got up and went to the pigs and felt them with his hand and then he sat down again granma and grampa went toward the barn to sleep and grampa carried a candle lantern in his hand the rest of the family sat quietly about the doorstep connie and al and tom on the ground leaning their backs against the house wall uncle john on a box pa in the doorway only ma and rose of sharon continued to move about ruthie and winfield were sleepy now but fighting it off they quarreled sleepily out in the darkness noah and the preacher squatted side by side facing the house pa scratched himself nervously and took off his hat and ran his fingers through his hair tomorra well get that pork salted early in the morning an then well get the truck loaded all but the beds an nex morning off well go hardly is a days work in all that he said uneasily tom broke in well be moonin aroun all day lookin for somepin to do the group stirred uneasily we could get ready by daylight an go tom suggested pa rubbed his knee with his hand and the restiveness spread to all of them noah said probly wouldnt hurt that meat to git her right down in salt cut her up shed cool quicker anyways it was uncle john who broke over the edge his pressures too great what we hangin aroun for i want to get shut of this now were goin why dont we go and the revulsion spread to the rest whynt we go get sleep on the way and a sense of hurry crept into them pa said they say its two thousan miles thats a hell of a long ways we oughta go noah you an me can get that meat cut up an we can put all the stuff in the truck ma put her head out of the door how about if we forgit somepin not seein it in the dark we could look round after daylight said noah they sat still then thinking about it but in a moment noah got up and began to sharpen the bowbladed knife on his little worn stone ma he said git that table cleared and he stepped to a pig cut a line down one side of the backbone and began peeling the meat forward off the ribs pa stood up excitedly we got to get the stuff together he said come on you fellas now that they were committed to going the hurry infected all of them noah carried the slabs of meat into the kitchen and cut it into small salting blocks and ma patted the coarse salt in laid it piece by piece in the kegs careful that no two pieces touched each other she laid the slabs like bricks and pounded salt in the spaces and noah cut up the sidemeat and he cut up the legs ma kept her fire going and as noah cleaned the ribs and the spines and leg bones of all the meat he could she put them in the oven to roast for gnawing purposes in the yard and in the barn the circles of lantern light moved about and the men brought together all the things to be taken and piled them by the truck rose of sharon brought out all the clothes the family possessed the overalls the thicksoled shoes the rubber boots the worn best suits the sweaters and sheepskin coats and she packed these tightly into a wooden box and got into the box and tramped them down and then she brought out the print dresses and shawls the black cotton stockings and the childrens clothessmall overalls and cheap print dressesand she put these in the box and tramped them down tom went to the tool shed and brought what tools were left to go a hand saw and a set of wrenches a hammer and a box of assorted nails a pair of pliers and a flat file and a set of rattail files and rose of sharon brought out the big piece of tarpaulin and spread it on the ground behind the truck she struggled through the door with the mattresses three double ones and a single she piled them on the tarpaulin and brought armloads of folded ragged blankets and piled them up ma and noah worked busily at the carcasses and the smell of roasting pork bones came from the stove the children had fallen by the way in the late night winfield lay curled up in the dust outside the door and ruthie sitting on a box in the kitchen where she had gone to watch the butchering had dropped her head back against the wall she breathed easily in her sleep and her lips were parted over her teeth tom finished with the tools and came into the kitchen with his lantern and the preacher followed him god in a buckboard tom said smell that meat an listen to her crackle ma laid the bricks of meat in a keg and poured salt around and over them and covered the layer with salt and patted it down she looked up at tom and smiled a little at him but her eyes were serious and tired be nice to have pork bones for breakfas she said the preacher stepped beside her leave me salt down this meat he said i can do it theres other stuff for you to do she stopped her work then and inspected him oddly as though he suggested a curious thing and her hands were crusted with salt pink with fluid from the fresh pork its womens work she said finally its all work the preacher replied theys too much of it to split it up to mens or womens work you got stuff to do leave me salt the meat still for a moment she stared at him and then she poured water from a bucket into the tin wash basin and she washed her hands the preacher took up the blocks of pork and patted on the salt while she watched him and he laid them in the kegs as she had only when he had finished a layer and covered it carefully and patted down the salt was she satisfied she dried her bleached and bloated hands tom said ma what stuff we gonna take from here she looked quickly about the kitchen the bucket she said all the stuff to eat with plates an the cups the spoons an knives an forks put all them in that drawer an take the drawer the big fry pan an the big stew kettle the coffee pot when it gets cool take the rack outa the oven thats good over a fire id like to take the wash tub but i guess there aint room ill wash clothes in the bucket dont do no good to take little stuff you can cook little stuff in a big kettle but you cant cook big stuff in a little pot take the bread pans all of em they fit down inside each other she stood and looked about the kitchen you jus take that stuff i tol you tom ill fix up the rest the big can a pepper an the salt an the nutmeg an the grater ill take all that stuff jus at the last she picked up a lantern and walked heavily into the bedroom and her bare feet made no sound on the floor the preacher said she looks tard womens always tard said tom thats just the way women is cept at meetin once an again yeah but tardern that real tard like shes sicktard ma was just through the door and she heard his words slowly her relaxed face tightened and the lines disappeared from the taut muscular face her eyes sharpened and her shoulders straightened she glanced about the stripped room nothing was left in it except trash the mattresses which had been on the floor were gone the bureaus were sold on the floor lay a broken comb an empty talcum powder can and a few dust mice ma set her lantern on the floor she reached behind one of the boxes that had served as chairs and brought out a stationery box old and soiled and cracked at the corners she sat down and opened the box inside were letters clippings photographs a pair of earrings a little gold signet ring and a watch chain braided of hair and tipped with gold swivels she touched the letters with her fingers touched them lightly and she smoothed a newspaper clipping on which there was an account of toms trial for a long time she held the box looking over it and her fingers disturbed the letters and then lined them up again she bit her lower lip thinking remembering and at last she made up her mind she picked out the ring the watch charm the earrings dug under the pile and found one gold cuff link she took a letter from an envelope and dropped the trinkets in the envelope then gently and tenderly she closed the box and smoothed the top carefully with her fingers her lips parted then she stood up took her lantern and went back into the kitchen she lifted the stove lid and laid the box gently among the coals quickly the heat browned the paper a flame licked up and over the box she replaced the stove lid and instantly the fire sighed up and breathed over the box out in the dark yard working in the lantern light pa and al loaded the truck tools on the bottom but handy to reach in case of a breakdown boxes of clothes next and kitchen utensils in a gunny sack cutlery and dishes in their box then the gallon bucket tied on behind they made the bottom of the load as even as possible and filled the spaces between boxes with rolled blankets then over the top they laid the mattresses filling the truck in level and last they spread the big tarpaulin over the load and al made holes in the edge two feet apart and inserted little ropes and tied it down to the sidebars of the truck now if it rains he said well tie it to the bar above an the folks can get underneath out of the wet up front well be dry enough and pa applauded thats a good idear that aint all al said first chance i git im gonna fin a long plank an make a ridge pole an put the tarp over that an then itll be covered in an the folksll be outa the sun

daylight began in the sky and the work was donethe kegs of pork ready the chicken coop ready to go on top ma opened the oven and took out the pile of roasted bones crisp and brown with plenty of gnawing meat left ruthie half awakened and slipped down from the box and slept again but the adults stood around the door shivering a little and gnawing at the crisp pork guess we oughta wake up granma an grampa tom said gettin along on toward day ma said kinda hate to till the las minute they need the sleep ruthie an winfield aint hardly got no real rest neither well they kin all sleep on top a the load said pa itll be nice an comftable there suddenly the dogs started up from the dust and listened and then with a roar went barking off into the darkness now what in hell is that pa demanded in a moment they heard a voice speaking reassuringly to the barking dogs and the barking lost its fierceness then footsteps and a man approached it was muley graves his hat pulled low he came near timidly morning folks he said why muley pa waved the ham bone he held step in an get some pork for yourself muley well no said muley i aint hungry exactly oh get it muley get it here and pa

weve et said tom mas fixin you a cup a coffee an some pork he went into the house and he drank his coffee and ate his pork the group outside in the growing dawn watched him quietly through the door they saw him yawn and sway and they saw him put his arms on the table and rest his head on his arms and go to sleep he was tard anyways said tom leave him be now they were ready granma giddy and vague saying whats all this what you doin now so early but she was dressed and agreeable and ruthie and winfield were awake but quiet with the pressure of tiredness and still half dreaming the light was sifting rapidly over the land and the movement of the family stopped they stood about reluctant to make the first active move to go they were afraid now that the time had comeafraid in the same way grampa was afraid they saw the shed take shape against the light and they saw the lanterns pale until they no longer cast their circles of yellow light the stars went out few by few toward the west and still the family stood about like dream walkers their eyes focused panoramically seeing no detail but the whole dawn the whole land the whole texture of the country at once only muley graves prowled about restlessly looking through the bars into the truck thumping the spare tires hung on the back of the truck and at last muley approached tom you goin over the state line he asked you gonna break your parole and tom shook himself free of the numbness jesus christ its near sunrise he said loudly we got to get goin and the others came out of their numbness and moved toward the truck come on tom said les get grampa on pa and uncle john and tom and al went into the kitchen where grampa slept his forehead down on his arms and a line of drying coffee on the table they took him under the elbows and lifted him to his feet and he grumbled and cursed thickly like a drunken man out the door they boosted him and when they came to the truck tom and al climbed up and leaning over hooked their hands under his arms and lifted him gently up and laid him on top of the load al untied the tarpaulin and they rolled him under and put a box under the tarp beside him so that the weight of the heavy canvas would not be upon him i got to get that ridge pole fixed al said do her tonight when we stop grampa grunted and fought weakly against awakening and when he was finally settled he went deeply to sleep again pa said ma you an granma set in with al for a while well change aroun so its easier but you start out that way they got into the cab and then the rest swarmed up on top of the load connie and rose of sharon pa and uncle john ruthie and winfield tom and the preacher noah stood on the ground looking up at the great load of them sitting on top of the truck al walked around looking underneath at the springs holy jesus he said them springs is flat as hell lucky i blocked under em noah said how about the dogs pa i forgot the dogs pa said he whistled shrilly and one bouncing dog ran in but only one noah caught him and threw him up on the top where he sat rigid and shivering at the height got to leave the other two pa called muley will you look after em some see they dont starve yeah said muley ill like to have a couple dogs yeah ill take em take them chickens too pa said al got into the drivers seat the starter whirred and caught and whirred again and then the loose roar of the six cylinders and a blue smoke behind so long muley al called and the family called goodby muley al slipped in the low gear and let in the clutch the truck shuddered and strained across the yard and the second gear took hold they crawled up the hill and the red dust arose about them christ what a load said al we aint makin no time on this trip ma tried to look back but the body of the load cut off her view she straightened her head and peered straight ahead along the dirt road and a great weariness was in her eyes the people on top of the load did look back they saw the house and the barn and a little smoke still rising from the chimney they saw the windows reddening under the first color of the sun they saw muley standing forlornly in the dooryard looking after them and then the hill cut them off the cotton fields lined the road and the truck crawled slowly through the dust toward the highway and the west chapter the houses were left vacant on the land and the land was vacant because of this only the tractor sheds of corrugated iron silver and gleaming were alive and they were alive with metal and gasoline and oil the disks of the plows shining the tractors had lights shining for there is no day and night for a tractor and the disks turn the earth in the darkness and they glitter in the daylight and when a horse stops work and goes into the barn there is a life and a vitality left there is a breathing and a warmth and the feet shift on the straw and the jaws clamp on the hay and the ears and the eyes are alive there is a warmth of life in the barn and the heat and smell of life but when the motor of a tractor stops it is as dead as the ore it came from the heat goes out of it like the living heat that leaves a corpse then the corrugated iron doors are closed and the tractor man drives home to town perhaps twenty miles away and he need not come back for weeks or months for the tractor is dead and this is easy and efficient so easy that the wonder goes out of work so efficient that the wonder goes out of land and the working of it and with the wonder the deep understanding and the relation and in the tractor man there grows the contempt that comes only to a stranger who has little understanding and no relation for nitrates are not the land nor phosphates and the length of fiber in the cotton is not the land carbon is not a man nor salt nor water nor calcium he is all these but he is much more much more and the land is so much more than its analysis the man who is more than his chemistry walking on the earth turning his plow point for a stone dropping his handles to slide over an outcropping kneeling in the earth to eat his lunch that man who is more than his elements knows the land that is more than its analysis but the machine man driving a dead tractor on land he does not know and love understands only chemistry and he is contemptuous of the land and of himself when the corrugated iron doors are shut he goes home and his home is not the land the doors of the empty houses swung open and drifted back and forth in the wind bands of little boys came out from the towns to break the windows and to pick over the debris looking for treasures and heres a knife with half the blade gone thats a good thing andsmells like a rat died here and look what whitey wrote on the wall he wrote that in the toilet in school too an teacher made im wash it off when the folks first left and the evening of the first day came the hunting cats slouched in from the fields and mewed on the porch and when no one came out the cats crept through the open doors and walked mewing through the empty rooms and then they went back to the fields and were wild cats from then on hunting gophers and field mice and sleeping in ditches in the daytime when the night came the bats which had stopped at the doors for fear of light swooped into the houses and sailed through the empty rooms and in a little while they stayed in dark room corners during the day folded their wings high and hung headdown among the rafters and the smell of their droppings was in the empty houses and the mice moved in and stored weed seeds in corners in boxes in the backs of drawers in the kitchens and weasels came in to hunt the mice and the brown owls flew shrieking in and out again now there came a little shower the weeds sprang up in front of the doorstep where they had not been allowed and grass grew up through the porch boards the houses were vacant and a vacant house falls quickly apart splits started up the sheathing from the rusted nails a dust settled on the floors and only mouse and weasel and cat tracks disturbed it one night the wind loosened a shingle and flipped it to the ground the next wind pried into the hole where the shingle had been lifted off three and the next a dozen the midday sun burned through the hole and threw a glaring spot on the floor the wild cats crept in from the fields at night but they did not mew at the doorstep any more they moved like shadows of a cloud across the room into the rooms to hunt the mice and on windy nights the doors banged and the ragged curtains fluttered in the broken windows chapter highway is the main migrant road the long concrete path across the country waving gently up and down on the map from the mississippi to bakersfieldover the red lands and the gray lands twisting up into the mountains crossing the divide and down into the bright and terrible desert and across the desert to the mountains again and into the rich california valleys is the path of a people in flight refugees from dust and shrinking land from the thunder of tractors and shrinking ownership from the deserts slow northward invasion from the twisting winds that howl up out of texas from the floods that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there from all of these the people are in flight and they come into from the tributary side roads from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads is the mother road the road of flight clarksville and ozark and van buren and fort smith on and theres an end of arkansas and all the roads into oklahoma city down from tulsa up from mcalester from wichita falls south from enid north edmond mcloud purcell out of oklahoma city el reno and clinton going west on hydro elk city and texola and theres an end to oklahoma across the panhandle of texas shamrock and mclean conway and amarillo the yellow wildorado and vega and boise and theres an end of texas tucumcari and santa rosa and into the new mexican mountains to albuquerque where the road comes down from santa fe then down the gorged rio grande to las lunas and west again on to gallup and theres the border of new mexico and now the high mountains holbrook and winslow and flagstaff in the high mountains of arizona then the great plateau rolling like a ground swell ashfork and kingman and stone mountains again where water must be hauled and sold then out of the broken sunrotted mountains of arizona to the colorado with green reeds on its banks and thats the end of arizona theres california just over the river and a pretty town to start it needles on the river but the river is a stranger in this place up from needles and over a burned range and theres the desert and goes on over the terrible desert where the distance shimmers and the black center mountains hang unbearably in the distance at last theres barstow and more desert until at last the mountains rise up again the good mountains and winds through them then suddenly a pass and below the beautiful valley below orchards and vineyards and little houses and in the distance a city and oh my god its over the people in flight streamed out on sometimes a single car sometimes a little caravan all day they rolled slowly along the road and at night they stopped near water in the day ancient leaky radiators sent up columns of steam loose connecting rods hammered and pounded and

says two hundred and fifty thousand people over the road fifty thousand old carswounded steaming wrecks along the road abandoned well what happened to them what happened to the folks in that car did they walk where are they where does the courage come from where does the terrible faith come from and heres a story you can hardly believe but its true and its funny and its beautiful there was a family of twelve and they were forced off the land they had no car they built a trailer out of junk and loaded it with their possessions they pulled it to the side of and waited and pretty soon a sedan picked them up five of them rode in the sedan and seven on the trailer and a dog on the trailer they got to california in two jumps the man who pulled them fed them and thats true but how can such courage be and such faith in their own species very few things would teach such faith the people in flight from the terror behindstrange things happen to them some bitterly cruel and some so beautiful that the faith is refired forever chapter the ancient overloaded hudson creaked and grunted to the highway at sallisaw and turned west and the sun was blinding but on the concrete road al built up his speed because the flattened springs were not in danger any more from sallisaw to gore is twentyone miles and the hudson was doing thirtyfive miles an hour from gore to warner thirteen miles warner to checotah fourteen miles checotah a long jump to henriettathirtyfour miles but a real town at the end of it henrietta to castle nineteen miles and the sun was overhead and the red fields heated by the high sun vibrated the air al at the wheel his face purposeful his whole body listening to the car his restless eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel al was one with his engine every nerve listening for weaknesses for the thumps or squeals hums and chattering that indicate a change that may cause a breakdown he had become the soul of the car granma beside him on the seat half slept and whimpered in her sleep opened her eyes to peer ahead and then dozed again and ma sat beside granma one elbow out the window and the skin reddening under the fierce sun ma looked ahead too but her eyes were flat and did not see the road or the fields the gas stations the little eating sheds she did not glance at them as the hudson went by al shifted himself on the broken seat and changed his grip on the steering wheel and he sighed makes a racket but i think shes awright god knows what shell do if we got to climb a hill with the load we got got any hills tween here an california ma ma turned her head slowly and her eyes came to life seems to me theys hills she said course i dunno but seems to me i heard theys hills an even mountains big ones granma drew a

through said ma that preacherll help us she looked ahead at the gleaming road again al steered with one hand and put the other on the vibrating gearshift lever he had difficulty in speaking his mouth formed the words silently before he said them aloud ma she looked slowly around at him her head swaying a little with the cars motion ma you scared a goin you scared a goin to a new place her eyes

and ma held her so granma would not fall when she squatted on top of the truck the others stirred to life their faces were shining with sunburn they could not escape tom and casy and noah and uncle john let themselves wearily down ruthie and winfield swarmed down the sideboards and went off into the bushes connie helped rose of sharon gently down under the canvas grampa was awake his head sticking out but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless he watched the others but there was little recognition in his watching tom called to him want to come down grampa the old eyes turned listlessly to him no said grampa for a moment the fierceness came into his eyes i aint agoin i tell you gonna stay like muley and then he lost interest again ma came back helping granma up the bank to the highway tom she said get that pan a bones under the canvas in back we got to eat somepin tom got the pan and passed it around and the family stood by the roadside gnawing the crisp

a little panic started al felt the fear growing well get water first service station we come to we need some gas too the family swarmed up the truck sides ma helped granma in and got in beside her al started the motor and they moved on castle to paden twentyfive miles and the sun passed the zenith and started down and the radiator cap began to jiggle up and down and steam started to whish out near paden there was a shack beside the road and two gas pumps in front of it and beside a fence a water faucet and a hose al drove in and nosed the hudson up to the hose as they pulled in a stout man red of face and arms got up from a chair behind the gas pumps and moved toward them he wore brown corduroys and suspenders and a polo shirt and he had a cardboard sun helmet painted silver on his head the sweat beaded on his nose and under his eyes and formed streams in the wrinkles of his neck he strolled toward the truck looking truculent and stern you folks aim to buy anything gasoline or stuff he asked al was out already unscrewing the steaming radiator cap with the tips of his fingers jerking his hand away to escape the spurt when the cap should come loose need some gas mister got any money

radiator cap and it jumped into the air with a head of steam behind it and a hollow bubbling sound came out of the radiator on top of the truck the suffering hound dog crawled timidly to the edge of the load and looked over whimpering toward the water uncle john climbed up and lifted him down by the scruff of the neck for a moment the dog staggered on stiff legs and then he went to lap the mud under the faucet in the highway the cars whizzed by glistening in the heat and the hot wind of their going fanned into the servicestation yard al filled the radiator with the hose it aint that im tryin to git trade outa rich folks the fat man went on im jus tryin to git trade why the folks that stops here begs gasoline an they trades for gasoline i could show you in my back room the stuff

with his palm and tom took off his cap and wiped his forehead with it he went to the hose and wet the cap through and squeezed it and put it on again ma worked a tin cup out through the side bars of the truck and she took water to granma and to grampa on top of the load she stood on the bars and handed the cup to grampa and he wet his lips and then shook his head and refused more the old eyes looked up at ma in pain and bewilderment for a moment before the awareness receded again al started the motor and backed the truck to the gas pump fill her up shell take about seven said al well give her six so she dont spill none the fat man put the hose in the tank no sir he said i jus dont know what the countrys comin to relief an all casy said i been walkin aroun in the country everbodys askin

many fellas like you you dont want to know nothin just sing yourself to sleep with a songwhat we comin to he looked at the gas pump rusted and old and at the shack behind it built of old lumber the nail holes of its first use still showing through the paint that had been brave the brave yellow paint that had tried to imitate the big company stations in town but the paint couldnt cover the old nail holes and the old cracks in the lumber and the paint could not be renewed the imitation was a failure and the owner had known it was a failure and inside the open door of the shack tom saw the oil barrels only two of them and the candy counter with stale candies and licorice whips turning brown with age and cigarettes he saw the broken chair and the fly screen with a rusted hole in it and the littered yard that should have been graveled and behind the corn field drying and dying in the sun beside the house the little stock of used tires and retreaded tires and he saw for the first time the fat mans cheap washed pants and his cheap polo shirt and his paper hat he said i didn mean to sound off at ya mister its the heat you aint got nothin pretty soon youll be on the road yoursef and it aint tractorsll put you there its them pretty yella stations in town folks is movin he said ashamedly an youll be movin mister the fat mans hand slowed on the pump and stopped while tom spoke he looked worriedly at tom howd you know he asked helplessly howd you know we was already talkin about packin up an movin west casy answered him its everbody he said heres me that used to give all my fight against the devil cause i figgered the devil was the enemy but theys somepin worsen the devil got hold a the country an it aint gonna let go till its chopped loose ever see one a them gila

layin there poison is drippin an drippin into the hole hes made with his teeth he stopped and looked sideways at tom the fat man stared hopelessly straight ahead his hand started turning the crank slowly i dunno what were comin to he said softly over by the water hose connie and rose of sharon stood together talking secretly connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup again rose of sharon watched the cars go by on the highway connie held out the cup to her this water aint cool but its wet he said she looked at him and smiled secretly she was all secrets now she was pregnant secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings she was pleased with herself and she complained about things that didnt really matter and she demanded services of connie that were silly and both of them knew they were silly connie was pleased with her too and filled with wonder that she was pregnant he liked to think he was in on the secrets she had when she smiled slyly he smiled slyly too and they exchanged confidences in whispers the world had drawn close around them and they were in the center of it or rather rose of sharon was in the center of it with connie making a small orbit about her everything they said was a kind of secret she drew her eyes from the highway i aint very thirsty she said daintily but maybe i ought to drink and he nodded for he knew well what she meant she took the cup and rinsed her mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water want another he asked jus a half and so he filled the cup just half and gave it to her a lincoln zephyr silvery and low whisked by she turned to see where the others were and saw them clustered about the truck reassured she said howd you like to be goin along in that connie sighed maybeafter they both knew what he meant an if theys plenty work in california well git our own car but themhe indicated the disappearing zephyrthem kind costs as much as a good size house i ruther have the house i like to have the house an one a them she said but course the house would be first because and they both knew what she meant they were terribly excited about the pregnancy you feel awright he asked tard jus tard ridin in the sun we got to do that or we wont never get to california i know she said the dog wandered sniffing past the truck trotted to the puddle under the hose again and lapped at the muddy water and then he moved away nose down and ears hanging he sniffed his way among the dusty weeds beside the road to the edge of the pavement he raised his head and looked across and then started over rose of sharon screamed shrilly a big swift car whisked near tires squealed the dog dodged helplessly and with a shriek cut off in the middle went under the wheels the big car slowed for a moment and faces looked back and then it gathered greater speed and disappeared and the dog a blot of blood and tangled burst intestines kicked slowly in the road rose of sharons eyes were wide dyou think itll hurt she begged think itll hurt connie put his arm around her come set down he said it wasnt nothin but i felt it hurt i felt it kinda jar when i yelled come set down it wasnt nothin it wont hurt he led her to the side of the truck away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board tom and uncle john walked out to the mess the last quiver was going out of the crushed body tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road uncle john looked embarrassed as though it were his fault i ought ta tied him up he said pa looked down at the dog for a moment and then he turned away les get outa here he said i don know how we was gonna feed im anyways just as well maybe the fat man came from behind the truck im sorry folks he said a dog jus don last no time near a highway i had three dogs run over in a year dont keep none no more and he said dont you folks worry none about it ill take care of im bury im out in the corn field ma walked over to

hell take care a hisself where is granma rose of sharon asked i dunno shes aroun here somewheres maybe in the outhouse the girl went toward the toilet and in a moment she came out helping granma along

a good nap if i wasnt woke up it aint a nice place to sleep said rose of sharon and she helped granma into the car granma settled herself happily maybe it aint nice for purty but its nice for nice she said tom said les go we got to make miles pa whistled shrilly now whered them kids go he whistled again putting his fingers in his mouth in a moment they broke from the corn field ruthie ahead and winfield trailing her eggs ruthie cried look a dozen soft grayishwhite eggs were in her grubby hand and as she held up her hand her eyes fell upon the dead dog beside the road oh she said ruthie and winfield walked slowly toward the dog they inspected him pa called to them come on you less you want to git left they turned solemnly and walked to the truck ruthie looked once more at the gray reptile eggs in her hand and then she threw them away they climbed up the side of the truck his eyes was still open said ruthie in a hushed tone but winfield gloried in the scene he said boldly his guts was just strowed all overall overhe was silent for a momentstrowedallover he said and then he rolled over quickly and vomited down the side of the truck when he sat up again his eyes were watery and his nose running it aint like killin pigs he said in explanation al had the hood of the hudson up and he checked the oil level he brought a gallon can from the floor of the front seat and poured a quantity of cheap black oil into the pipe and checked the level again tom came beside him want i should take her a piece he asked i aint tired said al well you didnt get no sleep las night i took a snooze this morning get up there on top ill take her awright al said reluctantly but watch the oil gauge pretty close take her slow an i been watchin for a short take a look a the needle now an then f she jumps to discharge its a short an take her slow tom shes overloaded tom laughed ill watch her he said you can res easy the family piled on top of the truck again ma settled herself beside granma in the seat and tom took his place and started the motor sure is loose he said and he put it in gear and pulled away down the highway the motor droned along steadily and the sun receded down the sky in front of them granma slept steadily and even ma dropped her head forward and dozed tom pulled his cap over his eyes to shut out the blinding sun paden to meeker is thirteen miles meeker to harrah is fourteen miles and then oklahoma citythe big city tom drove straight on ma waked up and looked at the streets as they went through the city and the family on top of the truck stared about at the stores at the big houses at the office buildings and then the buildings grew smaller and the stores smaller the wrecking yards and hotdog stands the outcity dance halls ruthie and winfield saw it all and it embarrassed them with its bigness and its strangeness and it frightened them with the fineclothed people they saw they did not speak of it to each other laterthey would but not now they saw the oil derricks in the town on the edge of the town oil derricks black and the smell of oil and gas in the air but they didnt exclaim it was so big and so strange it frightened them in the street rose of sharon saw a man in a light suit he wore white shoes and a flat straw hat she touched connie and indicated the man with her eyes and then connie and rose of sharon giggled softly to themselves and the giggles got the best of them they covered their mouths and it felt so good that they looked for other people to giggle at ruthie and winfield saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they tried to do it toobut they couldnt the giggles wouldnt come but connie and rose of sharon were breathless and red with stifling laughter before they could stop it got so bad that they had only to look at each other to start over again the outskirts were wide spread tom drove slowly and carefully in the traffic and then they were on the great western road and the sun was sinking on the line of the road the windshield was bright with dust tom pulled his cap lower over his eyes so low that he had to tilt his head back to see out at all granma slept on the sun on her closed eyelids and the veins on her temples were blue and the little bright veins on her cheeks were winecolored and the old brown marks on her face turned darker tom said we stay on this road right straight through ma had been silent for a long time maybe we better fin a place to stop fore sunset she said i got to get some pork aboilin an some bread made that takes time sure tom agreed we aint gonna make this trip in one jump mights well stretch ourselves oklahoma city to bethany is fourteen miles tom said i think we better stop fore the sun goes down al got to build that thing on the top sunll kill the folks up there ma

said we better look out for a place to stop they went through bethany and out on the other side in a ditch where a culvert went under the road an old touring car was pulled off the highway and a little tent was pitched beside it and smoke came out of a stove pipe through the tent tom pointed ahead theres some folks campin looks like as good a place as we seen he slowed his motor and pulled to a stop beside the road the hood of the old touring car was up and a middleaged man stood looking down at the motor he wore a cheap straw sombrero a blue shirt and a black spotted vest and his jeans were stiff and shiny with dirt his face was lean the deep cheeklines great furrows down his face so that his cheek bones and chin stood out sharply he looked up at the joad truck and his eyes were puzzled and angry tom leaned out of the window any law gainst folks stoppin here for the night the man had seen only the truck his eyes focused down on tom i dunno he said we ony stopped here cause we couldnt git no further any water here the man pointed to a servicestation shack about a quarter of a mile ahead theys water there theyll let ya take a bucket of tom hesitated well ya spose we could camp down longside the lean man looked puzzled we dont own it he said we ony stopped here cause this goddamn ol trap wouldn go no further tom insisted anyways youre here an we aint you got a right to say if you wan neighbors or not the appeal to hospitality had an instant effect the lean face broke into a smile why sure come on off the road proud to have ya and he called sairy theres some folks goin ta stay with us come on out an say how dya do sairy aint well he added the tent flaps opened and a wizened woman came outa face wrinkled as a dried leaf and eyes that seemed to flame in her face black eyes that seemed to look out of a well of horror she was small and shuddering she held herself upright by a tent flap and the hand holding onto the canvas was a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin when she spoke her voice had a beautiful low timbre soft and modulated and yet with ringing overtones tell em welcome she said tell em good an welcome tom drove off the road and brought his truck into the field and lined it up with the touring car and people boiled down from the truck ruthie and winfield too quickly so that their legs gave way and they shrieked at the pins and needles that ran through their limbs ma went quickly to work she untied the threegallon bucket from the back of the truck and approached the squealing children now you go git waterright down there ask nice say please kin we git a bucket a water and say thank you an carry it back together helpin an dont spill none an if you see stick wood to burn bring it on the children stamped away toward the shack by the tent a little embarrassment had set in and social intercourse had paused before it started pa said you aint oklahomy folks and al who stood near the car looked at the license plates kansas he said the lean man said galena or right about there wilson ivy wilson were joads said pa we come from right near sallisaw well were proud to meet you folks said ivy wilson sairy these is joads i knowed you wasnt

massachusetts an she said em differentest of all couldn hardly make out what she was sayin noah and uncle john and the preacher began to unload the truck they helped grampa down and sat him on the ground and he sat limply staring ahead of him you sick grampa noah asked you goddamn right said grampa weakly sickern hell sairy wilson walked slowly and carefully toward him howd you like ta come in our tent she asked you kin lay down on our mattress an rest he looked up at her drawn by her soft voice come on now she said youll git some rest well hep you over without warning grampa began to cry his chin wavered and his old lips tightened over his mouth and he sobbed hoarsely ma rushed over to him and put her arms around him she lifted him to his feet her broad back straining and she half lifted half helped him into the tent uncle john said he must be good an sick he aint never done that before never seen him blubberin in my life he jumped up on the truck and tossed a mattress down ma came out of the tent and went to casy you been aroun sick people she said grampas sick wont you go take a look at him casy walked quickly to the tent and went inside a double mattress was on the ground the blankets spread neatly and a little tin stove stood on iron legs and the fire in it burned unevenly a bucket of water a wooden box of supplies and a box for a table that was all the light of the setting sun came pinkly through the tent walls sairy wilson knelt on the ground beside the mattress and grampa lay on his back his eyes were open staring upward and his cheeks were flushed he breathed heavily casy took the skinny old wrist in his fingers feeling kinda tired grampa he asked the staring eyes moved toward his voice but did not find him the lips practiced a speech but did not speak it casy felt the pulse and he dropped the wrist and put his hand on grampas forehead a struggle began in the old mans body his legs moved restlessly and his hands stirred he said a whole string of blurred sounds that were not words and his face was red under the spiky white whiskers sairy wilson spoke softly to casy know whats wrong he looked up at the wrinkled face and the burning eyes do you ithink so what casy asked might be wrong i wouldn like to say casy looked back at the twitching red face would you saymaybe hes workin up a stroke id say that said sairy i seen it three times before from outside came the sounds of campmaking wood chopping and the rattle of pans ma looked through the flaps granma wants to come in would she better the preacher said shell just fret if she dont think hes awright ma asked casy shook his head slowly ma looked quickly down at the struggling old face with blood pounding through it she drew outside and her voice came through hes awright granma hes jus takin a little res and granma answered sulkily well i want ta see him hes a tricky devil he wouldnt never let ya know and she came scurrying through the flaps she stood over the mattresses and looked down whats the matterth you she demanded of grampa and again his eyes reached toward her voice and his lips writhed hes sulkin said granma i tol you he was tricky he was gonna sneak away this mornin so he wouldnt have to come an then his hip got ahurtin she said disgustedly hes jus sulkin i seen him when he wouldnt talk to nobody before casy said gently he aint sulkin granma hes sick oh she looked down at the old man again sick bad you think purty bad granma for a moment she hesitated uncertainly well she said quickly why aint you prayin youre a preacher aint you casys strong fingers blundered over to grampas wrist and clasped around it i tol you granma i aint a preacher no more pray anyway she ordered you know all the stuff by heart i cant said casy i dont know what to pray for or who to pray to granmas eyes wandered away and came to rest on sairy he wont pray she said di ever tell ya how ruthie prayed when she was a little skinner says now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep an when she got there the cupboard was bare an so the poor dog got none amen thats jus what she done the shadow of someone walking between the tent and the sun crossed the canvas grampa seemed to be struggling all his muscles twitched and suddenly he jarred as though under a heavy blow he lay still and his breath was stopped casy looked down at the old mans face and saw that it was turning a blackish purple sairy touched casys shoulder she whispered his tongue his tongue his tongue casy nodded get in front a granma he pried the tight jaws apart and reached into the old mans throat for the tongue and as he lifted it clear a rattling breath came out and a sobbing breath was indrawn casy found a stick on the ground and held down the tongue with it and the uneven breath rattled in and out granma hopped about like a chicken pray she said pray you pray i tell ya sairy tried to hold her back pray goddamn you granma cried casy looked up at her for a moment the rasping breath came louder and more unevenly our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name glory shouted granma thy kingdom come thy will be doneon earthas it is in heaven amen a long gasping sigh came from the open mouth and then a crying release of air give us this dayour daily breadand forgive us the breathing had stopped casy looked down into grampas eyes and they were clear and deep and penetrating and there was a knowing serene look in them hallelujah said granma go on amen said casy granma was still then and outside the tent all the noise had stopped a car whished by on the highway casy still knelt on the floor beside the mattress the people outside were listening standing quietly intent on the sounds of dying sairy took granma by the arm and led her outside and granma moved with dignity and held her head high she walked for the family and held her head straight for the family sairy took her to a mattress lying on the ground and sat her down on it and granma looked straight ahead proudly for she was on show now the tent was still and at last casy spread the tent flaps with his hands and stepped out pa asked softly what was it stroke said casy a good quick stroke life began to move again the sun touched the horizon and flattened over it and along the highway there came a long line of huge freight trucks with red sides they rumbled along putting a little earthquake in the ground and the standing exhaust pipes sputtered blue smoke from the diesel oil one man drove each truck and his relief man slept in a bunk high up against the ceiling but the trucks never stopped they thundered day and night and the ground shook under their heavy march the family became a unit pa squatted down on the ground and uncle john beside him pa was the head of the family now ma stood behind him noah and tom and al squatted and the preacher sat down and then reclined on his elbow connie and rose of sharon walked at a distance now ruthie and winfield clattering up with a bucket of water held between them felt the change and they slowed up and set down the bucket and moved quietly to stand with ma granma sat proudly coldly until the group was formed until no one looked at her and then she lay down and covered her face with her arm the red sun set and left a shining twilight on the land so that faces were bright in the evening and eyes shone in reflection of the sky the evening picked up light where it could pa said it was in mr wilsons tent uncle john nodded he loaned his tent fine friendly folks pa said softly wilson stood by his broken car and sairy had gone to the mattress to sit beside granma but sairy was careful not to touch her pa called mr wilson the man scuffed near and squatted down and sairy came and stood beside him pa said were thankful to you folks were proud to help said wilson were beholden to you said pa theres no beholden in a time of dying said wilson and sairy echoed him never no beholden al said ill fix your carme an tom will and al looked proud that he could return the familys obligation we could use some help wilson admitted the retiring of the obligation pa said we got to figger what to do theys

said softly grampa buried his pa with his own hand done it in dignity an shaped the grave nice with his own shovel that was a time when a man had the right to be buried by his own son an a son had the right to bury his own father the law says different now said uncle john sometimes the law cant be follerd no way said pa not in decency anyways theys lots a times you cant when floyd was loose an goin

from her own apron and tied up his jaw she straightened his limbs folded his hands over his chest she held his eyelids down and laid a silver piece on each one she buttoned his shirt and washed his

women moved back to the fire to see to supper ruthie and winfield watched absorbed ruthie said solemnly grampas down under there and winfield looked at her with horrified eyes and then he ran away to

lapels the insignia of lodges and service clubs places where they can go and by a weight of numbers of little worried men reassure themselves that business is noble and not the curious ritualized thievery they know it is that business men are intelligent in spite of the records of their stupidity that they are kind and charitable in spite of the principles of sound business that their lives are rich instead of the thin tiresome routines they know and that a time is coming when they will not be afraid any more and these two going to california going to sit in the lobby of the

window better tie your stuff down i think you got some of em comin now a nash sedan pulled wearily off the highway the back seat was piled nearly to the ceiling with sacks with pots and pans and on the very top right up against the ceiling two boys rode on the top of the car a mattress and a folded tent tent poles tied along the running board the car pulled up to the gas pumps a darkhaired hatchetfaced man got slowly out and the two boys slid down from the load and hit the ground mae walked around the counter and stood in the door the man was dressed in gray wool trousers and a blue shirt dark blue with sweat on the back and under the arms the boys in overalls and nothing else ragged patched overalls their hair was light and it stood up evenly all over their heads for it had been roached their faces were streaked with dust they went directly to the mud puddle under the hose and dug their toes into the mud the man asked can we git some water maam a look of annoyance crossed maes face sure go ahead she said softly over her shoulder ill keep my eye on the hose she watched while the man slowly unscrewed the radiator cap and ran the hose in a woman in the car a flaxenhaired woman said see if you cant git it here the man turned off the hose and screwed on the cap again the little boys took the hose from him and they upended it and drank thirstily the man took off his dark stained hat and stood with a curious humility in front of the screen could you see your way to sell us a loaf of bread maam mae said this aint a grocery store we got bread to make sanwidges i know

sullenly down at the potato salad he was mixing mae shrugged her plump shoulders and looked to the truck drivers to show them what she was up against she held the screen door open and the man came in bringing a smell of sweat with him the boys edged in behind him and they went immediately to the candy case and stared innot with craving or with hope or even with desire but just with a kind of wonder that such things could be they were alike in size and their faces were alike one scratched his dusty ankle with the toe nails of his other foot the other whispered some soft message and then they straightened their arms so that their clenched fists in the overall pockets showed through the thin blue cloth mae opened a drawer and took out a long waxpaperwrapped loaf this here is a fifteencent loaf the man put his hat back on his head he answered with inflexible humility wont youcant you see your way to cut off ten cents worth al said snarlingly goddamn it mae give em the loaf

with greasy bills may soun funny to be so tight he apologized we got a thousan miles to go an we dont know if well make it he dug in the pouch with a forefinger located a dime and pinched in for it when he put it down on the counter he had a penny with it he was about to drop the penny back into the pouch when his eye fell on the boys frozen before the candy counter he moved slowly down to them he pointed in the case at big long sticks of striped peppermint is them penny candy maam mae moved down and looked in which ones there them stripy ones the little boys raised their eyes to her face and they stopped breathing their mouths were partly opened their halfnaked bodies were rigid ohthem well nothems two for a penny well gimme two then maam he placed the copper cent carefully on the counter the boys expelled their held breath softly mae held the big sticks out take em said the man they reached timidly each took a stick and they held them down at their sides and did not look at them but they looked at each other and their mouth corners smiled rigidly with embarrassment thank you maam the man picked up the bread and went out the door and the little boys marched stiffly behind him the redstriped sticks held tightly against their legs they leaped like chipmunks over the front seat and onto the top of the load and they burrowed back out of sight like chipmunks the man got in and started his car and with a roaring motor and a cloud of blue oily smoke the ancient nash climbed up on the highway and went on its way to the west from inside the restaurant the truck drivers and mae and al stared after them big bill wheeled back them wasnt twoforacent candy he said whats that to you mae said fiercely them was nickel apiece candy said bill we got to get goin said the other man were droppin time they reached in their pockets bill put a coin on the counter and the other man looked at it and reached again and put down a coin they swung around and walked to the door so long said bill mae called hey wait a minute you got change you go to hell said bill and the screen door slammed mae watched them get into the great truck watched it lumber off in low gear and heard the shift up the whining gears to cruising ratio al she said softly he looked up from the hamburger he was patting thin and stacking between waxed papers what ya want look there she pointed at the coins beside the cupstwo halfdollars al walked near and looked and then he went back to work truck drivers mae said reverently an after them shitheels flies struck the screen with little bumps and droned away the compressor chugged for a time and then stopped on the traffic whizzed by trucks and fine streamlined cars and jalopies and they went by with a vicious whiz mae took down the plates and scraped the pie crusts into a bucket she found her damp cloth and wiped the counter with circular sweeps and her eyes were on the highway where life whizzed by al wiped his hands on his apron he looked at a paper pinned to the wall over the griddle three lines of marks in columns on the paper al counted the longest line he walked along the counter to the cash register rang no sale and took out a handful of nickels what ya doin mae asked number threes ready to pay off said al he went on the third slot machine and played his nickels in and on the fifth spin of the wheels the three bars came up and the jackpot dumped out into the cup al gathered up the big handful of coins and went back of the counter he dropped them in the drawer and slammed the cash register then he went back to his place and crossed out the line of dots number three gets more playn the others he said maybe i ought to shift em around he lifted a lid and stirred the slowly simmering stew i wonder what theyll do in california said mae who them folks that was just in christ knows said al spose theyll get work how the hell would i know said al she stared eastward along the highway here comes a transport double wonder if they stop hope they do and as the huge truck came heavily down from the highway and parked mae seized her cloth and wiped the whole length of the counter and she took a few swipes at the gleaming coffee urn too and turned up the bottlegas under the urn al brought out a handful of little turnips and started to peel them maes face was gay when the door opened and the two uniformed truck drivers entered hi sister i wont be a sister to no man said mae they laughed and mae laughed whatll it be boys oh a cup a java what kinda pie ya got pineapple cream an banana cream an chocolate cream an apple give me apple no waitwhats that big thick one mae picked up the pie and smelled it pineapple cream she said well chop out a hunk a that the cars whizzed viciously by on chapter joads and wilsons crawled westward as a unit el reno and bridgeport clinton elk city sayre and texola theres the border and oklahoma was behind and this day the cars crawled on and on through the panhandle of texas shamrock and alanreed groom and yarnell they went through amarillo in the evening drove too long and camped when it was dusk they were tired and dusty and hot granma had convulsions from the heat and she was weak when they stopped that night al stole a fence rail and made a ridge pole on the truck braced at both ends that night they ate nothing but pan biscuits cold and hard held over from breakfast they flopped down on the mattresses and slept in their clothes the wilsons didnt even put up their tent joads and wilsons were in flight across the panhandle the rolling gray country lined and cut with old flood scars they were in flight out of oklahoma and across texas the land turtles crawled through the dust and the sun whipped the earth and in the evening the heat went out of the sky and the earth sent up a wave of heat from itself two days the families were in flight but on the third the land was too huge for them and they settled into a new technique of living the highway became their home and movement their medium of expression little by little they settled into the new life ruthie and winfield first then al then connie and rose of sharon and last the older ones the land rolled like great stationary ground swells wildorado and vega and boise and glenrio thats the end of texas new mexico and the mountains in the far distance waved up against the sky the mountains stood and the wheels of the cars creaked around and the engines were hot and the steam spurted around the radiator caps they crawled to the pecos river and crossed at santa rosa and they went on for twenty miles al joad drove the touring car and his mother sat beside him and rose of sharon beside her ahead the truck crawled the hot air folded in waves over the land and the mountains shivered in the heat al drove listlessly hunched back in the seat his hand hooked easily over the crossbar of the steering wheel his gray hat peaked and pulled to an incredibly cocky shape was low over one eye and as he drove he turned and spat out the side now and then ma beside him had folded her hands in her lap had retired into a resistance against weariness she sat loosely letting the movement of the car sway her body and her head she squinted her eyes ahead at the mountains rose of sharon was braced against the movement of the car her feet pushed tight against the floor and her right elbow hooked over the door and her plump face was tight against the movement and her head jiggled sharply because her neck muscles were tight she tried to arch her whole body as a rigid container to preserve her fetus from shock she turned her head toward her mother ma she said mas eyes lighted up and she drew her attention toward rose of sharon her eyes went over the tight tired plump face and she smiled ma the girl said when we get there all you gonna pick fruit an kinda live in the country aint you ma smiled a little satirically we aint there yet she said we dont know what its like we got to see me an connie dont want to live in the country no more the girl said we got it all planned up what we gonna do for a moment a little worry came on mas face aint you gonna stay

thinks hes the ony sonofabitch can study at night ma suddenly seemed to know it was all a dream she turned her head forward again and her body relaxed but the little smile stayed around her eyes i wonder how granma feels today she said al grew tense over the wheel a little rattle had developed in the engine he speeded up and the rattle increased he retarded his spark and listened and then he speeded up for a moment and listened the rattle increased to a metallic pounding al blew his horn and pulled the car to the side of the road ahead the truck pulled up and then backed slowly three cars raced by westward and each one blew its horn and the last driver leaned out and yelled where the hell ya think youre stoppin tom backed the truck close and then he got out and walked to the touring car from the back of the loaded truck heads looked down al retarded his spark and listened to his idling motor tom asked whats a matter al al speeded the motor listen to her the rattling pound was

billboard stood beside the road ahead and it threw a great oblong shadow tom edged the truck off the road and across the shallow roadside ditch and he pulled up in the shadow he got out and waited

the bucket was half full tom his face already smudged with oil looked out between the wheels get back fast he called and he was loosening the pan bolts as the truck moved gently across the shallow ditch and crawled away tom turned each bolt a single turn loosening them evenly to spare the gasket the preacher knelt beside the wheels what can i do nothin not right now soons the oils out an i get

the wire was twisted he hammered it flat and then he turned the piston and tapped the wire all around until it cleared the piston wall he ran his finger up and down to make sure that the rings and wire were flush with the wall it was getting dark in the shed the oneeyed man brought a flashlight and shone its beam on the work there she is said tom saywhatll ya take for that light well it aint

working hands as they patted the gasket gently in place and lined the holes with the pan bolts the two men strained at the weight of the pan caught the end bolts and then set in the others and when they were all engaged tom took them up little by little until the pan settled evenly in against the gasket and he tightened hard against the nuts i guess thats her tom said he tightened the oil tap looked carefully up at the pan and took the light and searched the ground there she is les get the oil back in her they crawled out and poured the bucket of oil back in the crank case tom inspected the gasket for leaks ok al turn her over he said al got into the car and stepped on the starter the motor caught with a roar blue smoke poured from the exhaust pipe throttle down tom shouted shell

crawling in low gear tom said these here dodges can pull a house in low gear shes sure ratiod down good thing for usi wanta break that bearin in easy on the highway the dodge moved along slowly the volt headlights threw a short blob of yellowish light on the pavement casy turned to tom funny how you fellas can fix a car jus light right in an fix her i couldnt fix no car not even now when i seen you do it got to grow into her when youre a little kid tom said it aint jus knowin its moren that kids now can tear down a car thout even thinkin about it a jackrabbit got caught in the lights and he bounced along ahead cruising easily his great ears flopping with every jump now and then he tried to break off the road but the wall of darkness thrust him back far ahead bright headlights appeared and bore down on them the rabbit hesitated faltered then turned and bolted toward the lesser lights of the dodge there was a small soft jolt as he went under the wheels the oncoming car swished by we sure squashed him said casy tom said some fellas like to hit em gives me a little shakes ever time car sounds ok them rings must a broke loose by now she aint smokin so bad you done a nice job said casy a small wooden house dominated the camp ground and on the porch of the house a gasoline lantern hissed and threw its white glare in a great circle half a dozen tents were pitched near the house and cars stood beside the tents cooking for the night was over but the coals of the campfires still glowed on the ground by the camping places a group of men had gathered to the porch where the lantern burned and their faces were strong and muscled under the harsh white light light that threw black shadows of their hats over their foreheads and eyes and made their chins seem to jut out they sat on the steps and some stood on the ground resting their elbows on the porch floor the proprietor a sullen lanky man sat in a chair on the porch he leaned back against the wall and he drummed his fingers on his knee inside the house a kerosene lamp burned but its thin light was blasted by the hissing glare of the gasoline lantern the gathering of men surrounded the proprietor tom drove the dodge to the side of the road and parked al drove through the gate in the truck no need to take her in tom said he got out and walked through the gate to the white glare of the lantern the proprietor dropped his front chair legs to the floor and leaned forward you men wanta camp here no said tom we got folks here hi pa pa seated on the bottom step said thought you was gonna be all week get her

asked ya for nothin all of us bums huh well we aint askin no nickels from you for the chance to lay down an rest the men on the porch were rigid motionless quiet expression was gone from their faces and their eyes in the shadows under their hats moved secretly up to the face of the proprietor pa growled come off it tom sure ill come off it the circle of men were quiet sitting on the steps leaning on the high porch their eyes glittered under the harsh light of the gas lantern their faces were hard in the hard light and they were very still only their eyes moved from speaker to speaker and their faces were expressionless and quiet a lamp bug slammed into the lantern and broke itself and fell into the darkness in one of the tents a child wailed in complaint and a womans soft voice soothed it and then broke into a low song jesus loves you in the night sleep good sleep good jesus watches in the night sleep oh sleep oh the lantern hissed on the porch the owner scratched in the v of his open shirt where a tangle of white chest hair showed he was watchful and ringed with trouble he watched the men in the circle watched for some expression and they made no move tom was silent for a long time his dark eyes looked slowly up at the proprietor i dont wanta make no trouble he said its a hard thing to be named a bum i aint afraid he said softly ill go for you an your deputy with my mittshere now or jump jesus but there aint no good in it the men stirred changed positions and their glittering eyes moved slowly upward to the mouth of the proprietor and their eyes watched for his lips to move he was reassured he felt that he had won but not decisively enough to charge in aint you got half a buck he asked yeah i got it but im gonna need it i cant set it out jus for sleepin well

the ragged man said slowly meim comin back i been there the faces turned quickly toward him the men were rigid the hiss of the lantern dropped to a sigh and the proprietor lowered the front chair legs

then the coroner come them children died a heart failure he said put it on his paper shiverin they was an their bellies stuck out like a pig bladder the circle was quiet and mouths were open a little the men breathed shallowly and watched the ragged man looked around at the circle and then he turned and walked quickly away into the darkness the dark swallowed him but his dragging footsteps could be heard a long time after he had gone footsteps along the road and a car came by on the highway and its lights showed the ragged man shuffling along the road his head hanging down and his hands in the black coat pockets the men were uneasy one said wellgettin late got to get to sleep the proprietor said probly shifless theys so goddamn many shifless fellas on the road now and then he was quiet and he tipped his chair back against the wall again and fingered his throat tom said guess ill go see ma for a minute an then well shove along a piece the joad men moved away pa said spose hes tellin

said politely as they went by the woman smiled they aint done or youd be welcome she said come aroun in the daybreak thank you maam tom said he and casy and uncle john walked by the porch the proprietor still sat in his chair and the lantern hissed and flared he turned his head as the three went by ya runnin outa gas tom said well time to close up anyways no more halfbucks rollin down the road i guess tom said the chair legs hit the floor dont you go asassin me i member you youre one of these here troublemakers damn right said tom im bolshevisky theys too damn many of you kinda guys aroun tom laughed as they went out the gate and climbed into the dodge he picked up a clod and threw it at the light they heard it hit the house and saw the proprietor spring to his feet and peer into the darkness tom started the car and pulled into the road and he listened closely to the motor as it turned over listened for knocks the road spread dimly under the weak lights of the car chapter the cars of the migrant people crawled out of the side roads onto the great crosscountry highway and they took the migrant way to the west in the daylight they scuttled like bugs to the westward and as the dark caught them they clustered like bugs near to shelter and to water and because they were lonely and perplexed because they had all come from a place of sadness and worry and defeat and because they were all going to a new mysterious place they huddled together they talked together they shared their lives their food and the things they hoped for in the new country thus it might be that one family camped near a spring and another camped for the spring and for company and a third because two families had pioneered the place and found it good and when the sun went down perhaps twenty families and twenty cars were there in the evening a strange thing happened the twenty families became one family the children were the children of all the loss of home became one loss and the golden time in the west was one dream and it might be that a sick child threw despair into the hearts of twenty families of a hundred people that a birth there in a tent kept a hundred people quiet and awestruck through the night and filled a hundred people with the birthjoy in the morning a family which the night before had been lost and fearful might search its goods to find a present for a new baby in the evening sitting about the fires the twenty were one they grew to be units of the camps units of the evenings and the nights a guitar unwrapped from a blanket and tunedand the songs which were all of the people were sung in the nights men sang the words and women hummed the tunes every night a world created complete with furniturefriends made and enemies established a world complete with braggarts and with cowards with quiet men with humble men with kindly men every night relationships that make a world established and every morning the world torn down like a circus at first the families were timid in the building and tumbling worlds but gradually the technique of building worlds became their technique then leaders emerged then laws were made then codes came into being and as the worlds moved westward they were more complete and better furnished for their builders were more experienced in building them the families learned what rights must be observedthe right of privacy in the tent the right to keep the past black hidden in the heart the right to talk and to listen the right to refuse help or to accept to offer help or to decline it the right of son to court and daughter to be courted the right of the hungry to be fed the rights of the pregnant and the sick to transcend all other rights and the families learned although no one told them what rights are monstrous and must be destroyed the right to intrude upon privacy the right to be noisy while the camp slept the right of seduction or rape the right of adultery and theft and murder these rights were crushed because the little worlds could not exist for even a night with such rights alive and as the worlds moved westward rules became laws although no one told the families it is unlawful to foul near the camp it is unlawful in any way to foul the drinking water it is unlawful to eat good rich food near one who is hungry unless he is asked to share and with the laws the punishmentsand there were only twoa quick and murderous fight or ostracism and ostracism was the worst for if one broke the laws his name and face went with him and he had no place in any world no matter where created in the worlds social conduct became fixed and rigid so that a man must say good morning when asked for it so that a man might have a willing girl if he stayed with her if he fathered her children and protected them but a man might not have one girl one night and another the next for this would endanger the worlds the families moved westward and the technique of building the worlds improved so that the people could be safe in their worlds and the form was so fixed that a family acting in the rules knew it was safe in the rules there grew up government in the worlds with leaders with elders a man who was wise found that his wisdom was needed in every camp a man who was a fool could not change his folly with his world and a kind of insurance developed in these nights a man with food fed a hungry man and thus insured himself against hunger and when a baby died a pile of silver coins grew at the door flap for a baby must be well buried since it has had nothing else of life an old man may be left in a potters field but not a baby a certain physical pattern is needed for the building of a world water a river bank a stream a spring or even a faucet unguarded and there is needed enough flat land to pitch the tents a little brush or wood to build the fires if there is a garbage dump not too far off all the better for there can be found equipmentstove tops a curved fender to shelter the fire and cans to cook in and to eat from and the worlds were built in the evening the people moving in from the highways made them with their tents and their hearts and their brains in the morning the tents came down the canvas was folded the tent poles tied along the running board the beds put in place on the cars the pots in their places and as the families moved westward the technique of building up a home in the evening and tearing it down with the morning light became fixed so that the folded tent was packed in one place the cooking pots counted in their box and as the cars moved westward each member of the family grew into his proper place grew into his duties so that each member old and young had his place in the car so that in the weary hot evenings when the cars pulled into the camping places each member had his duty and went to it without instruction children to gather wood to carry water men to pitch the tents and bring down the beds women to cook the supper and to watch while the family fed and this was done without command the families which had been units of which the boundaries were a house at night a farm by day changed their boundaries in the long hot light they were silent in the cars moving slowly westward but at night they integrated with any group they found thus they changed their social lifechanged as in the whole universe only man can change they were not farm men any more but migrant men and the thought the planning the long staring silence that had gone out to the fields went now to the roads to the distance to the west that man whose mind had been bound with acres lived with narrow concrete miles and his thought and his worry were not any more with rainfall with wind and dust with the thrust of the crops eyes watched the tires ears listened to the clattering motors and minds struggled with oil with gasoline with the thinning rubber between air and road then a broken gear was tragedy then water in the evening was the yearning and food over the fire then health to go on was the need and strength to go on and spirit to go on the wills thrust westward ahead of them and fears that had once apprehended drought or flood now lingered with anything that might stop the westward crawling the camps became fixedeach a short days journey from the last and on the road the panic overcame some of the families so that they drove night and day stopped to sleep in the cars and drove on to the west flying from the road flying from movement and these lusted so greatly to be settled that they set their faces into the west and drove toward it forcing the clashing engines over the roads but most of the families changed and grew quickly into the new life and when the sun went down time to look out for a place to stop andtheres some tents ahead the car pulled off the road and stopped and because others were there first certain courtesies were necessary and the man the leader of the family leaned from the car can we pull up here an sleep why sure be proud to have you what state you from come all the way from arkansas theys arkansas people down that fourth tent that so and the great question hows the water well she dont taste so good but theys plenty well thank ya no thanks to me but the courtesies had to be the car lumbered over the ground to the end tent and stopped then down from the car the weary people climbed and stretched stiff bodies then the new tent sprang up the children went for water and the older boys cut brush or wood the fires started and supper was put on to boil or to fry early comers moved over and states were exchanged and friends and sometimes relatives discovered oklahoma huh what county cherokee why i got folks there know the allens theys allens all over cherokee know the willises why sure and a new unit was formed the dusk came but before the dark was down the new family was of the camp a word had been passed with every family they were known peoplegood people i

they went to live in enid an done wellreal well only allen that ever done well got a garage when the water was carried and the wood cut the children walked shyly cautiously among the tents and they made elaborate acquaintanceship gestures a boy stopped near another boy and studied a stone picked it up examined it closely spat on it and rubbed it clean and inspected it until he forced the other to demand what you got there and casually nothin jus a rock well what you lookin at it like that for thought i seen gold in it howd you know gold aint gold its black in a rock sure everbody knows that i bet its fools gold an you figgered it was gold that aint so cause pa hes foun lots a gold an he tol me how to look howd you like to pick up a big ol piece a gold saaay id git the bigges old sonabitchin piece a candy you ever seen i aint let to swear but i do anyways me too les go to the spring and young girls found each other and boasted shyly of their popularity and their prospects the women worked over the fire hurrying to get food to the stomachs of the familypork if there was money in plenty pork and potatoes and onions dutchoven biscuits or cornbread and plenty of gravy to go over it sidemeat or chops and a can of boiled tea black and bitter fried dough in drippings if money was slim dough fried crisp and brown and the drippings poured over it those families which were very rich or very foolish with their money ate canned beans and canned peaches and packaged bread and bakery cake but they ate secretly in their tents for it would not have been good to eat such fine things openly even so children eating their fried dough smelled the warming beans and were unhappy about it when supper was over and the dishes dipped and wiped the dark had come and then the men squatted down to talk and they talked of the land behind them i dont know what its coming to they said the countrys spoilt itll come back though ony we wont be there maybe they thought maybe we sinned some way we didnt know about fella says to me govment fella an he says shes gullied up on ya govment fella he says if ya plowed cross the contour she wont gully never did have no chance to try her an the new super aint plowin cross the contour runnin a furrow four miles long that aint stoppin or goin aroun jesus christ hisself and they spoke softly of their homes they was a little coolhouse under

your mouth she was so cool water drippin down from the tank they spoke of their tragedies had a brother charley hair as yella as corn an him a growed man played the cordeen nice too he was harrowin

gonna take care my kids dont miss no more school i can read good but it aint no pleasure to me like with a fella thats used to it and perhaps a man brought out his guitar to the front of his tent and he sat on a box to play and everyone in the camp moved slowly in toward him drawn in toward him many men can chord a guitar but perhaps this man was a picker there you have somethingthe deep chords beating beating while the melody runs on the strings like little footsteps heavy hard fingers marching on the frets the man played and the people moved slowly in on him until the circle was closed and tight and then he sang tencent cotton and fortycent meat and the circle sang softly with him and he sang why do you cut your hair girls and the circle sang he wailed the song im leaving old texas that eerie song that was sung before the spaniards came only the words were indian then and now the group was welded to one thing one unit so that in the dark the eyes of the people were inward and their minds played in other times and their sadness was like rest like sleep he sang the mcalester blues and then to make up for it to the older people he sang jesus calls me to his side the children drowsed with the music and went into the tents to sleep and the singing came into their dreams and after a while the man with the guitar stood up and yawned good night folks he said and they murmured good night to you and each wished he could pick a guitar because it is a gracious thing then the people went to their beds and the camp was quiet and the owls coasted overhead and the coyotes gabbled in the distance and into the camp skunks walked looking for bits of foodwaddling arrogant skunks afraid of nothing the night passed and with the first streak of dawn the women came out of the tents built up the fires and put the coffee to boil and the men came out and talked softly in the dawn when you cross the colorado river theres the desert they say look out for the desert see you dont get hung up take plenty water case you get hung up im gonna take her at night me too shell cut the living jesus outa you the families ate quickly and the dishes were dipped and wiped the tents came down there was a rush to go and when the sun arose the camping place was vacant only a little litter left by the people and the camping place was ready for a new world in a new night but along the highway the cars of the migrant people crawled out like bugs and the narrow concrete miles stretched ahead chapter the joad family moved slowly westward up into the mountains of new mexico past the pinnacles and pyramids of the upland they climbed into the high country of arizona and through a gap they looked down on the painted desert a border guard stopped them where you going to california said tom how long you plan to be in arizona no longern we can get acrost her got any plants no plants i ought to look your stuff over i tell you we aint got no plants the guard put a little sticker on the windshield ok go ahead but you better keep movin sure we aim to they crawled up the slopes and the low twisted trees covered the slopes holbrook joseph city winslow and then the tall trees began and the cars spouted steam and labored up the slopes and there was flagstaff and that was the top of it all down from flagstaff over the great plateaus and the road disappeared in the distance ahead the water grew scarce water was to be bought five cents ten cents fifteen cents a gallon the sun drained the dry rocky country and ahead were jagged broken peaks the western wall of arizona and now they were in flight from the sun and the drought they drove all night and came to the mountains in the night and they crawled the jagged ramparts in the night and their dim lights flickered on the pale stone walls of the road they passed the summit in the dark and came slowly down in the late night through the shattered stone debris of oatman and when the daylight came they saw the colorado river below them they drove to topock pulled up at the bridge while a guard washed off the windshield sticker then across the bridge and into the broken rock wilderness and although they were dead weary and the morning heat was growing they stopped pa called were therewere in california they looked dully at the broken rock glaring under the sun and across the river the terrible ramparts of arizona we got the desert said tom we got to get to the water and rest the road runs parallel to the river and it was well into the morning when the burning motors came to needles where the river runs swiftly among the reeds the joads and wilsons drove to the river and they sat in the cars looking at the lovely water flowing by and the green reeds jerking slowly in the current there was a little encampment by the river eleven tents near the water and the swamp grass on the ground and tom leaned out of the truck window mind if we stop here a piece a stout woman scrubbing clothes in a bucket looked up we dont own it mister stop if you want theyll be a cop down to look you over and she went back to her scrubbing in the sun the two cars pulled to a clear place on the swamp grass the tents were passed down the wilson tent set up the joad tarpaulin stretched over its rope winfield and ruthie walked slowly down through the willows to the reedy place ruthie said with soft vehemence california this heres california an were right in it winfield broke a tule and twisted it free and he put the white pulp in his mouth and chewed it they walked into the water and stood quietly the water about the calves of their legs we got the desert yet ruthie said whats the desert like i dont know i seen pitchers once says a desert they was bones everplace man bones some i guess but mosly cow bones we gonna

squidged his toes in the sand of the bottom they heard ma calling ruthie winfiel you come back they turned and walked slowly back through the reeds and the willows the other tents were quiet for a moment when the cars came up a few heads had stuck out between the flaps and then were withdrawn now the family tents were up and the men gathered together tom said im gonna go down an take a bath thats what im gonna dobefore i sleep hows granma sence we got her in the tent don know said pa couldn seem to wake her up he cocked his head toward the tent a whining babbling voice came from under

soon she ain gonna las shes jes wore out anybody comin with me im gonna wash an im gonna sleep in the shadeall day long he moved away and the other men followed him they took off their clothes in the willows and then they walked into the water and sat down for a long time they sat holding themselves with heels dug into the sand and only their heads stuck out of the water jesus i needed this al said he took a handful of sand from the bottom and scrubbed himself with it they lay in the water and looked across at the sharp peaks called needles and at the white rock mountains of arizona we come through them pa said in wonder uncle john ducked his head under the water well were here this heres california an she dont look so prosperous got the desert yet said tom an i hear shes a sonofabitch

stay here like to lay here forever never get hungry an never get sad lay in the water all life long lazy as a brood sow in the mud and tom looking at the ragged peaks across the river and the needles

appear again following the edge of the river and he watched noah growing smaller on the edge of the river until he disappeared into the willows at last and tom took off his cap and scratched his head he went back to his willow cave and lay down to sleep under the spread tarpaulin granma lay on a mattress and ma sat beside her the air was stiflingly hot and the flies buzzed in the shade of the canvas granma was naked under a long piece of pink curtain she turned her old head restlessly from side to side and she muttered and choked ma sat on the ground beside her and with a piece of cardboard drove the flies away and fanned a stream of moving hot air over the tight old face rose of sharon sat on the other side and watched her mother granma called imperiously will will you come here will and her eyes opened and she looked fiercely about tol him to come right here she said ill catch him ill take the hair offn him she closed her eyes and rolled her head back and forth and muttered thickly ma fanned with the cardboard rose of sharon looked helplessly at the old woman she said softly shes awful sick ma raised her eyes to the girls face mas eyes were patient but the lines of strain were on her forehead ma fanned and fanned the air and her piece of cardboard warned off the flies when youre young rosasharn everthing that happens is a thing all by itself its a lonely thing i know i member rosasharn her mouth loved the name of her daughter youre gonna have a baby rosasharn and thats somepin to you lonely and away thats gonna hurt you an the hurtll be lonely hurt an this here tent is alone in the worl rosasharn she whipped the air for a moment to drive a buzzing blow fly on and the big shining fly circled the tent twice and zoomed out into the blinding sunlight and ma went on theys a time of change an when that comes dyin is a piece of all dyin and bearin is a piece of all bearin an bearin an dyin is two pieces of the same thing an then things aint lonely any more an then a hurt dont hurt so bad cause it aint a lonely hurt no more rosasharn i wisht i could tell you so youd know but i cant and her voice was so soft so full of love that tears crowded into rose of sharons eyes and flowed over her eyes and blinded her take an fan granma ma said and she handed the cardboard to her daughter thats a good thing to do i wisht i could tell you so youd know granma scowling her brows down over her closed eyes bleated will youre dirty you aint never gonna get clean her little wrinkled claws moved up and scratched her cheek a red ant ran up the curtain cloth and scrambled over the folds of loose skin on the old ladys neck ma reached quickly and picked it off crushed it between thumb and forefinger and brushed her fingers on her dress rose of sharon waved the cardboard fan she looked up at ma she and the words parched in her throat wipe your feet willyou dirty pig granma cried ma said i dunno maybe if we can get her where it aint so hot but i dunno dont worry yourself rosasharn take your breath in when you need it an let go when you need to a large woman in a torn black dress looked into the tent her eyes were bleared and indefinite and the skin sagged to her jowls and hung down in little flaps her lips were loose so that the upper lip hung like a curtain over her teeth and her lower lip by its weight folded outward showing her lower gums mornin maam she said mornin an praise god for victory ma looked around mornin she said the woman stooped into the tent and bent her head over granma we heerd you got a soul here ready to join her jesus praise god mas face tightened and her eyes grew sharp shes tard thats all ma said shes wore out with the road an the heat shes jus wore out get a little res an shell be well the woman leaned down over granmas face and she seemed almost to sniff then she turned to ma and nodded quickly and her lips jiggled and her jowls quivered a dear soul gonna join her jesus she said ma cried that aint

forth and muttered under her breath the woman walked stiffly out of the tent ma continued to look down at the old face rose of sharon fanned her cardboard and moved the hot air in a stream she said ma yeah whynt ya let em hol a meetin i dunno said ma jehovites is good people theyre howlers an jumpers i dunno somepin jus come over me i didn think i could stan it id jus fly all apart from some little distance there came the sound of the beginning meeting a singsong chant of exhortation the words were not clear only the tone the voice rose and fell and went higher at each rise now a response filled in the pause and the exhortation went up with a tone of triumph and a growl of power came into the voice it swelled and paused and a growl came into the response and now gradually the sentences of exhortation shortened grew sharper like commands and into the responses came a complaining note the rhythm quickened male and female voices had been one tone but now in the middle of a response one womans voice went up and up in a wailing cry wild and fierce like the cry of a beast and a deeper womans voice rose up beside it a baying voice and a mans voice traveled up the scale in the howl of a wolf the exhortation stopped and only the feral howling came from the tent and with it a thudding sound on the earth ma shivered rose of sharons breath was panting and short and the chorus of howls went on so long it seemed that lungs must burst ma said makes me nervous somepin happened to me now the high voice broke into hysteria the gabbling screams of a hyena the thudding became louder voices cracked and broke and then the whole chorus fell to a sobbing grunting undertone and the slap of flesh and the thuddings on the earth and the sobbing changed to a little whining like that of a litter of puppies at a food dish rose of sharon cried softly with nervousness granma kicked the curtain off her legs which lay like gray knotted sticks and granma whined with the whining in the distance ma pulled the curtain back in place and then granma sighed deeply and her breathing grew steady and easy and her closed eyelids ceased their flicking she slept deeply and snored through her halfopen mouth the whining from the distance was softer and softer until it could not be heard at all any more rose of sharon looked at ma and her eyes were blank with tears it done good said rose of sharon it done granma good shes asleepin mas head was down and she was ashamed maybe i done them good people wrong granma is asleep whynt you ast our preacher if you done a sin the girl asked i willbut hes a queer man maybe its him made me tell them people they couldn come here that preacher hes gettin roun to thinkin that what people does is right to do ma looked at her hands and then she said rosasharn

the ice you want gonna have a ice box keep it full stuff dont spoil if you got ice connies thinkin all a time ma chuckled better get some rest now rose of sharon closed her eyes ma turned over on her back and crossed her hands under her head she listened to granmas breathing and to the girls breathing she moved a hand to start a fly from her forehead the camp was quiet in the blinding heat but the noises of hot grassof crickets the hum of flieswere a tone that was close to silence ma sighed deeply and then yawned and closed her eyes in her halfsleep she heard footsteps approaching but it was a mans voice that started her awake whos in here ma sat up quickly a brownfaced man bent over and looked in he wore boots and khaki pants and a khaki shirt with epaulets on a sam browne belt a pistol holster hung and a big silver star was pinned to his shirt at the left breast a loosecrowned military cap was on the back of his head he beat on the tarpaulin with his hand and the tight canvas vibrated like a drum whos in here he demanded again ma asked what is it you want mister what you think i want i want to know whos in here why theys jus us three in here me an granma an my girl wheres

secretly and when she saw ma fighting with her face rose of sharon closed her eyes and pretended to be asleep the sun sank low in the afternoon but the heat did not seem to decrease tom awakened under his willow and his mouth was parched and his body was wet with sweat and his head was dissatisfied with his rest he staggered to his feet and walked toward the water he peeled off his clothes and waded into the stream and the moment the water was about him his thirst was gone he lay back in the shallows and his body floated he held himself in place with his elbows in the sand and looked at his toes which bobbed above the surface a pale skinny little boy crept like an animal through the reeds and slipped off his clothes and he squirmed into the water like a muskrat and pulled himself along like a muskrat only his eyes and nose above the surface then suddenly he saw toms head and saw that tom was watching him he stopped his game and sat up tom said hello lo looks like you was playin muskrat well i was he edged gradually away toward the bank he moved casually and then he leaped out gathered his clothes with a sweep of his arms and was gone among the willows tom laughed quietly and then he heard his name called shrilly tom oh tom he sat up in the water and whistled through his teeth a piercing whistle with a loop on the end the willows shook and ruthie stood looking at him ma wants you she said ma wants you right away awright he stood up and strode through the water to the shore and ruthie looked with interest and amazement at his naked body tom seeing the direction of her eyes said run on now git and ruthie ran tom heard her calling excitedly for winfield as she went he put the hot clothes on his cool wet body and he walked slowly up through the willows toward the tent ma had started a fire of dry willow twigs and she had a pan of water heating she looked relieved when she saw him whats a matter ma he asked i was scairt she said they was a policeman here he says we

inside the mattress lay on the ground and the equipment was scattered about as it had been unloaded in the morning sairy lay on the mattress her eyes wide and bright he stood and looked down at her

out of the dusky tent into the blinding light the men were loading up the truck uncle john on top while the others passed equipment up to him he stowed it carefully keeping the surface level ma emptied the quarter of a keg of salt pork into a pan and tom and al took both little barrels to the river and washed them they tied them to the running boards and carried water in buckets to fill them then over the tops they tied canvas to keep them from slopping the water out only the tarpaulin and granmas mattress were left to put on tom said with the load well take this ol wagonll boil her head off we got to have plenty water ma passed the boiled potatoes out and brought the half sack from the tent and put it with the pan of pork the family ate standing shuffling their feet and tossing the hot potatoes from hand to hand until they cooled ma went to the wilson tent and stayed for ten minutes and then she came out quietly its time to go she said the men went under the tarpaulin granma still slept her mouth wide open they lifted the whole mattress gently and passed it up on top of the truck granma drew up her skinny legs and frowned in her sleep but she did not awaken uncle john and pa tied the tarpaulin over the crosspiece making a little tight tent on top of the load they lashed it down to the sidebars and then they were ready pa took out his purse and dug two crushed bills from it he went to wilson and held them out we want you should take this an he pointed to the pork and potatoesan that wilson hung his head and shook it sharply i aint agonna do it he said you aint got much got enough to get there said pa we aint left it all well have work right off i aint agonna do it wilson said ill git mean if you try ma took the two bills from pas hand she folded them neatly and put them on the ground and placed the pork pan over them thats where theyll be she said if you don get em somebody else will wilson his head still down turned and went to his tent he stepped inside and the flaps fell behind him for a few moments the family waited and then we got to go said tom its near four i bet the family climbed on the truck ma on top beside granma tom and al and pa in the seat and winfield on pas lap connie and rose of sharon made a nest against the cab the preacher and uncle john and ruthie were in a tangle on the load pa called goodby mister and mis wilson there was no answer from the tent tom started the engine and the truck lumbered away and as they crawled up the rough road toward needles and the highway ma looked back wilson stood in front of his tent staring after them and his hat was in his hand the sun fell full on his face ma waved her hand at him but he did not respond tom kept the truck in second gear over the rough road to protect the springs at needles he drove into a service station checked the worn tires for air checked the spares tied to the back he had the gas tank filled and he bought two fivegallon cans of gasoline and a twogallon can of oil he filled the radiator begged a map and studied it the servicestation boy in his white uniform seemed uneasy until the bill was paid he said you people sure have got nerve tom looked up from the map what you mean well crossin in a jalopy like this you been acrost sure plenty but not in no wreck like this tom said if we broke down maybe somebodyd give us a han well maybe but folks are kind of scared to stop at night id hate to be doing it takes more nerve than ive got tom grinned it dont take no nerve to do somepin when there aint nothin else you can do well thanks well drag on and he got in the truck and moved away the boy in white went into the iron building where his helper labored over a book of bills jesus what a hardlooking outfit them okies theyre all hardlookin jesus id hate to start out in a jalopy like that well you and me got sense them goddamn okies got no sense and no feeling they aint human a human being wouldnt live like they do a human being couldnt stand it to be so dirty and miserable they aint a hell of a lot better than gorillas just the same im glad i aint crossing the desert in no hudson supersix she sounds like a threshing machine the other boy looked down at his book of bills and a big drop of sweat rolled down his finger and fell on the pink bills you know they dont have much trouble theyre so goddamn dumb they dont know its dangerous and christ almighty they dont know any better than what they got why worry im not worrying just thought if it was me i wouldnt like it thats cause you know better they dont know any better and he wiped the sweat from the pink bill with his sleeve the truck took the road and moved up the long hill through the broken rotten rock the engine boiled very soon and tom slowed down and took it easy up the long slope winding and twisting through dead country burned white and gray and no hint of life in it once tom stopped for a few moments to let the engine cool and then he traveled on they topped the pass while the sun was still up and looked down on the desertblack cinder mountains in the distance and the yellow sun reflected on the gray desert the little starved bushes sage and greasewood threw bold shadows on the sand and bits of rock the glaring sun was straight ahead tom held his hand before his eyes to see at all they passed the crest and coasted down to cool the engine they coasted down the long sweep to the floor of the desert and the fan turned over to cool the water in the radiator in the drivers seat tom and al and pa and winfield on pas knee looked into the bright descending sun and their eyes were stony and their brown faces were damp with perspiration the burnt land and the black cindery hills broke the even distance and made it terrible in the reddening light of the setting sun al said jesus what a place howd you like to walk acrost her people done it said tom lots a people done it an if they could we could lots must a died said al well we aint come out exacly clean al was silent for a while and the reddening desert swept past think well ever see them wilsons again al asked tom flicked his eyes down to the oil gauge i got a hunch nobody aint gonna see mis wilson for long jus a hunch i got winfield said pa i wanta get out tom looked over at him mights well let everbody out fore we settle down to drivin tonight he slowed the car and brought it to a stop winfield scrambled out and urinated at the side of the road tom leaned out anybody else were holdin our water up here uncle john called pa said winfiel you crawl up on top you put my legs to sleep asettin on em the little boy buttoned his overalls and obediently crawled up the back board and on his hands and knees crawled over granmas mattress and forward to ruthie the truck moved on into the evening and the edge of the sun struck the rough horizon and turned the desert red ruthie said wouldn leave you set up there huh i didn want to it wasnt so nice as here couldn lie down well don you bother me asquawkin an atalkin ruthie said cause im goin to sleep an when i wake up we gonna be there cause tom said so gonna seem funny to see pretty country the sun went down and left a great halo in the sky and it grew very dark under the tarpaulin a long cave with light at each enda flat triangle of light connie and rose of sharon leaned back against the cab and the hot wind tumbling through the tent struck the backs of their heads and the tarpaulin whipped and drummed above them they spoke together in low tones pitched to the drumming canvas so that no one could hear them when connie spoke he turned his head and spoke into her ear and she did the same to him she said seems like we wasnt never gonna do nothin but move im so tard he turned his head to her ear maybe in the mornin howd you like to be alone now in the dusk his hand moved out and stroked her hip she said dont youll make me crazy as a loon dont do that and she turned her head to hear his response

fore christmus soons you get studied up we could get ice an stuff i guess he chuckled its this here heat he said what you gonna need ice roun christmus for she giggled thas right but id like ice any time now dont youll get me crazy the dusk passed into dark and the desert stars came out in the soft sky stars stabbing and sharp with few points and rays to them and the sky was velvet and the heat changed while the sun was up it was a beating flailing heat but now the heat came from below from the earth itself and the heat was thick and muffling the lights of the truck came on and they illuminated a little blur of highway ahead and a strip of desert on either side of the road and sometimes eyes gleamed in the lights far ahead but no animal showed in the lights it was pitch dark under the canvas now uncle john and the preacher were curled in the middle of the truck resting on their elbows and staring out the back triangle they could see the two bumps that were ma and granma against the outside they could see ma move occasionally and her dark arm moving against the outside uncle john talked to the preacher casy he said youre a fella oughta know what to do what to do about what i dunno said uncle john casy said well thats gonna make it easy for me well you been a preacher look john everbody takes a crack at me cause i been a preacher a preacher aint nothin but a man

sinthen its a sin a fella builds his own sins right up from the groun i got to give that goinover said uncle john and he rolled on his back and lay with his knees pulled up the truck moved on over the hot earth and the hours passed ruthie and winfield went to sleep connie loosened a blanket from the load and covered himself and rose of sharon with it and in the heat they struggled together and held their breaths and after a time connie threw off the blanket and the hot tunneling wind felt cool on their wet bodies on the back of the truck ma lay on the mattress beside granma and she could not see with her eyes but she could feel the struggling body and the struggling heart and the sobbing breath was in her ear and ma said over and over all right its gonna be all right and she said hoarsely you know the family got to get acrost you know that uncle john called you all right it was a moment before she answered all right guess i dropped off to sleep and after a time granma was still and ma lay rigid beside her the night hours passed and the dark was in against the truck sometimes cars passed them going west and away and sometimes great trucks came up out of the west and rumbled eastward and the stars flowed down in a slow cascade over the western horizon it was near midnight when they neared daggett where the inspection station is the road was floodlighted there and a sign illuminated keep right and stop the officers loafed in the office but they came out and stood under the long covered shed when tom pulled in one officer put down the license number and raised the hood tom asked whats this here agricultural inspection we got to look over your stuff got any vegetables or seeds no said tom well we got to look over your stuff you got to unload now ma climbed heavily down from the truck her face was swollen and her eyes were hard look mister we got a sick ol lady we got to get her to a doctor we cant wait she seemed to fight with hysteria you cant make us wait yeah well we got to look you over i swear we aint got anything ma cried i swear it an granmas awful sick you dont look so good yourself the officer said ma pulled herself up the back of the truck hoisted herself with huge strength look she said the officer shot a flashlight beam up on the old shrunken face by god she is he said you swear you got no seeds or fruits or vegetables no corn no oranges no no i swear it then go ahead you can get a doctor in barstow thats only eight miles go on ahead tom climbed in and drove on the officer turned to his companion i couldn hold em maybe it was a bluff said the other oh jesus no you should of seen that ol womans face that wasnt no bluff tom increased his speed to barstow and in the little town he stopped got out and walked around the truck ma leaned out its awright she said i didn wanta stop there fear we wouldn get acrost yeah but hows granma shes awrightawright drive on we got to get acrost tom shook his head and walked back al he said im gonna fill her up an then you drive some he pulled to an allnight gas station and filled the tank and the radiator and filled the crank case then al slipped under the wheel and tom took the outside with pa in the middle they drove away into the darkness and the little hills near barstow were behind them tom said i don know whats got into ma shes flighty as a dog with a flea in his ear wouldn a took long to look over the stuff an she says granmas sick an now she says granmas awright i cant figger her out she aint right spose she wore her brains out on the trip pa said mas almost like she was when she was

tom said well you done a damn good job a pickin we aint had hardly no trouble with her at all all night they bored through the hot darkness and jackrabbits scuttled into the lights and dashed away in long jolting leaps and the dawn came up behind them when the lights of mojave were ahead and the dawn showed high mountains to the west they filled with water and oil at mojave and crawled into the mountains and the dawn was about them tom said jesus the deserts past pa al for christ sakes the deserts past im too goddamned tired to care said al want me to drive no wait awhile they drove through tehachapi in the morning glow and the sun came up behind them and thensuddenly they saw the great valley below them al jammed on the brake and stopped in the middle of the road and jesus christ look he said the vineyards the orchards the great flat valley green and beautiful the trees set in rows and the farm houses and pa said god almighty the distant cities the little towns in the orchard land and the morning sun golden on the valley a car honked behind them al pulled to the side of the road and parked i want ta look at her the grain fields golden in the morning and the willow lines the eucalyptus trees in rows pa sighed i never knowed they was anything like her the peach trees and the walnut groves and the dark green patches of oranges and red roofs among the trees and barnsrich barns al got out and stretched his legs he called macome look were there ruthie and winfield scrambled down from the car and then they stood silent and awestruck embarrassed before the great valley the distance was thinned with haze and the land grew softer and softer in the distance a windmill flashed in the sun and its turning blades were like a little heliograph far away ruthie and winfield looked at it and ruthie whispered its california winfield moved his lips silently over the syllables theres fruit he said aloud casy and uncle john connie and rose of sharon climbed down and they stood silently rose of sharon had started to brush her hair back when she caught sight of the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side tom said wheres ma i want ma to see it look ma come here ma ma was climbing slowly stiffly down the back board tom looked at her my god ma you sick her face was stiff and puttylike and her eyes seemed to have sunk deep into her head and the rims were red with weariness her feet touched the ground and she braced herself by holding the truckside her voice was a croak ya say were acrost tom pointed to the great valley look she turned her head and her mouth opened a little her fingers went to her throat and gathered a little pinch of skin and twisted gently thank god she said the famblys here her knees buckled and she sat down on the running board you sick ma no jus tard didn you get no sleep no was granma bad ma looked down at her hands lying together like tired lovers in her lap i wisht i could wait an not tell you i wisht it could be allnice pa

back there no moreim tard im awful tard they climbed back on the load and they avoided the long stiff figure covered and tucked in a comforter even the head covered and tucked they moved to their places and tried to keep their eyes from itfrom the hump on the comforter that would be the nose and the steep cliff that would be the jut of the chin they tried to keep their eyes away and they could not ruthie and winfield crowded in a forward corner as far away from the body as they could get stared at the tucked figure and ruthie whispered thas granma an shes dead winfield nodded solemnly she aint breathin at all shes awful dead and rose of sharon said softly to connie she was adyin right when we howd we know he reassured her al climbed on the load to make room for ma in the seat and al swaggered a little because he was sorry he plumped down beside casy and uncle john well she was ol guess her time was up al said everbody got to die casy and uncle john turned eyes expressionlessly on him and looked at him as though he were a curious talking bush well aint they he demanded and the eyes looked away leaving al sullen and shaken casy said in wonder all night long an she was alone and he said john theres a woman so great with loveshe scares me makes me afraid an mean john asked was it a sin is they any part of it you might call a sin casy turned on him in astonishment a sin no there aint no part of it thats a sin i aint never done nothin that wasnt part sin said john and he looked at the long wrapped body tom and ma and pa got into the front seat tom let the truck roll and started on compression and the heavy truck moved snorting and jerking and popping down the hill the sun was behind them and the valley golden and green before them ma shook her head slowly from side to side its purty she said i wisht they could of saw it i wisht so too said pa tom patted the steering wheel under his hand they was too old he said they wouldnt of saw nothin thats here grampa would a been aseein the injuns an the prairie country when he was a young fella an granma would a remembered an seen the first home she lived in they was too ol whos really seein it is ruthie an winfiel pa said heres tommy talkin like a growedup man talkin like a preacher almos and ma smiled sadly he is tommys growed way upway up so i cant get aholt of im sometimes they popped down the mountain twisting and looping losing the valley sometimes and then finding it again and the hot breath of the valley came up to them with hot green smells on it and with resinous sage and tarweed smells the crickets crackled along the road a rattlesnake crawled across the road and tom hit it and broke it and left it squirming tom said i guess we got to go to the coroner wherever he is we got to get her buried decent how much money might be lef pa bout forty dollars said pa tom laughed jesus are we gonna start clean we sure aint bringin nothin with us he chuckled a moment and then his face straightened quickly he pulled the visor of his cap down low over his eyes and the truck rolled down the mountain into the great valley chapter once california belonged to mexico and its land to mexicans and a horde of tattered feverish americans poured in and such was their hunger for land that they took the landstole sutters land guerreros land took the grants and broke them up and growled and quarreled over them those frantic hungry men and they guarded with guns the land they had stolen they put up houses and barns they turned the earth and planted crops and these things were possession and possession was ownership the mexicans were weak and fled they could not resist because they wanted nothing in the world as frantically as the americans wanted land then with time the squatters were no longer squatters but owners and their children grew up and had children on the land and the hunger was gone from them the feral hunger the gnawing tearing hunger for land for water and earth and the good sky over it for the green thrusting grass for the swelling roots they had these things so completely that they did not know about them any more they had no more the stomachtearing lust for a rich acre and a shining blade to plow it for seed and a windmill beating its wings in the air they arose in the dark no more to hear the sleepy birds first chittering and the morning wind around the house while they waited for the first light to go out to the dear acres these things were lost and crops were reckoned in dollars and land was valued by principal plus interest and crops were bought and sold before they were planted then crop failure drought and flood were no longer little deaths within life but simple losses of money and all their love was thinned with money and all their fierceness dribbled away in interest until they were no longer farmers at all but little shopkeepers of crops little manufacturers who must sell before they can make then those farmers who were not good shopkeepers lost their land to good shopkeepers no matter how clever how loving a man might be with earth and growing things he could not survive if he were not also a good shopkeeper and as time went on the business men had the farms and the farms grew larger but there were fewer of them now farming became industry and the owners followed rome although they did not know it they imported slaves although they did not call them slaves chinese japanese mexicans filipinos they live on rice and beans the business men said they dont need much they wouldnt know what to do with good wages why look how they live why look what they eat and if they get funnydeport them and all the time the farms grew larger and the owners fewer and there were pitifully few farmers on the land any more and the imported serfs were beaten and frightened and starved until some went home again and some grew fierce and were killed or driven from the country and the farms grew larger and the owners fewer and the crops changed fruit trees took the place of grain fields and vegetables to feed the world spread out on the bottoms lettuce cauliflower artichokes potatoesstoop crops a man may stand to use a scythe a plow pitchfork but he must crawl like a bug between the rows of lettuce he must bend his back and pull his long bag between the cotton rows he must go on his knees like a penitent across a cauliflower patch and it came about that owners no longer worked on their farms they farmed on paper and they forgot the land the smell the feel of it and remembered only that they owned it remembered only what they gained and lost by it and some of the farms grew so large that one man could not even conceive of them any more so large that it took batteries of bookkeepers to keep track of interest and gain and loss chemists to test the soil to replenish straw bosses to see that the stooping men were moving along the rows as swiftly as the material of their bodies could stand then such a farmer really became a storekeeper and kept a store he paid the men and sold them food and took the money back and after a while he did not pay the men at all and saved bookkeeping these farms gave food on credit a man might work and feed himself and when the work was done might find that he owed money to the company and the owners not only did not work the farms any more many of them had never seen the farms they owned and then the dispossessed were drawn westfrom kansas oklahoma texas new mexico from nevada and arkansas families tribes dusted out tractored out carloads caravans homeless and hungry twenty thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand they streamed over the mountains hungry and restlessrestless as ants scurrying to find work to doto lift to push to pull to pick to cutanything any burden to bear for food the kids are hungry we got no place to live like ants scurrying for work for food and most of all for land we aint foreign seven generations back americans and beyond that irish scotch english german one of our folks in the revolution an they was lots of our folks in the civil warboth sides americans they were hungry and they were fierce and they had hoped to find a home and they found only hatred okiesthe owners hated them because the owners knew they were soft and the okies strong that they were fed and the okies hungry and perhaps the owners had heard from their grandfathers how easy it is to steal land from a soft man if you are fierce and hungry and armed the owners hated them and in the towns the storekeepers hated them because they had no money to spend there is no shorter path to a storekeepers contempt and all his admirations are exactly opposite the town men little bankers hated okies because there was nothing to gain from them they had nothing and the laboring people hated okies because a hungry man must work and if he must work if he has to work the wage payer automatically gives him less for his work and then no one can get more and the dispossessed the migrants flowed into california two hundred and fifty thousand and three hundred thousand behind them new tractors were going on the land and the tenants were being forced off and new waves were on the way new waves of the dispossessed and the homeless hardened intent and dangerous and while the californians wanted many things accumulation social success amusement luxury and a curious banking security the new barbarians wanted only two thingsland and food and to them the two were one and whereas the wants of the californians were nebulous and undefined the wants of the okies were beside the roads lying there to be seen and coveted the good fields with water to be dug for the good green fields earth to crumble experimentally in the hand grass to smell oaten stalks to chew until the sharp sweetness was in the throat a man might look at a fallow field and know and see in his mind that his own bending back and his own straining arms would bring the cabbages into the light and the golden eating corn the turnips and carrots and a homeless hungry man driving the roads with his wife beside him and his thin children in the back seat could look at the fallow fields which might produce food but not profit and that man could know how a fallow field is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin children and such a man drove along the roads and knew temptation at every field and knew the lust to take these fields and make them grow strength for his children and a little comfort for his wife the temptation was before him always the fields goaded him and the company ditches with good water flowing were a goad to him and in the south he saw the golden oranges hanging on the trees the little golden oranges in the dark green trees and guards with shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child oranges to be dumped if the price was low he drove his old car into a town he scoured the farms for work where can we sleep the night well theres hooverville on the edge of the river theres a whole raft of okies there he drove his old car to hooverville he never asked again for there was a hooverville on the edge of every town the rag town lay close to water and the houses were tents and weedthatched enclosures paper houses a great junk pile the man drove his family in and became a citizen of hoovervillealways they were called hooverville the man put up his own tent as near to water as he could get or if he had no tent he went to the city dump and brought back cartons and built a house of corrugated paper and when the rains came the house melted and washed away he settled in hooverville and he scoured the countryside for work and the little money he had went for gasoline to look for work in the evening the men gathered and talked together squatting on their hams they talked of the land they had seen theres thirty thousan acres out west of here layin there jesus what i could do with that with five acres of that why hell id have everthing to eat notice one thing they aint no vegetables nor chickens nor pigs at the farms they raise one thingcotton say or peaches or lettuce nother placell be all chickens they buy the stuff they could raise in the dooryard jesus what i could do with a couple pigs well it aint yourn an it aint gonna be yourn what we gonna do the kids cant grow up this way in the camps the word would come whispering theres work at shafter and the cars would be loaded in the night the highways crowdeda gold rush for work at shafter the people would pile up five times too many to do the work a gold rush for work they stole away in the night frantic for work and along the roads lay the temptations the fields that could bear food thats owned that aint ourn well maybe we could get a little piece of her maybea little piece right down therea patch jimson weed now christ i could git enough potatoes offn that little patch to feed my whole family it aint ourn it got to have jimson weeds now and then a man tried crept on the land and cleared a piece trying like a thief to steal a little richness from the earth secret gardens hidden in the weeds a package of carrot seeds and a few turnips planted potato skins crept out in the evening secretly to hoe in the stolen earth leave the weeds around the edgethen nobody can see what were adoin leave some weeds big tall ones in the middle secret gardening in the evenings and water carried in a rusty can and then one day a deputy sheriff well what you think youre doin i aint doin no harm i had my eye on you this aint your land youre trespassing the land aint plowed an i aint hurtin it none you goddamned squatters pretty soon youd think you owned it youd be sore as hell think you

when they were children a gun is an extension of themselves what if they wont scare what if some time an army of them marches on the land as the lombards did in italy as the germans did on gaul and the turks did on byzantium they were landhungry illarmed hordes too and the legions could not stop them slaughter and terror did not stop them how can you frighten a man whose hunger is not only in his own cramped stomach but in the wretched bellies of his children you cant scare himhe has known a fear beyond every other in hooverville the men talking grampa took his lan from the injuns now this

was all under water cause he went in a boathe never went to jail neither an the fellas that bribed congressmen and the legislatures never went to jail neither all over the state jabbering in the hoovervilles and then the raidsthe swoop of armed deputies on the squatters camps get out department of health orders this camp is a menace to health where we gonna go thats none of our business we got orders to get you out of here in half an hour we set fire to the camp theys typhoid down the line you want ta spread it all over we got orders to get you out of here now get in half an hour we burn the camp in half an hour the smoke of paper houses of weedthatched huts rising to the sky and the people in their cars over the highways looking for another hooverville and in kansas and arkansas in oklahoma and texas and new mexico the tractors moved in and pushed the tenants out three hundred thousand in california and more coming and in california the roads full of frantic people running like ants to pull to push to lift to work for every manload to lift five pairs of arms extended to lift it for every stomachful of food available five mouths open and the great owners who must lose their land in an upheaval the great owners with access to history with eyes to read history and to know the great fact when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away and that companion fact when a majority of the people are hungry and cold they will take by force what they need and the little screaming fact that sounds through all history repression works only to strengthen and knit the repressed the great owners ignored the three cries of history the land fell into fewer hands the number of the dispossessed increased and every effort of the great owners was directed at repression the money was spent for arms for gas to protect the great holdings and spies were sent to catch the murmuring of revolt so that it might be stamped out the changing economy was ignored plans for the change ignored and only means to destroy revolt were considered while the causes of revolt went on the tractors which throw men out of work the belt lines which carry loads the machines which produce all were increased and more and more families scampered on the highways looking for crumbs from the great holdings lusting after the land beside the roads the great owners formed associations for protection and they met to discuss ways to intimidate to kill to gas and always they were in fear of a principal three hundred thousand if they ever move under a leaderthe end three hundred thousand hungry and miserable if they ever know themselves the land will be theirs and all the gas all the rifles in the world wont stop them and the great owners who had become through their holdings both more and less than men ran to their destruction and used every means that in the long run would destroy them every little means every violence every raid on a hooverville every deputy swaggering through a ragged camp put off the day a little and cemented the inevitability of the day the men squatted on their hams sharpfaced men lean from hunger and hard from resisting it sullen eyes and hard jaws and the rich land was around them dja hear about the kid in the fourth tent down no i jus come in well that kids been acryin in his sleep an arollin in his sleep them folks thought he got worms so they give him a blaster an he died it was what they call blacktongue the kid had comes from not gettin good things to eat poor little fella yeah but them folks cant bury him got to go

our people are kind people pray god some day kind people wont all be poor pray god some day a kid can eat and the association of owners knew that some day the praying would stop and theres the end chapter the family on top of the load the children and connie and rose of sharon and the preacher were stiff and cramped they had sat in the heat in front of the coroners office in bakersfield while pa and ma and uncle john went in then a basket was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck and they sat in the sun while the examination went on while the cause of death was found and the certificate signed al and tom strolled along the street and looked in store windows and watched the strange people on the sidewalks and at last pa and ma and uncle john came out and they were subdued and quiet uncle john climbed up on the load pa and ma got in the seat tom and al strolled back and tom got under the steering wheel he sat there silently waiting for some instruction pa looked straight ahead his dark hat pulled low ma rubbed the sides of her mouth with her fingers and her eyes were far away and lost dead with weariness pa sighed deeply they wasnt nothin else to do he said i

funeral where we goin tom asked pa raised his hat and scratched among his hair camp he said we aint gonna spen what littles lef till we get work drive out in the country tom started the car and they rolled through the streets and out toward the country and by a bridge they saw a collection of tents and shacks tom said mights well stop here find out whats doin an where at the work is he drove down a steep dirt incline and parked on the edge of the encampment there was no order in the camp little gray tents shacks cars were scattered about at random the first house was nondescript the south wall was made of three sheets of rusty corrugated iron the east wall a square of moldy carpet tacked between two boards the north wall a strip of roofing paper and a strip of tattered canvas and the west wall six pieces of gunny sacking over the square frame on untrimmed willow limbs grass had been piled not thatched but heaped up in a low mound the entrance on the gunnysack side was cluttered with equipment a fivegallon kerosene can served for a stove it was laid on its side with a section of rusty stovepipe thrust in one end a wash boiler rested on its side against the wall and a collection of boxes lay about boxes to sit on to eat on a model t ford sedan and a twowheel trailer were parked beside the shack and about the camp there hung a slovenly despair next to the shack there was a little tent gray with weathering but neatly properly set up and the boxes in front of it were placed against the tent wall a stovepipe stuck out of the door flap and the dirt in front of the tent had been swept and sprinkled a bucketful of soaking clothes stood on a box the camp was neat and sturdy a model a roadster and a little homemade bed trailer stood beside the tent and next there was a huge tent ragged torn in strips and the tears mended with pieces of wire the flaps were up and inside four wide mattresses lay on the ground a clothes line strung along the side bore pink cotton dresses and several pairs of overalls there were forty tents and shacks and beside each habitation some kind of automobile far down the line a few children stood and stared at the newly arrived truck and they moved toward it little boys in overalls and bare feet their hair gray with dust tom stopped the truck and looked at pa she aint very purty he said want to go somewheres else cant go nowhere else till we know where were at pa said we got to ast about work tom opened the door and stepped out the family climbed down from the load and looked curiously at the camp ruthie and winfield from the habit of the road took down the bucket and walked toward the willows where there would be water and the line of children parted for them and closed after them the flaps of the first shack parted and a woman looked out her gray hair was braided and she wore a dirty flowered mother hubbard her face was wizened and dull deep gray pouches under blank eyes and a mouth slack and loose pa said can we jus pull up anywheres an camp the head was withdrawn inside the shack for a moment there was quiet and then the flaps were pushed aside and a bearded man in shirt sleeves stepped out the woman looked out after him but she did not come into the open the bearded man said howdy folks and his restless dark eyes jumped to each member of the family and from them to the truck to the equipment pa said i jus ast your woman if its all right to set our stuff anywheres the bearded man looked at pa intently as though he had said something very wise that needed thought set down anywheres here in this place he asked sure anybody own this place that we got to see fore we can camp the bearded man squinted one eye nearly closed and studied pa you wanta camp here pas irritation arose the gray woman peered out of the burlap shack what you think im asayin pa said well if you wanta camp here why dont ya i aint astoppin you tom laughed he got it pa gathered his temper i jus wanted to know does anybody own it

who owns it he demanded whos gonna kick us outa here you tell me tom stepped in front of pa you better go take a good long sleep he said the bearded man dropped his mouth open and put a dirty finger against his lower gums for a moment he continued to look wisely speculatively at tom and then he turned on his heels and popped into the shack after the gray woman tom turned on pa what the hell was that he asked pa shrugged his shoulders he was looking across the camp in front of a tent stood an old buick and the head was off a young man was grinding the valves and as he twisted back and forth back and forth on the tool he looked up at the joad truck they could see that he was laughing to himself when the bearded man was gone the young man left his work and sauntered over hare ya he said

with a bent back came like a badger out of a tent and snooped near sniffing the air as he came he laced his arms behind him and joined the children to watch ma ruthie and winfield stood near to ma and

stared at the top of the tent and then she put her thumb in her mouth for a gag and she cried silently ma knelt beside the fire breaking twigs to keep the flame up under the stew kettle the fire flared and dropped and flared and dropped the children fifteen of them stood silently and watched and when the smell of the cooking stew came to their noses their noses crinkled slightly the sunlight glistened on hair tawny with dust the children were embarrassed to be there but they did not go ma talked quietly to a little girl who stood inside the lusting circle she was older than the rest she stood on one foot caressing the back of her leg with a bare instep her arms were clasped behind her she watched ma with steady small gray eyes she suggested i could break up some bresh if you want me

angry eyes on the little girl ruthie squatted down to break up the twigs for ma ma lifted the kettle lid and stirred the stew with a stick im sure glad some of you aint hungry that little fella aint

between them they limped against the weight of the bucket and neither one looked up from the ground the sun was half down in afternoon al said you dont like nothin much floyd scraped harder with the

ground they aint a hands work in this here country we gotta move where to al called god knows we worked this here place over he let in his clutch and moved slowly down the camp al looked after them

toward the joad camp it was crowded now the strange children stood close to the stew pot so close that ma brushed them with her elbows as she worked tom and uncle john stood beside her ma said helplessly i dunno what to do i got to feed the fambly whatm i gonna do with these here the children stood stiffly and looked at her their faces were blank rigid and their eyes went mechanically from the pot to the tin plate she held their eyes followed the spoon from pot to plate and when she passed the steaming plate up to uncle john their eyes followed it up uncle john dug his spoon into the stew and the banked eyes rose up with the spoon a piece of potato went into johns mouth and the banked eyes were on his face watching to see how he would react would it be good would he like it and then uncle john seemed to see them for the first time he chewed slowly you take this here he said to tom i aint hungry you aint et today tom said i know but i got a stomickache i aint hungry tom said quietly you take that plate inside the tent an you eat it i aint hungry john insisted id still see em inside the tent tom turned on the children you git he said go on now git the bank of eyes left the

little tas but it aint gonna do you no good she faltered i cant hep it cant keep it from you she lifted the pot and set it down on the ground now wait its too hot she said and she went into the tent quickly so she would not see her family sat on the ground each with his plate and outside they could hear the children digging into the pot with their sticks and their spoons and their pieces of rusty tin a mound of children smothered the pot from sight they did not talk did not fight or argue but there was a quiet intentness in all of them a wooden fierceness ma turned her back so she couldnt see we cant do that no more she said we got to eat alone there was the sound of scraping at the kettle and then the mound of children broke and the children walked away and left the scraped kettle on the ground ma looked at the empty plates didn none of you get nowhere near enough pa got up and left the tent without answering the preacher smiled to himself and lay back on the ground hands clasped behind his head al got to his feet got to help a fella with a car ma gathered the plates and took them outside to wash ruthie she called winfiel go get me a bucket a water right off she handed them the bucket and they trudged off toward the river a strong broad woman walked near her dress was streaked with dust and splotched with car oil her chin was held high with pride she stood a short distance away and regarded ma belligerently at last she approached afternoon she said coldly afternoon said ma and she got up from her knees and pushed a box forward wont you set down the woman walked

about em ever since he fitted his wrench to the enginehead bolts and turned them down evenly one turn to each nut around and around the series tom squatted down beside the car and squinted his eyes up the line of tents a little stubble was beaten into the earth between the tents no sir he said ma aint gonna like you goin off well seems to me a lone fella got more chance of work maybe but ma aint gonna like it at all two cars loaded with disconsolate men drove down into the camp floyd lifted his eyes but he didnt ask them about their luck their dusty faces were sad and resistant the sun was sinking now and the yellow sunlight fell on the hooverville and on the willows behind it the children began to come out of the tents to wander about the camp and from the tents the women came and built their little fires the men gathered in squatting groups and talked together a new chevrolet coupe turned off the highway and headed down into the camp it pulled to the center of the camp tom said whos this they dont belong here floyd said i dunnocops maybe the car door opened and a man got out and stood beside the car his companion remained seated now all the squatting men looked at the newcomers and the conversation was still and the women building their fires looked secretly at the shiny car the children moved closer with elaborate circuitousness edging inward in long curves floyd put down his wrench tom stood up al wiped his hand on his trousers the three strolled toward the chevrolet the man who had got out of the car was dressed in khaki trousers and a flannel shirt he wore a flatbrimmed stetson hat a sheaf of papers was held in his shirt pocket by a little fence of fountain pens and yellow pencils and from his hip pocket protruded a notebook with metal covers he moved to one of the groups of squatting men and they looked up at him suspicious and quiet they watched him and did not move the whites of their eyes showed beneath the irises for they did not raise their heads to look tom and al and floyd strolled casually near the man said you men want to work still they looked quietly suspiciously and men from all over the camp moved near one of the squatting men spoke at last sure we wanta work wheres ats work tulare county fruits opening up need a lot of pickers floyd spoke up you doin the hiring well im contracting the land the men were in a compact group now an overalled man took off his black hat and combed back his long black hair with his fingers what you payin he asked well cant tell exactly yet bout thirty cents i guess why cant you tell you took the contract didn you thats true the khaki man said but its keyed to the price might be a little more might be a little less floyd stepped out ahead he said quietly ill go mister youre a contractor an

say what hes gonna pay ast ta see his license he aint allowed to contract men without a license the contractor turned to the chevrolet and called joe his companion looked out and then swung the car door open and stepped out he wore riding breeches and laced boots a heavy pistol holster hung on a cartridge belt around his waist on his brown shirt a deputy sheriffs star was pinned he walked heavily over his face was set to a thin smile what you want the holster slid back and forth on his hip ever see this guy before joe the deputy asked which one this fella the contractor pointed to floyd whatd he do the deputy smiled at floyd hes talkin red agitating trouble hmmm the deputy moved slowly around to see floyds profile and the color slowly flowed up floyds face you see floyd cried if this guys on the level would he bring a cop along ever see im before the contractor insisted hmm seems like i have las week when that usedcar lot was busted into seems like i seen this fella hangin

deputy swung around f youd like to go in too you jus open your trap once more they was two fellas hangin around that lot i wasnt even in the state las week tom said well maybe youre wanted someplace

here maybe with pick handles if you aint gone the contractor said i told you i need men if you dont want to workwell thats your business the deputy smiled if they dont want to work they aint a place for em in this county well float em quick floyd stood stiffly beside the deputy and floyds thumbs were hooked over his belt tom stole a look at him and then stared at the ground thats all the contractor said theres men needed in tulare county plenty of work tom looked slowly up at floyds hands and he saw the strings at the wrists standing out under the skin toms own hands came up and his thumbs hooked over his belt yeah thats all i dont want one of you here by tomorra morning the contractor stepped into the chevrolet now you the deputy said to floyd you get in that car he reached a large hand up and took hold of floyds left arm floyd spun and swung with one movement his fist splashed into the large face and in the same motion he was away dodging down the line of tents the deputy staggered and tom put out his foot for him to trip over the deputy fell heavily and rolled reaching for his gun floyd dodged in and out of sight down the line the deputy fired from the ground a woman in front of a tent screamed and then looked at a hand which had no knuckles the fingers hung on strings against her palm and the torn flesh was white and bloodless far down the line floyd came in sight sprinting for the willows the deputy sitting on the ground raised his gun again and then suddenly from the group of men the reverend casy stepped he kicked the deputy in the neck and then stood back as the heavy man crumpled into unconsciousness the motor of the chevrolet roared and it streaked away churning the dust it mounted to the highway and shot away in front of her tent the woman still looked at her shattered hand little droplets of blood began to ooze from the wound and a chuckling hysteria began in her throat a whining laugh that grew louder and higher with each breath the deputy lay on his side his mouth open against the dust tom picked up his automatic pulled out the magazine and threw it into the brush and he ejected the live shell from the chamber fella like that aint got no right to a gun he said and he dropped the automatic to the ground a crowd had collected around the woman with the broken hand and her hysteria increased a screaming quality came into her laughter casy moved close to tom you got to git out he said you go down in the willas an wait he didn see me kick im but he seen you stick out your foot i don want ta go tom said casy put his head close he whispered theyll fingerprint you you broke parole theyll send you back tom drew in his breath quietly jesus i forgot go quick casy said fore he comes to like to have his gun tom said no leave it if its awright to come back ill give ya four high whistles tom strolled away casually but as soon as he was away from the group he hurried his steps and he disappeared among the willows that lined the river al stepped over to the fallen deputy jesus he said admiringly you sure flagged im down the crowd of men had continued to stare at the unconscious man and now in the great distance a siren screamed up the scale and dropped and it screamed again nearer this time instantly the men were nervous they shifted their feet for a moment and then they moved away each one to his own tent only al and the preacher remained casy turned to al get out he said go on get outto the tent you dont know nothin yeah how bout you casy grinned at him somebody got to take the blame i got no kids theyll jus put me in jail an i aint doin nothin but set aroun al said aint no reason for go on now casy said sharply you get outta this al bristled i aint takin orders casy said softly if you mess in this your whole fambly all your folks gonna get in trouble i don care about you but your ma and your pa theyll get in trouble maybe theyll send tom back to mcalester al considered it for a moment ok he said i think youre a damn fool though sure said casy why not the siren screamed again and again and always it came closer casy knelt beside the deputy and turned him over the man groaned and fluttered his eyes and he tried to see casy wiped the dust off his lips the families were in the tents now and the flaps were down and the setting sun made the air red and the gray tents bronze tires squealed on the highway and an open car came swiftly into the camp four men armed with rifles piled out casy stood up and walked to them what the hells goin on here casy said i knocked out your man there one of the armed men went to the deputy he was conscious now trying weakly to sit up now what happened here well casy said he got tough an i hit im and he started shootinhit a woman down the line so i hit im again well whatd you do in the first place i talked back said casy get in that car sure said casy and he climbed into the back seat and sat down two men helped the hurt deputy to his feet he felt his neck gingerly casy said theys a woman down the row like to bleed to death from his bad shootin well see about that later joe is this the fella that hit you the dazed man stared sickly at casy dont

trouble you better see how bad that womans hurt wheres she that tent over there the leader of the deputies walked to the tent rifle in hand he spoke through the tent walls and then went inside in a moment he came out and walked back and he said a little proudly jesus what a mess a does make they got a tourniquet on well send a doctor out two deputies sat on either side of casy the leader sounded his horn there was no movement in the camp the flaps were down tight and the people in their tents the engine started and the car swung around and pulled out of the camp between his guards casy sat proudly his head up and the stringy muscles of his neck prominent on his lips there was a faint smile and on his face a curious look of conquest when the deputies had gone the people came out of the tents the sun was down now and the gentle blue evening light was in the camp to the east the mountains were still yellow with sunlight the women went back to the fires that had died the men collected to squat together and to talk softly al crawled from under the joad tarpaulin and walked toward the willows to whistle for tom ma came out and built her little fire of twigs pa she said we aint goin to have much we et so late pa and uncle john stuck close to the camp watching ma peeling potatoes and slicing them raw into a frying pan of deep grease pa said now what the hell made the preacher do

the dust and ground it with his heel in selfabasement and he left his black hat there broken and dirty he entered the store and walked to the shelves where the whisky bottles stood behind wire netting

said pa tom stood up look he said you all eat an get the stuff loaded ill go look for uncle john hed of went to the store crost the road tom walked quickly away the little cooking fires burned in front of the tents and the shacks and the light fell on the faces of ragged men and women on crouched children in a few tents the light of kerosene lamps shone through the canvas and placed shadows of people hugely on the cloth tom walked up the dusty road and crossed the concrete highway to the little grocery store he stood in front of the screen door and looked in the proprietor a little gray man with an unkempt mustache and watery eyes leaned on the counter reading a newspaper his thin arms were bare and he wore a long white apron heaped around and in back of him were mounds pyramids walls of canned goods he looked up when tom came in and his eyes narrowed as though he aimed a shotgun good evening he said run out of something run out of my uncle said tom or he run out or something the gray man looked puzzled and worried at the same time he touched the tip of his nose tenderly and waggled it around to stop an itch seems like you people always lost somebody he said ten times a day or more somebody comes in here an says if you see a man named so an so an looks like so an so will you tell im we went up north somepin like that all the time tom laughed well if you see a young snotnose name

yourself out too much tom said he went out the screen door carrying uncle johns dusty black hat he crossed the concrete road and walked along the edge of it below him in the sunken field the hooverville lay and the little fires flickered and the lanterns shone through the tents somewhere in the camp a guitar sounded slow chords struck without any sequence practice chords tom stopped and listened and then he moved slowly along the side of the road and every few steps he stopped to listen again he had gone a quarter of a mile before he heard what he listened for down below the embankment the sound of a thick tuneless voice singing drably tom cocked his head the better to hear and the dull voice sang ive give my heart to jesus so jesus take me home ive give my soul to jesus so jesus is my home the song trailed off to a murmur and then stopped tom hurried down from the embankment toward the song after a while he stopped and listened again and the voice was close this time the same slow tuneless singing oh the night that maggie died she called me to her side an give to me them ol red flannel drawers that maggie wore they was baggy at the knees tom moved cautiously forward he saw the black form sitting on the ground and he stole near and sat down uncle john tilted the pint and the liquor gurgled out of the neck of the bottle tom said quietly hey wait where do i come in uncle john turned his head who you you forgot me awready you had four drinks to my one no tom dont try fool me im all alone here you aint been here well im sure here now how bout givin me a

starlight nobody don know my sins nobody but jesus he knows tom got down on his knees he put his hand on uncle johns forehead and it was hot and dry john brushed his hand away clumsily come on tom pleaded come on now uncle john aint goin go jus tard gon res ri here ri here tom was very close he put his fist against the point of uncle johns chin he made a small practice arc twice for distance and then with his shoulder in the swing he hit the chin a delicate perfect blow johns chin snapped up and he fell backwards and tried to sit up again but tom was kneeling over him and as john got one elbow up tom hit him again uncle john lay still on the ground tom stood up and bending he lifted the loose sagging body and boosted it over his shoulder he staggered under the loose weight johns hanging hands tapped him on the back as he went slowly puffing up the bank to the highway once a car came by and lighted him with the limp man over his shoulder the car slowed for a moment and then roared away tom was panting when he came back to the hooverville down from the road and to the joad truck john was coming to he struggled weakly tom set him gently down on the ground camp had been broken while he was gone al passed the bundles up on the truck the tarpaulin lay ready to bind over the load al said he sure got a quick start tom apologized i had to hit im a little to make im come poor fella didn hurt im ma asked don think so hes acomin out of it uncle john was weakly sick on the ground his spasms of vomiting came in little gasps ma said i lef a plate a potatoes for you tom tom chuckled i aint just in the mood right now pa called awright al sling up the tarp the truck was loaded and ready uncle john had gone to sleep tom and al boosted and pulled him up on the load while winfield made a vomiting noise behind the truck and ruthie plugged her mouth with her hand to keep from squealing awready pa said tom asked wheres rosasharn over there said ma come on rosasharn were agoin the girl sat still her chin sunk on her breast tom walked over to her come on he said i aint agoin she did not raise her head you got to go i want connie i aint agoin till he comes back three cars pulled out of the camp up the road to the highway old cars loaded with the camps and the people they clanked up the highway and rolled away their dim lights glancing along the road tom said conniell find us i lef word up at the store where wed be hell find us ma came up and stood beside him come on rosasharn come on honey she said gently i wanta wait we cant wait ma leaned down and took the girl by the arm and helped her to her feet hell find us tom said don you worry hell find us they walked on either side of the girl maybe he went to get them books to study up said rose of sharon maybe he was agonna surprise us ma said maybe thats jus what he done they led her to the truck and helped her up on top of the load and she crawled under the tarpaulin and disappeared into the dark cave now the bearded man from the weed shack came timidly to the truck he waited about his hands clutched behind his back you gonna leave any stuff a fella could use he asked at last pa said cant think of nothin we aint got nothin to leave tom asked aint ya gettin out for a long time the bearded man stared at him no he said at last but theyll burn ya out the unsteady eyes dropped to the ground i know they done it before well why the hell dont ya get out the bewildered eyes looked up for a moment and then down again and the dying firelight was reflected redly i don know takes so long to git stuff together you wont have nothin if they burn ya out i know you aint leavin nothin a fella could use cleaned out slick said pa the bearded man vaguely wandered away whats a matter with him pa demanded cophappy said tom fella was sayinhes bullsimple been beat over the head too much a second little caravan drove past the camp and climbed to the road and moved away come on pa lets go look here pa you an me an al ride in the seat ma can get on the load no ma you ride in the middle altom reached under the seat and brought out a monkey wrenchal you get up behind take this here jus in case if anybody tries to climb uplet im have it al took the wrench and climbed up the back board and he settled himself crosslegged the wrench in his hand tom pulled the iron jack handle from under the seat and laid it on the floor under the brake pedal awright he said get in the middle ma pa said i aint got nothin in my han you can reach over an get the jack handle said tom i hope to jesus you don need it he stepped on the starter and the clanking flywheel turned over the engine caught and died and caught again tom turned on the lights and moved out of the camp in low gear the dim lights fingered the road nervously they climbed up to the highway and turned south tom said they comes a time when a man gets mad ma broke in tomyou tol meyou promised me you wasnt like that you promised i know ma im atryin but them deputiesdid you ever see a deputy that didn have a fat ass an they waggle their ass an flop their gun aroun ma he said if it was the law they was workin with why we could

fat asses gets to workin me over i got a big job tryin if it was the law itd be different but burnin the camp aint the law the car jolted along ahead a little row of red lanterns stretched across the highway detour i guess tom said he slowed the car and stopped it and immediately a crowd of men swarmed about the truck they were armed with pick handles and shotguns they wore trench helmets and some american legion caps one man leaned in the window and the warm smell of whisky preceded him where you think youre goin he thrust a red face near to toms face tom stiffened his hand crept down to the floor and felt for the jack handle ma caught his arm and held it powerfully tom said well and then his voice took on a servile whine were strangers here he said we heard about theys work in a place called tulare well goddamn it youre goin the wrong way we aint gonna have no goddamn okies in this town toms shoulders and arms were rigid and a shiver went through him ma clung to his arm the front of the truck was surrounded by the armed men some of them to make a military appearance wore tunics and sam browne belts tom whined which way is it at mister you turn right around an head north an dont come back till the cottons ready tom shivered all over yes sir he said he put the car in reverse backed around and turned he headed back the way he had come ma released his arm and patted him softly and tom tried to restrain his hard smothered sobbing don you mind ma said don you mind tom blew his nose out the window and wiped his eyes on his sleeve the sonsofbitches you done good ma said tenderly you done jus good tom swerved into a side dirt road ran a hundred yards and turned off his lights and motor he got out of the car carrying the jack handle where you goin ma demanded jus gonna look we aint goin north the red lanterns moved up the highway tom watched them cross the entrance of the dirt road and continue on in a few moments there came the sounds of shouts and screams and then a flaring light arose from the direction of the hooverville the light grew and spread and from the distance came a crackling sound tom got in the truck again he turned around and ran up the dirt road without lights at the highway he turned south again and he turned on his lights ma asked timidly where we goin tom goin south he said we couldn let them bastards push us aroun we couldn try to get aroun the town thout goin through it yeah but where we goin pa spoke for the first time thats what i want ta know gonna look for that govment camp tom said a fella said they don let no deputies in

time i know ma chuckled maybe that makes us tough rich fellas come up an they die an their kids aint no good an they die out but tom we keep acomin don you fret none tom a different times comin how do you know i don know how they entered the town and tom turned down a side street to avoid the center by the street lights he looked at his mother her face was quiet and a curious look was in her eyes eyes like the timeless eyes of a statue tom put out his right hand and touched her on the shoulder he had to and then he withdrew his hand never heard you talk so much in my life he said wasnt never so much reason she said he drove through the side streets and cleared the town and then he crossed back at an intersection the sign said he turned south on it well anyways they never shoved us north he said we still go where we want even if we got to crawl for the right the dim lights felt along the broad black highway ahead chapter the moving questing people were migrants now those families who had lived on a little piece of land who had lived and died on forty acres had eaten or starved on the produce of forty acres had now the whole west to rove in and they scampered about looking for work and the highways were streams of people and the ditch banks were lines of people behind them more were coming the great highways streamed with moving people there in the middleand southwest had lived a simple agrarian folk who had not changed with industry who had not farmed with machines or known the power and danger of machines in private hands they had not grown up in the paradoxes of industry their senses were still sharp to the ridiculousness of the industrial life and then suddenly the machines pushed them out and they swarmed on the highways the movement changed them the highways the camps along the road the fear of hunger and the hunger itself changed them the children without dinner changed them the endless moving changed them they were migrants and the hostility changed them welded them united themhostility that made the little towns group and arm as though to repel an invader squads with pick handles clerks and storekeepers with shotguns guarding the world against their own people in the west there was panic when the migrants multiplied on the highways men of property were terrified for their property men who had never been hungry saw the eyes of the hungry men who had never wanted anything very much saw the flare of want in the eyes of the migrants and the men of the towns and of the soft suburban country gathered to defend themselves and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad as a man must do before he fights they said these goddamned okies are dirty and ignorant theyre degenerate sexual maniacs those goddamned okies are thieves theyll steal anything theyve got no sense of property rights and the latter was true for how can a man without property know the ache of ownership and the defending people said they bring disease theyre filthy we cant have them in the schools theyre strangers howd you like to have your sister go out with one of em the local people whipped themselves into a mold of cruelty then they formed units squads and armed themarmed them with clubs with gas with guns we own the country we cant let these okies get out of hand and the men who were armed did not own the land but they thought they did and the clerks who drilled at night owned nothing and the little storekeepers possessed only a drawerful of debts but even a debt is something even a job is something the clerk thought i get fifteen dollars a week spose a goddamn okie would work for twelve and the little storekeeper thought how could i compete with a debtless man and the migrants streamed in on the highways and their hunger was in their eyes and their need was in their eyes they had no argument no system nothing but their numbers and their needs when there was work for a man ten men fought for itfought with a low wage if that fellall work for thirty cents ill work for twentyfive if hell take twentyfive ill do it for twenty no me im hungry ill work for fifteen ill work for food the kids you ought to see them little boils like comin out an they cant run aroun give em some windfall fruit an they bloated up me ill work for a little piece of meat and this was good for wages went down and prices stayed up the great owners were glad and they sent out more handbills to bring more people in and wages went down and prices stayed up and pretty soon now well have serfs again and now the great owners and the companies invented a new method a great owner bought a cannery and when the peaches and the pears were ripe he cut the price of fruit below the cost of raising it and as cannery owner he paid himself a low price for the fruit and kept the price of canned goods up and took his profit and the little farmers who owned no canneries lost their farms and they were taken by the great owners the banks and the companies who also owned the canneries as time went on there were fewer farms the little farmers moved into town for a while and exhausted their credit exhausted their friends their relatives and then they too went on the highways and the roads were crowded with men ravenous for work murderous for work and the companies the banks worked at their own doom and they did not know it the fields were fruitful and starving men moved on the roads the granaries were full and the children of the poor grew up rachitic and the pustules of pellagra swelled on their sides the great companies did not know that the line between hunger and anger is a thin line and money that might have gone to wages went for gas for guns for agents and spies for blacklists for drilling on the highways the people moved like ants and searched for work for food and the anger began to ferment chapter it was late when tom joad drove along a country road looking for the weedpatch camp there were few lights in the countryside only a sky glare behind showed the direction of bakersfield the truck jiggled slowly along and hunting cats left the road ahead of it at a crossroad there was a little cluster of white wooden buildings ma was sleeping in the seat and pa had been silent and withdrawn for a long time tom said i don know where she is maybe well wait till daylight an ast somebody he stopped at a boulevard signal and another car stopped at the crossing tom leaned out hey mister know where the big camp is at straight ahead tom pulled across into the opposite road a few hundred yards and then he stopped a high wire fence faced the road and a widegated driveway turned in a little way inside the gate there was a small house with a light in the window tom turned in the whole truck leaped into the air and crashed down again jesus tom said i didn even see that hump a watchman stood up from the porch and walked to the car he leaned on the side you hit her too fast he said next time youll take it easy what is it for gods sake the watchman laughed well a lot of kids play in here you tell folks to go slow and theyre liable to forget but let em hit that hump once and they dont forget oh yeah

unit whats that toilets and showers and wash tubs ma demanded you got wash tubsrunning water sure oh praise god said ma tom drove down the long dark row of tents in the sanitary building a low light burned pull in here the watchman said its a nice place folks that had it just moved out tom stopped the car right there yeah now you let the others unload while i sign you up get to sleep the camp committeell call on you in the morning and get you fixed up toms eyes drew down cops he asked the watchman laughed no cops we got our own cops folks here elect their own cops come along al dropped off the truck and walked around gonna stay here yeah said tom you an pa unload while i go to the office be kinda quiet the watchman said theys a lot of folks sleeping tom followed through the dark and climbed the office steps and entered a tiny room containing an old desk and a chair the guard sat down at the desk and took out a form name tom joad that your father yeah his name tom joad too the questions went on where from how long in the state what work done the watchman looked up im not nosy we got to have this stuff sure said tom nowgot any money little bit you aint destitute got a little why well the camp site costs a dollar a week but you can work it out carrying garbage keeping the camp cleanstuff like that well work it out said tom youll see the committee tomorrow theyll show you how to use the camp and tell you the rules tom said saywhat is this what committee is this anyways the watchman settled himself back works pretty nice theres five sanitary units each one elects a central committee man now that committee makes the laws what they say goes spose they get tough tom said well you can vote em out jus as quick as you vote em in theyve done a fine job tell you what they didyou know the holy roller preachers all the time follow the people around preachin an takin up collections well they wanted to preach in this camp and a lot of the older folks wanted them so it was up to the central committee they went into meeting and heres how they fixed it they say any preacher can preach in this camp nobody can take up a collection in this camp and it was kinda sad for the old folks cause there hasnt been a preacher in since tom laughed and then he asked you mean to say the fellas that runs the camp is jus fellascampin here sure and it works you said about cops

here without a warrant well spose a fella is jus mean or drunk an quarrelsome what then the watchman stabbed the blotter with a pencil well the first time the central committee warns him and the second time they really warn him the third time they kick him out of the camp god almighty i cant hardly believe it tonight the deputies an them fellas with the little caps they burned the camp out by the river they dont get in here the watchman said some nights the boys patrol the fences specially dance nights dance nights jesus christ we got the best dances in the county every saturday night well for christs sake why aint they more places like this the watchman looked sullen youll have to find that out yourself go get some sleep good night said tom mas gonna like this place she aint been treated decent for a long time good night the watchman said get some sleep this camp wakes up early tom walked down the street between the rows of tents his eyes grew used to the starlight he saw that the rows were straight and that there was no litter about the tents the ground of the street had been swept and sprinkled from the tents came the snores of sleeping people the whole camp buzzed and snorted tom walked slowly he neared number four sanitary unit and he looked at it curiously an unpainted building low and rough under a roof but open at the sides the rows of wash trays he saw the joad truck standing near by and went quietly toward it the tarpaulin was pitched and the camp was quiet as he drew near a figure moved from the shadow of the truck and came toward him ma said softly that you tom yeah sh she said theyre all asleep they was tard out you ought to be asleep too tom said well i wanted to see ya is it awright its nice tom said i aint gonna tell ya theyll tell ya in the

nothin like that hangin over me you got to tom chuckled happily you jus got to good night she said softly and she bent down and slipped under the dark tarpaulin tom climbed up over the tailboard of the truck he lay down on his back on the wooden floor and he pillowed his head on his crossed hands and his forearms pressed against his ears the night grew cooler tom buttoned his coat over his chest and settled back again the stars were clear and sharp over his head it was still dark when he awakened a small clashing noise brought him up from sleep tom listened and heard again the squeak of iron on iron he moved stiffly and shivered in the morning air the camp still slept tom stood up and looked over the side of the truck the eastern mountains were blueblack and as he watched the light stood up faintly behind them colored at the mountain rims with a washed red then growing colder grayer darker as it went up overhead until at a place near the western horizon it merged with pure night down in the valley the earth was the lavendergray of dawn the clash of iron sounded again tom looked down the line of tents only a little lighter gray than the ground beside a tent he saw a flash of orange fire seeping from the cracks in an old iron stove gray smoke spurted up from a stubby smoke pipe tom climbed over the truck side and dropped to the ground he moved slowly toward the stove he saw a girl working about the stove saw that she carried a baby on her crooked arm and that the baby was nursing its head up under the girls shirtwaist and the girl moved about poking the fire shifting the rusty stove lids to make a better draft opening the oven door and all the time the baby sucked and the mother shifted it deftly from arm to arm the baby didnt interfere with her work or with the quick gracefulness of her movements and the orange fire licked out of the stove cracks and threw flickering reflections on the tent tom moved closer he smelled frying bacon and baking bread from the east the light grew swiftly tom came near to the stove and stretched out his hands to it the girl looked at him and nodded so that her two braids jerked good mornin she said and she turned the bacon in the pan the tent flap jerked up and a young man came out and an older man followed him they were dressed in new blue dungarees and in dungaree coats stiff with filler the brass buttons shining they were sharpfaced men and they looked much alike the young man had a dark stubble beard and the older man a white stubble beard their heads and faces were wet their hair dripped water stood in drops on their stiff beards their cheeks shone with dampness together they stood looking quietly into the lightening east they yawned together and watched the light on the hill rims and then they turned and saw tom mornin the older man said and his face was neither friendly nor unfriendly mornin said tom and mornin said the younger man the water slowly dried on their faces they came to the stove and warmed their hands at it the girl kept to her work once she set the baby down and tied her braids together in back with a string and the two braids jerked and swung as she worked she set tin cups on a big packing box set tin plates and knives and forks out then she scooped bacon from the deep grease and laid it on a tin platter and the bacon cricked and rustled as it grew crisp she opened the rusty oven door and took out a square pan full of big high biscuits when the smell of the biscuits struck the air both of the men inhaled deeply the younger said keerist softly now the older man said to tom had your breakfast well no i aint but my folks is over there they aint up need the sleep well set down with us then we got plentythank god why thank ya tom said smells so darn good i couldn say no dont she the younger man asked ever smell anything so good in ya life they marched to the packing box and squatted around it workin around here the young man asked aim to said tom we jus got in las night aint had no chance to look aroun we had twelve days work the young man said the girl working by the stove said they even got new clothes both men looked down at their stiff blue clothes and they smiled a little shyly the girl set out the platter of bacon and the brown high biscuits and a bowl of bacon gravy and a pot of coffee and then she squatted down by the box too the baby still nursed its head up under the girls shirtwaist they filled their plates poured bacon gravy over the biscuits and sugared their coffee the older man filled his mouth full and he chewed and chewed and gulped and swallowed god almighty its good he said and he filled his mouth again the younger man said we been eatin good for twelve days now never missed a meal in twelve daysnone of us workin an gettin our pay an eatin he fell to again almost frantically and refilled his plate they drank the scalding coffee and threw the grounds to the earth and filled their cups again there was color in the light now a reddish gleam the father and son stopped eating they were facing to the east and their faces were lighted by the dawn the image of the mountain and the light coming over it were reflected in their eyes and then they threw the grounds from their cups to the earth and they stood up together got to git goin the older man said the younger turned to tom lookie he said were layin some pipe f you want to walk over with us maybe we could get you on tom said well thats mighty nice of you an i sure thank ya for the breakfast glad to have you the older man said well try to git you workin if you want ya goddamn right i want tom said jus wait a minute ill tell my folks he hurried to the joad tent and bent over and looked inside in the gloom under the tarpaulin he saw the lumps of sleeping figures but a little movement started among the bedclothes ruthie came wriggling out like a snake her hair down over her eyes and her dress wrinkled and twisted she crawled carefully out and stood up her gray eyes were clear and calm from sleep and mischief was not in them tom moved off from the tent and beckoned her to follow and when he turned she looked up at him lord god youre growin up he said she looked away in sudden embarrassment listen here tom said dont you wake nobody up but when they get up you tell em i got a chancet at a job an im agoin for it tell ma i et breakfas with some neighbors you hear that ruthie nodded and turned her head away and her eyes were little girls eyes dont you wake em up tom cautioned he hurried back to his new friends and ruthie cautiously approached the sanitary unit and peeked in the open doorway the two men were waiting when tom came back the young woman had dragged a mattress out and put the baby on it while she cleaned up the dishes tom said i wanted to tell my folks whereat i was they wasnt awake the three walked down the street between the tents the camp had begun to come to life at the new fires the women worked slicing meat kneading the dough for the mornings bread and the men were stirring about the tents and about the automobiles the sky was rosy now in front of the office a lean old man raked the ground carefully he so dragged his rake that the tine marks were straight and deep youre out early pa the young man said as they went by yep yep got to make up my rent rent hell the young man said he was drunk last satdy night sung in his tent all

picked up a green walnut he tested it with his thumb and then shied it at a blackbird sitting on a fence wire the bird flew up let the nut sail under it and then settled back on the wire and smoothed

the highway and walked down a graveled road through a small kitchen orchard and behind the trees they came to a small white farm house a few shade trees and a barn behind the barn a vineyard and a field of cotton as the three men walked past the house a screen door banged and a stocky sunburned man came down the back steps he wore a paper sun helmet and he rolled up his sleeves as he came across the yard his heavy sunburned eyebrows were drawn down in a scowl his cheeks were sunburned a beef red mornin mr thomas timothy said morning the man spoke irritably timothy said this heres tom joad we wondered if you could see your way to put him on thomas scowled at tom and then he laughed shortly and his brows still scowled oh sure ill put him on ill put everybody on maybe ill get a

ground and warned agitators to get out of the county tom began why i and then he closed his mouth and was silent thomas folded the paper carefully and put it in his pocket he had himself in control again he said quietly those men were sent out by the association now im giving em away and if they ever find out i told i wont have a farm next year i jus dont know what to say timothy said if they

who tol we thank you they wont be no fight go on to work thomas said and its twentyfive cents an hour well take it wilkie said from you thomas walked away toward the house ill be out in a piece he said you men get to work the screen door slammed behind him the three men walked out past the little whitewashed barn and along a field edge they came to a long narrow ditch with sections of concrete pipe lying beside it heres where were aworkin wilkie said his father opened the barn and passed out two picks and three shovels and he said to tom heres your beauty tom hefted the pick jumping jesus if she dont feel good waitll about leven oclock wilkie suggested see how good she feels then they walked to the end of the ditch tom took off his coat and dropped it on the dirt pile he pushed up his cap and stepped into the ditch then he spat on his hands the pick arose into the air and flashed down tom grunted softly the pick rose and fell and the grunt came at the moment it sank into the ground and loosened the soil wilkie said yes sir pa we got here a firstgrade muckstick man this here boy been married to that there little digger tom said i put in time umph yes sir i sure did umph put in my years umph kinda like the feel umph the soil loosened ahead of him the sun cleared the fruit trees now and the grape leaves were golden green on the vines six feet along and tom stepped aside and

yes sir timothy replied and its a responsibility all them people were doin our best an the people in the camp adoin their best i wisht them big farmers wouldn plague us so i wisht they wouldn tom climbed back into the ditch and wilkie stood aside tom said how bout this fight umph at the dance he tol about umph what they wanta do that for timothy followed behind wilkie and timothys shovel

it umph you an the pick umph workin together umph in line the three men worked and the ditch inched along and the sun shone hotly down on them in the growing morning when tom left her ruthie gazed in at the door of the sanitary unit for a while her courage was not strong without winfield to boast for she put a bare foot in on the concrete floor and then withdrew it down the line a woman came out of a tent and started a fire in a tin camp stove ruthie took a few steps in that direction but she could not leave she crept to the entrance of the joad tent and looked in on one side lying on the ground lay uncle john his mouth open and his snores bubbling spittily in his throat ma and pa were covered with a comfort their heads in away from the light al was on the far side from uncle john and his arm was flung over his eyes near the front of the tent rose of sharon and winfield lay and there was the space where ruthie had been beside winfield she squatted down and peered in her eyes remained on winfields tow head and as she looked the little boy opened his eyes and stared out at her and his eyes were solemn ruthie put her finger to her lips and beckoned with her other hand winfield rolled his eyes over to rose of sharon her pink flushed face was near to him and her mouth was open a little winfield carefully loosened the blanket and slipped out he crept out of the tent cautiously and joined ruthie how long you been up he whispered she led him away with elaborate caution and when they were safe she said i never been to bed i was up all night you was not winfield said youre a dirty liar awright she said if im a liar i aint gonna tell you nothin that happened i aint gonna tell how the fella got killed with a stab knife an how they was a bear come in an took off a little chile they wasnt no bear winfield said uneasily he brushed up his hair with his fingers and he pulled down his overalls at the crotch all rightthey wasnt no bear she said sarcastically an they aint no white things made outa dishstuff like in the catalogues winfield regarded her gravely he pointed to the sanitary unit in there he asked im a dirty liar ruthie said it aint gonna do me no good to tell stuff to you les go look winfield said i already been ruthie said i already set on em i even peed in one you never neither said winfield they went to the unit building and that time ruthie was not afraid boldly she led the way into the building the toilets lined one side of the large room and each toilet had its compartment with a door in front of it the porcelain was gleaming white hand basins lined another wall while on the third wall were four shower compartments there said ruthie thems the toilets i seen em in the catalogue the children drew near to one of the toilets ruthie in a burst of bravado boosted her skirt and sat down i tol you i been here she said and to prove it there was a tinkle of water in the bowl winfield was embarrassed his hand twisted the flushing lever there was a roar of water ruthie leaped into the air and jumped away she and winfield stood in the middle of the room and looked at the toilet the hiss of water continued in it you done it ruthie said you went an broke it i seen you i never honest i never i seen you ruthie said you jus aint to be trusted with no nice stuff winfield sunk his chin he looked up at ruthie and his eyes filled with tears his chin quivered and ruthie was instantly contrite never you mind she said i wont tell on you well pretend like she was already broke well pretend we aint even been in here she led him out of the building the sun lipped over the mountain by now shone on the corrugatediron roofs of the five sanitary units shone on the gray tents and on the swept ground of the streets between the tents and the camp was waking up the fires were burning in camp stoves in the stoves made of kerosene cans and of sheets of metal the smell of smoke was in the air tent flaps were thrown back and people moved about in the streets in front of the joad tent ma stood looking up and down the street she saw the children and came over to them i was worryin ma said i didn know where you was we was jus lookin ruthie said well wheres tom you seen him ruthie became important yes maam tom he got me up an he tol me what to tell you she paused to let her importance be apparent wellwhat ma demanded he said tell you she paused again and looked to see that winfield appreciated her position ma raised her hand the back of it toward ruthie what he got work said ruthie quickly went out to work she looked apprehensively at mas raised hand the hand sank down again and then it reached out for ruthie ma embraced ruthies shoulders in a quick convulsive hug and then released her ruthie stared at the ground in embarrassment and changed the subject they got toilets over there she said white ones you been in there ma demanded me an winfiel she said and then treacherously winfiel he bust a toilet winfield turned red he glared at ruthie she peed in one he said viciously ma was apprehensive now what did you do you show me she forced them to the door and inside now whatd you do ruthie pointed it was ahissin and aswishin stopped now show me what you done ma demanded winfield went reluctantly to the toilet i didn push it hard he said i jus had aholt of this here an the swish of water came again he leaped away ma threw back her head and laughed while ruthie and winfield regarded her resentfully thas the way she works ma said i seen them before when you finish you push that the shame of their ignorance was too great for the children they went out the door and they walked down the street to stare at a large family eating breakfast ma watched them out of the door and then she looked about the room she went to the shower closets and looked in she walked to the wash basins and ran her finger over the white porcelain she turned the water on a little and held her finger in the stream and jerked her hand away when the water came hot for a moment she regarded the basin and then setting the plug she filled the bowl a little from the hot faucet a little from the cold and then she washed her hands in the warm water and she washed her face she was brushing water through her hair with her fingers when a step sounded on the concrete floor behind her ma swung around an elderly man stood looking at her with an expression of righteous shock he said harshly how you come in here ma gulped and she felt the water dripping from her chin and soaking through her dress i didn know she said apologetically i thought this here was for folks to use the elderly man frowned on her for men folks he said sternly he walked to the door and pointed to a sign on it men there he said that proves it didn you see that

be quick she talked on to herself and ruthie and winfield stood by wondering the smoke of the morning fires arose all over the camp and the mutter of talk came from all sides rose of sharon unkempt and sleepyeyed crawled out of the tent ma turned from the cornmeal she was measuring in fistfuls she looked at the girls wrinkled dirty dress at her frizzled uncombed hair you got to clean up she said

kettle and added water and salt and stirred the gravy the coffee began to turn over in the gallon can and the smell of coffee rose from it pa wandered back from the sanitary unit and ma looked

he led the sad and startled children toward the sanitary unit ma called after him scrounge aroun good in their ears uncle john came to the door of the mens side and looked out and then he went back and sat on the toilet a long time and held his aching head in his hands ma had taken up a panload of brown pone and was dropping spoons of dough in the grease for a second pan when a shadow fell on the ground beside her she looked over her shoulder a little man dressed all in white stood behind hera man with a thin brown lined face and merry eyes he was lean as a picket his white clean clothes

expressionless eyes ruthie watched them go then she hit a ball and ran after it come on winfiel get a stick she called and then she looked in amazement winfield had joined the watching children and he too looked at her with expressionless eyes defiantly she hit the ball again she kicked up a great dust she pretended to have a good time and the children stood and watched ruthie lined up two balls and hit both of them and she turned her back on the watching eyes and then turned back suddenly she advanced on them mallet in hand you come an play she demanded they moved silently back at her

watching lady warned them when she comes back an wants to be decent you let her you was mean yourself amy the game went on while in the joad tent ruthie wept miserably the truck moved along the

moment the woman backed away and then suddenly she threw back her head and howled her eyes rolled up her shoulders and arms flopped loosely at her side and a string of thick ropy saliva ran from the corner of her mouth she howled again and again long deep animal howls men and women ran up from the other tents and they stood nearfrightened and quiet slowly the woman sank to her knees and the howls sank to a shuddering bubbling moan she fell sideways and her arms and legs twitched the white eyeballs showed under the open eyelids a man said softly the sperit she got the sperit ma stood looking down at the twitching form the little manager strolled up casually trouble he asked the crowd parted to let him through he looked down at the woman too bad he said will some of you help get her back to her tent the silent people shuffled their feet two men bent over and lifted the woman one held her under the arms and the other took her feet they carried her away and the people moved slowly after

tonightwell havesomepin nice chapter the migrant people scuttling for work scrabbling to live looked always for pleasure dug for pleasure manufactured pleasure and they were hungry for amusement sometimes amusement lay in speech and they climbed up their lives with jokes and it came about in the camps along the roads on the ditch banks beside the streams under the sycamores that the story teller grew into being so that the people gathered in the low firelight to hear the gifted ones and they listened while the tales were told and their participation made the stories great i was a recruit against geronimo and the people listened and their quiet eyes reflected the dying fire them injuns was cuteslick as snakes an quiet when they wanted could go through dry leaves an make no rustle try to do that sometimes and the people listened and remembered the crash of dry leaves under their feet come the change of season an the clouds up wrong time ever hear of the army doing anything right give the army ten chances an theyll stumble along took three regiments to kill a hundred bravesalways and the people listened and their faces were quiet with listening the story tellers gathering attention into their tales spoke in great rhythms spoke in great words because the tales were great and the listeners became great through them they was a brave on a ridge against the sun knowed he stood out spread his arms an stood naked as morning an against the sun maybe he was crazy i don know stood there arms spread out like a cross he looked four hunderd yards an the menwell they raised their sights an they felt the wind with their fingers an then they jus lay there an couldn shoot maybe that injun knowed somepin knowed we couldn shoot jes laid there with the rifles cocked an

somepin bettern you an eatin him dont never make it up to you cause you spoiled somepin in yaself an you cant never fix it up and the people nodded and perhaps the fire spurted a little light and showed their eyes looking in on themselves against the sun with his arms out an he looked bigas god and perhaps a man balanced twenty cents between food and pleasure and he went to a movie in marysville or tulare in ceres or mountain view and he came back to the ditch camp with his memory crowded and he told how it was they was this rich fella an he makes like hes poor an theys this rich

their feetfunny as hell and always if he had a little money a man could get drunk the hard edges gone and the warmth then there was no loneliness for a man could people his brain with friends and he could find his enemies and destroy them sitting in a ditch the earth grew soft under him failure dulled and the future was no threat and hunger did not skulk about but the world was soft and easy and a man could reach the place he started for the stars came down wonderfully close and the sky was soft death was a friend and sleep was deaths brother the old times came backa girl with pretty feet who danced one time at homea horsea long time ago a horse and a saddle and the leather was carved when was that ought to find a girl to talk to thats nice might lay with her too but warm here and the

you can do anything with a harmonica thin reedy single tone or chords or melody with rhythm chords you can mold the music with curved hands making it wail and cry like bagpipes making it full and round like an organ making it as sharp and bitter as the reed pipes of the hills and you can play and put it back in your pocket it is always with you always in your pocket and as you play you learn new tricks new ways to mold the tone with your hands to pinch the tone with your lips and no one teaches you you feel aroundsometimes alone in the shade at noon sometimes in the tent door after supper when the women are washing up your foot taps gently on the ground your eyebrows rise and fall in rhythm and if you lose it or break it why its no great loss you can buy another for a quarter a guitar

people cried and the preacher paced like a tiger whipping the people with his voice and they groveled and whined on the ground he calculated them gauged them played on them and when they were all squirming on the ground he stooped down and of his great strength he picked each one up in his arms and shouted take em christ and threw each one in the water and when they were all in waist deep in the water and looking with frightened eyes at the master he knelt down on the bank and he prayed for them and he prayed that all men and women might grovel and whine on the ground men and women dripping clothes sticking tight watched then gurgling and sloshing in their shoes they walked back to the camp to the tents and they talked softly in wonder we been saved they said were washed white as snow we wont never sin again and the children frightened and wet whispered together we been saved we wont sin no more wisht i knowed what all the sins was so i could do em the migrant people looked humbly for pleasure on the roads chapter on saturday morning the wash tubs were crowded the women washed dresses pink ginghams and flowered cottons and they hung them in the sun and stretched the cloth to smooth it when afternoon came the whole camp quickened and the people grew excited the children caught the fever and were more noisy than usual about midafternoon child bathing began and as each child was caught subdued and washed the noise on the playground gradually subsided before five the children were scrubbed and warned about getting dirty again and they walked about stiff in clean clothes miserable with carefulness at the big openair dance platform a committee was busy every bit of electric wire had been requisitioned the city dump had been visited for wire every tool box had contributed friction tape and now the patched spliced wire was strung out to the dance floor with bottle necks as insulators this night the floor would be lighted for the first time by six oclock the men were back from work or from looking for work and a new wave of bathing started by seven dinners were over men had on their best clothes freshly washed overalls clean blue shirts sometimes the decent blacks the girls were ready in their print dresses stretched and clean their hair braided and ribboned the worried women watched the families and cleaned up the evening dishes on the platform the string band practiced surrounded by a double wall of children the people were intent and excited in the tent of ezra huston chairman the central committee of five men went into meeting huston a

and now the dusk was falling and as the darkness deepened the practicing of the string band seemed to grow louder the lights flashed on and two men inspected the patched wire to the dance floor the children crowded thickly about the musicians a boy with a guitar sang the down home blues chording delicately for himself and on his second chorus three harmonicas and a fiddle joined him from the tents the people streamed toward the platform men in their clean blue denim and women in their ginghams they came near to the platform and then stood quietly waiting their faces bright and intent under the light around the reservation there was a high wire fence and along the fence at intervals of fifty feet the guards sat in the grass and waited now the cars of the guests began to arrive small farmers and their families migrants from other camps and as each guest came through the gate he mentioned the name of the camper who had invited him the string band took a reel tune up and played loudly for they were not practicing any more in front of their tents the jesuslovers sat and watched their faces hard and contemptuous they did not speak to one another they watched for sin and their faces condemned the whole proceeding at the joad tent ruthie and winfield had bolted what little dinner they had and then they started for the platform ma called them back held up their faces with a hand under each chin and looked into their nostrils pulled their ears and looked inside and sent them to the sanitary unit to wash their hands once more they dodged around the back of the building and bolted for the platform to stand among the children closepacked about the band al finished his dinner and spent half an hour shaving with toms razor al had a tightfitting wool suit and a striped shirt and he bathed and washed and combed his straight hair back and when the washroom was vacant for a moment he smiled engagingly at himself in the mirror and he turned and tried to see himself in profile when he smiled he slipped his purple armbands on and put on his tight coat and he rubbed up his yellow shoes with a piece of toilet paper a late bather came in and al hurried out and walked recklessly toward the platform his eye peeled for girls near the dance floor he saw a pretty blond girl sitting in front of a tent he sidled near and threw open his coat to show his shirt

git along she said fiercely this here girls spoke for shes agonna be married an her mans acomin for her al winked rakishly at the girl and he tripped on striking his feet to the music and swaying his shoulders and swinging his arms and the girl looked after him intently pa put down his plate and stood up come on john he said and he explained to ma were agonna talk to some fellas about gettin work

music stopped boys and girls young men and women ran about until eight squares were ready on the big floor ready and waiting the girls held their hands in front of them and squirmed their fingers the boys tapped their feet restlessly around the floor the old folks sat smiling slightly holding the children back from the floor and in the distance the jesuslovers sat with hard condemning faces and watched the sin ma and rose of sharon sat on a bench and watched and as each boy asked rose of sharon as partner ma said no she aint well and rose of sharon blushed and her eyes were bright the caller stepped to the middle of the floor and held up his hands all ready then let her go the music snarled out chicken reel shrill and clear fiddle skirling harmonicas nasal and sharp and the guitars booming on the bass strings the caller named the turns the squares moved and they danced forward and back hands round swing your lady the caller in a frenzy tapped his feet strutted back and forth went through the figures as he called them swing your ladies an a dol ce do join hans roun an away we go the music rose and fell and the moving shoes beating in time on the platform sounded like drums swing to the right an a swing to lef break nowbreakback toback the caller sang the high vibrant monotone now the girls hair lost the careful combing now perspiration stood out on the foreheads of the boys now the experts showed the tricky intersteps and the old people on the edge of the floor took up the rhythm patted their hands softly and tapped their feet and they smiled gently and then caught one anothers eyes and nodded ma leaned her head close to rose of sharons ear maybe you wouldn think it but your pa was as nice a dancer as i ever seen when he was young and ma smiled makes me think of ol times she said and on the faces of the watchers the smiles were of old times up near muskogee twenty years ago they was a blin man with a fiddle i seen a fella oncet could slap his heels four times in one jump swedes up in dakotaknow what they do sometimes put pepper on the floor gits up the ladies skirts an makes em purty livelylively as a filly in season swedes do that sometimes in the distance the jesuslovers watched their restive children look on sin they said them folks is ridin to hell on a poker its a shame the godly got to see it and their children were silent and nervous one more roun an then a little res the caller chanted hit her hard cause were gonna stop soon and the girls were damp and flushed and they danced with open mouths and serious reverent faces and the boys flung back their long hair and pranced pointed their toes and clicked their heels in and out the squares moved crossing backing whirling and the music shrilled then suddenly it stopped the dancers stood still panting with fatigue and the children broke from restraint dashed on the floor chased one another madly ran slid stole caps and pulled hair the dancers sat down fanning themselves with their hands the members of the band got up and stretched themselves and sat down again and the guitar players worked softly over their strings now willie called choose again for another square if you can the dancers scrambled to their feet and new dancers plunged forward for partners tom stood near the three young men he saw them force their way through out on the floor toward one of the forming squares he waved his hand at willie and willie spoke to the fiddler the fiddler squawked his bow across the strings twenty young men lounged slowly across the floor the three reached the square and one of them said ill dance with this here a blond boy looked up in astonishment shes my partner listen you little sonofabitch off in the darkness a shrill whistle sounded the three were walled in now and each one felt the grip of hands and then the wall of men moved slowly off the platform willie yelped les go the music shrilled out the caller intoned the figures the feet thudded on the platform a touring car drove to the entrance the driver called open up we hear you got a riot the guard kept his position we got no riot listen to that music who are you deputy sheriffs got a warrant we dont need a warrant if theres a riot well we got no riots here said the gate guard the men in the car listened to the music and the sound of the caller and then the car pulled away and parked in a crossroad and waited in the moving squad each of the three young men was pinioned and a hand was over each mouth when they reached the darkness the group opened up tom said that sure was did nice he

thinkin maybe we ought to get up a turkey shootin club an have meetins ever sunday the men looked up at him and then down at the ground and their feet moved restlessly and they shifted their weight from one leg to the other chapter the spring is beautiful in california valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea then the first tendrils of the grapes swelling from the old gnarled vines cascade down to cover the trunks the full green hills are round and soft as breasts and on the level vegetable lands are the milelong rows of pale green lettuce and the spindly little cauliflowers the graygreen unearthly artichoke plants and then the leaves break out on the trees and the petals drop from the fruit trees and carpet the earth with pink and white the centers of the blossoms swell and grow and color cherries and apples peaches and pears figs which close the flower in the fruit all california quickens with produce and the fruit grows heavy and the limbs bend gradually under the fruit so that little crutches must be placed under them to support the weight behind the fruitfulness are men of understanding and knowledge and skill men who experiment with seed endlessly developing the techniques for greater crops of plants whose roots will resist the million enemies of the earth the molds the insects the rusts the blights these men work carefully and endlessly to perfect the seed the roots and there are the men of chemistry who spray the trees against pests who sulphur the grapes who cut out disease and rots mildews and sicknesses doctors of preventive medicine men at the borders who look for fruit flies for japanese beetle men who quarantine the sick trees and root them out and burn them men of knowledge the men who graft the young trees the little vines are the cleverest of all for theirs is a surgeons job as tender and delicate and these men must have surgeons hands and surgeons hearts to slit the bark to place the grafts to bind the wounds and cover them from the air these are great men along the rows the cultivators move tearing the spring grass and turning it under to make a fertile earth breaking the ground to hold the water up near the surface ridging the ground in little pools for the irrigation destroying the weed roots that may drink the water away from the trees and all the time the fruit swells and the flowers break out in long clusters on the vines and in the growing year the warmth grows and the leaves turn dark green the prunes lengthen like little green birds eggs and the limbs sag down against the crutches under the weight and the hard little pears take shape and the beginning of the fuzz comes out on the peaches grape blossoms shed their tiny petals and the hard little beads become green buttons and the buttons grow heavy the men who work in the fields the owners of the little orchards watch and calculate the year is heavy with produce and the men are proud for of their knowledge they can make the year heavy they have transformed the world with their knowledge the short lean wheat has been made big and productive little sour apples have grown large and sweet and that old grape that grew among the trees and fed the birds its tiny fruit has mothered a thousand varieties red and black green and pale pink purple and yellow and each variety with its own flavor the men who work in the experimental farms have made new fruits nectarines and forty kinds of plums walnuts with paper shells and always they work selecting grafting changing driving themselves driving the earth to produce and first the cherries ripen cent and a half a pound hell we cant pick em for that black cherries and red cherries full and sweet and the birds eat half of each cherry and the yellowjackets buzz into the holes the birds made and on the ground the seeds drop and dry with black shreds hanging from them the purple prunes soften and sweeten my god we cant pick them and dry and sulphur them we cant pay wages no matter what wages and the purple prunes carpet the ground and first the skins wrinkle a little and swarms of flies come to feast and the valley is filled with the odor of sweet decay the meat turns dark and the crop shrivels on the ground and the pears grow yellow and soft five dollars a ton five dollars for forty fiftypound boxes trees pruned and sprayed orchards cultivatedpick the fruit put it in boxes load the trucks deliver the fruit to the canneryforty boxes for five dollars we cant do it and the yellow fruit falls heavily to the ground and splashes on the ground the yellowjackets dig into the soft meat and there is a smell of ferment and rot then the grapeswe cant make good wine people cant buy good wine rip the grapes from the vines good grapes rotten grapes waspstung grapes press stems press dirt and rot but theres mildew and formic acid in the vats add sulphur and tannic acid the smell from the ferment is not the rich odor of wine but the smell of decay and chemicals oh well it has alcohol in it anyway they can get drunk the little farmers watched debt creep up on them like the tide they sprayed the trees and sold no crop they pruned and grafted and could not pick the crop and the men of knowledge have worked have considered and the fruit is rotting on the ground and the decaying mash in the wine vat is poisoning the air and taste the wineno grape flavor at all just sulphur and tannic acid and alcohol this little orchard will be a part of a great holding next year for the debt will have choked the owner this vineyard will belong to the bank only the great owners can survive for they own the canneries too and four pears peeled and cut in half cooked and canned still cost fifteen cents and the canned pears do not spoil they will last for years the decay spreads over the state and the sweet smell is a great sorrow on the land men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten and the failure hangs over the state like a great sorrow the works of the roots of the vines of the trees must be destroyed to keep up the price and this is the saddest bitterest thing of all carloads of oranges dumped on the ground the people came for miles to take the fruit but this could not be how would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up and men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges and they are angry at the crime angry at the people who have come to take the fruit a million people hungry needing the fruitand kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains and the smell of rot fills the country burn coffee for fuel in the ships burn corn to keep warm it makes a hot fire dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out slaughter the pigs and bury them and let the putrescence drip down into the earth there is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation there is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize there is a failure here that topples all our success the fertile earth the straight tree rows the sturdy trunks and the ripe fruit and children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange and coroners must fill in the certificatedied of malnutritionbecause the food must rot must be forced to rot the people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river and the guards hold them back they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges but the kerosene is sprayed and they stand still and watch the potatoes float by listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze and in the eyes of the people there is the failure and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath in the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy growing heavy for the vintage chapter in the weedpatch camp on an evening when the long barred clouds hung over the set sun and

insignia of their companies painted on the doors red and white gasoline trucks dragging clinking chains behind them great squaredoored vans from wholesale grocery houses delivering produce the country

back of the last car these here is our own people all of em tom said i don like this suddenly the leading policemen turned off the road into a wide graveled entrance the old cars whipped after them the motorcycles roared their motors tom saw a line of men standing in the ditch beside the road saw their mouths open as though they were yelling saw their shaking fists and their furious faces a stout woman ran toward the cars but a roaring motorcycle stood in her way a high wire gate swung open the six old cars moved through and the gate closed behind them the four motorcycles turned and sped back in the direction from which they had come and now that the motors were gone the distant yelling of the men in the ditch could be heard two men stood beside the graveled road each one carried a shotgun one called go on go on what the hell are you waiting for the six cars moved ahead turned a bend and came suddenly on the peach camp there were fifty little square flatroofed boxes each with a door and a window and the whole group in a square a water tank stood high on one edge of the camp and a little grocery store stood on the other side at the end of each row of square houses stood two men armed with shotguns and wearing big silver stars pinned to their shirts the six cars stopped two bookkeepers moved from car to car want to work tom answered sure but what is this thats not your

stood a rusty tin stove and nothing more the tin stove rested on four bricks and its rusty stovepipe went up through the roof the room smelled of sweat and grease rose of sharon stood beside ma we

street but she did not look at them her head was sunk and her dirty gingham dress was frayed at the bottom in little flags the pall had fallen on ruthie and winfield they did not dash away to inspect the place they stayed close to the truck close to the family they looked forlornly up and down the dusty street winfield found a piece of baling wire and he bent it back and forth until it broke he made a little crank of the shortest piece and turned it around and around in his hands tom and pa were carrying the mattresses into the house when a clerk appeared he wore khaki trousers and a blue shirt and a black necktie he wore silverbound eyeglasses and his eyes through the thick lenses were weak and red and the pupils were staring little bulls eyes he leaned forward to look at tom i want

of gold and red on the branches among the trees were piles of empty boxes the pickers scurried about filling their buckets from the branches putting the peaches in the boxes carrying the boxes to the checking station and at the stations where the piles of filled boxes waited for the trucks clerks waited to check against the names of the pickers heres four more the guide said to a clerk ok ever

elbows on the counter and looked after her with his surprised eyes a plump tortoise shell cat leaped up on the counter and stalked lazily near to him it rubbed sideways against his arms and he reached out with his hand and pulled it against his cheek the cat purred loudly and the tip of its tail jerked back and forth tom and al and pa and uncle john walked in from the orchard when the dusk was deep

business al said acidly im still agoin said tom they emerged from the orchard into the dusty street between the red shacks the low yellow light of kerosene lanterns shone from some of the doorways and inside in the halfgloom the black shapes of people moved about at the end of the street a guard still sat his shotgun resting against his knee tom paused as he passed the guard got a place where a fella can get a bath mister the guard studied him in the halflight at last he said see that water tank yeah well theres a hose over there any warm water say who in hell you think you are j p morgan no

potatoes bubbled the house was full of smoke and the yellow lantern light threw heavy black shadows on the walls ma worked quickly about the fire while rose of sharon sat on a box resting her heavy abdomen on her knees feelin better now ma asked smell a cookin gets me im hungry too go set in the door ma said i got to have that box to break up anyways the men trooped in meat by god said tom and

light she said she pounced at winfield and felt his hair well you got wet anyway but i bet you aint clean they wasnt no soap winfield complained no thats right i couldn buy no soap not today maybe we

all out of the frying pan she poured a little of the grease on each plate the men came in again their faces dripping and their hair shining with water leave me at her tom cried they took the plates they ate silently wolfishly and wiped up the grease with the bread the children retired into the corner of the room put their plates on the floor and knelt in front of the food like little animals tom swallowed the last of his bread got any more ma no she said thats all you made a dollar an thats a dollars worth that they charge extry out here we got to go in town when we can i aint full said tom well tomorra youll get in a full day tomorra nightwell have plenty al wiped his mouth on his sleeve guess ill take a look around he said wait ill go with you tom followed him outside in the darkness tom went close to his brother sure you don wanta come with me no im gonna look aroun like i said ok said tom he turned away and strolled down the street the smoke from the houses hung low to the ground and the lanterns threw their pictures of doorways and windows into the street on the doorsteps people sat and looked out into the darkness tom could see their heads turn as their eyes followed him down the street at the street end the dirt road continued across a stubble field and the black lumps of haycocks were visible in the starlight a thin blade of moon was low in the sky toward the west and the long cloud of the milky way trailed clearly overhead toms feet sounded softly on the dusty road a dark patch against the yellow stubble he put his hands in his pockets and trudged along toward the main gate an embankment came close to the road tom could hear the whisper of water against the grasses in the irrigation ditch he climbed up the bank and looked down on the dark water and saw the stretched reflections of the stars the state road was ahead car lights swooping past showed where it was tom set out again toward it he could see the high wire gate in the starlight a figure stirred beside the road a voice said hellowho is it tom stopped and stood still who are you a man stood up and walked near tom could see the gun in his hand then a flashlight played on his face where you think youre going well i thought id take a walk any law against it you better walk some other way tom asked cant i even get out of here not tonight you cant want to walk back or shall i whistle some help an take you hell said tom it aint nothin to me if its gonna cause a mess i dont give a darn sure ill go back the dark figure relaxed the flash went off ya see its for your own good them crazy pickets might get you what pickets them goddamn reds oh said tom i didn know bout them you seen em when you come didn you well i seen a bunch a guys but they was so many cops i didn know thought it was a accident well you better git along back thats ok with me mister he swung about and started back he walked quietly along the road a hundred yards and then he stopped and listened the twittering call of a raccoon sounded near the irrigation ditch and very far away the angry howl of a tied dog tom sat down beside the road and listened he heard the high soft laughter of a night hawk and the stealthy movement of a creeping animal in the stubble he inspected the skyline in both directions dark frames both ways nothing to show against now he stood up and walked slowly to the right of the road off into the stubble field and he walked bent down nearly as low as the haycocks he moved slowly and stopped occasionally to listen at last he came to the wire fence five strands of taut barbed wire beside the fence he lay on his back moved his head under the lowest strand held the wire up with his hands and slid himself under pushing against the ground with his feet he was about to get up when a group of men walked by on the edge of the highway tom waited until they were far ahead before he stood up and followed them he watched the side of the road for tents a few automobiles went by a stream cut across the fields and the highway crossed it on a small concrete bridge tom looked over the side of the bridge in the bottom of the deep ravine he saw a tent and a lantern was burning inside he watched it for a moment saw the shadows of people against the canvas walls tom climbed a fence and moved down into the ravine through brush and dwarf willows and in the bottom beside a tiny stream he found a trail a man sat on a box in front of the tent evenin tom said who are you welli guess wellim jus goin past know anybody here no i tell you i was jus goin past a head stuck out of the tent a voice said whats the matter casy tom cried casy for chris sake what you doin here why my god its tom joad come on in tommy come on in know him do ya the man in front asked know him christ yes knowed him for years i come west with him come on in tom he clutched toms elbow and pulled him into the tent three other men sat on the ground and in the center of the tent a lantern burned

somepin casy turned the screw the flame drew down into the slots and popped and went out casy groped outside and tom followed him what is it casy asked softly i dunno listen there was a wall of frog sounds that merged with silence a high shrill whistle of crickets but through this background came other soundsfaint footsteps from the road a crunch of clods up on the bank a little swish of brush down the stream cant really tell if you hear it fools you get nervous casy reassured them were all nervous cant really tell you hear it tom i hear it said tom yeah i hear it i think theys guys comin from ever which way we better get outa here the wizened man whispered under the bridge spanout that way hate to leave my tent les go said casy they moved quietly along the edge of the stream the black span was a cave before them casy bent over and moved through tom behind their feet slipped into the water thirty feet they moved and their breathing echoed from the curved ceiling then they came out on the other side and straightened up a sharp call there they are two flashlight beams fell on the men caught them blinded them stand where you are the voices came out of the darkness thats him that shiny bastard thats him casy stared blindly at the light he breathed heavily listen he said you fellas don know what youre doin youre helpin to starve kids shut up you red sonofabitch a short heavy man stepped into the light he carried a new white pick handle casy went on you don know what youre adoin the heavy man swung with the pick handle casy dodged down into the swing the heavy club crashed into the side of his head with a dull crunch of bone and casy fell sideways out of the light jesus george i think you killed him put the light on him said george serve the sonofabitch right the flashlight beam dropped searched and found casys crushed head tom looked down at the preacher the light crossed the heavy mans legs and the white new pick handle tom leaped silently he wrenched the club free the first time he knew he had missed and struck a shoulder but the second time his crushing blow found the head and as the heavy man sank down three more blows found his head the lights danced about there were shouts the sound of running feet crashing through brush tom stood over the prostrate man and then a club reached his head a glancing blow he felt the stroke like an electric shock and then he was running along the stream bending low he heard the splash of footsteps following him suddenly he turned and squirmed up into the brush deep into a poisonoak thicket and he lay still the footsteps came near the light beams glanced along the stream bottom tom wriggled up through the thicket to the top he emerged in an orchard and still he could hear the calls the pursuit in the stream bottom he bent low and ran over the cultivated earth the clods slipped and rolled under his feet ahead he saw the bushes that bounded the field bushes along the edges of an irrigation ditch he slipped through the fence edged in among vines and blackberry bushes and then he lay still panting hoarsely he felt his numb face and nose the nose was crushed and a trickle of blood dripped from his chin he lay still on his stomach until his mind came back and then he crawled slowly over the edge of the ditch he bathed his face in the cool water tore off the tail of his blue shirt and dipped it and held it against his torn cheek and nose the water stung and burned the black cloud had crossed the sky a blob of dark against the stars the night was quiet again tom stepped into the water and felt the bottom drop from under his feet he threshed the two strokes across the ditch and pulled himself heavily up the other bank his clothes clung to him he moved and made a slopping noise his shoes squished then he sat down took off his shoes and emptied them he wrung the bottoms of his trousers took off his coat and squeezed the water from it along the highway he saw the dancing beams of the flashlights searching the ditches tom put on his shoes and moved cautiously across the stubble field the squishing noise no longer came from his shoes he went by instinct toward the other side of the stubble field and at last he came to the road very cautiously he approached the square of houses once a guard thinking he heard a noise called whos there tom dropped and froze to the ground and the flashlight beam passed over him he crept silently to the door of the joad house the door squalled on its hinges and mas voice calm and steady and wide awake whats that me tom well you better get some sleep al aint in yet he must a foun a girl go on to sleep she said softly over under the window he found his place and took off his clothes to the skin he lay shivering under his blanket and his torn face awakened from its numbness and his whole head throbbed it was an hour more before al came in he moved cautiously near and stepped on toms wet clothes sh said tom al whispered you awake howd you get wet sh said tom tell you in the mornin pa turned on his back and his snoring filled the room with gasps and snorts youre col al said sh go to sleep the little square of the window showed gray against the black of the room tom did not sleep the nerves of his wounded face came back to life and throbbed and his cheek bone ached and his broken nose bulged and pulsed with pain that seemed to toss him about to shake him he watched the little square window saw the stars slide down over it and drop from sight at intervals he heard the footsteps of the watchmen at last the roosters crowed far away and gradually the window lightened tom touched his swollen face with his fingertips and at his movement al groaned and murmured in his sleep the dawn came finally in the houses packed together there was a sound of movement a crash of breaking sticks a little clatter of pans in the graying gloom ma sat up suddenly tom could see her face swollen with sleep she looked at the window for a long moment and then she threw the blanket off and found her dress still sitting down she put it over her head and held her arms up and let the dress slide down to her waist she stood up and pulled the dress down around her ankles then in bare feet she stepped carefully to the window and looked out and while she stared at the growing light her quick fingers unbraided her hair and smoothed the strands and braided them up again then she clasped her hands in front of her and stood motionless for a moment her face was lighted sharply by the window she turned stepped carefully among the mattresses and found the lantern the shade screeched up and she lighted the wick pa rolled over and blinked at her she said pa you got more money huh yeah paper wrote for sixty cents well git up an go buy some flour an lard quick now pa yawned maybe the store aint open make em open it got to get somepin in you fellas you got to get out to work pa struggled into his overalls and put on his rusty coat he went sluggishly out the door yawning and stretching the children awakened and watched from under their blanket like mice pale light filled the room now but colorless light before the sun ma glanced at the mattresses uncle john was awake al slept heavily her eyes moved to tom for a moment she peered at him and then she moved quickly to him his face was puffed and blue and the blood was dried black on his lips and chin the edges of the torn cheek were gathered and tight tom she whispered whats the matter sh he said dont talk loud i got in a fight tom i couldn help it ma she knelt

hammer on halfcock and then he went back to his mattress he laid the rifle on the floor beside him stock up and barrel pointing down rose of sharons voice thinned to a whimper tom lay down again and

removed up to the big sliding doors slatted planks ran for catwalks they made good houses watertight and draftless room for twentyfour families one family in each end of each car no windows but the wide doors stood open in some of the cars a canvas hung down in the center of the car while in others only the position of the door made the boundary the joads had one end of an end car some previous occupant had fitted up an oil can with a stovepipe had made a hole in the wall for the stovepipe even with the wide door open it was dark in the ends of the car ma hung the tarpaulin across the middle of the car its nice she said its almost nicer than anything we had cept the govment camp each night she unrolled the mattresses on the floor and each morning rolled them up again and every day they went into the fields and picked the cotton and every night they had meat on a saturday they drove into tulare and they bought a tin stove and new overalls for al and pa and winfield and uncle john and they bought a dress for ma and gave mas best dress to rose of sharon shes so big ma said jus a waste of good money to get her a new dress now the joads had been lucky they got in early enough to have a place in the boxcars now the tents of the latecomers filled the little flat and those who had the boxcars were oldtimers and in a way aristocrats the narrow stream slipped by out of the willows and back into the willows again from each car a hardbeaten path went down to the stream between the cars the clothes lines hung and every day the lines were covered with drying clothes in the evening they walked back from the fields carrying their folded cotton bags under their arms they went into the store which stood at the crossroads and there were many pickers in the store buying their supplies how much today were doin fine we made three and a half today wisht shed keep up them kids is gettin to be good pickers mas worked em up a little bag for each they couldn tow a growedup bag dump into ours

she held up the boxes jerked them up and down to make them attractive now you put them back the tragedy began to form in ruthies eyes pa said theyre ony a nickel apiece them little fellas worked good today well the excitement began to steal into ruthies eyes awright ruthie turned and fled halfway to the door she caught winfield and rushed him out the door into the evening uncle john fingered a pair of canvas gloves with yellow leather palms tried them on and took them off and laid them down he moved gradually to the liquor shelves and he stood studying the labels on the bottles ma saw him

frightened winfield triumphantly followed her ruthie looked fiercely about but she went to a corner of the car and put her back in the corner her shame and fierceness were blended i tol her what you done winfield said ma was putting two chops and some fried potatoes on a tin plate hush winfiel she said they aint no need to hurt her feelings no moren what theyre hurt ruthies body hurtled across the car she grabbed ma around the middle and buried her head in mas stomach and her strangled sobs shook her whole body ma tried to loosen her but the grubby fingers clung tight ma brushed the hair on

and he put himself in a good position of defense for ruthie would attack him at the first opportunity and he knew it ruthie went quietly heartbrokenly to the other side of the car ma put a sheet of newspaper over the tin plate im agoin now she said aint you gonna eat nothin yourself uncle john demanded later when i come back i wouldn want nothin now ma walked to the open door she steadied herself down the steep cleated catwalk on the stream side of the boxcars the tents were pitched close together their guy ropes crossing one another and the pegs of one at the canvas line of the next the lights shone through the cloth and all the chimneys belched smoke men and women stood in the doorways talking children ran feverishly about ma moved majestically down the line of tents here and there she was recognized as she went by evenin mis joad evenin takin somepin out mis joad theys a frien im takin back some bread she came at last to the end of the line of tents she stopped and looked back a glow of light was on the camp and the soft overtone of a multitude of speakers now and then a harsher voice cut through the smell of smoke filled the air someone played a harmonica softly trying for an effect one phrase over and over ma stepped in among the willows beside the stream she moved off the trail and waited silently listening to hear any possible follower a man walked down the trail toward the camp boosting his suspenders and buttoning his jeans as he went ma sat very still and he passed on without seeing her she waited five minutes and then she stood up and crept on up the trail beside the stream she moved quietly so quietly that she could hear the murmur of the water above her soft steps on the willow leaves trail and stream swung to the left and then to the right again until they neared the highway in the gray starlight she could see the embankment and the black round hole of the culvert where she always left toms food she moved forward cautiously thrust her package into the hole and took back the empty tin plate which was left there she crept back among the willows forced her way into a thicket and sat down to wait through the tangle she could see the black hole of the culvert she clasped her knees and sat silently in a few moments the thicket crept to life again the field mice moved cautiously over the leaves a skunk padded heavily and unselfconsciously down the trail carrying a faint effluvium with him and then a wind stirred the willows delicately as though it tested them and a shower of golden leaves coasted down to the ground suddenly a gust boiled in and racked the trees and a cricking downpour of leaves fell ma could feel them on her hair and on her shoulders over the sky a plump black cloud moved erasing the stars the fat drops of rain scattered down splashing loudly on the fallen leaves and the cloud moved on and unveiled the stars again ma shivered the wind blew past and left the thicket quiet but the rushing of the trees went on down the stream from back at the camp came the thin penetrating tone of a violin feeling about for a tune ma heard a stealthy step among the leaves far to her left and she grew tense she released her knees and straightened her head the better to hear the movement stopped and after a long moment began again a vine rasped harshly on the dry leaves ma saw a dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the culvert the black round hole was obscured for a moment and then the figure moved back she called softly tom the figure stood still so still so low to the ground that it might have been a stump she called again tom oh tom then the figure moved that you ma right over here she stood up and went to meet him you shouldn of came he said i got to see you tom i got to talk to you its near the trail he said somebody might come by aint you got a place tom yeahbut ifwell spose somebody seen you with mewhole famblyd be in a jam i got to tom then come along come quiet he crossed the little stream wading carelessly through the water and ma followed him he moved through the brush out into a field on the other side of the thicket and along the plowed ground the blackening stems of the cotton were harsh against the ground and a few fluffs of cotton clung to the stems a quarter of a mile they went along the edge of the field and then he turned into the brush again he approached a great mound of wild blackberry bushes leaned over and pulled a mat of vines aside you got to crawl in he said ma went down on her hands and knees she felt sand under her and then the black inside of the mound no longer touched her and she felt toms blanket on the ground he arranged the vines in place again it was lightless in the cave where are you ma here right here talk soft tom dont worry i been livin like a rabbit some time she heard him unwrap his tin plate pork chops she said and fry potatoes god awmighty an still warm ma could not see him at all in the blackness but she could hear him chewing tearing at the meat and swallowing its a pretty good hideout he said ma said uneasily tomruthie tol about you she heard him gulp ruthie what for well it wasn her fault got in a fight an says her brotherll lick that other girls brother you know how they do an she tol that her brother killed a man an was hidin tom was chuckling with me i was always gonna get uncle john after em but he never would do it thats jus kid talk ma thats awright no it aint ma said them kidsll tell it aroun an then the folksll hear an theyll tell aroun an pretty soon well they liable to get men

scared for you i aint seen you cant see you now hows your face gettin well quick come clost tom let me feel it come clost he crawled near her reaching hand found his head in the blackness and her fingers moved down to his nose and then over his left cheek you got a bad scar tom an your nose is all crooked maybe thats a good thing nobody wouldnt know me maybe if my prints wasnt on record id be glad he went back to his eating hush she said listen its the wind ma jus the wind the gust poured down the stream and the trees rustled under its passing she crawled close to his voice i wanta touch ya again tom its like im blin its so dark i wanta remember even if its ony my fingers that remember you got to go away tom yeah i knowed it from the start we made purty good she said i been squirrelin money away hol out your han tom i got seven dollars here i aint gonna take ya money he said ill get long all right hol out ya han tom i aint gonna sleep none if you got no money maybe you got to take

thinkin about casy he talked a lot used ta bother me but now i been thinkin what he said an i can rememberall of it says one time he went out in the wilderness to find his own soul an he foun he didn have no soul that was hisn says he foun he jus got a little piece of a great big soul says a wilderness aint no good cause his little piece of a soul wasnt no good less it was with the rest an was whole funny how i remember didn think i was even listenin but i know now a fella aint no good alone he was a good man ma said tom went on he spouted out some scripture once an it didn soun like no hellfire scripture he tol it twicet an i remember it says its from the preacher hows it go tom goes two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lif up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up thats part of her go on ma said go on tom jus a little bit more again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken an thats scripture casy said it was called it the preacher hushlisten ony the wind ma i know the wind an i got to thinkin mamost of the preachin is about the poor we shall have always with us an if you got nothin why jus fol your hands an to hell with it you gonna git ice cream on gol plates when youre dead an then this here preacher says two get a better reward for their work tom she said what you aimin to do he was quiet for a long time i been thinkin how it was in that govment camp how our folks took care a theirselves an if they was a fight they fixed it theirself an they wasnt no cops wagglin their guns but they was better order than them cops ever give i been awonderin why we cant do that all over throw out the cops that aint our people all work together for our own thingall farm our own lan tom ma repeated what you gonna do what casy done he said but they killed him yeah said tom he didn duck quick enough he wasn doing nothin against the law ma i been thinkin a hell of a lot thinkin about our people livin like pigs an the good rich lan layin fallow or maybe one fella with a million acres while a hunderd thousan good farmers is starvin an i been wonderin if all our folks got together an yelled like them fellas

gonna know bout you they might kill ya an i wouldn know they might hurt ya howm i gonna know tom laughed uneasily well maybe like casy says a fella aint got a soul of his own but ony a piece of a big onean then then what tom then it don matter then ill be all aroun in the dark ill be everwherewherever you look wherever theys a fight so hungry people can eat ill be there wherever theys a cop beatin up a guy ill be there if casy knowed why ill be in the way guys yell when theyre mad anill be in the way kids laugh when theyre hungry an they know suppers ready an when our folks eat the stuff they

neither said tom its jus stuff i been thinkin about get thinkin a lot when you aint movin aroun you got to get back ma you take the money then he was silent for a moment awright he said an tom laterwhen its blowed over youll come back youll find us sure he said now you better go here gimme your han he guided her toward the entrance her fingers clutched his wrist he swept the vines aside and followed her out go up to the field till you come to a sycamore on the edge an then cut acrost the stream goodby goodby she said and she walked quickly away her eyes were wet and burning but she did not cry her footsteps were loud and careless on the leaves as she went through the brush and as she went out of the dim sky the rain began to fall big drops and few splashing on the dry leaves heavily ma stopped and stood still in the dripping thicket she turned abouttook three steps back toward the mound of vines and then she turned quickly and went back toward the boxcar camp she went straight out to the culvert and climbed up on the road the rain had passed now but the sky was overcast behind her on the road she heard footsteps and she turned nervously the blinking of a dim flashlight played on the road ma turned back and started for home in a moment a man caught up with her politely he kept his light on the ground and did not play it in her face evenin he said ma said howdy looks

whywell look ill bring some sugar well put sugar in them pancakes ma broke twigs into the stove and the coals from the dinner cooking started them blazing ruthie and winfield came out of their bed like hermit crabs from shells for a moment they were careful they watched to see whether they were still criminals when no one noticed them they grew bold ruthie hopped all the way to the door and back on one foot without touching the wall ma was pouring flour into a bowl when rose of sharon climbed the catwalk she steadied herself and advanced cautiously whats the matter she asked why its news ma cried were gonna have a little party count a al an aggie wainwright is gonna get married rose of sharon stood perfectly still she looked slowly at al who stood there flustered and embarrassed mrs wainwright shouted from the other end of the car im puttin a fresh dress on aggie ill be right over rose of sharon turned slowly she went back to the wide door and she crept down the catwalk once on the ground she moved slowly toward the stream and the trail that went beside it she took the way ma had gone earlierinto the willows the wind blew more steadily now and the bushes whished steadily rose of sharon went down on her knees and crawled deep into the brush the berry vines cut her face and pulled at her hair but she didnt mind only when she felt the bushes touching her all over did she stop she stretched out on her back and she felt the weight of the baby inside of her in the lightless car ma stirred and then she pushed the blanket back and got up at the open door of the car the gray starlight penetrated a little ma walked to the door and stood looking out the stars were paling in the east the wind blew softly over the willow thickets and from the little stream came the quiet talking of the water most of the camp was still asleep but in front of one tent a little fire burned and people were standing about it warming themselves ma could see them in the light of the new dancing fire as they stood facing the flames rubbing their hands and then they turned their backs and held their hands behind them for a long moment ma looked out and she held her hands clasped in front of her the uneven wind whisked up and passed and a bite of frost was in the air ma shivered and rubbed her hands together she crept back and fumbled for the matches beside the lantern the shade screeched up she lighted the wick watched it burn blue for a moment and then put up its yellow delicately curved ring of light she carried the lantern to the stove and set it down while she broke the brittle dry willowy twigs into the fire box in a moment the fire was roaring up the chimney rose of sharon rolled heavily over and sat up ill git right up she said whynt you lay a minute till it warms ma asked no ill git ma filled the coffee pot from the bucket and set it on the stove and she put on the frying pan deep with fat to get hot for the pones whats over you she said softly im agoin out

get your sacks ruthie don you forget them shirts i fixed for you to pick in wainwrights and joads climbed into the truck in the dark the dawn was coming but it was slow and pale turn lef ma told al theyll be a sign out where were goin they drove along the dark road and other cars followed them and behind in the camp the cars were being started the families piling in and the cars pulled out on the highway and turned left a piece of cardboard was tied to a mailbox on the righthand side of the road and on it printed with blue crayon cotton pickers wanted al turned into the entrance and drove out to the barnyard and the barnyard was full of cars already an electric globe on the end of the white barn lighted a group of men and women standing near the scales their bags rolled under their arms some of the women wore the bags over their shoulders and crossed in front we aint so early as we thought said al he pulled the truck against a fence and parked the families climbed down and went to join the waiting group and more cars came in from the road and parked and more families joined the group under the light on the barn end the owner signed them in hawley he said hawley how many four will will benton benton amelia amelia claire claire whos next carpenter how many six he wrote them in the book with a space left for the weights got your bags i got a few cost you a dollar and the cars poured into the yard the owner pulled his sheeplined leather jacket up around his throat he looked at the driveway apprehensively this twenty isnt gonna take long to pick with all these people he said children were climbing into the big cotton trailer digging their toes into the chickenwire sides git off there the owner cried come on down youll tear that wire loose and the children climbed slowly down embarrassed and silent the gray dawn came ill have to take a tare for dew the owner said change it when the sun comes out all right go out when you want light enough to see the people moved quickly out into the cotton field and took their rows they tied the bags to their waists and they slapped their hands together to warm stiff fingers that had to be nimble the dawn colored over the eastern hills and the wide line moved over the rows and from the highway the cars still moved in and parked in the barnyard until it was full and they parked along the road on both sides the wind blew briskly across the field i dont know how you all found out the owner said there must be a hell of a grapevine the twenty wont last till noon what name hume how many the line of people moved out across the field and the strong steady west wind blew their clothes their fingers flew to the spilling bolls and flew to the long sacks growing heavy behind them pa spoke to the man in the row to his right back home we might get rain out of a wind like this seems a little mite frosty for rain how long you been out here he kept his eyes down on his work as he spoke his neighbor didnt look up i been here nearly a year would you say it was gonna rain cant tell an that aint no insult neither folks that lived here all their life cant tell if the rain can git in the way of a crop itll rain thas what they say out here pa looked quickly at the western hills big gray clouds were coasting over the ridge riding the wind swiftly them looks like rainheads he said his neighbor stole a squinting look cant tell he said and all down the line of rows the people looked back at the clouds and then they bent lower to their work and their hands flew to the cotton they raced at the picking raced against time and cotton weight raced against the rain and against each otheronly so much cotton to pick only so much money to be made they came to the other side of the field and ran to get a new row and now they faced into the wind and they could see the high gray clouds moving over the sky toward the rising sun and more cars parked along the roadside and new pickers came to be checked in the line of people moved frantically across the field weighed at the end marked their cotton checked the weights into their own books and ran for new rows at eleven oclock the field was picked and the work was done the wiresided trailers were hooked on behind wiresided trucks and they moved out to the highway and drove away to the gin the cotton fluffed out through the chicken wire and little clouds of cotton blew through the air and rags of cotton caught and waved on the weeds beside the road the pickers clustered disconsolately back to the barnyard and stood in line to be paid off hume james twentytwo cents ralph thirty cents joad thomas ninety cents winfield fifteen cents the money lay in rolls silver and nickels and pennies and each man looked in his own book as he was being paid wainwright agnes thirtyfour cents tobin sixtythree cents the line moved past slowly the families went back to their cars silently and they drove slowly away joads and wainwrights waited in the truck for the driveway to clear and as they waited the first drops of rain began to fall al put his hand out of the cab to feel them rose of sharon sat in the middle and ma on the outside the girls eyes were lusterless again you shouldn of came ma said you didn pick moren tenfifteen pounds rose of sharon looked down at her great bulging belly and she didnt reply she shivered suddenly and held her head high ma watching her closely unrolled her cotton bag spread it over rose of sharons shoulders and drew her close at last the way was clear al started his motor and drove out into the highway the big infrequent drops of rain lanced down and splashed on the road and as the truck moved along the drops became smaller and close rain pounded on the cab of the truck so loudly that it could be heard over the pounding of the old worn motor on the truck bed the wainwrights and joads spread their cotton bags over their heads and shoulders rose of sharon shivered violently against mas arm and ma cried go faster al rosasharn got a chill gotta get her feet in hot water al speeded the pounding motor and when he came to the boxcar camp he drove down close to the red cars ma was spouting orders before they were well stopped al she commanded you an john an pa go into the willows an clect all the dead stuff you can we got to keep warm wonder if the roof leaks no i don think so be nice an dry but we got to have wood got to keep warm take ruthie an winfiel too they can get twigs this here girl aint well ma got out and rose of sharon tried to follow but her knees buckled and she sat down heavily on the running board fat mrs wainwright saw her whats a matter her time come no i don think so said ma got a chill maybe took col gimme a han will you the two women supported rose of sharon after a few steps her strength came backher legs took her weight im awright ma she said it was jus a minute there the older women kept hands on her elbows feet in hot water ma said wisely they helped her up the catwalk and into the boxcar you rub her mrs wainwright said ill get a far goin she used the last of the twigs and built up a blaze in the stove the rain poured now scoured at the roof of the car ma looked up at it thank god we got a tight roof she said them tents leaks no matter how good jus put on a little water mis wainwright rose of sharon lay still on a mattress she let them take off her shoes and rub her feet mrs wainwright bent over her you got pain she demanded no jus don feel good jus feel bad i got pain killer an salts mrs wainwright said youre welcome to em if you want em perfecly welcome the girl shivered violently cover me up ma im col ma brought all the blankets and piled them on top of her the rain roared down on the roof now the woodgatherers returned their arms piled high with sticks and their hats and coats dripping jesus shes wet pa said soaks you in a minute ma said better go back an get more burns up awful quick be dark purty soon ruthie and winfield dripped in and threw their sticks on the pile they turned to go again you stay ma ordered stan up close to the fire an get dry the afternoon was silver with rain the roads glittered with water hour by hour the cotton plants seemed to blacken and shrivel pa and al and uncle john made trip after trip into the thickets and brought back loads of dead wood they piled it near the door until the heap of it nearly reached the ceiling and at last they stopped and walked toward the stove streams of water ran from their hats to their shoulders the edges of their coats dripped and their shoes squished as they walked awright now get off them clothes ma said i got some nice coffee for you fellas an you got dry overhalls to put on don stan there the evening came early in the boxcars the families huddled together listening to the pouring water on the roofs chapter over the high coast mountains and over the valleys the gray clouds marched in from the ocean the wind blew fiercely and silently high in the air and it swished in the brush and it roared in the forests the clouds came in brokenly in puffs in folds in gray crags and they piled in together and settled low over the west and then the wind stopped and left the clouds deep and solid the rain began with gusty showers pauses and downpours and then gradually it settled to a single tempo small drops and a steady beat rain that was gray to see through rain that cut midday light to evening and at first the dry earth sucked the moisture down and blackened for two days the earth drank the rain until the earth was full then puddles formed and in the low places little lakes formed in the fields the muddy lakes rose higher and the steady rain whipped the shining water at last the mountains were full and the hillsides spilled into the streams built them to freshets and sent them roaring down the canyons into the valleys the rain beat on steadily and the streams and the little rivers edged up to the bank sides and worked at willows and tree roots bent the willows deep in the current cut out the roots of cottonwoods and brought down the trees the muddy water whirled along the bank sides and crept up the banks until at last it spilled over into the fields into the orchards into the cotton patches where the black stems stood level fields became lakes broad and gray and the rain whipped up the surfaces then the water poured over the highways and cars moved slowly cutting the water ahead and leaving a boiling muddy wake behind the earth whispered under the beat of the rain and the streams thundered under the churning freshets when the first rain started the migrant people huddled in their tents saying itll soon be over and asking how longs it likely to go on and when the puddles formed the men went out in the rain with shovels and built little dikes around the tents the beating rain worked at the canvas until it penetrated and sent streams down and then the little dikes washed out and the water came inside and the streams wet the beds and the blankets the people sat in wet clothes they set up boxes and put planks on the boxes then day and night they sat on the planks beside the tents the old cars stood and water fouled the ignition wires and water fouled the carburetors the little gray tents stood in lakes and at last the people had to move then the cars wouldnt start because the wires were shorted and if the engines would run deep mud engulfed the wheels and the people waded away carrying their wet blankets in their arms they splashed along carrying the children carrying the very old in their arms and if a barn stood on high ground it was filled with people shivering and hopeless then some went to the relief offices and they came sadly back to their own people theys rulesyou got to be here a year before you can git relief they say the govment is gonna help they don know when and gradually the greatest terror of all came along they aint gonna be no kinda work for three months in the barns the people sat huddled together and the terror came over them and their faces were gray with terror the children cried with hunger and there was no food then the sickness came pneumonia and measles that went to the eyes and to the mastoids and the rain fell steadily and the water flowed over the highways for the culverts could not carry the water then from the tents from the crowded barns groups of sodden men went out their clothes slopping rags their shoes muddy pulp they splashed out through the water to the towns to the country stores to the relief offices to beg for food to cringe and beg for food to beg for relief to try to steal to lie and under the begging and under the cringing a hopeless anger began to smolder and in the little towns pity for the sodden men changed to anger and anger at the hungry people changed to fear of them then sheriffs swore in deputies in droves and orders were rushed for rifles for tear gas for ammunition then the hungry men crowded the alleys behind the stores to beg for bread to beg for rotting vegetables to steal when they could frantic men pounded on the doors of the doctors and the doctors were busy and sad men left word at country stores for the coroner to send a car the coroners were not too busy the coroners wagons backed up through the mud and took out the dead and the rain pattered relentlessly down and the streams broke their banks and spread out over the country huddled under sheds lying in wet hay the hunger and the fear bred anger then boys went out not to beg but to steal and men went out weakly to try to steal the sheriffs swore in new deputies and ordered new rifles and the comfortable people in tight houses felt pity at first and then distaste and finally hatred for the migrant people in the wet hay of leaking barns babies were born to women who panted with pneumonia and old people curled up in corners and died that way so that the coroners could not straighten them at night the frantic men walked boldly to hen roosts and carried off the squawking chickens if they were shot at they did not run but splashed sullenly away and if they were hit they sank tiredly in the mud the rain stopped on the fields the water stood reflecting the gray sky and the land whispered with moving water and the men came out of the barns out of the sheds they squatted on their hams and looked out over the flooded land and they were silent and sometimes they talked very quietly no work till spring no work and if no workno money no food fella had a team of horses had to use em to plow an cultivate an mow wouldn think a turnin em out to starve when they wasnt workin thems horseswere men the women watched the men watched to see whether the break had come at last the women stood silently and watched and where a number of men gathered together the fear went from their faces and anger took its place and the women sighed with relief for they knew it was all rightthe break had not come and the break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath tiny points of grass came through the earth and in a few days the hills were pale green with the beginning year chapter in the boxcar camp the water stood in puddles and the rain splashed in the mud gradually the little stream crept up the bank toward the low flat where the boxcars stood on the second day of the rain al took the tarpaulin down from the middle of the car he carried it out and spread it on the nose of the truck and he came back into the car and sat down on his mattress now without the separation the two families in the car were one the men sat together and their spirits were damp ma kept a little fire going in the stove kept a few twigs burning and she conserved her wood the rain poured down on the nearly flat roof of the boxcar on the third day the wainwrights grew restless maybe we better go long mrs wainwright said and ma tried to keep them whered you go an be sure of a tight roof i dunno but i got a feelin we oughta go along they argued together and ma watched al ruthie and winfield tried to play for a while and then they too relapsed into sullen inactivity and the rain drummed down on the roof on the third day the sound of the stream could be heard above the drumming rain pa and uncle john stood in the open door and looked out on the rising stream at both ends of the camp the water ran near to the highway but at the camp it looped away so that the highway embankment surrounded the camp at the back and the stream closed it in on the front and pa said hows it look to you john seems to me if that crick comes up shell flood us uncle john opened his mouth and rubbed his bristling chin yeah he said might at that rose of sharon was down with a heavy cold her face flushed and her eyes shining with fever ma sat beside her with a cup of hot milk here she said take this here got bacon grease in it for strength here drink it rose of sharon shook her head weakly i aint hungry pa drew a curved line in the air with his finger if we was all to get our shovels an throw up a bank i bet we could keep her out ony have to go from up there down to there yeah uncle john agreed might dunno if them other fellasd wanta they maybe ruther move somewheres else but these here cars is dry pa insisted couldn find no dry place as good as this you wait from the pile of brush in the car he picked a twig he ran down the catwalk splashed through the mud to the stream and he set his twig upright on the edge of the swirling water in a moment he was back in the car jesus ya get wet through he said both men kept their eyes on the little twig on the waters edge they saw the water move slowly up around it and creep up the bank pa squatted down in the doorway comin up fast he said i think we oughta go talk to the other fellas see if theyll help ditch up got to git outa here if they wont pa looked down the long car to the wainwright end al was with them sitting beside aggie pa walked into their precinct waters

then she stood up mis wainwright she called oh mis wainwright the fat little woman came down the car want me look ma pointed at rose of sharons face her teeth were clamped on her lower lip and her

only eight shovels he hurried to the lower part of the bank and drove his shovel into the mud the shovelful lifted with a sucking sound he drove it again and threw the mud into the low place on the stream bank and beside him the other men ranged themselves they heaped the mud up in a long embankment and those who had no shovels cut live willow whips and wove them in a mat and kicked them into the bank over the men came a fury of work a fury of battle when one man dropped the shovel another took it up they had shed their coats and hats their shirts and trousers clung tightly to their bodies their shoes were shapeless blobs of mud a shrill scream came from the joad car the men stopped listened uneasily and then plunged to work again and the little levee of earth extended until it connected with the highway embankment on either end they were tired now and the shovels moved more slowly and the stream rose slowly it edged above the place where the first dirt had been thrown pa laughed in triumph shed come over if we hadn a built up he cried the stream rose slowly up the side of the new wall and tore at the willow mat higher pa cried we got to git her higher the evening came and the work went on and now the men were beyond weariness their faces were set and dead they worked jerkily like machines when it was dark the women set lanterns in the car doors and kept pots of coffee handy and the women ran one by one to the joad car and wedged themselves inside the pains were coming close now twenty minutes apart and rose of sharon had lost her restraint she screamed fiercely under the fierce pains and the neighbor women looked at her and patted her gently and went back to their own cars ma had a good fire going now and all her utensils filled with water sat on the stove to heat every little while pa looked in the car door all right he asked yeah i think so ma assured him as it grew dark someone brought out a flashlight to work by uncle john plunged on throwing mud on top of the wall you take it easy pa said youll kill yaself i cant hep it i cant stan that yellin its likeits like when i know pa said but jus take it easy uncle john blubbered ill run away by god i got to work or ill run away pa turned from him hows she stan on the last marker the man with the flashlight threw the beam on the stick the rain cut whitely through the light comin up shell come up slower now pa said got to flood purty far on the other side shes comin up though the women filled the coffee pots and set them out again and as the night went on the men moved slower and slower and they lifted their heavy feet like draft horses more mud on the levee more willows interlaced the rain fell steadily when the flashlight turned on faces the eyes showed staring and the muscles on the cheeks were welted out for a long time the screams continued from the car and at last they were still pa said mad call me if it was bore he went on shoveling the mud sullenly the stream eddied and boiled against the bank then from up the stream there came a ripping crash the beam of the flashlight showed a great cottonwood toppling the men stopped to watch the branches of the tree sank into the water and edged around with the current while the stream dug out the little roots slowly the tree was freed and slowly it edged down the stream the weary men watched their mouths hanging open the tree moved slowly down then a branch caught on a stump snagged and held and very slowly the roots swung around and hooked themselves on the new embankment the water piled up behind the tree moved and tore the bank a little stream slipped through pa threw himself forward and jammed mud in the break the water piled against the tree and then the bank washed quickly down washed around ankles around knees the men broke and ran and the current worked smoothly into the flat under the cars under the automobiles uncle john saw the water break through in the murk he could see it uncontrollably his weight pulled him down he went to his knees and the tugging water swirled about his chest pa saw him go hey whats the matter he lifted him to his feet you sick come on the cars is high uncle john gathered his strength i dunno he said apologetically legs give out jus give out pa helped him along toward the cars when the dike swept over al turned and ran his feet moved heavily the water was about his calves when he reached the truck he flung the tarpaulin off the nose and jumped into the car he stepped on the starter the engine turned over and over and there was no bark of the motor he choked the engine deeply the battery turned the sodden motor more and more slowly and there was no cough over and over slower and slower al set the spark high he felt under the seat for the crank and jumped out the water was higher than the running board he ran to the front end crank case was under water now frantically he fitted the crank and twisted around and around and his clenched hand on the crank splashed in the slowly flowing water at each turn at last his frenzy gave out the motor was full of water the battery fouled by now on slightly higher ground two cars were started and their lights on they floundered in the mud and dug their wheels down until finally the drivers cut off the motors and sat still looking into the headlight beams and the rain whipped white streaks through the lights al went slowly around the truck reached in and turned off the ignition when pa reached the catwalk he found the lower end floating he stepped it down into the mud under water think ya can make it awright john he asked ill be awright jus go on pa cautiously climbed the catwalk and squeezed himself in the narrow opening the two lamps were turned low ma sat on the mattress beside rose of sharon and ma fanned her still face with a piece of cardboard mrs wainwright poked dry brush into the stove and a dank smoke edged out around the lids and filled the car with a smell of burning tissue ma looked up at pa when he entered and then quickly down howis she pa asked ma did not look up at him again awright i think sleepin the air was fetid and close with the smell of the birth uncle john clambered in and held himself upright against the side of the car mrs wainwright left her work and came to pa she pulled him by the elbow toward the corner of the car she picked up a lantern and held it over an apple box in the corner on a newspaper lay a blue shriveled little mummy never breathed said mrs wainwright softly never was alive uncle john turned and shuffled tiredly down the car to the dark end the rain whished softly on the roof now so softly that they could hear uncle johns tired sniffling from the dark pa looked up at mrs wainwright he took the lantern from her hand and put it on the floor ruthie and winfield were asleep on their own mattress their arms over their eyes to cut out the light pa walked slowly to rose of sharons mattress he tried to squat down but his legs were too tired he knelt instead ma fanned her square of cardboard back and forth she looked at pa for a moment and her eyes were wide and staring like a sleepwalkers eyes pa said wedonewhat we could i know

in the corner wheres the baby ruthie demanded ma wet her lips there aint no baby they never was no baby we was wrong shucks ruthie yawned i wisht it had a been a baby mrs wainwright sat down beside ma and took the cardboard from her and fanned the air ma folded her hands in her lap and her tired eyes never left the face of rose of sharon sleeping in exhaustion come on mrs wainwright said jus lay down youll be right beside her why youd wake up if she took a deep breath even awright i will ma stretched out on the mattress beside the sleeping girl and mrs wainwright sat on the floor and kept watch pa and al and uncle john sat in the car doorway and watched the steely dawn come the rain had stopped but the sky was deep and solid with cloud as the light came it was reflected on the water the men could see the current of the stream slipping swiftly down bearing black branches of trees boxes boards the water swirled into the flat where the boxcars stood there was no sign of the embankment left on the flat the current stopped the edges of the flood were lined with yellow foam pa leaned out the door and placed a twig on the catwalk just above the water line the men watched the water slowly climb to it lift it gently and float it away pa placed another twig an inch above the water and settled back to watch think itll come inside the car al asked cant tell theys a hell of a lot of water got to come down from the hills yet cant tell might start up to rain again al said i been athinkin if she come in everthingll get soaked yeah well she wont come up moren threefour feet in

away from the catwalk pa placed another one higher up sure climbin he said i guess we better do that ma turned restlessly in her sleep her eyes started wide open she cried sharply in warning tom oh tom tom mrs wainwright spoke soothingly the eyes flicked closed again and ma squirmed under her dream mrs wainwright got up and walked to the doorway hey she said softly we aint gonna git out soon she pointed to the corner of the car where the apple box was that aint doin no good jus cause trouble and sorra couldn you fellas kindatake it out an bury it the men were silent pa said at last guess

right behin you pa said uncle john took the shovel in one hand he slipped out the doorway into the slowly moving water and it rose nearly to his waist before he struck bottom he turned and settled the apple box under his other arm pa said come on al les git that lumber in in the gray dawn light uncle john waded around the end of the car past the joad truck and he climbed the slippery bank to the highway he walked down the highway past the boxcar flat until he came to a place where the boiling stream ran close to the road where the willows grew along the road side he put his shovel down and holding the box in front of him he edged through the brush until he came to the edge of the swift stream for a time he stood watching it swirl by leaving its yellow foam among the willow stems he held the apple box against his chest and then he leaned over and set the box in the stream and steadied it with his hand he said fiercely go down an tell em go down in the street an rot an tell em that way thats the way you can talk don even know if you was a boy or a girl aint gonna find out go on down now an lay in the street maybe theyll know then he guided the box gently out into the current and let it go it settled low in the water edged sideways whirled around and turned slowly over the sack floated away and the box caught in the swift water floated quickly away out of sight behind the brush uncle john grabbed the shovel and went rapidly back to the boxcars he sloshed down into the water and waded to the truck where pa and al were working taking down the onebysix planks pa looked over at him get it done yeah well look pa said if youll hep al ill go down the store an get some stuff to eat get some bacon al said i need some meat i will pa said he jumped down from the truck and uncle

teeth with a splinter in a very adult manner said i knowed it all the time howd you know i wont tell said winfield and he spat out a piece of the splinter ma built the fire up with the last twigs and cooked the bacon and made gravy pa had brought store bread ma scowled when she saw it we got any money lef nope said pa but we was so hungry an you got store bread ma said accusingly well we was awful hungry worked all night long ma sighed now what we gonna do as they ate the water crept up and up al gulped his food and he and pa built the platform five feet wide six feet long four feet above the floor and the water crept to the edge of the doorway seemed to hesitate a long time and then moved slowly inward over the floor and outside the rain began again as it had before big heavy drops splashing on the water pounding hollowly on the roof al said come on now lets get the mattresses up lets put the blankets up so they dont git wet they piled their possessions up on the platform and the water crept over the floor pa and ma al and uncle john each at a corner lifted rose of sharons mattress with the girl on it and put it on top of the pile and the girl protested i can walk im awright and the water crept over the floor a thin film of it rose of sharon whispered to ma and ma put her hand under the blanket and felt her breast and nodded in the other end of the boxcar the wainwrights were pounding building a platform for themselves the rain thickened and then passed away ma looked down at her feet the water was half an inch deep on the car floor by now you ruthiewinfiel she called distractedly come get on top of the pile youll get cold she saw them safely up sitting awkwardly beside rose of sharon ma said suddenly we got to git out we cant pa said like al says all our stuffs here well pull off the boxcar door an make more room to set on the family huddled on the platforms silent and fretful the water was six inches deep in the car before the flood spread evenly over the embankment and moved into the cotton field on the other side during that day and night the men slept soddenly side by side on the boxcar door and ma lay close to rose of sharon sometimes ma whispered to her and sometimes sat up quietly her face brooding under the blanket she hoarded the remains of the store bread the rain had become intermittent nowlittle wet squalls and quiet times on the morning of the second day pa splashed through the camp and came back with ten potatoes in his pockets ma watched him sullenly while he chopped out part of the inner wall of the car built a fire and scooped water into a pan the family ate the steaming boiled potatoes with their fingers and when this last food was gone they stared at the gray water and in the night they did not lie down for a long time when the morning came they awakened nervously rose of sharon whispered to ma ma nodded her head yes she said its time for it and then she turned to the car door where the men lay were agettin outa here she said savagely gettin to higher groun an youre comin or you aint comin but im takin rosasharn an the little fellas outa here we cant pa said weakly awright then maybe

the road git your back bent pa pa slipped into the water and stood waiting ma helped rose of sharon down from the platform and steadied her across the car pa took her in his arms held her as high as he could and pushed his way carefully through the deep water around the car and to the highway he set her down on her feet and held onto her uncle john carried ruthie and followed ma slid down into the water and for a moment her skirts billowed out around her winfiel set on my shoulder alwell come back soons the waters down al she paused ifif tom comestell him well be back tell him be careful winfiel climb on my shoulderthere now keep your feet still she staggered off through the breasthigh water at the highway embankment they helped her up and lifted winfield from her shoulder they stood on the highway and looked back over the sheet of water the dark red blocks of the cars the trucks and automobiles deep in the slowly moving water and as they stood a little misting rain began to fall we got to git along ma said rosasharn you feel like you could walk kinda dizzy the girl said feel like i been beat pa complained now were agoin where we goin i dunno come on give your han to rosasharn ma took the girls right arm to steady her and pa her left goin someplace where its dry got to you fellas aint had dry clothes on for two days they moved slowly along the highway they could hear the rushing of the water in the stream beside the road ruthie and winfield marched together splashing their feet against the road they went slowly along the road the sky grew darker and the rain thickened no traffic moved along the highway we got to hurry ma said if this here girl gits good an weti dont know whatll happen to her you aint said whereat were ahurryin to pa reminded her sarcastically the road curved along beside the stream ma searched the land and the flooded fields far off the road on the left on a slight rolling hill a rainblackened barn stood look ma said look there i bet its dry in that barn lets go there till the rain stops pa sighed probly get run out by the fella owns it ahead beside the road ruthie saw a spot of red she raced to it a scraggly geranium gone wild and there

another red petal on her forehead a little brightred heart come on ruthie lemme have one come on now he grabbed at the flower in her hand and missed it and ruthie banged him in the face with her open

winfield felt for the petal with his fingers and pressed it down on his nose they walked quickly after the others ruthie felt how the fun was gone here she said heres some more stick some on your forehead from the right of the road there came a sharp swishing ma cried hurry up theys a big rain les go through the fence here its shorter come on now bear on rosasharn they half dragged the girl across the ditch helped her through the fence and then the storm struck them sheets of rain fell on them they plowed through the mud and up the little incline the black barn was nearly obscured by the rain it hissed and splashed and the growing wind drove it along rose of sharons feet slipped and she dragged between her supporters pa can you carry her pa leaned over and picked her up were wet through anyways he said hurry up winfielruthie run on ahead they came panting up to the rainsoaked barn and staggered into the open end there was no door in this end a few rusty farm tools lay about a disk plow and a broken cultivator an iron wheel the rain hammered on the room and curtained the entrance pa gently set rose of sharon down on an oily box god awmighty he said ma said maybe theys hay inside look theres a door she swung the door on its rusty hinges they is hay she cried come on in you it was dark inside a little light came in through the cracks between the boards lay down rosasharn ma said lay down an res ill try to figger some way to dry you off winfield said ma and the rain roaring on the roof drowned his voice ma what is it what you want look in the corner ma looked there were two figures in the gloom a man who lay on his back and a boy sitting beside him his eyes wide staring at the newcomers as she looked the boy got slowly up to his feet and came toward her his voice croaked you own this here no ma said jus come in outa the wet we got a sick girl you got a dry blanket we could use an get her wet clothes off the boy went back to the corner and brought a dirty comfort and held it out to ma thank ya she said whats the matterth that fella the boy spoke in a croaking monotone fust he was sickbut now hes starvin what starvin got sick in the cotton he aint et

would i knowed she looked down at her hands tightlocked in her lap rose of sharon whispered willwill you allgo out the rain whisked lightly on the roof ma leaned forward and with her palm she brushed the tousled hair back from her daughters forehead and she kissed her on the forehead ma got up quickly come on you fellas she called you come out in the tool shed ruthie opened her mouth to speak hush ma said hush and git she herded them through the door drew the boy with her and she closed the squeaking door for a minute rose of sharon sat still in the whispering barn then she hoisted her tired body up and drew the comfort about her she moved slowly to the corner and stood looking down at the wasted face into the wide frightened eyes then slowly she lay down beside him he shook his head slowly from side to side rose of sharon loosened one side of the blanket and bared her breast you got to she said she squirmed closer and pulled his head close there she said there her hand moved behind his head and supported it her fingers moved gently in his hair she looked up and across the barn and her lips came together and smiled mysteriously the end
