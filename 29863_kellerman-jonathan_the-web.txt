jonathan kellerman the web the tenth book in the alex delaware series to my daughter aliza such pizzazz such intellect flashing eyes and a smile that lights up the galaxy wonderful things come in tiny packages the shark on the dock was no monster four feet long probably a lowlying reef scavenger but its dead white eyes had retained their menace and its jaws were jammed with needles that made it a prize for the two men with the bloody hands they were barechested anglos baked brown muscular yet flabby one held the corpse by the gill slits while the other used the knife slime coated the gray wooden planks robin had been looking out over the bow as the madeleine pulled in to harbor she saw the butchery and turned away i kept my hand on spikes leash hes a french bulldog twentyeight pounds of bateared blackbrindled muscle and a flat face that makes him a drowning risk trained as a pup to avoid water he now despises it and robin and i had dreaded the sixhour cruise from saipan but hed gotten his sea legs before we had exploring the old yachts teak deck then falling asleep under the friendly pacific sun his welfare during the trip had been our main concern six hours in a pet crate in the baggage hold during the flight from la to honolulu had left him shellshocked a pep talk and meatloaf had helped his recovery and hed taken well to the condo where wed stopped over for thirty hours then back on the plane for nearly eight more hours to guam an hour at the airport bumping shoulders with soldiers and sailors and minor government officials in guayaberas and a fortyminute shuttle to saipan there alwyn brady had met us at the harbor and taken us along with the bimonthly provisions on the final leg of the trip to aruk brady had maneuvered the seventyfoot vessel through the keyhole and beyond the barrier reef the yachts rubber bumpers bounced gently off the pilings out at the remote edges the water was deep blue thinning to silvery green as it trickled over creamy sand the green reminded me of something cadillac had offered the exact shade during the fifties from above the reefs ledges were coalblack and small brilliant fish flitted around them like nervous birds a few coconut palms grew out of the empty beach dead husks dotted the silica like suspension points another bump and brady cut the engines i looked past the dock at sharp black peaks in the distance volcanic outcroppings that told the story of the islands origins closer in soft brown slopes rose above small whitewashed houses and narrow roads that coiled like limp shoelaces off to the north a few clapboard stores and a singlepump filling station made up the islands business district tin roofs glinted in the afternoon light the only sign i could make out read auntie maes trading post above it was a rickety satellite dish robin put her head on my shoulder one of bradys deckhands a thin blackhaired boy tied the boat this is it he said brady came up a few seconds later pushing his cap back and shouting at the crew to start unloading fiftyish compact and nearly as blunt faced as spike he was proud of his halfirish halfislander ancestry and talkative as an allnight disc jockey several times during the journey hed turned the wheel over to one of the crewmen and come up on deck to lecture us on yeats joyce vitamins navigation without instrumentation sportfishing the true depth of the mariana trench geopolitics island history and dr moreland a saint cleaned up the water supply vaccinated the kids like that german fellow schweitzer only dr bill dont play the organ or no such foolishness no time for nothing but his good work now brady stretched and grinned up at the sun displaying the few yellow teeth he had left gorgeous isnt it bit of gods own giftwrap go easy on that orson fraygile and get the doctorandmissus gear out he glanced at spike you know doc first time i saw that face i thought of a monkfish but hes been a sailor hasnt he starting to look like errol flynn he laughed too many hours on water turn a sea cow into a mermaid ah heres your things lay that gently orson pretend its your honeybunch stay there folks well unload it for you someone should be by any minute to pick you up ah talk about prophecy he aimed his chin at a black jeep coming down the center of the hillside the vehicle stopped at the beach road waited for a woman to pass then headed straight for us parking a few feet away from where the shark was being butchered what remained of the fish was soft and pitiful the man with the knife was inspecting the teeth in his late twenties he had small features in a big soft face lifeless yellow hair that fell across his forehead and arms embroidered with tattoos running his finger along the sharks gums he passed the blade to his partner a shorter man slightly older with heavy beard shadow wild curly brassy hair and matching coils of body fleece impassive he began working on the dorsal fin brady climbed out of the boat and stood on the dock the water was flat and the madeleine barely bobbed he helped robin out and i scooped up spike once on solid ground the dog cocked his head shook himself off snorted and began barking at the jeep a man got out something dark and hairy sat on his shoulder spike became livid straining the leash the hairy thing bared its teeth and pawed the air small monkey the man seemed unperturbed after shaking bradys hand he came over and reached for robins then mine ben romero welcome to aruk thirty to thirtyfive five six one forty he had a smooth bronze face and short straight black hair sideparted precisely aviator glasses sat atop a delicate nose his eyes were burnt almonds he wore pressed blue cotton pants and a spotless white shirt that had somehow evaded the monkeys footprints the monkey was jabbering and pointing calm down kiko its just a dog romero smiled i think were not sure either said robin romero took the monkey off his shoulder and held it to his cheek stroking its face you like dogs kiko right whats his name spike his name is spike kiko dr moreland told me hes heat sensitive so weve got a portable air conditioner for your suite but i doubt youll need it januarys one of our prettiest months we get some rain bursts but it stays about eighty its lovely said robin always is on the leeward side let me get your stuff brady and his men brought our luggage to the jeep romero and i loaded when we finished the monkey was standing on the ground petting spikes head and chattering happily spike accepted the attention with a look of injured dignity good boy said robin kneeling beside him laughter made us all turn the shark butchers were looking our way the shorter one had his hands on his hips the knife in his belt rosypink hands he wiped them on his cutoffs and winked the taller man laughed again spikes bat ears stiffened and the monkey hissed romero put it back on his shoulder frowning better get going you must be bushed we climbed into the jeep and romero made a wide arc and headed back to the beach road a wooden sign said front street as we drove up the hill i looked back the ocean was allencompassing and the island seemed very small the madeleines crew stood on the dock and the men with the bloody hands were heading toward town wheeling their bounty in a rusty barrow all that was left of the shark was a stain let me give you a proper welcome said romero ahuma na ahapthats old pidgin for enjoy our home he started up the same central road winding and unmarked it was barely one vehicle wide and bordered by low walls of piled rock the grade was steeper than it had appeared from the harbor and he played with the jeeps gears in order to maintain traction each time the vehicle lurched kiko nattered and tightened his spidery grip on romeros shirt spikes head was out the window tilted up at the cloudless sky as we climbed i looked back and caught a frontal view of the business district most of the buildings were closed including the gas station romero sped past the small white houses up close the buildings looked shabbier the stucco cracked sometimes peeled to the paper the tin roofs dented and pocked and mossy laundry hung on sagging lines naked and halfnaked children played in the dirt a few of the properties were fenced with chicken wire most were open some looked unoccupied a couple of skinny dogs scrounged lazily in the dirt ignoring spikes bark this was us territory but it could have been anywhere in the developing world some of the meanness was softened by vegetation broadleafed philodendrons bromeliads flowering coral trees palms many of the structures were surrounded by greenery whitewashed eggs in emerald nests so how was your trip said romero tiring but good said robin her fingers were laced in mine and her brown eyes were wide the air through the jeeps open windows ruffled her curls and her linen shirt billowed dr bill wanted to greet you personally but he just got called out some kids diving out on north beach stung by jellyfish hope its not serious nah but it does smart is he the only doctor on the island i said we run a clinic at the church im an rn emergencies used to get flown over to guam or saipan till anyway the clinic does the trick for most of our problems im on call for whenever im needed have you lived here long whole life except for coast guard and nursing school in hawaii met my wife there shes a chinese girl we have four kids as we continued to climb the shabby houses gave way to empty fields of red clay and the harbor became tiny but the volcanic peaks remained as distant as if avoiding us to the right was a small grove of ashcolored trees with deeply corrugated trunks and sinuous knobby branches that seemed to claw at the sky aerial roots dripped like melting wax from several boughs digging their way back into the earth banyans i said yup strangler trees they send those shoots up around anything unlucky enough to grow near them and squeeze the life out of it little hooks under the shoots like velcro they just dig in we dont want them but they grow like crazy in the jungle those are about ten years old some bird must have dropped seeds wheres the jungle he laughed well its not really that i mean therere no wild animals or anything else for that matter except the stranglers he pointed toward the mountaintops just east of the islands center dr bills place butts right up against it on the other side is stanton the navy base he shifted into low got the jeep over an especially steep rise then coasted through big open wooden gates the road on the other side was freshly blacktopped fourstory coco palms were set every ten feet the piled rock was replaced by a handhewn japanesestyle pine fence and rows of flameorange clivia velvet lawns rolled away on all sides and i could make out the tops of the banyan forest a remote gray fringe then movement a small herd of blacktailed deer grazing to the left i pointed them out to robin and she smiled and kissed my knuckles a few seabirds hovered above us otherwise the sky was inert a hundred more palms and we pulled into a huge gravel courtyard shaded by red cedar aleppo pine mango and avocado in the center an algaestreaked limestone fountain spouted into a carved basin teeming with hyacinths behind it stood a massive twostory house light brown stucco with pine trim and balconies and a pagoda roof of shiny green tiles some of the edge tiles wore gargoyle faces romero turned off the engine and kiko scrambled off his shoulder ran up wide stone steps and began knocking on the front door spike jumped out of the jeep and followed scratching at the wood with his forepaws robin got out to restrain him dont worry said romero thats iron pine hundreds of years old the whole place is rock solid the japanese army built it in after the league of nations took the territories away from germany and gave them to the emperor this was their official headquarters kiko was swinging from the doorknob as spike barked in encouragement romero said looks like theyre already buddies dont worry about your stuff ill get it for you later he pushed the door open with the monkey still holding on it had been a long time since id left a door unlocked in la a round white stone entry led to a big front room with waxed pine floors under chinese rugs high plaster walls a carved teak ceiling and lots of old comfortablelooking furniture pastel watercolors on the walls potted orchids in porcelain jardinieres supplied richer hues archways on each side led to long hallways in front of the righthand passage was an awkwardlooking redcarpeted staircase with an oiled banister all right angles no curves it hooked its way up to the secondfloor landing and continued out of view straight ahead a wall of picture windows framed a touristbrochure vista of terraces and grasslands and the heartbreakingly blue ocean the barrier reef was a tiny dark comma notched by the keyhole harbor the western tip of the island a distinct knife point cutting into the lagoon most of aruk village was now concealed by treetops the few houses i could see were sprinkled like sugar on the hillside how many acres do you have here seven hundred give or take over a square mile big chunk of a sevenbyonemile island when dr bill bought it from the government it was abandoned romero said he brought it back to life can i get you something to drink he returned with a tray of coke cans lime wedges glasses and a water bowl for spike trailing him were two small women in floral housedresses and rubber thongs one in her sixties the other half that age both had broad open faces the older womans was pitted dr alexander delaware and ms robin castagna said romero placing the tray on a bamboo end table and the water bowl on the floor spike rushed over and began lapping kiko watched analytically scratching his little head this is gladys medina said romero gourmet chef and executive housekeeper and cheryl first daughter of gladys and executive vicehousekeeper please said gladys flipping a hand we cook and clean nice to meet you she bowed and her daughter imitated her false modesty said romero handing robin her drink what are you after benjamin a ginger cookie i didnt bake yet so it wont do you any good thats a very cute dog i ordered some food for him on the last boatload and it stayed dry she named the brand spike was used to perfect said robin thank you when kiko eats here its in the service room maybe they want to keep each other company spike was belly down on the entry floor jowls spreading on the stone eyelids drooping looks like he needs to nap first said romero whatever said gladys you need anything you just come to the kitchen and let me know both women left cheryl hadnt uttered a word gladys has been with dr bill since he left the navy said romero she used to work for the base commander at stanton as a cook came down with scrub typhus and dr bill got her through it while she recuperated they fired her so dr bill hired her her husband died a few years ago cheryl lives with her shes a little slow he led us upstairs our suite was in the center of the secondstory landing sitting room with a small refrigerator bedroom and whitetiled bath old brown wool carpeting covered the floors the walls were teak and plaster overstuffed floralprint furniture more bamboo tables the bathtub was ancient castiron and spotless with a marble shelf holding soaps and lotions and loofah sponges still in plastic wrap fly fans churned the air lazily in all three rooms a faint insecticidal smell hung in the air the bed was a turnofthecentury mahogany fourposter made up with crisp white linens and a yellow wiltedsilk spread on one nightstand was a frosted glass vase of cut amaryllis a folded white card formed a miniature tent on the pillow lots of windows silk curtains pulled back lots of sky look at that view said robin the japanese military governor wanted to be king of the mountain said romero the highest point on the island is actually that peak over there he pointed to the tallest of the black crags but its too close to the windward side youve got your gales all year round and rotten humidity he walked to a window the japanese figured the mountains gave them a natural barrier from an eastern land assault the german governor built his house here too for the same reason the japanese tore it down they were really into making the place japanese brought in geishas teahouses baths even a movie theater down where the trading post is now the slave barracks were in that field we passed on the way up where the accidental banyans are when macarthur attacked the slaves came out of the barracks and turned against the japanese between that and the bombing two thousand japanese died sometimes you still find old bones and skulls up along the hillside he went into the bathroom and tried out the taps you can drink the water dr bill installed activated carbon filters on all the cisterns on the island and we take regular germ counts before that cholera and typhus were big problems youve still got to be careful about eating the local shellfish marine toxins and rat lungworm disease but fruits and vegetables are no problem anything here at the house is no problem dr bill grows it all himself in terms of outside stuff the bar food at slims isnt much but the chop suey palace is better than it sounds at least my mandarin wife doesnt mind it sometimes jacqui the owner cooks up something interesting like birds nest soup depending on whats available is that where the sharks fin was headed i said pardon those two guys down at the harbor was it for the restaurant he pushed his glasses up his nose oh them no i doubt it a grayhaired graybearded man brought up our bags romero introduced him as carl sleet and thanked him when he left romero said anything else i can do for you we seem to have everything okay then heres your key dinners at six dress comfortably he exited spike had fallen asleep in the sitting room robin and i went into the bedroom and i closed the door on canine snores well she said taking a deep breath and smiling i kissed her she kissed back hard then yawned in the middle of it and broke away laughing me too i said nap time after i clean up she rubbed her arms im crusted with salt ah dillpickle woman i grabbed her and licked her skin she laughed pushed me away and began opening a carryon i picked up the folded card on the bed inside was a handwritten note home is the sailor home from sea and the hunter home from the hill r l stevenson please make my home yours wwm robert louis stevenson said robin maybe this will be our treasure island wanna see my peg as she laughed i went to run a bath the water was crystalline the towels brandnew thick as fur when i returned she was lying on top of the covers naked her hands behind her head auburn hair spread on the pillow nipples brown and stiff i watched her belly rise and fall her smile the oversized upper incisors id fallen for years ago the windows were still wide open dont worry she said softly i checked and no one can see in were too high up god youre beautiful i love you she said this is going to be wonderful a rasping noise woke me scratching at one of the screens i sat up fast saw it a small lizard rubbing its foreclaws against the mesh i got out of bed and had a closer look it stayed there light brown body speckled with black skinny head and unmoving eyes it stared at me i waved unimpressed it scraped some more finally scampered away five pm id been out for two hours robin was still curled under the sheets slipping into my pants i tiptoed to the sitting room spike greeted me by panting and rolling over i massaged his gut refilled his water bowl poured myself a tonic water on ice and sat by the largest window the sun was a big red cherry the ocean starting to silver i felt lucky to be alive but disconnected so far from everything familiar rummaging in my briefcase i found morelands letter heavy white paper with a regal watermark at the top in embossed black aruk house aruk island dear dr delaware i am a physician who lives on the island of aruk in the northern region of micronesia nicknamed knife island because of its oblong shape aruk is officially part of the mariana commonwealth and a selfgoverning us territory but relatively obscure and not listed in any guidebooks i have lived here since and have found it a wonderful and fascinating place i chanced to come across an article you published in the journal of child development and clinical practice on group trauma progressing to all your other published works i found that you display a fine combination of scholarliness and commonsense thinking i say all this by way of making an interesting proposition over the last three decades in addition to conducting research in natural history and nutrition i have accumulated an enormous amount of clinical data from my practice some of it unique because the bulk of my time has been spent treating patients i have not taken the time to properly organize this information as i grow older and closer to retirement i realize that unless these data are brought to publication a wealth of knowledge may be lost initially my thought was to obtain the help of an anthropologist but i decided that someone with clinical experience preferably in a mental health field would be better suited to the task your writing skills and orientation make me feel that you might be a compatible collaborator im sure dr delaware that this will seem odd coming out of the blue but i have given much thought to my offer though the pace of life on aruk is probably a good deal slower than what you are used to that in and of itself may have appeal for you would you be interested in helping me by my estimate the preliminary organization should take two perhaps three months at which point we could sit down and figure out if weve got a book a monograph or several journal articles i would concentrate on the biological aspects and id rely upon you for the psychological input what i envision is a fiftyfifty collaboration with joint authorship im prepared to offer compensation of six thousand dollars per month for four months in addition to businessclass transportation from the mainland and full room and board there are no hotels on aruk but my own home is quite commodious and im sure you would find it pleasant if you are married i could accommodate your wifes transportation though i could not offer her any paid work if you have children they could enroll in the local catholic school which is small but good or i could arrange for private tutoring at a reasonable cost if this interests you please write me or call collect at there is no formal schedule but i would like to get to work on this as soon as possible thank you for your attention to this matter sincerely woodrow wilson moreland md slow pace of life nothing in the letter indicated professional challenges and any other time i might have written back a polite refusal i hadnt done longterm therapy for years but forensic consultations kept me busy and robins work as a builder of custom stringed instruments left her little free time for vacations let alone a fourmonth idyll but wed been talking half jokingly about escaping to a desert island a year ago a psychopath had burned down our home and tried to murder us eventually wed taken on the task of rebuilding finding temporary lodgings at a beach rental on the far western end of malibu after our general contractor flaked out on us robin began overseeing the project things went well before bogging down the way construction projects inevitably do our new home was still months from completion and the double load finally proved too much for her she hired a fellow luthier whod developed a severe allergy to wood dust to oversee the final stages and returned to her carving then her right wrist gave out severe tendinitis the doctors said nothing would help unless she gave the joint a long hiatus she grew depressed and did little but sit on the beach all day insisting she was adjusting just fine to my surprise she soon was hurrying to the sand each morning even when autumn brought biting winds and iron skies taking long solitary walks to the tide pools watching the pelicans hunt from a vantage point atop the rocky cove i know i know she finally said im surprised myself but now im thinking i was silly for waiting this long in november the lease on our beach house expired and the owner informed us he was giving it to his failedscreenwriter son as an incentive to write thirtyday notice to vacate morelands letter came soon after i showed it to robin expecting her to laugh it off she said call me robin crusoe something human woke her people arguing next door a man and a woman their words blunted by thick walls but the tone unmistakable going at each other with that grinding relentlessness that said theyd had long practice robin sat up pushed her hair out of her face and squinted the voices subsided then resumed what time is it alex fiveforty she took a long breath i sat down on the bed and held her her body was moist dinner in twenty minutes she said the bath must be cold ill run another when did you get up five i told her about the lizard so dont be alarmed if it happens again was he cute who says it was a he girls dont peep through other peoples windows now that i think about it he did seem to be ogling you i narrowed my eyes and flicked my tongue probably a lounge lizard she laughed and got out of bed putting on a robe she walked around flexing her wrist how does it feel better actually all the warm air and doing nothing yes she said the power of positive nothing she slipped into a sleeveless white dress that showed off her olive skin as we headed for the stairs someone said hello there a couple had emerged from next door the woman was locking up the man repeated his greeting both were tall in their forties with shortsleeved epauletted khaki ensembles his looked well worn but hers was right out of the box he had a red peeling nose under thickrimmed glasses and a long graying beard that reached his breastbone the hair on top was darker thin combed over his vest pockets bulged she was big busted and broad beamed with brown hair pulled back from a round face they lumbered toward us holding hands half an hour ago theyd been assaulting each other with words dr and mrs delaware i presume his voice was low and grainy cocktail breath up close his skin was freckled pemmican the red nose due to shattered vessels not sunburn robin castagna and alex delaware i said jo picker lyman picker dr jo picker and lyman picker the woman said actually its dr lyman picker too but who cares about that nonsense she had a subalto voice if the two of them had kids they probably sounded like tugboat horns she gave robin a wide appraising smile light brown eyes an even nose lips just a little too thin her tan was as new as her getup still pink around the edges ive heard youre a craftswoman she said sounds fascinating weve been looking forward to meeting you said picker round out the dinner table make up for the hosts absence is the host absent often i said all work no play when the man sleeps i dont know are you vegetarians like him were not my line of work you eat what you can get or you starve to death knowing it was expected of me i said what line is that epiphytology botany tropical spores are you doing research with dr moreland he gave a wet laugh no i rarely venture far from the equator this is a cold weather jaunt for me he threw an arm around his wifes shoulder keeping the distaff side company dr jo here is an esteemed meteorologist fluctuations in aerial currents uncle sams quite enamored ergo grant money jo gave an uneasy smile i study the wind how was your trip long but peaceful said robin come over on the supply boat said picker yes out of saipan or rota saipan us too damned tedious give me a plane any day even the biggest ocean liners a thumbnail in a swimming pool ridiculous isnt it big airfield over on stanton and the navy wont let anyone use it dr moreland wrote that the airport there was closed i said not when the navy needs it damn boats oh it wasnt so bad ly said jo remember the flying fish it was lovely actually the four of us started toward the stairs typical government stupidity said picker all that land no one using it probably the result of some subcommittee wouldnt you say dear you understand the ways of the government jos smile was tense wish i did spend any time in guam asked her husband read any of those tourist pamphlets they have everywhere developing the pacific making use of the native talent pool so what does the military do to a place like this blocks off the one link between the base and the rest of the island what link is that i said southern coastal road the leeward side is unapproachable from the north sheer rock walls from the tip of north beach up to those dead volcanoes so the only other ways to get through are the southern beach road and through the banyan forest navy blockaded the road last year meaning no military contact with the village no commerce what little local economy there was got choked off what about through the forest the japanese salted it with land mines his wife moved out from under his arm what kinds of things do you craft robin musical instruments ah drums and such guitars and mandolins lyman plays the guitar picker scratched his beard took a guitar into the hoyos of central ecuador now that was a place ocelots tapir kinkajou only indigenous thingies around here lack spines and my bride despises spineless things dont you he plays quite well said jo regular segovia picker mimed a strum sitting around the campfire with the auca indians trying to charm them so theyd lead me to a juicy trove of cordyceps militarisfungal parasite grows on insect pupae they eat it like popcorn humidity loosened the glue on the thing woke up the next morning to a stack of soggy boards he laughed used the strings to strangle my supper that night the rest for toothpicks we reached the bottom of the stairs ben romero was in the front room kiko on his shoulder picker eyed the animal ive eaten them too gamy cant housebreak them did you know evening ben said jo alfresco as usual ben nodded dr bill will be a little late surprise surprise said picker we walked through the righthand hallway raw silk walls were hung with yet more pale watercolors nature scenes well executed the same signature on all of them b moreland another of the doctors talents ben led us through a big yellow living room with a limestone fireplace brocade couches chinoiserie tables imari porcelain lamps with parchment shades an oil portrait of a blackhaired woman took up the space over the mantel her haughty beauty evoked sargent the room opened to a wraparound terrace where a banquet table was covered with bright blue cloth bone china set for seven nascent light from hanging iron lanterns was swallowed by the stillbright evening the sun nudged the horizon spilling crimson onto the skin of the water a lovely wound down in the village tin roofs glinted through the treetops like tiny coins the road leading up to the estate was a sleeping gray snake its head resting at the big front gates i thought of the slaves storming up from the barracks some japanese general watching helpless knowing how it would end lyman picker touched his throat and winked at ben bourbon ben said in a tight voice straight up excellent memory friend and for you mrs picker just a soda if its no bother no bother at all bens jaw flexed ms castagna dr delaware nothing thanks i said robin looked at me me neither youre sure positive he left conscientious one that said picker jo began examining the flatware robin and i walked to the pine railing picker followed us and leaned against the wood elbows resting on the cap so youre here to work with the old man sun and fun maybe a publication or two hes lucky to get you you wouldnt find a serious scientist here i laughed no offense man he said as if offended when i say serious i mean us theoretical and ohsoirrelevant types panhandlers with phds rattling our beakers and praying stipends will drop in this part of the globe you want funding you dont study a place like this you go for melanesia polynesia big fat fertile islands plenty of flora fauna agreeably colorful indigenous tribes serious mythology for the folklore crowd aruk doesnt have any of that he coughed without covering his mouth micronesia my friend is two thousand dirt specks in three million square miles of water most of them uninhabited bumps of coral this bumps one of the most obscure did you know there were no people till the spanish brought them over to grow sugar the crop failed and the spanish sailed away leaving the workers to starve then came the germans who for all their authoritarianism hadnt a clue about colonizing sat around reading goethe all day then the japanese trying the same damn sugar thing slave labor he laughed so what was the payoff macarthur bombs them to hell and the slaves say payback time night of the long knives he drew a finger across his beard jo came over is he regaling you with tales of his farflung adventures no said picker grumpily reviewing local history he coughed again wheres that drink soon ly so what led you to become a craftswoman robin i love music and working with my hands tell us about your research jo nothing very exciting i was sent to do a wind survey of several islands in the mariana complex and aruks my last stop we were renting a teeny place in town till bill was kind enough to invite us up here were leaving in a week dont make it sound like the weather service girl said picker defense department pays her bills shes an important national asset marry an asset get an allexpensepaid vacation he slapped his wife on the back none too gently she stiffened but smiled do you live in washington said robin we have a town house in georgetown said jo but most of the time were both gone she recoiled a lizard just like the one id seen at the window raced along the top of the railing her husband flicked a finger at it laughing as it disappeared over the side still jittery he reproached her i told you its harmless hemidactylus frenatus house gecko semidomesticated people feed them near the house so theyll stick around and eat all the buggies he wiggled his fingers in his wifes face in grade school hed probably been a pigtail yanker she tried to smile well i just cant get used to them doing pushups on my screen squeamish picker told us meaning i cant bring my work home jo colored beneath her tan the young housekeeper cheryl came out with a tray on it were the drinks the pickers had ordered and mineral waters with lime for robin and me retarded that picker said when she was gone tapping his temple he raised his glass to spineless things red light bounced off the ocean and bloodied his beard his wife looked the other way and sipped robin drew me away to the opposite corner charming huh i said alex why were you so adamant about not ordering drinks because bens teeth were clenched when picker ordered his hes a nurse doesnt want to be thought of as a butler notice he sent cheryl with the tray oh she said my psychologist she slipped her hand around my waist and lowered her head to my shoulder lovers secrets picker called out his glass was empty let them be ly said jo looks like theyre being just fine welcome to paradise i muttered robin quelled a laugh it came out sounding like a hiccup hitting the sauce girl i whispered tsk tsk damned selfindulgent stop she said biting her lip i leaned close great fun ahead wench cooked flesh and spirits and after dinner hell regale us with tales of the giantpenised matahuaxl tribe human tripods they are very virile she licked her lips and whispered back very indeed as they trip their way over the roots of the variegated crotchweed cause lets face it when it comes to tribes bigger is better ah love picker called from across the terrace need another drinkie i do but he made no move to get one and neither did his wife welcome silence then light footsteps sounded from behind i turned and saw a lovelylooking blond woman walk toward us late twenties or early thirties she had a nipped waist boyish hips small breasts long legs she wore an apricot silk blouse and black crepe slacks bluntcut hair ended at her shoulders held in place by a black band the honey tint looked real and her sculpted face had a scrubbedclean look her features were fine and perfectly placed soft wide mouth clean jaw delicate ears blue eyes with a downward slant that made them look sad except for her coloring she could have been the woman in the oil portrait dr delaware and ms castagna im pam dr morelands daughter soft musical slightly reticent voice she had a fetching smile but looked away as she extended her hand id had patients with that tendency to avert all had been painfully shy as children doctor herself picker corrected all these accomplished femmes and everyones playing the modesty game pam moreland gave him a pitying smile evening lyman jo sorry im late dad should be here shortly if not well start without him gladys has done a nice chicken kiev dads vegetarian but he tolerates us barbarians she smiled beautifully but the eyes remained sad and i wondered if physical structure completely explained it picker said just gave our new chums a history lesson dr daughter told them scientists shun this lovely bit of real estate because margaret mead showed the key to stardom is witch doctors puberty rites and barechested dusky girls his eyes dropped to pams bodice interesting theory can i get you some coffee no thanks my dear but a refill of this wouldnt hurt ly said jo she hadnt moved from her corner picker kept his back to her yes my love come here and look at the sunset he nibbled his mustache the old distraction technique worried about my liver i just he swiveled and faced her if entamoeba histolytica and fasciola hepatica failed to do the trick do you really think a little wild turkey will succeed josephine jo said nothing lived on metronodizole and bithionol for months picker told pam long overdue for a physical any referrals not unless youre going to philadelphia ah the city of brotherly love said picker dont have a brother would i love him if i did pondering that he walked away i will take that refill dr pam he called over his shoulder the man who came to dinner pam said very softly excuse me she returned with a quarterfull bottle of wild turkey thrust it at the surprised picker and returned to us dads sorry about not being able to greet you properly the jellyfish i said she nodded glance at a lady rolex i guess we should get started she seated robin and me with a view of the sunset the pickers on the other end herself in the middle two empty chairs remained and moments later ben romero came out and took one hed put on a tan cotton sportcoat usually i go home by six he said unrolling his napkin but my wifes having a card party the babys sleeping and the older kids are farmed out next time well have claire up said pam shes a marvelous violinist the kids too ben laughed thatll be real relaxing your kids are great ben the food came platters of it watercress salad with avocado dressing carrot puree fricassee of wild mushrooms with walnuts and water chestnuts then the chicken sizzling and moist a bottle of white burgundy remained untouched picker poured himself the rest of the bourbon his wife looked the other way and ate energetically gladys didnt learn to cook like this at the base said robin believe it or not she did pam said the commander thought himself quite the gourmet shes very creative lucky for dad has he always been a vegetarian since after the korean war the things he saw made him determined never to hurt anything again picker grunted but hes always been tolerant said pam had meat shipped over for me when i arrived you dont live here said robin no i came last october it was supposed to be a stopover on the way to a medical convention in hong kong whats your specialty i said internal medicine and public health i work at the student health center at temple u she paused actually it was a combination work trip and breather i just got divorced she filled her water glass shrugged did you grow up here asked robin not really ready for dessert picker watched her walk away some fool in philadelphia s missing out ben eyed him another bottle dr picker picker stared back no thank you amigo better keep my wits im flying tomorrow jo put down her fork picker grinned at her yes darling ive decided to go ahead flying in what said ben vintage craft but well maintained man named amalfi owns it harry amalfi one of those crop dusters they havent flown in years theyre quite serviceable friend i examined them myself been buzzing jungles for fifteen years and im going to buzz your poor excuse for one tomorrow morning me and dr missus take some aerial photographs prove to the boys back at the institute that ive been here and that there was nothing to dig up jos fingers were gathering tablecloth ly ben said its not a good idea dr picker picker shot him a fierce smile your input is duly noted friend the forest is navy territory youll need official permission to fly over wrong said picker only the east end is navy land the western half is public land never formally claimed by the navy or so dr wife here tells me from her maps thats true ly said jo but its still zoom picker spoke over her up and away would you rather i remain bored to the point of brain death the entire forest is one mile wide said ben once youre up there its going to be pretty hard to keep track concerned about me amigo said picker with sudden harshness he picked up the bourbon bottle as if ready to break it put it down with exquisite care and got up everyone so concerned about me touching his beard was littered with crumbs fonts of human kindness to my face but behind my back drunken buffoon he shifted his attention to his wife glaring and grinning simultaneously are you coming angel her lip trembled you know how i feel about small craft ly not that now are you coming now without taking his eyes off her he picked up a piece of chicken and bit in chewing with his mouth open he shot a hard dark glance at romero its a metaphor friend what is said ben this place all the other damn bumps in the ocean volcanoes ejaculating then dropping dead conquerors arriving with high hopes only to slink away or die the damned coral parasites taking over everything sinking entropy jo put down her fork excuse us picker tossed the chicken onto a plate and took her arm roughly everything sinks he said pulling her away pam came back carrying a huge bowl of fruit she eyed the empty chairs they left said ben theyre renting one of harrys crop dusters and buzzing the jungle tomorrow morning in one of those wrecks are they safe i tried to talk him out of it hes a worldclass explorer he arched his eyebrows she put the bowl down and sat im afraid sometimes dr picker gets a little difficult nice of your father to put them up all this time i said she and ben exchanged looks they kind of invited themselves she said dads a soft touch apparently shes quite a prominent researcher what about him he works parttime for some wildlife organization with a shoestring budget studying some fungus or other i get the feeling hes having trouble finding grant money i guess its difficult dad should be here any moment she passed the bowl is it true i said about the navy cutting off contact with the village with a blockade she nodded why its the military said ben they live in their own little world dads working on it said pam wrote to senator hoffman because the two of them go back a ways and hoffman knows aruk from personal experience he was stanton s commander during the korean war the gourmet she nodded he used to come up here with his wife sit right on this terrace and play bridge sounds like a good contact i said the senator from oregon had been discussed as a presidential candidate ben put his napkin down and stood scuse me got to pick up the kids anything you need for tomorrow pam just more disposable needles and vaccine if its running low already there said ben i set up before dinner he shook our hands and left quickly hes terrific said pam really knows what hes doing he found kiko on the docks dying of infection and nursed him back to health she smiled kikos short for king kong he sleeps in a cradle in bens house dr picker said monkeys cant be housebroken im no primatologist but sometimes i think animals are a lot more tractable than people the sound of a car engine drew my eyes down toward the road darkness had set in obscuring details but a pair of headlights shone through one of the most levelheaded people youll ever meet dad wouldnt mind if he went on to med school the island could use a younger doctor but the time commitment hes got a big family to support in his letter to me i said your father mentioned retirement she smiled i dont imagine hell ever fully retire but with three thousand people on this island he could use some help ive been pitching in but she put her spoon down you asked before if i grew up on aruk and i said not really i was born here but boarded out very young went to temple for med school and stayed in philadelphia i kept thinking i should come back here but i grew up a city girl found out i like the city i know what you mean said robin small towns are great in theory but they can be limiting exactly aruk is wonderful you guys will have a great time but as a permanent place to live its how shall i put this at the risk of sounding elitist its just very small and the water all around you just cant go very far without being reminded of your insignificance we lived on the beach this last year said robin there were times the ocean made me feel invisible precisely everywhere you turn its there sometimes i think of it as a big blue slap in the face she nibbled more fruit and then theres the pace cross the international dateline and for some reason everything moves slowly im not the most patient person in the world gladys and cheryl arrived with a rolling tray and coffee cleared the dishes and poured pam said everything was delicious gladys tell your father to show up for dinner he needs to take better care of himself ive been telling him that since i got here gladys and ive been ignoring it mule that i am said a voice from the house a very tall very homely man stood in the double doorway stooped gaunt cleanshaven bald except for white dandelion puffs over his ears he had a narrow lipless mouth a thick fleshy nose and a long face bottoming in a misshapen crinkled chin that made me think of a camel his cheeks were hollow and limp his eye sockets deep and pouched sad blue eyes the only physical trait hed passed on to his daughter he wore a cheaplooking white shirt over baggy brown pants white socks and sandals his chest looked caved in his arms long and ungainly and spotted by the sun the flesh loose on thin bones plastic eyeglasses hung from a chain his breast pocket drooped with pens a doctors penlight a pair of sunglasses a small white plastic ruler he carried an old black leather medical bag as i stood he waved and came forward in an ungainly headfirst lope not a camel a flamingo touching his lips to pams cheek he said evening kitten hi dad the narrow mouth widened a millimeter miss castagna a pleasure dear he gave robins fingertips a brief doublehand clasp then took my hand sighing as if hed been waiting a long time to do it dr delaware his hand was dry and limp exerting feeble pressure then slipping away like a windblown leaf im bringing you dinner said gladys and dont tell me you grabbed a snack in the village i didnt said moreland putting his palms together i promise gladys he sat down and inspected his napkin before unfolding it i trust youve been well taken care of any seasickness coming over we shook our heads good madeleines a fine craft and alwyns the best of the supply captains she used to belong to a sportsman from hawaii runs fine on sails but alwyn upgraded the engines and he really makes good time he babies that boat how many boats make the run i said three to six depending on orders circulating among the smaller islands on the average we get one or two loads twice a month must be expensive it does inflate the cost of goods cheryl returned with two plates piled high with everything wed eaten but the chicken beans had been added to the rice she set the food in front of moreland and he smiled up at her thank you dear i hope your mother doesnt expect me to finish all this cheryl giggled and scurried off moreland took a deep breath and raised a fork hows your little bulldog faring sleeping off the boat ride i said robin said matter of fact id better go check on him excuse me i walked her to the stairway when i got back moreland was looking at his food but hadnt touched it pam was sitting in place not moving morelands eyes drifted up to the black sky for a moment they seemed clouded then he blinked them clear pam was fiddling with her napkin ring i think ill take a walk she said rising good night kitten nice to meet you dr delaware nice to meet you another exchange of pecks and she was gone moreland took a forkful of rice and chewed slowly washing it down with water im very happy to finally meet you same here doctor call me bill may i call you alex of course how are your accommodations great thanks for everything what did you think of my stevenson quote the question threw me nice touch great writer home is the sailor he said this is my home and its my pleasure to have you here stevenson never made it to the northern marianas but he did have a feel for island life great thinker as well as a great writer the great thinkers have much to offer i have high hopes for our project alex who knows what patterns will emerge when we really get into the data he put the fork down as i mentioned im particularly interested in mental health problems because they always pose the greatest puzzles and ive seen some fascinating cases he aimed the pouchy eyes at me for example years ago i encountered a case of i suppose the closest label would be lycanthropy but it really wasnt classical lycanthropy a wolfman a cat woman have you seen that during my training i saw schizophrenics with transitory animal hallucinations this was more than transitory thirtyyearold woman quite attractive sweet nature shortly after her thirtyfirst birthday she began withdrawing from her family and wandering around staring at cats then she started chasing mice rather uselessly mewing licking herself eating raw meat thats what finally brought her to me rampant intestinal parasites caused by her diet was this a constant delusion more like a series of fits acute spells but they lasted longer and longer as time went on by the time i saw her the periods between the fits werent good either appetite loss poor concentration bouts of weeping tell all that to a psychiatrist and hed probably diagnose psychotic depression or a bipolar mood disorder an anthropologist on the other hand would pounce on tribal rituals or a plantinduced religious hallucinosis the problem is there are no native hallucinogenic plants on aruk nor any prechristian shamanic culture he ate more rice but didnt seem to taste it interesting from a diagnostic standpoint wouldnt you say did the woman drink heavily i said no and her vitamin b intake was sufficient so it wasnt an idiopathic korsakoffs syndrome what about the parasites had they infiltrated her brain good question i wondered about that too but her symptoms made conducting even a gross neurological exam impossible shed gotten quite aggressive snarling and biting and scratching to the point where her husband tied her up in her room shed become quite a burden sounds brutal he looked pained in any event the symptoms didnt conform to any parasitical disease id ever come across and i was able to treat her intestinal problems quite easily after she died the husband refused an autopsy and i certified cause of death as heart attack how did she die he put down his fork she screamed out one night a cri du chatcats cry louder than usual so the husband went in to check he found her lying on her bed openeyed dead no evidence of any kind of poisoning my lab was rather primitive in those days but i was able to test her blood for the obvious things and found nothing what was her relationship with her husband like he stared at me is there any particular reason you ask that im a psychologist he smiled also i said you said shed become a burden and that he only went in because her cats cry was louder that implies he usually ignored her it doesnt sound like marital devotion he looked up and down the table then past it into the living room as if making sure we were alone shortly after she died he said her husband took up with another woman and moved off the island years later i found out hed been quite a don juan his eyes dropped to his plate i suppose id better get through this or gladys will have my head eating a few mouthfuls of vegetables he said i fibbed had some chow mein brought into the clinic sudden emergency influx of jellyfish on north beach pam told me how are the children sore and covered with welts and totally unchastened any more thoughts on our catwoman did she have a history of fainting or any other evidence of syncope a cardiac arrhythmia to explain the sudden death none that i picked up and no family history of heart disease but the mode sudden death her heart stopped so i called it heart disease allergies anaphylaxis he shook his head no heavy drinking i said what about drug abuse her habits were clean alex a lovely lady really until the change how completely was she bound when she slept hands and feet pretty severe she was considered dangerous and she was tied up the night she died yes perhaps something frightened or upset her i said to the point of heart failure such as an especially severe hallucination or a nightmare he didnt respond and i thought he looked angry or i said something real he closed his eyes maybe i continued her don juan husband took up with another woman before she died slow nods the eyes remained shut tied up at night i said but the husband and the girlfriend were in the next room did they make love in front of her the eyes opened my my you are a remarkable young man just guessing another long pause as i said it wasnt till years later that i found out about him and only then because i treated a cousin of his who lived on another island and came to me to be treated for shingles i gave him acyclovir and it reduced his pain i suppose he felt he owed me something so he told me the catwomans husband had just died and had mentioned me on his deathbed hed been married three more times any other mysterious deaths no three divorces all because he couldnt stop philandering but as he lay eaten away by lung cancer his chest completely ravaged he confessed to tormenting his first wife right from the beginning the day after the wedding she saw him kill a cat that had gotten into their yard and eaten a chicken he choked it to death chopped its head off and tossed the carcass at her laughing she learned of his infidelities soon after when she complained he called her a bitchcat and sent her to clean the chicken coop it became a regular pattern whenever theyd fight years later her symptoms began the more disturbed she became the less he cared about hiding his affairs during her final months the other woman was actually living with them ostensibly to clean house the night she died the husband and the girlfriend were making love noisily the wife cried out in protest and they laughed at her this went on for a while then she entered her cat mode and began mewing then hissing then screaming he touched one cheek and the flesh bobbled they came into her room and continued to in front of her she strained at her bonds screaming im sure her blood pressure was skyrocketing finally she gave a last scream he pushed his plate away deathbed confession he said guilt is a great motivator infidelities i said catting around he said nothing for several seconds then i like that but he sounded anything but happy so what are we talking about diagnostically manicdepression marked by some sort of primitive feline identification or a fullblown schizophrenia or a severe stress reaction was there any psychiatric history in the family at all her mother was morose he leaned in closer bald pate shining like an ostrich egg dying like that was it due to fear shame can a person truly die of frustration or did she suffer from some physical irregularity that i wasnt clever enough to discover thats what i mean about puzzles well document the case fascinating i said thinking of the catwomans agony ive got many more son many many more a hand began to reach out for a moment i thought hed put it on mine but it landed on the table and lay there exhibiting a slight tremor im so glad youre here to help me glad to be here a bark made us both turn robin returned with spike on his leash moreland brightened oh look at him he went over and crouched hand out palm down spike panted and jumped then nosed the old mans crotch oh my said moreland laughing and standing youre a friendly little fellow has he had his dinner he just finished said robin and we took a short walk lovely moreland said absently do you two have any plans for tomorrow if youre up to it you might try snorkeling down on south beach the reefs are beautiful and the fish come right into the shallows so you dont need tanks i have an extra jeep for you to use fishing in his pocket he pulled out some keys and gave them to me thanks i said when do you want to start working he smiled we already have we walked back through the silkpapered gallery moreland moving stiffly despite long strides robin and i slowing down for him i like your paintings i said he gave a puzzled look oh those they were done by my late wife he made no further comment till we reached the entry hall and a door slammed upstairs from the vicinity of the pickers suite i heard about lymans behavior at dinner he said stopping i apologize no big deal theyll only be here another week or so shes just about completed whatever it is she came here to do he has nothing to do which is part of the problem hes unhappy about the lack of exotic molds he may still be hoping to find some i said theyre flying over the banyan forest tomorrow morning thin arms folded across his chest tomorrow thats what he said flying in what a plane owned by a man named harry amalfi good lord those are junk heaps harry bought them from surplus years ago expecting me to hire him to dust crops i decided to use only organic pest control tried to explain it to him even after i compensated him he convinced himself i ruined him you paid him anyway said robin i gave him something because hed taken initiative i suggested he use the money to open a car repair business he and his son know how to do that instead he spent every penny and hasnt taken any initiative since theres no reason to go up in one of those rattletraps what do they expect to see the forest theres nothing down there the area is mostly navy land the rest public domain that would have been cleared long ago except that its not safe land mines left by the japanese and whos going to fly them harry hasnt been up in years and he drinks picker has a pilots license he shook his head i must have a talk with them those land mines are a real danger if he tries to land i had barbed wire put up along the eastern wall of my property to make sure no one climbed over id better go up there right now he may not be receptive i said oh yes youre probably right tomorrow morning then now in terms of your recreation here at the house we dont get television reception but the radio in your room should be working theres also a small library on the other side of the dining room he gave a little wave converted silver room you may not find much of interest there mostly condensed books and biographies there are many more books in your office and mine periodicals come in with the provisions if theres something specific youre interested in reading ill do my best to find it for you he bent slowly and petted spike well ill let you go now is there anything you need robin said its so pleasant out i thought we might walk some more moreland nodded happily have you noticed the sweetness in the air ive planted for aroma frangipani nightblooming jasmine old roses all sorts of things picker said the soil isnt good i said hes right about that any residues of volcanic ash have drifted into the jungle and the rest of the island is too high in salt and silica in some places the dirt only goes down a couple of feet before you hit coral with the exception of a few pines planted by the japanese this place was scrub when i bought it i brought in boatloads of topsoil and amendments it took years its turned out fairly well would you like to see no forgive me i wont interrupt your walk wed love to said robin he blinked i believe youre being kind to an old bore but at my age one takes what one gets lets go little doggy behind the house was a courtyard planted with privethedged rose gardens and precisely cut flower beds big conifers some pruned in the spare graceful japanese style then looser plantings of palm and fern and crushed rock walkways lined with lowgrowing lilies artfully placed spotlights allowed just enough illumination for safe passage the botanic perfumes blended in strange combinations sometimes the result was cloying it goes back a ways said moreland pointing to a wooden arbor at the rear of the lawn to the side highvoltage spots exposed a grass tennis court without a net then more grass off to the left stood a group of flatroofed buildings one huge hangarlike structure and several smaller sheds moreland led us to them saying its too dark to see but ive got all sorts of things behind the arbor citrus plum peach table grapes bananas vegetables feel free to go picking tomorrow everythings safe to eat are you selfsufficient i said for the most part meat and fish and dairy products i buy for the staff and guests i used to keep a goat herd for milk but we didnt consume enough to justify it as i wrote you i conduct nutritional research sometimes theres surplus for the village do people in the village grow anything a bit he said its not an agricultural culture as we got closer to the outbuildings he said those are my offices and labs and warehouses your office is the nearest bungalow and ive set aside studio space for you as well robin right next door a nice room with northern exposure and a skylight my wife used to paint there hows your wrist doing better he stopped again may i lifting her arm he flexed the joint very gently no crepitus good ice for acute inflammation and follow up with warmth for pain keep it relaxed and it should knit nicely the southern lagoon stays very nice all year round swimmings a lowresistance exercise that will strengthen the muscles without unduly stressing the joint releasing her arm he looked out into the darkness i should probably dig up some of that lawn ridiculously labor intensive and useless but i grew up on a ranch and the smell of new grass brings me back to my childhood a ranch where i said sonoma california father grew santa rosa plums and pinot noir grapes we continued walking do you see patients here i said no thats done at the clinic in town the xray machine is there and its a lot more convenient for the villagers so what kinds of labs do you have here research i have a longstanding interest in alternative pesticides are either of you squeamish about what said robin natural predation he blinked spineless creatures if theyre crawling all over me i am he laughed i certainly hope not dear if youre ever interested i have some very interesting specimens you keep live specimens here he turned to pat her shoulder under lock and key in that big building over there im sorry dear i should have told you sometimes i forget how people get no its all right she said when i was a kid i had a tarantula as a pet i didnt know that i said she laughed neither did my parents a friend gave it to me when her mother made her get rid of it i hid it in a shoebox in my closet for weeks then my mother discovered it one of the more memorable episodes of my childhood i have tarantulas said moreland excitement tinged his voice theyre really quite wonderful once you get to know them mine wasnt that big maybe an inch long i think it was from italy probably an italian wolf spider lycosa tarentula heres something for you alex the bite of the italian wolf was once thought to cause madness weeping and stumbling and dancing thats how the tarantella dance got its name nonsense of course the little things harmless wish you could have been there to convince my mother said robin she flushed it moreland winced if youd like to see another one i can oblige sure she said if its okay with you alex i stared at her back home she called upon me to swat mosquitoes and flies love to see it i said mr macho im afraid youd best leave him outside though said moreland looking at spike dogs are still basically wolves and wolves are predators with all the hormonal secretions that entails little scurrying things may set off an aggressive response in him i dont want to upset him or them humans are predators too i said most definitely said moreland but we seem to be naturally afraid of them and they can deal with that we tied spike to a tree gave him a cheeseflavored dog cracker and told him wed be back soon moreland took us to the hangarlike building the entrance was a gray metal door the japanese officers bath house he said releasing a key lock they had herbal mudpits here wet and dry steam fresh and saltwater pools the saltwater was brought up from the beach in trucks he flipped a switch and light flooded a windowless room white tile on all surfaces empty another gray door closed no lock careful now he said i have to keep the light dim there are thirteen steps down opening the second door he flicked one of a series of toggles and a weak pale blue haze stuttered to life thirteen steps he reiterated and he counted out loud as we followed him down a stone flight grasping cold metal handrails the interior was much cooler than the main house at the bottom was a sunken area maybe sixty feet long concrete walls and floors the floors were marked by several rectangles seams where concrete had been poured to fill the baths narrow windows so high they nearly touched the ceiling let in feeble dots of moonlight translucent wire glass the blue light came from a few fluorescent bulbs mounted vertically on the walls as my eyes got accustomed to the dimness i made out another flight of stairs at the far end a raised work space desk and chair storage cabinets lab tables a wide aisle spined through the center of the sunken area metal ribs on both sides ten rows of steel tables bolted to the concrete the tables housed dozens of tengallon aquariums covered by wire mesh lids some tanks were completely dark others glowed pink gray lavender more blue random spurts of sound from within flutterings and scratchings sudden stabs the ping of something hard against glass the panic of attempted escape a strange mixture of smells filled my nose decayed vegetation excreta peat moss wet grain boiled meat then something sweet fruit on the verge of rot robins hand in mine was as cold as the handrails welcome said moreland to my little zoo he led us past the first two rows and stopped at the third some sort of classification system would have been clever but i know where everyone is and im the one who feeds them turning left he stopped at a dark tank inside was a floor of mulch and leaves above it a tangle of bare branches nothing else that i could see he pulled something out of his pocket and held it between his fingers a pellet not unlike spikes kibble the wire lid was clamped he loosened it and pushed exposing a corner inserting two fingers he dangled the pellet at first nothing happened then quicker than i believed possible the mulch heaved as if in the grip of a tiny earthquake and something shot up a second later the food was gone robin pressed herself against me moreland hadnt moved whatever had taken the pellet had disappeared australian garden wolf said moreland securing the top cousin of your italian friend like tarantula they burrow and wait looks as if you know what it likes said robin i heard the difference in her voice but a stranger might not have what she likes this ones quite the lady is animal protein preferably in liquid form spiders always liquefy their food i combine insects worms mice whatever and create a broth that i freeze and defrost this is the same stuff compressed and freezedried i did it to see if theyd adapt to solids luckily many of them did he smiled strange avocation for a vegetarian right but whats the choice shes my responsibility come with me perhaps we can bring back some memories he opened another aquarium at the end of the row but this time he shoved his arm in drew out something and placed it on his forearm one of the vertical bulbs was close enough to highlight its form on his pale flesh a spider dark hairy just over an inch long it crawled slowly up toward his shoulder does this resemble what your mother found dear robin licked her lips yes her name is gina to the spider now at his collar good evening señora then to robin would you like to hold her i guess a new friend gina as if understanding the spider stopped moreland lifted it tenderly and placed it in robins palm it didnt budge then it lifted its head and seemed to study her its mouth moved an eerie lip sync youre cute gina we can send one to your mother i said for old times sake she laughed and the spider stopped again then moving with mechanical precision it walked to the edge of her palm and peered over the edge nothing down there but floor said robin guess youd like to go back to daddy moreland removed it stroked its belly placed it back in its home walked on pulling out his doctors penlight he pointed out specimens colorless spiders the size of ants spiders that looked like ants a delicate green thing with translucent limecolored legs a sticklike australian hygropoda marvel of energy conservation the slender build prevents it from overheating a hugefanged arachnid whose brickred carapace and lemonyellow abdomen were so vivid they resembled costume jewelry a bornean jumper whose big black eyes and hairy face gave it the look of a wise old man look at this he said im sure youve never seen a web like this pointing to a zigzag construction like crimped paper argiope an orb spinner customtailored to attract the bee it loves to eat that central x reflects ultraviolet light in a manner that brings the bees to it all webs are highly specific with incredible tensile strength many use several types of silk many are pigmented with an eye toward particular prey most are modified daily to adapt to varying circumstances some are used as mating beds all in all a beautiful deceit his hands flew and his head bobbed with each sentence he grew more animated i knew i was anthropomorphizing but the creatures seemed excited too emerging from the shadows to show themselves not the panic id heard before smooth almost leisurely motions a dance of mutual interest why i concentrate on predators moreland was saying why im so concerned with keeping them fit a brilliant pink crablike thing rested atop his bony hand of course natural predation is nothing new back in nineteen twentyfive levuana moths threatened the entire coconut crop on fiji tachinid parasites were brought in and they did the job beautifully the following year a particularly voracious destructor scale was done in by the coccinellid beetle and im sure you know gardeners have used ladybugs on aphids for years i breed them to protect my citrus trees as a matter of fact he pointed to an aquarium that seemed to be red carpeted a finger against the glass made the carpet move thousands of miniature volkswagens a ladybug traffic jam so simple so practical but the key is keeping them nutritionally robust we moved further up the row and he stopped and breathed deeply if it werent for public prejudice this beauty and her compatriots could be trained to clear homes of rats shining the penlight into a dark tank he revealed something half covered by leaves it crawled out slowly and my stomach lurched three inches wide and more than twice that length legs as thick as pencils hairs as coarse as boar bristle it remained inert as the light washed over it then it opened its mouth wide yawning and stroked the orifice with clawlike pincers as moreland undid the mesh i found myself stepping back in went his hand another pellet dangled unlike the australian wolf this one took the food lazily almost coyly this is emma and shes spoiled one of the spiders legs nudged his finger rubbing it this is the tarantula of bmovies but shes really a grammostola from the amazon in her natural habitat she eats small birds lizards mice even venomous snakes which she immobilizes then crushes can you see the advantages for pest control why doesnt she use her own venom i said most spider venom cant do harm except to very small prey you can be sure spoiled madame emma wouldnt have the patience to wait for the toxin to take effect despite her apparent indolence shes quite eager when she gets hungry all wolves are they got their name because they chase their prey down i must confess theyre my favorite so bright they quickly recognize individuals and they respond to kindness all tarantulae do thats why your little lycosa made such a good pet robin robins eyes remained on the monster moreland said she likes you i sure hope so oh yes she definitely does when she doesnt care for someone she turns her head away quite the debutante not that i bring people in here very often they need their peace he petted the huge spider removed his hand and covered the aquarium insects and arachnids are magnificent structurally and functionally im sure youve heard all the clichés about how theyre competing with us will eventually drive us to extinction nonsense some species become quite successful but many others are fragile and dont survive for years entomologists have been trying to figure out what leads to success the popular academic model is monomorium pharaonisthe common ant many tenures have been granted on studies of what makes monomorium tick the conventional wisdom is that there are three important criteria resistance to dehydration cooperative colonies with multiple fertile queens and the ability to relocate the colony quickly and efficiently but there are insects with those exact traits who fail and others like the carpenter ant whove done quite well despite having none of them he shrugged a puzzle he resumed the tour pointing out walking stick bugs mantises with serrated jaws giant madagascar hissing cockroaches topped with chitinous armor dung beetles rolling their fetid treasures like giant medicine balls stout black carrion beetles imagine what they could do to solve the landfill problems youve got over on the mainland tank after tank of crawling climbing darting crackling slithering things i stay away from butterflies and moths too shortlived and they need flying room to be truly happy all my guests adapt well to close quarters and many of them achieve amazing longevity my lycosas ten years old and some spiders live double or triple that amount am i boring you no said robin her eyes were wide and it didnt seem like fear theyre all impressive but emma her size yes he walked quickly to a tank in the last row larger than the others at least twenty gallons inside several rocks formed a cave that shadowed a woodchip floor my brontosaurus he said his ancestors probably did coexist with the dinosaurs pointing to what seemed to be an extension of the rock i stayed back looking steeling myself for another heartstopping movement nothing then it was there without moving taking shape before my eyes what id thought to be a slab of rock was organic extending out of the cave flat bodied segmented like a braided brown leather whip seven eight inches long legs on each segment antennae as thick as cello strings twitching antennae i moved further back waiting for moreland to play the pellet game he put his face up against the glass more slithered out of the cave at least a foot long spikes at the tail end quivered moreland tapped the glass and several pairs of feet pawed the air then a lunging motion a sound like snapping fingers what is it said robin the giant centipede of east asia this one stowed away on one of the supply boats last year bradys as a matter of fact i obtain a lot of my specimens that way i thought of our ride on the madeleine sleeping below deck wearing only bathing trunks hes significantly more venomous than most spiders he said and i havent named him yet havent quite trained him to love me how venomous is significant i said theres only one recorded fatality a sevenyearold boy in the philippines the most common problem is secondary infection gangrene limb loss can occur have you ever been bitten i asked often he smiled but only by human children who didnt wish to be vaccinated very impressive i said hoping we were through but another pellet was between morelands fingers and before i knew it another corner of mesh had been drawn back no dangling this time he dropped the food into the centipedes cage from a onefoot height the animal ignored it moreland said have it your way and refastened the top he headed up the central aisle and we were right behind him thats it i hope i havent repulsed you so your nutritional research is about them i said primarily they have much to teach us i also study web patterns various other things fascinating said robin i stared at her she smiled from the corner of her mouth her hand had warmed her fingers began tickling my palm then dropped crawling down my inner wrist i tried to pull away but she held me fast full smile im glad you feel that way dear said moreland some people are repelled no telling later in our suite i tried to extract revenge by coming up behind her as she removed her makeup and lightly scratching her neck she squealed and shot to her feet grabbing for me and we ended up on the floor i got on top and tickled her some more fascinating all of a sudden im living with spiderwoman shall we begin a new hobby when we get back she laughed first thing lets learn the recipe for those pellets actually it was fascinating alex though now that im out of there its starting to feel creepy again the size of some of them i said it wasnt a typical evening thats for sure what do you think of our host mucho eccentric but courtly sweet dear i dont mind that from him hes from another generation and despite his age hes still passionate i like passion in a man she freed an arm and ran it up mine coochiecoo i pinioned her ah my little lycosa i am passionate too she reached around so it seems i bared my teeth hold me and crush me arachnodella liquefy me you scoff she said but just think what i could do with six more hands the next morning swim fins snorkels towels and masks were waiting for us at the breakfast table jeeps out in front said gladys we ate quickly and found the vehicle parked near the fountain one of those barebones canvastop models that kids in beverly hills and san marino favor when pretending to be rural this one was the real thing clouded plastic windows rough white paint no fourfigure stereo system just as i started the engine the pickers burst out of the house waving hitch a ride into town lyman called out they were in khakis again with bush hats binoculars hung around his neck and a big yellow smile opened in his beard seeing as this used to be our borrowed vehicle dont see how you can decently refuse wouldnt think of it i said they climbed in the back thanks said jo her eyes were bloodshot and her mouth looked tight from robins lap spike grumbled talk about brachycephaly said picker is he able to breathe apparently said robin where would you like me to drop you i said ill direct you terrible shocks on this thing so watch for potholes i drove through the gates the jeep gliding on the fresh blacktop speeding along the palmlined road soon the ocean came into view trueblue unperturbed by breakers as we neared the harbor the water swooped toward us driving toward it was like tumbling into a box of sapphires i remembered pams comment about a big blue slap in the face picker said did you notice the rotary phones in the house thank god its not two cans and a string robin put her hand on my leg and turned back to him smiling if you dont like it why stay we do like it said jo quickly excellent question ms craftsperson said her husband if it were up to me we would not be staying if it were up to me we would not be staying within a thousand miles of this isle but dr wifes research is urgent heard you saw the zooette last night rich mans version of firefly in a jar no systemization scientifically its a waste of time spike reared his head and stared picker tried to pet him but he backed away and curled up in robins lap again male dogs said picker always go for the femmes thats not true ly said his wife when i was little we had a miniature schnauzer and he preferred my father because dearest hed met your mother he didnt mind laughing by himself hormones dogs go after women men go after bitches he began humming spike growled not a music fan said picker on the contrary said robin he likes melody but sour notes drive him wild at front street picker said go right i drove north parallel to the waterfront no boats were in dock and the gas station was still closed a fuelrationing schedule posted on the pump a couple of children rode bikes up and down the waterfront a woman pushed a baby stroller men sat with their feet in the water and one lay stretched out on the dock sleeping wheres the airfield just keep going we passed the shops a saltwater tang hung in the air the temperature was a perfect eighty the windows of auntie maes trading post were filled with faded tshirts and souvenirs and signs above the entrance advertising postal service and snacks and check cashing next door was the aruk market two openair stalls of fruit and vegetables a few women squeezed and bagged the merchandise as we passed a couple of them smiled the adjoining building was white and shuttered with a budweiser sign long depleted of neonslims orchid bar skinny ragged specimens slouched in front longnecks in hand the chop suey palace facade was red with gold lettering and stone fu dogs guarded the door three outdoor tables were set up in front a darkhaired man sat at one of them drinking a beer and pushing something around his plate with chopsticks he looked up but didnt smile next came more stores all empty some of the windows boarded then a freshly whitewashed block structure with several cars parked in front and a sign claiming municipal centernorth beach began as more barrier reef and palms sand dunes spotted with clumps of whiteflowered beach plum to the right a paved road twisted up the hillside the stucco houses at the top had been turned to vanilla fudge by the morning sun i spotted a church steeple and a copper peak below it is that where the clinic is yup said picker keep going no more outlets appeared as we continued to hug the islands upper shore no keyhole harbor on the north side and the water was a little more active scattered swimmers stroked lazily and sunbathers offered themselves like bits of cookie batter but birds outnumbered the human population by far droves of them searching the waters edge for breakfast front street ended at a sixslot parking area to the east was a fifteenfoot wall of untrimmed bamboo handlettered signs read private property and dead end no outlet picker leaned forward and pointed over my shoulder at a break in the bamboo in there i turned up a dirt path so narrow that bamboo brushed the sides of the jeep a hundredyard drive brought a house into view more cape cod than tahiti its splintering planks hadnt been white in a long time the front porch was piled high with junk and a stovepipe vent spouted from the tar roof the property was wide and flat maybe fifteen acres of red dirt walled by bamboo the tall plants along the rear border looked puny backed by two hundred feet of sheer black rock the western edge of the volcanic range the mountains hurled shadows so dark and defined they resembled paint splotches a smaller house sat fifty feet behind the first same construction and condition with a strangelooking doorway bright white gingerbread molding that didnt fit between the two buildings rested half the fuselage of a propeller plane its sheetmetal edges sliced cleanly the rest of the acreage was a grimy sculpture garden peppered with more plane carcasses heaps of parts and a few craft left intact as i pulled up a man wearing only dirty denim cutoffs came out of the bigger house knuckling his eyes and shoving limp yellow hair out of his face the younger of the shark butchers wed seen yesterday picker drew back the jeeps plastic window flap wheres your father skip the man rubbed his eyes again side his voice was thick and hoarse and peevish were renting a plane from him this morning skip tried to digest that finally he said yeah wheres the takeoff strip ly said jo anywhere we please these arent jumbo jets lets get going the two of them climbed out of the jeep and picker went up to skip and began talking jo hung back mouth still busy hands plucking at her vest poor thing said robin shes scared as i started to turn the jeep around another barechested man came out of the house flowered boxer shorts the same wide face as skip but thirty years older sloping shoulders and a monumental gut what was left of his hair was tangray a twoweek beard coated a face made for suspicion he pointed at us and approached the jeep you the doctors new guests heavy voice like his son but not as sleepy amalfi his tiny blue eyes were bloodshot but alert his nose so flat it was almost flush the beard was patchy and ingrown the skin it didnt cover was a ruin of mounds and puckers whats that you got french bulldog never saw nothing like that in france robin stroked spike and harry amalfi drew back his head having a good time miss very much so doctor treating you good she nodded well dont count on it he licked a finger and held it to the wind wanna go up in the air too no thanks he laughed started coughing and spat on the ground nervous maybe some other time dont worry miss my planes are all greased and tuned im the only way to fly around here thanks for the offer i said and completed the turn amalfi put his hands on his hips and watched us hitching up his shorts the pickers had gone inside the house with skip as i drove away i glanced back and got a closer look at the smaller house the white molding around the door was a ring of sharks jaws i got on front street and drove back toward south beach the man with the chopsticks was still in front of the palace and this time he stood as we approached and waved his arms as if hailing a cab i pulled over and he trotted to the curb he was around forty average height and narrow build with black hair combed down over his forehead and a black mustache too thin to see from a distance the rest of his face was sallow and smooth nearly hairless he wore wide black porsche sunglasses a shortsleeved blue buttondown shirt seersucker pants and topsiders back at his table was a stuffed filofax next to a platter of noodlesandsomething and three empty sapporos he said tom creedman in a tone that said we should recognize the name when we didnt he smiled unhappily and clicked his tongue la right right new york he said pointing to his chest before that dc used to work in the news business he paused then dropped the names of a tv network and two major newspapers ah i said as if all was clear his smile warmed up care to join me for a beer i looked at robin she nodded we got out and went over to his table spike in tow he looked at the dog but didnt say anything then he stuck his head in the restaurants open door jacqui a statuesque woman came out dishcloth balled in one hand her long dark hair was thick and wavy crowning a fulllipped golden face a few lines but young skin her age was hard to gauge anywhere from twentyfive to fortyfive the new guests up at knife castle creedman told her a round for everyone jacqui smiled at us welcome to aruk something to eat said creedman i know its early but ive found chinese for breakfast a great pickmeup probably all the soy sauce gets that blood pressure up no thanks okay said creedman to jacqui just beers she left knife castle said robin local nickname for your lodgings didnt you know the japanese owned this island morelands manse was their headquarters they used the locals as slaves to do all the dirty work imported more then macarthur decided to take over everything from hawaii to tokyo and bombed the hell out of them when the surviving japanese soldiers were trying to entrench the slaves grabbed any sharp thing they could find left their barracks and finished the job knife island i said dr moreland said it was because of the shape creedman laughed sounds like youve done some research i said old habits jacqui brought the beers and he threw a dollar tip at her she looked irritated and left quickly creedman lifted a bottle but instead of drinking rubbed the top of his hand against the glass what brings you here i said little winddown from reality running with the beltway movers and shakers too long you covered politics in all its sleazy splendor he raised his bottle to island torpor the beer was icecold and terrific robin took my hand creedman stroked the bottle some more then the filofax im working on a book nonfiction novel lifechanges isolation internal revolution the island mystique as it relates to the endofthecentury zeitgeist he smiled cant really say more sounds interesting i said my publisher hopes so got them to pay me enough so theyll break their asses promoting is aruk your only subject or have you been to other islands been traveling for over a year tahiti fiji tonga the marshalls guam rest of the marianas came here last year to start writing because the place is dead no distractions taking a long swallow he gave yet another closedmouth laugh so how long will you be here probably a couple of months i said what exactly are you here for helping dr moreland organize his data medical data whatever hes got any specific diseases youre looking at no just a general overview for a book if theres a book in it youre a psychologist right right so he wants you to analyze his patients psychologically were still discussing the specifics he smiled whats that your version of no comment i smiled back my version of were still discussing the specifics he turned to robin and you robin whats your project im on vacation good for you he faced me again another beer no thanks good stuff isnt it most of the packaged goods that get over here are from japan marked up two three hundred percent ultimate revenge he drained his bottle and put it down ill have you guys over for dinner where do you live i said just up there he tilted his head toward the hillside spent a few days up at morelands but couldnt take it too intense he is something isnt he he seems very dedicated easy to be dedicated when youre loaded did you know his father was a big san francisco investment honcho i shook my head big bucks mega owned a brokerage house some banks ranchland all over wine country morelands an only child inherited the whole kit and k how else could he keep that place going not that its going to matter lost cause what is said robin saving this place i dont want to put a downer on your trip but aruks on the way out no natural resources no industry no industriousness talk about your slackers look at that beach they dont even have the energy to swim the smart ones keep leaving only a matter of time before it looks like one of those cartoon desert islands shipwrecked loser under a palm tree i hope not said robin its so beautiful creedman inched closer to her maybe so robin but lets face it ebb and flow is part of the life rhythm thats a theme of my book how much of the islands decline is due to the navys blocking the southern road i said have you been to stanton no if thats a base im a sea anemone the only incoming flights are to feed and clothe the skeleton crew that runs the place letting a few sailors come into town to get drunk and laid doesnt create a viable economy what happens to stanton after the island closes down who knows maybe the navy will sell the island or maybe theyll just let it sit here the base has no strategic value not since the cold war ended main thing is theres no constituency here seagulls dont vote so you dont think the navys intentionally shutting the island down who told you that a guest up at the estate suggested it dr picker he chuckled kind of an asshole isnt he couple more weeks in the sun hell be spotting amelia earhart skinnydipping in the lagoon with judge crater sure you dont want another i shook my head actually said robin petting spike we were going to do some snorkeling we stood and i tried to put money on the table on me said creedman how often do i get to have an intelligent conversation and your pooch is okay too didnt pee on me he walked us back to the jeep i like to cook have you up for dinner sometime we got in the car he leaned into robins window and took off his sunglasses his eyes were small and very dark scanning slowly there was a good reason for blockading the south road he said public safety disease control i said if you consider murder a disease it happened half a year ago local girl found on the beach right where youre headed raped and mangled pretty badly the details never came out moreland can give them to you he did the autopsy villagers were sure the murderer was some sailor because that kind of thing just doesnt happen here right at least not since they massacred the japanese he chuckled some of the young bloods worked themselves up and started hiking up to stanton for a têteàtête with captain ewing navy guards stopped them a little civil unrest resulted soon after the navy started building that blockade he shrugged sorry to darken your day but one thing ive learned the only real escape is in your head putting his shades back on he walked back to his table scooped up his filofax and went inside the restaurant i started up the jeep shifted into first and pulled away just as i shifted into second the sound hit a giant paper bag being popped then a swirling black plume spiraled up from behind the volcano tips rising high above them inking the perfect sky spikes neck was bowtight he growled and sniffed the air and began to bark the people on the dock pointed up at the explosion robins hand was clamped around my wrist navy maneuvers i said at a nonfunctional base i reversed the jeep quickly as i passed the chop suey palace jacqui stepped out still holding her dishtowel her curiosity and fear stayed in my head as i sped back to the airfield harry amalfi stood near his house looking dazed studying the black smoke as if it bore a message we drove up right behind him and got out but he didnt move shouts made all three of us pivot skip amalfi and the other shark carver were running toward us the older man wore bathing trunks too long for his stocky legs harry amalfi said its a good craft was said skip amalfis companion his voice was soft his eyes rainwater gray very closeset skip said maybe he fucked up and flooded the engine or something dad amalfi turned back to the sky the smoke was thinning and curling the other man shaded his eyes and looked upward too looks like it might have gone down right over stanton probably said skip probably right on the fucking tarmac his father started to say something then shuffled back toward his front porch want me to call over there said skip see if it went down there amalfi didnt answer pulling a bandana out of his pocket he wiped his face and kept trudging shit deal said skips companion the gray eyes washed over robin then checked to see if i was watching i was he nodded major shit said skip he probably did flood it skip turned to us dumb fuck said he knew how to fly did he just met him yesterday i said he shook his head disgustedly probably got it up there and flooded it first thing said the grayeyed man pushing his hand through wild curly hair his poor wife said robin she didnt want to go asshole said he knew what he was doing said skip you guys come back here for something we returned to the jeep and i drove toward the bamboo thatch just as i was about to turn onto the dirt path jo picker came running out hatless her big purse flopping against her thigh her mouth was open and her eyes were wide and blank she kept coming toward us and i jammed the brakes slapping her hands on the jeeps hood she stared at us through the windshield robin jumped out and embraced her spike wanted to jump out but i restrained him he hadnt relaxed since the explosion all that remained in the sky were gray wisps jo said no oh god no she struggled away from robin and i saw her mouth contort off in the distance skip and the grayeyed man watched we finally got her in the jeep and drove home she cried softly till we got through the big open gates and close to the house then we had a i was planning to go but i got scared ben was already outside kiko on his shoulder along with gladys and a crew of men in work clothes this close i could still see hints of smoke the noise would have been louder up here jo had stopped crying and looked stunned robin helped ease her out of the jeep and she and gladys walked her into the house ben said so it was him i wasnt sure he couldnt have been up long not long at all did you see the plane we saw a bunch of them when we dropped him off junk he said whole thing was stupid no point amalfis son said he might have come down on the base or darn close to it forget about retrieving the body he turned to the house why didnt she go up with him cold feet i nodded well she was the smart one he said you try to tell people dr bill talked to picker this morning picker just got rude does dr bill know yet said robin he nodded i called him at the clinic hes on his way up my first thought was some sort of military maneuver i said does the navy ever shoot anything in the air the only things that fly in and out of there are big transports if one of those went down youd think the volcano had erupted a white subcompact came barreling through the gates and stopped short scattering gravel police was stenciled in blue on the door pam moreland was in the front passenger seat a man was driving they both got out pam looked frightened the man was goodlooking in his late twenties and huge six four two fifty with nosetackle shoulders and enormous hands his skin was bronze with islander features but his hair was light brown and his eyes pale hazel he had on a shortsleeved skyblue shirt and razorcreased blue pants over military laceups a silver badge was pinned to the breast pocket but he had no club or gun pam matched his stride this is terrible she said the big man clasped bens hand hey he said in a deep voice ben said hey dennis some mess folks meet dennis laurent our chief of police laurent shook both our hands noticed spike and suppressed a smile his gaze was intense anyone know how many people were in the plane he said just lyman picker i said his wife started to go but changed her mind shes in the house he shook his head cant remember anything like this never happened said ben because no one goes up in harrys heaps you figure it crashed on stanton either there or right near the eastern border i called ewing got put on hold finally his aide says hes busy will get back to me busy said ben with scorn laurent said the wifes probably going to want details he put on mirrored sunglasses and looked around some more guess shes in no shape now shes in shock said robin yeah said laurent let me know if she wants to talk to me or if theres anything i can do for her werent they supposed to be leaving soon in a week or so said pam shes just about finished her work laurent nodded weather research she came into the station a couple of weeks ago with this little laptop computer wanting to know if we kept storm records i told her we really never got the big ones so we didnt any idea why her husband went up in the first place to take pictures of the jungle said ben prove to his colleagues hed been here he was a scientist too right botanist so what was he looking at the banyans he wasnt really working said pam told us he was bored tagging along after her probably made him feel like a third foot maybe he just wanted to do some flying laurent digested that well too bad he picked this time and place harry probably should have been closed down but like you said no one used him i hope the wife doesnt think were going to be able to do any big faatype investigation if he went down in the jungle well be lucky to get the body he shook his head again pam had been standing close to him and she moved nearer a downward flick of a hazel eye acknowledged her presence laurent put his hands in his pockets and stretched the fabric with his fists then he looked at the jeep the diving gear still piled on the back seat someone snorkeling we were on our way when it happened said robin we were vacationing howd the kids at the clinic react i said they dont know exactly what happened yet she said some of them looked up when they heard the noise but their minds were on their shots we just kept the line going for a while and then broke for a snack how many shots did you get through said ben about half we were going to finish this afternoon but i guess not planning to dive at south beach lagoon laurent asked us yes said robin its beautiful there he said give it another go when youre ready life generally goes smoothly here pam walked him back to his car and stayed to talk after he got behind the wheel ben called out kikos name and the monkey and spike followed us into the house cheryl was washing the front rooms big windows and didnt turn to acknowledge us except for the hiss of the glasscleaner spray the interior was silent robin said i think ill go up and see how jos doing she hurried up the stairs something to drink ben asked me no thanks we had a couple of beers in town a guy named creedman was buying oh he stared straight ahead whered he snag you front of the palace does he make a habit of snagging people there thats his spot i figured hed go for you being outsiders and all that he used to live here for a while he mentioned that did he also mention he was asked to leave no he said it was too intense an environment for him intense i guess you could say that he turned and looked me in the eye the thing you need to understand is that dr bill is the most hospitable person youll ever meet anyone visits the island they get an invite thats how the pickers ended up here and after meeting them you can see what a patient man dr bill is creedman was also extended hospitality he was up here for only three days when we found him snooping around snooping where dr bills office i caught him redhanded not that theres anything to hide but patient infos confidential except of course for something scientific like you and dr bill are doing some thanks for hospitality huh did he have an excuse nope his jaw bunched the way it had when picker had asked him to serve drinks and he pushed his aviators up his nose he tried to laugh it off said he was taking a walk and had just wandered in looking for something to read except the books were in the back room and he was in the front so give me a break i called him on it and he told me to screw myself then he complained to dr bill that id harassed him dr bill might have tolerated the snooping but he didnt appreciate creedman badmouthing me did he badmouth us some more not really i said but he did say the reason the southern road was blockaded was because of a murder half a year ago a local girl killed on the beach and passions toward the navy got high the guy makes like hes an ace reporter probably told you he was a media hotshot right truth is he was strictly smalltime and keep him away from ms castagna he thinks hes gods gift to women so i noticed but she can handle herself my wife can too but he still annoyed her right after i kicked him out came up to her in the market making small talk offering to carry her bags real subtle he shoved his glasses harder did you meet the owner of the palace a tall woman named jacqui i nodded he came on to her too till he found out she was chief laurents mother she looks way too young shes in her forties had dennis when she was a teenager she and dennis are good people he was a couple of grades behind me jacquis half islander half cauc originally from saipan denniss dad was a french sea captain used to run cargo boats between the bigger islands died at sea just before dennis was born she raised him right anyway do what you want but in my humble opinion creedmans someone to avoid he just hangs out all day acting superior he told us he was working on a book maybe a book on beer his laugh was merciless speaking of unwanted attention i said the guy who was working on the shark with skip amalfi seemed to notice robin too any potential problems there thats anders haygood hes a bit of a lowlife but no problems with him so far came over a year ago mostly keeps to himself lives in back of harrys place working for harry odd jobs now and then once in a while someone brings them an appliance to fix or a car to tune basically he and skip are beach bums and harrys an old bum he laughed im some chamber of commerce huh by now you probably think aruks nothing but lowlife but between skip and harry and haygood and creedman youve just about exhausted the list everyone else is great youll end up having a great time he wasnt mr charm said robin but to go like that we were up in the sitting room of our suite no sounds came through the wall bordering jo pickers room hows jo i said wiped out she decided to call his family i left her trying to get a phone connection i know its trite but one moment youre talking to someone the next theyre gone she put her head on my chest and i traced her jawline howre you doing i said with what vacation she laughed is that what it is no im fine assuming weve used up all the bad vibes nothing but sunshine and sweetness ahead ben assures me weve exhausted the islands supply of miscreants i told her about creedmans snooping his hitting on jacqui and claire romero im not surprised she said when we were sitting there he put his hand on my knee what its okay honey i handled it i didnt see a thing it happened right at the beginning when jacqui came out to take our order you looked up for a second and he made his move no big deal i ended it how pinched the top of his hand she grinned hard with my nails he didnt react i said nope just kept on talking and cooled the hand on his beer bottle i remembered that bastard forget it alex i know the type he wont try it again someone else noticed you i said at the airfield skip amalfis buddy that wildhaired guy now that i think about it both he and skip were probably ogling you the minute we stepped off the boat probably a woman shortage dont worry ill stick close to home work on my pinching dont you think creedmans behavior is pretty risky for a small place like this you should have seen bens face when he talked about creedman coming on to his wife maybe thats his kick she said that stupid thrillofthehunt thing or maybe aruks such a peaceful place that the locals are able to laugh him off as a fool it certainly doesnt seem to be highcrime the police chiefs unarmed i noticed that probably why everyone was so sure the murderer was a sailor does the murder bother you i didnt love hearing about it but one homicide a year is heaven compared to la right according to ben it wasnt the reason for the blockade what was i thought back he didnt say hes an interesting fellow she said in what way nice but a bit hard dont you think like the way he reacted to the crash angry at picker no sympathy picker gave him a hard time i said but youre right it was cold maybe its his training as a nurse struggling to save people and then watching someone take what he thought was a stupid risk or maybe hes just one of those perfectionists incapable of suffering fools he seems awfully meticulous proprietary about moreland and aruk too now morelands getting old and aruks having problems so he could be under stress could be she said aruks definitely having problems all those businesses boarded up and did you see the gas ration sign in town how do you think people make a living in his letters moreland said fishing and some crafts but i havent seen much sign of either bens educated could live anywhere so perhaps he stays here because of some special commitment yes it must be hard for him she snuggled closer it is lovely though look at those mountains want to try diving tomorrow maybe she closed her eyes id like everything to go smoothly for you i said dont worry ill have a great time hows your wrist she laughed much better and i pledge to go to bed on time and drink my milk i know i know its okay honey you like to take care of me its not just that for some reason after all these years i still feel i need to court you i know that too she said softly and slipped her hand under my shirt the phone woke us up moreland said oh were you sleeping im terribly sorry no problem i said whats up pickers accident i just wanted to make sure you were all right it was a shock but were fine i tried to warn him i want to reassure you that it was a freak event the last crash we had was in sixtythree when a military transport went down over the water nothing since i just feel terrible that your welcome has been interrupted by something like this dont worry about it bill i dropped in on mrs picker gave her some brandy shes resting peacefully good all right then alex sorry again for disturbing your rest he paused we can start working whenever youre ready just give me a call downstairs robin sat up and yawned who is it i covered the phone bill do you mind if i work a bit she shook her head im going to get up too ive got some time right now i told moreland well then he said i could show you your office come down when youre ready ill be waiting we found him sitting in an overstuffed chair near a picture window drinking orange juice his legs looked so thin they seemed to fold rather than cross he wore the same type of plain white shirt this time the baggy pants were gray the chained glasses rested low on his nose he stood closed his book and put it down leatherbound copy of flauberts léducation sentimentale have you read him son just madame bovary years ago a great realistic novel he said flaubert was excoriated for being realistic bending slowly he petted spike ive set up a little run for this fellow in a shaded area behind the rose garden that is if you feel comfortable leaving him alone is there a problem with his coming along not at all no zoo this morning come let me show you the smaller library he led us through the dining room pale blue with chippendale furniture we rarely dine here he said we go outside whenever we can the former silver room was on the other side of a mahogany door he opened it halfway salmon moiré walls two dark bookcases carved moldings crystal lamps dried flowers on the verge of disintegration sprouted from a huge famille verte vase he closed the door as i said youll probably have little use for it we continued through a waxedpine breakfast room yellow pantry industrial kitchen past wallfreezers and out the rear door ending on one of the rock paths the closest bungalow was the same light brown as the main house the roof tiles replaced with asphalt shingles inside the bungalow was a small cool room paneled beautifully with redgold koa and set up with an old but flawless walnut desk topped by a leather blotter a sterling silver inkwell and an electric typewriter another ceiling fan desultory rotations on the opposite wall was a brown couch and matching armchair some tables and lamps a carved japanese motif ran along the top of the paneling seashells and corals rested on high shelves below hung more of mrs morelands watercolors two small open windows let in the breeze and offered a long view of the entry to the estate the spray from the fountain sparkled like tivoli lights between spikes heavy breathing more of that same narcotic silence very nice i said behind the desk was a door that moreland opened revealing a much larger room with four walls of ceilinghigh bookcases the floor was crowded with high stacks of cardboard cartons brown columns rising nearly to the ceiling hundreds of boxes nearly filling the space randomly separated by narrow aisles moreland shrugged apologetically as you can see ive been waiting for you i laughed as much at his flamingo awkwardness as at the enormity of the task its shameful alex i wont insult you by making excuses i cant tell you how many times ive sat down to figure out some system of classification only to get overwhelmed and give up before i began is it alphabetized he rubbed one sandal against his shin a curiously boyish gesture after my first few years in practice i tried to alphabetize repeated the process every few years but somewhat haphazardly all in all there are probably a dozen or so independently alphabetized series he threw up his hands why pretend its virtually random but at least my handwritings not bad for a doctor robin grinned and i knew she was thinking of my scrawl i dont expect miracles said moreland skim peruse whatever tell me if anything jumps out at you ive always tried to include psychological and social data now permit me to show you your atelier dear the adjoining bungalow was identical but the interior walls were painted white more old but wellmaintained furniture a drafting table and stool easels a flat file disposable pallets still wrapped in plastic sat atop the file along with trays of oilpaint tubes acrylics and watercolors ink bottles pens charcoal sticks brushes in every shape and size everything brandnew the price tag on a brush was from an artists supply store in honolulu off to one side was a table full of shiny things shell said moreland cowry abalone motherofpearl some hardwood remnants as well and carving tools i bought them from an old man whose specialties were usmc insignia and leaping dolphins back when there was a trinket business robin picked up a small handsaw good quality this was barbara my wifes special place i know youre not carving right now but alex told me how gifted you were so i thought you might like to he trailed off and rubbed his hands together id love to said robin only when your hand permits of course its too bad you didnt get a chance to swim well try again good good would you like to stay here and look around dear or do you prefer to be there as alex discovers how truly disordered i am it was as gracious a way as any to ask for privacy theres plenty here to keep me busy bill robin said pick me up when youre done alex and you moreland said to spike watch i said walking to the door i said come spike the dog ran immediately to robin and flopped down at her feet moreland laughed impeccable taste when we were outside he said what a lovely girl youre lucky but i suppose you hear that all the time its nice to have someone in barbaras studio after all these years we began walking how long has it been thirty years this spring a few steps later she drowned not here hawaii shed gone there for a vacation i was busy with patients she went out for an earlymorning dip on waikiki beach she was a strong swimmer but got caught up in a riptide he stopped fished in his pocket drew out a battered eelskin wallet and extricated a small photo the blackhaired woman from the mantel portrait standing alone on a beach wearing a black onepiece bathing suit hair shorter than in the painting pinned back severely she looked no older than thirty moreland would have been at least forty the snapshot was faded gray sand the sky an insipid aqua the womans flesh nearly deadwhite the ocean that had claimed her was a thin line of foam she had a beautiful figure and smiled prettily but her pose legs together arms at her side had a tired almost resigned quality moreland blinked several times i gave him back the snapshot why dont we work our way downward he said lifting a box from the top of an outer column carrying it into the office and placing it on the floor between the couch and the armchair the carton was taped shut he cut the tape with a swiss army knife and pulled out several blue folders putting on his glasses he read one of all things handing me the folder he said this one isnt from aruk but it was a case of mine inside were stiff yellowed papers filled with elegant indigo fountainpenned writing that i recognized from the card hed left on the bed fortyyearold medical records of a man named samuel h you dont use full names i said generally i do but this was different i read samuel h had presented him with gastric complaints and thyroid problems that moreland had treated with synthetic hormones and words of reassurance for eleven months a month later several small benign nerve tumors were discovered and moreland raised the possibility of travel to guam for evaluation and surgery samuel h was unsure but before he could decide his health deteriorated further fatigue bruising hair loss bleeding lips and gums blood tests showed a precipitous drop in red blood cells accompanied by a sharp rise in white cells leukemia the patient expired seven months later moreland signing the certificate and directing the remains to a mortuary in a place called rongelap i asked where that was the marshall islands isnt that clear across the pacific i was stationed there after korea the navy sent me all over the region i closed the chart any thoughts he said all those symptoms could be due to radiation poisoning is rongelap near bikini atoll so you know about bikini just in general terms i said the government conducted nuclear tests there after world war two the winds shifted and polluted some neighboring islands twentythree blasts he said between nineteen fortysix and nineteen fiftyeight one hundred billion dollars worth of tests the first few were abombs dropped on old fleets captured from the japanese then they got confident and started detonating things underwater the big one was bravo in fiftyfour the worlds first hydrogen bomb but your average american has never heard of it isnt that amazing i nodded not amazed at all it broke the dawn with a seventyfivethousandfoot mushroom cloud son the dust blanketed several of the atolls kongerik and utirik and rongelap the children thought it was great fun a new kind of rain they played with the dust tasted it he got up walked to the window and braced himself on the sill shifting winds he said i believed that too i was a loyal officer it wasnt till years later that the truth came out the winds had been blowing east steadily for days before the test steadily and predictably there was no surprise the air force warned its own personnel so they could evacuate but not the islanders human guinea pigs his hands were balled it didnt take long for the problems to emerge leukemias lymphomas thyroid disorders autoimmune diseases and of course birth defects retardation anencephaly limbless babies we called them jellyfish he sat down and gave a terrible laugh we compensated the poor devils twentyfive thousand dollars a victim some government accountants appraisal of the value of a life one hundred and fortyeight checks totaling one million two hundred and thirtyseven thousand dollars one hundredthousandth the cost of the blasts he sat back down and placed his hands on bony knees his high forehead was as white and moist as a freshly boiled egg i took part in the compensation program someone upstairs thought it a good use of my training we did it at night going from island to island in small motorboats pulling up to the shore calling the people out with bullhorns then handing them their checks and sailing off he shook his head twentyfive thousand dollars per life an actuarial triumph removing his glasses he rubbed his eyes after i figured out what the blast had done i put in for extended stay and tried to do what i could for the people which wasnt much samuel was a nice man a very fine carpenter howd the people react to being paid i said the more perceptive among them were angry frightened but many were grateful the united states extending a helping hand he put his glasses back on well lets crack another box hopefully something a bit more routine at least you tried to help them i said sticking around helped me more than them son till then i thought medicine boiled down to diagnosis dosage and incision encountering my own impotence taught me it was much more and less you worked in pediatric oncology you understand by the time i got involved cancer was no longer a death sentence i saw enough cures to keep me from feeling like an undertaker yes he said thats wonderful still you saw the misery too your articles on pain control scientific yet compassionate i read them all read between the lines its one of the reasons i felt you were someone who would understand understand what bill why a crazy old man suddenly wants to organize his life the other cases were routine and he seemed to tire as i scanned the chart of a woman with diabetes he said ill leave you alone dont try to do too much enjoy the rest of the day he stood and headed for the door i wanted to ask you something bill yes i met tom creedman in the village this morning he mentioned something about a murder a half year ago and some social unrest that led to the blockade he leaned against the jamb what else did he have to say that was it ben told me he lived here caused some problems oh indeed i pointed to the rear storage room was that where ben caught him snooping no he said that was my office two bungalows down creedman claimed hed wandered in and was on his way out when ben found him i might have let it pass but he insulted ben that kind of thing isnt tolerated around here i ordered him off the grounds he delights in accentuating the negative about me and aruk he called this place knife castle and probably told you that yarn about the slaves butchering every last japanese it never happened allied bombs killed the vast majority of the japanese soldiers three days of constant bombardment on the third night the americans radioed victory and some of the forced workers left the barracks and came up here to loot understandable after what theyd been put through they encountered a few survivors and there was some handtohand fighting the japanese were outnumbered mr creedman calls himself a journalist but he seems attracted to fiction not that theres that much difference nowadays i suppose he also said that you did the autopsy on the murder victim do you agree with the theory that it was a sailor he sucked in breath im growing a bit concerned alex about what pickers accident and now this you certainly cant be faulted for seeing aruk as a terrible place but its not yes the murder was terrible but it was the first wed had in many years and the only one of its type i remember in over three decades what type is that he pressed his hands together clapped them silently and looked up at the ceiling fan as if counting rotations suddenly he opened the door and stepped out ill be right back the folder he returned with was brown with a white paper label aruk police invest d laurent case no the first four pages were a typed report composed by the police chief in slightly clearerthanusual cop prose the body of a twentyfouryearold woman named annemarie valdos had been found at three am on south beach by two crab fishermen wedged between rocks overlooking a tide pool the amount of blood indicated violence at the site other fishermen had been at that exact spot at nine pm allowing laurent to narrow the time the corpse had lain there during that period birds and scavengers had done their work but laurent referring to a conversation with dr w w moreland md had been able to distinguish the external shredding and mostly superficial laceration from multiple deep knife wounds leading to exsanguination and death the victim had lived on aruk for two years coming over from saipan to work as a cocktail waitress at slims but losing that job after three months due to chronic intoxication and absenteeism her lodgings had been a rented room in the village and she was two months in arrears shed been known to socialize with navy men the only surviving relative was an alcoholic mother in guam who had no money to travel or to pay for burial questioning the villagers produced no witnesses or leads but did elicit the repeated claim that the viciousness of the crime proved the perpetrator was a sailor laurents final paragraph read investigating officer has repeatedly attempted to communicate with captain e ewing commanding officer of stanton usn base for possible questioning of enlisted men re this crime but has been unable to make contact i started to turn the page you might not want to said moreland photographs i thought about it and flipped anyway the shots werent any worse than some of the ones milo had shown me which is to say theyd be additions to my nightmare file i moved past them to morelands report hed been thorough inspecting dissecting enumerating each wound at least fiftythree wounds additional ones possibly obscured by scavenger bites the killing blow probably a neck slash contrary to what creedman had said no sexual penetration all the cuts probably inflicted by the same weapon a very sharp unserrated blade the next page was written out in morelands elegant longhand dennis you may want to keep this private wwm postmortem mutilation a the left leg has been severed completely at the patellar joint b the left femur has been broken discretely in three places with a considerable quantity of bone marrow removed c a deep cm longitudinal upward slashing wound extends from the pubic region to the sternum d disembowelment has taken place with the small and large intestines piled atop the chest region obscuring both breasts the breasts are intact extensive crustaceal invasion of these tissues exists as well e both kidneys and the liver have been f decapitation has occurred between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae with the head left next to the left side of the body at a distance of centimeters g a deep transverse wound of the neck is visible both above and below the decapitation line probable downward stroke from left ear across the neck indicates righthanded person slashing from the back the trachea and jugular vein have been severed h significant enlargement of the foramen magnum has been accomplished possibly with some kind of graspingcrushing instrument portions of the occipital skull have been shattered probably by blunt force i both cerebral hemispheres have been removed with the cerebellum and lower brain left intact i shut the file and took a slow breath trying to settle my stomach im sorry said moreland but i want you to see that im not concealing anything from you the killer was never caught unfortunately not and the navy man theory he blinked and fidgeted with his glasses in all the years ive lived here the islanders have never engaged in serious violence let alone this i suppose it could have been one of the cargo boat deckhands though ive come to know most of them and theyre decent chaps and dennis did question them unlike the sailors remembering laurents remark about not having his call to stanton returned i said he never got access to the base no he didnt why do you still have the file is the investigation ongoing dennis thought i might come up with something if i studied it for a while i havent any suggestions its not your typical sadistic murder i said no rape though creedman said there was you see he said the man has no credibility no positioning of the body either mutilation but of the head and the back and the legs not the genitalia or the breasts then theres the multiple organ theft coring out the femur to remove the marrow it sounds ghoulish almost ritualistic he smiled sourly the kind of thing some primitive native would do i was thinking more of a satanic rite were any satanic symbols left behind none that we found does the killing bear the mark of some sort of ritual he rubbed his bald head took a thick black fountain pen out of his pocket uncapped it and inspected the nub what do you know about cannibalism alex mercifully little conducting the autopsy brought to mind things id heard about when i was stationed in melanesia back in the fifties he put the pen back uncrossed his legs and rubbed a bony knee the sad truth is from an historical perspective eating human flesh isnt a cultural aberration on the contrary its culturally entrenched and i dont mean just the socalled primitive continents old teuton had its menschenfressers theres a grotto in chavaux in france on the banks of the meuse where archaeologists found heaps of hollowedout human leg and arm bones your early gallic gourmets the ancient romans and greeks and egyptians consumed each other with glee and certain caledonian tribes wandered the scottish countryside for centuries turning shepherds into twolegged supper he started to sit back then grimaced violently are you all right i said fine fine he touched his neck a crick slept the wrong way where was i ah yes patterns of anthropophagy the most common motive believe it or not is nutritionthe quest for protein in marginal societies however when alternative sources are provided sometimes the preference endures tender as dead man was once high praise among the old tribes of fiji cannibalism can also be a military tactic or part of a spiritual quest ingesting ones own ancestors in order to incorporate their benevolent spirits or a combination of the two eating the enemys brain grants wisdom his heart courage and so on but despite all this diversity there are fairly consistent procedural patternsdecapitation removal of vital organs shattering the long bones for marrow as the bible says the blood is the soul he tapped the file in his lap looked at me expectantly you think this woman was killed to be eaten i said what im saying is her wounds were consistent with classic cannibalistic practices but there are also inconsistencies her heart typically considered a delicacy was left intact skulls are frequently taken as trophies and preserved yet hers was left behind i suppose both could be explained in terms of time pressure the killer may have been forced to leave the beach before finishing the job or perhaps and i think this is the best guess he was just a psychopathic deviant mimicking some ancient rite or someone whod watched the wrong movie i said he nodded the world we live in finishing the job i pictured the gentle waves of the lagoon the arc of a long blade cutting the moonlight what he did to her took quite a bit of time whats your estimate at least an hour the human femurs a sturdy thing can you imagine sitting there working at sawing it free he shook his head repulsive whyd you suggest to laurent that he not publicize the details both as a means of concealing facts only the killer would know and in order to maintain public safety tempers were already running high rumors spreading can you imagine what the notion of a cannibal sailor would have done so the villagers still dont know no one knows other than you dennis and myself and the murderer he winced i know i can trust you to keep it to yourself i showed you the file because i value your opinion cannibalisms not exactly my area of expertise but you have some understanding of human motivation after all these years i find people more and more perplexing what could have led to this alex god only knows i said you said the villagers arent violent what about the sailors any previous incidents of serious violence brawls fistfights nothing worse so creedmans story about locals storming the southern road was true another exaggeration no one stormed a few of the younger men fortified with beer tried to reach the base to protest the sentries turned them back and there was some shouting and shoving but anyone who thinks the navy would go to the expense of building that blockade two days later to keep out a handful of kids is naive i spent enough time in the service to know that nothing moves that quickly in the military the blockade must have been planned for months why he frowned im afraid it may very well be the first stage in closing down the base because it has no strategic value thats not the point aruk was created by colonial powers and the navys the current colonizer to simply pull out is cruel how do the villagers make a living now small jobs and barter and federal welfare checks he said it sadly almost apologetic the checks come on the supply boats he nodded i think we both know where that kind of thing leads ive tried to get the people to develop some independence but theres very little interest in farming and not enough natural resources for anything commercial even before the blockade basic skills were already dropping and most of the bright students left the island for high school and never returned thats why im so glad people like ben and dennis choose to stay and now the blockade has sped up the decline yes but things dont need to be hopeless son one good trade project a factory of some kind would sustain aruk ive been trying to get various businesses to invest here but when they learn of our transport problems they balk pam said youve corresponded with senator hoffman yes i have he placed the murder file on the couch is there any history of tribal cannibalism on aruk i said no because theres no prechristian culture of any kind the first islanders were brought over by the spanish in the fifteenhundreds already converted to catholicism a prechristian culture is necessary for cannibalism from my reading its a virtual constant even the most recent documented cases seem to incorporate christian and prechristian ideas are you familiar with the term cargo cult vaguely a sect that equates material goods with spiritual salvation a spontaneous sect spurred by a selfstyled prophet cargo cults develop when native people have been converted to a western religion but have held on to some of their old beliefs the link between acquiring goods and receiving salvation occurs because basic missionary technique combines gifts with doctrine the islander believes the missionary holds the key to eternal afterlife and that everything associated with him is sacred white skin caucasian features western dress the wonderful kahgo the cults are rarer and rarer but as late as the sixties there was a cult that worshiped lyndon johnson because someone got the notion he was the source of the cargo correlation confused with causation i said the same way all superstitions are learned a tribe goes fishing the night of the full moon and brings in a record catch the moon acquires magical properties an actor wears a red shirt the night he gets rave reviews the shirt becomes sacred exactly groundless rituals provide comfort but if the belief system is shaken up the missionary leaves and the cargo stops the islander may view it as the beginning of the apocalypse stick a charismatic prophet into the picture and years ago i was sent to pangia in southern highlands province to survey infectious diseases fiftyfive right after the war in the course of my research i learned of a minor government clerk who suddenly quit his job and started reading the bible aloud twenty hours a day in the village square handsome intelligent young fellow his association with the ruling class had lent additional status a small group formed around him and his delusions grew more florid and bloody he ended up slaughtering and eating his own infant son sharing the meal with his followers in an attempt to bring in plane loads of goods the morning of the murder hed been preaching from genesis the story of abraham binding isaac for sacrifice abraham never went through with it in his view that was because abraham didnt merit true fulfillment he of course was quite another story telling the story had turned him pale i can still see his face smiling tranquil any similarities to this murder several and some of the factors youve just mentioned are present here too dependence upon the white man then abandonment but still he said bending forward it doesnt make sense because other factors are absent no prechristian culture and absolutely no history of cults on aruk he rapped his knuckle against the file i continue to insist that this hideousness was the work of a single sick person someone whod read up on cannibalism and was trying to simulate a cult murder perhaps and most important someone whos moved on why do you say that because it hasnt happened again he was ashen i lacked the heart for debate for a while son i couldnt stop thinking that hed simply gone off to do it somewhere else but dennis has been checking international reports for similar crimes in the region and none have come up now what say we put aside this ghastly stuff and move on for the next hour and a half we were dispassionate scientists discussing cases suggesting different ways to organize the data moreland looked at his watch feeding time for emma and her friends thank you for a stimulating afternoon its not often i get to engage in collegial discussions i thought of his daughter the physician trained in public health my pleasure bill he strode to the door itll be dark soon dont work too hard he said i didnt bring you over here to enslave you alone i sat back and looked out the window at the fountain spitting jewels my minds eye kept focusing on the photos of annemarie valdoss murder scene white body on dark rock the details moreland and laurent had withheld probably what creedman had been after when ben caught him snooping ace reporter comes to islands to find himself finds a gorefest instead and phones his agent what a concept mel then he came up against moreland and was cut off from the information and resented it moreland had concealed the whole truth from his beloved islanders but offered them to me after a fortyeighthour acquaintance wanting input from me about human motivation more worried about recurrence than hed admitted couching it in collegialitya couple of guys with doctorates having a clubby chat about twolegged supper a brilliantly colored bird flew past the window the sky was still a peacock blue id seen only on crayons i got up and headed for robins studio what would i tell her by the time i reached the door id decided on limited honesty letting her know id discussed the murder with moreland and that he believed it an isolated crime but leaving out the details she wasnt there bits of shell were laid out neatly atop the flat file along with a billet of koa and two small chisels no dust wishful thinking i went looking for her finally spotted her down by the fruit groves a white butterfly flitting among the citrus trees spike a wiggly dark shadow at her feet i jogged to her side she put her arm in mine and we walked together so how did work go she said very scholarly whatd you do played around in the studio but it was a little frustrating not being able to work so mr handsome and i decided to stroll the estates wonderful alex huge we made it all the way to the edge of the banyan jungle bill must have sunk a fortune into landscaping there are some beautiful plantings along the way herbs wildflowers a greenhouse orchids growing on tree trunks even the walls are pretty hes got different kinds of vines trailing down them the only thing that spoils it is the barbed wire she stopped to pick up an orange that had dropped peeled it surgically as we continued how much of the jungle can you see over the walls treetops and those aerial roots theres a coolness that seems to make its way over not a breeze even milder a subtle current id take you there but spikey didnt like it kept pulling away our little mine detector or some kind of animal on the other side i couldnt hear anything but you know him i bent and rubbed behind the dogs bat ears his flat face looked up at me comically grave with those radar detectors its no wonder i said finally style and substance merge she laughed umm smell those orange blossoms this is great alex i kept my mouth shut we decided to dive the following morning and got up for an early breakfast jo picker was already on the terrace dressed in a black tshirt and loose pants her hair tied back carelessly sooty shadows under her eyes she kept both hands on her coffee cup and stared down into it the food on her plate was untouched when robin touched her shoulder she smiled weakly spikes licking her hand sparked another smile as we sat down she said ly never liked dogs too much maintenance her lips tightened then trembled she stood abruptly and marched into the house we left spike in the run with kiko and drove down to south beach as i turned off front street to park i looked up the coastal road the navy blockade was at the top a crude wall of gray concrete at least twenty feet tall it appeared to be crammed into the hillside warning signs applied generously an extension of chain link and barbed wire snaked up the hill and continued into the brush the beach at that point was just a narrow spit and the wall cut across it and continued into the ocean creating a damming effect but the water was shallow and still lapping weakly at the algaestained base of the seabarrier large chunks of coral were stacked nearby desiccated and sunbaked part of the reef had been shattered to accommodate the barrier i parked atop the widest section of beach the sand was as smooth and white as a freshly made bed the lagoon that same silvery green we collected our gear and as i carried it to the shoreline i noticed flat smooth rocks above the tide pools the altar where annemarie valdos had been sacrificed to what we stepped onto the sand the temperature was holding as mild and steady as moreland had promised when i tested the lagoon with my foot there was no chill and when i eased in for a swim a soft warmth enveloped me perfect i called out to robin we put on our fins and masks and snorkels flipperwalked the shallows till the water reached our thighs then knifed in and floated belly down on the surface of the pool the reef took a long time to deepen finally reaching eight feet as we neared the brownred ring of coral that held back the ocean the coral colonies grew in wide flat beds despite the lack of current the reefs living rock seemed to dance patches of tiny animals sharing space with biocondos of sea urchins chitons feather duster worms and gooseneck barnacles small brilliant fish grazed untroubled by our presence electricblue damsels lemonyellow tangs confident grayblack french angels shockingpink basslets with the stern little faces of tax auditors orangeandwhite clownfish nested in the soft stinging embrace of fluorescent sea anemones the bottom sand was fine almost downy spotted with shells and rocks and shreds of coral the sunlight made its way down easily dappling the ocean floor we shattered the light with our shadows causing some of the shells to move in reflexive panic drifting in opposite directions we explored separately for a while then i heard robin burble through her breathing tube and turned to see her pointing excitedly at the far end of the reef something torpedo shaped was shooting between us speeding across the lagoon a small sea turtle maybe a foot long head down legs compressed skimming the top of the coral as it headed for bluer pastures i watched it disappear then looked back at robin making the ok sign she waved and i paddled to her extending a hand we bumped masks in a mock kiss then swam together thrilled and weightless suspended like twins in a warm salty womb when we got back on the beach we were no longer alone skip amalfi and anders haygood had spread a horse blanket thirty feet from our clothes skip was lying on his back eyes closed belly surging and collapsing as he sucked on a cigarette and blew smoke haygood crouched nearby hairy thighs thick as logs tongue tip sticking out the corner of his mouth concentrating as he pulled the limbs off something huge and ugly the biggest crab id ever seen easily thirty inches from claw to claw with a knobby blue spotted carapace and pincers the size of bear traps my year for monster arthropods haygood looked up at us and snapped a leg free watched the juice drip out of it then held it up and waved it maam sir again the gray eyes washed over robin and i became aware of how she looked in her twopiece hair dripping over smooth bare shoulders hips swelling above the lowcut bottom the sharp sweet contrast between bronze skin and white nylon she turned her back on them just as skip sat up both men watched her trudge to our blanket walking in the sand made her sway more than she intended to big crab i said stoner said haygood great eating can i give you a couple of legs sir no thanks youre sure forget it said skip old man moreland dont eat animals thats right said haygood too bad stoners are great eating this one liked coconuts thats why its blue when they eat other things they can be orange ive seen them even bigger but hes healthy mean though said skip bite your finger clear off best thing is throw em in the pot live how was your swim great see any octopus no just a turtle little one i nodded last summers hatch they come in lay at the breaker line bury the eggs the natives dig em up makes a helluva omelet the suckers that make it swim the hell out of here but most of them get eaten too sometimes a real stupid one comes back musta been what you saw checking out the old hood said haygood laughing his teeth were widely spaced and white the sun turned his body hair into dense copper wire octopus are smart said skip those big eyes you swear theyre checking you out a glance robins way best omelet for my money is tern said haygood lays pink eggs first time people see it they freak out think its blood but pinks the true color pink omelet he licked his lips salty like duck you can have it man said skip too fuckin gamy haygood smiled well i go for the pink skip snickered sharks good eating too said haygood but you have to soak the meat in acid or it tastes like piss how long are you here for doc couple of months like it its beautiful they looked at each other haygood snapped off another crab leg skip said rich people would dig this place right i guess anyone who likes swimming and relaxing would what about you what kind of stuff do you dig all kinds of things he dragged on his cigarette and flipped the butt onto the spotless sand me and my buddy hay here wanna build a resort but different grass huts like a club med pay one price up front get your food drinks the works no tv or phones or video movies just swimming and digging the beach maybe well bring some girls over to put on a dance show or something his eyes got hard so what do you think sounds good it does huh sure he spat on the sand i figure rich assholes from the mainlandd go for it in a big way right cause otherwise wed hafta go for the japanese tour groups like all the other islands do he put both hands in front of his face hooked his upper teeth over his lower lip and flexed his thumbs take pikcha crick crick he laughed haygood smiled and examined the crabs legless body full of roe he said a girl we wanna get americans said skip this is america even though no one in america knows shit about this place good luck i started to walk away wanna invest he called after me i was about to laugh then i saw his face and stopped im not really much of an investor then maybe you should start man get in early guys who invested in hawaii after the war are wiping their asses with hundreddollar bills he held out a palm as if panhandling hey the man came here to mellow out said haygood give him a break skip flipped him a middle finger and his weak chin struggled for a jut shut the fuck up man im talking business here haygood didnt speak but his wrists flexed and the crabs torso shattered wetly skip tried to stare him down but the older man ignored him think about it man said skip passing some of the anger over to me talk to your lady she looks pretty smart another glance robins way shed draped her shoulders with a towel and was sitting with her knees drawn up to her chest looking out at the sea a voice to my back said gentlemen and skips dull eyes narrowed haygood wiped his hands with a tshirt but his face didnt move i turned dennis laurent stood on the sand in full mirrored sunglasses flashing white light he looked vast none of us had heard him approach he touched an eyebrow doctor got a nice stoner there hay must be what six seven pounds of meat eight at least said skip pull it off a coco didnt have to said haygood lazy one sleeping over there he pointed to the tide pools nothing like an easy target said laurent i see you finally got in the water doc nice perfect always is have a nice day gentlemen he and i walked to robin his shoed feet were steady on the sand spotting the butt skip had discarded he picked it up and pocketed it those two give you any trouble no are they troublemakers not generally but theyve got too much free time and one iq between them most of it haygoods skip hit on you for his resort scheme right just before you arrived club skip ready to call your broker got a cell phone he laughed cant you just see skip greeting a boatload of touristshey welcome to fucking aruk man chamber of commerce should hire him yeah he said if we had one hello ms castagna how was the water warm always is something about the lack of water movement and the insulating properties of the coral im happy to see you two finally enjoying yourselves finally got a callback from the navy just headed up to the estate to talk to mrs picker they found the wreckage just inside stanton nothing much left theyll be shipping the remains back to the states billing her later for the transport youre kidding wish i was captain ewing thinks hes being generous because the plane was trespassing on military property he says he could have filed a complaint fined picker bigtime and the estate would be financially responsible thats despicable said robin laurent flicked a speck of sand off his badge yup hows mrs picker doing this morning she looked pretty exhausted id better leave out the part about the bill for now knowing the military im an exmarine theyll take two years just to finish the paperwork if they even follow through trouble is im not going to be able to get her the body even if ewing was cooperative theres no real mortuary here just a couple of guys who dig graves for the cemetery behind the church and no supply boat for another ten days or so without proper embalming it could get pretty ripe he stopped himself sorry whys ewing so hostile i said he shrugged maybe its his nature maybe he doesnt like being here he was involved in skipjack that navy sex scandal in virginia got exiled here because of it but maybe thats just talk anyway ill just tell mrs picker the navys doing her a favor by shipping the body ewing asked me to get an address she can have someone claim it back in the states he removed his shades and blew sand off the lenses his light eyes took in the beach the harbor lingering for a split second on the flat rocks above the tide pools or had i imagined it do you know if doctor bills up at the house he said he wasnt at breakfast hes usually up way before breakfast goes to sleep late too never met a man who needs less sleep always moving moving moving if you see him tell him hi pam too as we got back in the jeep skip and haygood were walking along the shore smoking and flicking ash into the water robin said lets drive around a bit explore some of the smaller roads i turned the vehicle around and she looked up at the barricade its almost as if they wanted it to be ugly moreland agrees with picker that the navys shutting the island down gradually i asked him how people live and he admitted the main source was welfare end of an era she said that may be why hes so eager to document what hes done i headed toward the bowed gray pilings of the dock the openair market was closed and the ration sign remained atop the gas pump did you talk about the murder a bit and moreland and dennis are assuming its a oneshot that the murderers gone because he hasnt done it again in the region so it could very well be a sailor whos transferred to another base meaning he could be doing it in another region dennis has been keeping an eye out for similar crimes and none have come up we were nearing the chop suey palace creedman was outside again with a bottle and a mug looking straight ahead i passed him and hung a sharp right onto the next road passing more tumbledown houses and empty lots then a small poorly tended patch of grass housing a world war two cannon and a lifesize statue of macarthur shading his eyes a wooden sign said victory park est the only obvious triumph was that of birds over bronze more shacks and leantos and dirt till the crest where a narrow white church stood i stopped two stories high with a sharply pitched roof fishscale trim and a badly tarnished copper steeple the building canted to the right the balusters of the front stair rail were intricately turned but flaking the fivepace front yard was thick with high grass edged with leggy white petunias early victorian said robin its sunk a little on the foundation but the designs nice a display board staked in the lawn said our lady of the harbor catholic church visitors welcome a few feet away a metal flagpole hosted old glory the flag drooped in the motionless air behind the church was more tall grass squared by a low picket fence rows of white crosses stone and wooden grave markers a few flashes of color floral wreaths some so bright they had to be plastic next door was a large aluminum quonset hut labeled aruk community clinic the old black jeep ben had used to pick us up was parked near the door next to an even older mg roadster once red now faded to salmon the emergency number on the door was that of morelands estate just as i started to drive on pam came out removing her stethoscope she waved and i stopped again taking something out of the mg she came over handful of plasticwrapped lollipops hi snack no thanks said robin sure theyre sugarless unwrapping a green pop she put it in her mouth so you guys got to swim how was it robin told her about our dive through the open door i could see children their small faces pinched with fright they seemed okay about the crash said pam but still pretty nervous about their shots so we decided to get it over with want to come in we followed her into the hut and breathed in the sharp smell of alcohol the floor was blue linoleum fiberboard partitions sectioned the interior into cubicles cartoon posters and nutritional charts nearly covered the walls but the aluminum fought the attempt to cheer fifteen or so children all dark haired none older than eight were lined up in front of a long table two chairs sat behind the table the one on the right empty the other occupied by ben to his left were steel trays of bandages cotton swabs disinfectant pads disposable syringes and small glass jars with rubber stoppers a trash basket near his left foot brimmed with discarded needles and bloodspecked pads he crooked his finger and a little girl in a pink tshirt and redandwhite paisley shorts stepped forward her hair was waist long her feet were in beach thongs she was losing the struggle not to cry ben unwrapped a pad picked up a bottle and jabbed the needle through the rubber cap with his left hand filling the syringe he squirted it clear of air took hold of the girls arm and drew her closer cleaning her bicep swiftly he tossed the pad in the basket said something that made her look at him and flicked the needle at her arm almost teasingly the girls mouth opened in pain and insult the tears flowed some of the boys in line laughed but none with enthusiasm then the needle was out and ben was bandaging her arm the whole process had taken less than five seconds and he remained impassive the girl kept crying ben looked back at us pam rushed over and unwrapped a lollipop for the whimpering child when the tears didnt stop she cradled the girl ben said next and crooked a finger a small chubby boy stepped into position and stared down at his arm dimpled fists drummed his thighs ben reached for a pad all done angie said pam walking the girl to the door you did great the child sniffed and sucked her lollipop and the white paper stick bobbed these are some visitors from the mainland honey this is angelina shes seven and a half and very brave ill say said robin the girl wiped an eye these people came all the way from california said pam do you know where that is angelina mumbled around the sucker whats that sweetie

stayed with us comforting the children and seeing them off schools still in session she said theyre in class for another hour who teaches i said the priest no there is no priest father marriot was called back last spring and sister june just left for guam breast cancer claire bens wife was our substitute but now shes the faculty a couple of other mothers serve as parttime assistants another weeping child passed through guess i should do a few said pam but bens so good i hate inflicting pain cheryl was sweeping the entry to the big house but when we walked in she stopped dr bill said give you this she handed me a scrap of yellow lined paper morelands writing det milo sturgis called am aruk time west hollywood exchange milos home number thats one in the morning la time said robin wonder what it could be you know what a night owl he is probably something to do with the house and hes trying to catch us at a good time mention of the house tightened her face she looked at her watch its twothirty there now should we wait if he was up an hour and a half ago he probably still is cheryl stood there as if trying to follow the conversation when i turned to her she blushed and began sweeping is it all right to use the phone for long distance she looked puzzled theres a phone in your room is dr bill around she thought yes where in his lab we went back to the run to pick up spike he and kiko stopped their play immediately and he ran to robin the monkey shinnied up a low branch then let go and landed feather light on my shoulder a small dry hand cupped the back of my neck hed been shampooed recently something with almonds but his fur also gave off a faint hint of zoo we left with both animals robin said id like to freshen up ill go ask moreland about using the phone she turned back toward the house kiko jumped off and joined her and spike i walked down to the outbuildings and knocked on morelands office door he said come in but the door was locked and i had to wait for him to open it sorry he said how was your swim terrific he was holding a pencil stub and looked distracted his office was the same size as the one hed given me but with pale green walls and no furniture other than a cheap metal desk and chair papers loose and bound carpeted half the floor the desk was blanketed too though i did notice one high stack that had been squared neatly and placed in the center journal reprints the top one an article id written ten years ago on treating childhood phobias my name underlined in red the door to the lab was open tables beakers flasks test tubes in racks a centrifuge a balance scale equipment i couldnt identify next to the scale was a tall jar full of the graybrown pellets hed used to feed the insects a smaller container of some sort of brownish liquid sat beside it so he said taking off his glasses his tone was strained id interrupted something i wanted to check if it was okay to use the phone for long distance he laughed returning detective sturgiss call of course there was no need to ask give him my best hes a pleasant fellow robin sat there caressing her two hairy pals as i dialed the phone rang twice and a cranky deep voice grunted sturgis hi its me still up alex milos voice lightened i hadnt thought much about his missing us yeah wide awake he said reverting to a grumble so hows bali hoo sunny and clear want to hop over and join us i dont tan i parboil thought you were black irish thats temperament not complexion so you pretty much settled in very nicely just got back from diving in a gorgeous coral reef yo jacques there really is a garden of eden huh my fig leaf says yes what are you doing up past your bedtime sonny boy working double shifts and building up the overtime reason i called is the guy whos handling your house has a couple of questions seems the crown and floor moldings robin told him to order have been discontinued he can get something similar a little wider or go for her exact specifications and have it custom milled the difference is a couple of thou and he wants authorization also the cost of your alarm is going to be a little higher than estimated something about having to connect up with a power line thats outside the basic contractual area probably another grand its never below estimate is it anyway ask the lovely ms c what she wants to do get back to me and ill forward the message ill put her on right now i handed over the receiver robin said hi and kikos eyes widened as she began to speak the monkey stuck his head closer to the phone and began talking along in a wordless chittering singsong what oh no its a monkey milo a monkey as in barrel of no he hasnt replaced spikey we still love him no theyre getting along fine as a matter of fact thats it in terms of mammals what no just some bugs bugs insects spiders tarantulas dr moreland does research on them whats up detective she talked to him about the construction then ended with more small talk and returned the phone to me im putting these guys outside again then running a bath love it if youd join me when youre through she left bugs said milo eden has bugs god created them too what day was it his badjoke day exactly what kind of research does this guy do nutrition predatory behavior he sounded a little spacey when i talked to him how so taking the message but somewhere else he thought you were a pleasant fellow that proves he was somewhere else i laughed what kind of things are you working on you really want to know intensely four armed robberies one with hostages in a meat locker and a near fatality one driveby of a drug dealer slash rap artist that we probably wont solve aw shucks and the beauty thats been keeping me up late sixteenyearold girl out in the palisades shot her father to death while he sat on the can she claims longtime molestation but the mother says no way and shes been divorced from the old man for years no love lost the kid has a history of naughty behavior and daddy had promised her a brandnew range rover for her birthday if she passed all her classes she flunked he said no go and friends say she got mighty pissed any evidence of molestation nope and friends say she was a big fan of those two little shits with shotguns from beverly hills shes got dead eyes alex so who knows what was done to her but thats not my concern right now she retained a mouthy lawyer with dead daddys dough but enough ishmael you set sail to escape all this barbarism true i said but allow me to raise your cynicism quotient even higher even eden has its problems i told him about annemarie valdoss murder he didnt answer you still there cracking her bones to eat the marrow thats morelands hypothesis you go to paradise and outdo me in the grossness department according to moreland cannibalisms pretty common across cultures ever come across it he an expert on that too tell me is there some huge guy stomping around the estate with a bad haircut and bolts in his neck marrow no thanks dear ill pass on that breakfast steak and stick with the veggie plate funny you should say that morelands a vegetarian his daughter says he saw things after the korean war that made him never want to be cruel again how sensitive and no i havent personally come across any bad guy gourmets but there are a few years left to retirement so now ive got something to live for hows rick he says changing the subject doing the workaholic thing as usual night shift at the er marrow why do i keep hearing jungle drums going oonka loonka come across any missionaries in a pot not yet and moreland says not to worry theres no history of cannibalism here both he and the chief of police see it as a sicko killer trying to look exotic local opinion pins it on a navy man who moved on morelands a crime sleuth too hes the only doctor on the island so he handles all the forensics cannibalism he said does robin know about this she knows there was a homicide but i havent given her the details i dont want to make too big of a deal about it other than that theres been no serious crime here for years other than that mrs lincoln how was the play why a navy man because the locals arent violent and the killer seems to be transitory well he said i was joe army so you wont get any big debate from me okay hang loose dont eat anything you cant identify and stay away from jokers with bones in their noses a creed to live by i said thanks for calling and good luck on your cases yeah all bullshit aside im really glad you guys got to do this i know what last year was like for you a phone rang in the distance and he grunted other line he said more sludge sayonara and all that and if you see a bearded french guy painting ladies in flowery muumuus buy up the canvases robin napped and i took a walk crossing the rose garden and descending the sloping acres of lawn four men in driveandmows were working on the turf the rottingsugar smell of cut grass brought to mind childhood sundays so had victory park i realized the war memorial in my missouri hometown had been only slightly larger sunday meant my mother bundling my sister and me off to the park when my father chose to drink at home bologna sandwiches and apple juice climbing the cannon pretending to fire mothers sweet forced smiles when she died dads drinking stopped and so did the rest of his life shaking off melancholy i continued down to the fruit groves stepping among fallen oranges and tangerines and a popcorn spray of citrus blossoms the meadow moreland had created out of wildflowers was brilliant a collection of miniature conifers had been trimmed surgically and a boxwood knot garden was as intricate as any maze id encountered in graduate school then the greenhouses every pane spotless and trees full of orchids the plants tucked into the folds and hollows of branches like hatchlings i kept going till i spotted patches of granite and the brown thorny fuzz of rusty barbed wire the eastern border plumbago and honeysuckle and wisteria covered most of the high stone walls softening the wire but not hiding it on the other side the banyan tops formed a greenergray awning aerial roots shooting through the canopy like the tentacles of a beast in pain from what i could see the tree trunks below were stout and kinked cruelly whipsawing in a struggle for space for a second the entire forest seemed to be moving tumbling down on me and i felt myself losing balance after i restored equilibrium a tight spot remained at the base of my throat i looked up at the trees again robin had mentioned a subtle coolness drifting over the walls but all i felt was an internal chill i hiked along the border listening for sounds from the other side but hearing nothing when i stopped the same illusion of movement recurred and i placed both hands on the stone and breathed in deeply probably low blood sugar i hadnt eaten since breakfast i headed back when i got to the grove i picked up an orange peeled it and finished it in three bites letting the juice run down my chin the way id done as a child back in my office i tackled another carton of medical files more routine the only psychological diagnoses moreland had noted were stress reactions to physical illnesses i pulled down another box and found myself growing bored till a folder at the bottom made me take notice on the front cover moreland had drawn a large red question mark the patient was a fiftyoneyearold laborer named joseph cristobal with no history of mental disorder who began to experience visual hallucinationswhite worms and white worm people and symptoms of agitation and paranoia moreland treated him with tranquilizers and noted that cristobal did have a fondness for drink but is not an alcoholic the symptoms didnt abate two weeks later cristobal died suddenly in his sleep the apparent victim of a heart attack morelands autopsy revealed no brain pathology but did discover an occluded coronary artery then the doctors final remark in large bold print the same red color as the question mark a tutalo i figured that for a bacterium or virus but the medical dictionary hed provided me didnt list it a drug no citation in the physicians desk reference i returned to the storage room squeezed my way past the columns of boxes and searched the bookshelves natural history archaeology mathematics mythology history chemistry physics even a collection of antique travelogues one complete case devoted to insects another to plant pathology and toxicology which i went through carefully no mention of a tutalo finally in a dark musty corner the medical books nothing i thought of the catwoman morelands telling me about the case moments after wed met now another case of spontaneous death id reviewed perhaps sixty files two out of sixty was three percent an emerging pattern time for another collegial chat when i reached the house i saw jo picker near the fountain watching dennis laurents police car drive away water dotted her hair and face as i came up to her she wiped her cheek and looked at the moisture on her hand the spray continued to hit her slowly she moved out of its arc that policeman came over to tell me whats going on she rubbed her eyes her new tan had been replaced by mourners pallor they say ly landed on the base and theyre shipping him back today i shouldve expected it working in washington but when it happens to you ive been calling his family one of her hands rolled tight i didnt really chicken out she said though that would have been rational she looked at me i nodded i probably wouldve been stupid enough to go up even though i had bad feelings about it but this time he got mad at me called me a i just said to heck with it and walked away she moved her face nearer to mine close enough to kiss but there was nothing seductive about it even so i still probably wouldve relented but he wouldnt let up as i was walking through that bamboo i heard the plane engine start up and almost ran back but instead i kept going to the beach found a nice spot on the rocks and sat down and stared at the ocean i was feeling pretty relaxed when i heard it our noses were nearly touching her breath was stale i miss him she said as if finding it hard to believe youre with someone for a long time i told his mother she could bury him in new jersey near his father we never made any plans for that kind of thing he was fortyeight when i get back well have some kind of service i nodded again she noticed a stain on her shirt and frowned my ticket out of guam isnt for another two weeks i guess i should say that i cant wait to get back but the truth is whats waiting for me i might as well stay and finish up my work wetting her finger with her tongue she rubbed the stain that sounds cold to you doesnt it whatever helps you through it my work helps me coming heres the final leg of a threeyear study why throw it away she backed away and drew herself up enough blubbering back to the old laptop it was just before five i strolled to the rose garden and watched through the boughs of a pine tree as the men in the mowers painted broad stripes in the lawn i thought about sudden death the catwoman white worms annemarie valdos killed to be eaten routine medical cases collected during a thirtyyear practice some routine i was probably making too much of it after all id initiated the conversation about the valdos murder though it had been moreland whod brought over the autopsy photos sparing no detail maybe the old man had a strong stomach and assumed i did too hed implied as much during the tour of the bug zoo research on predators i recalled the animation with which hed discussed the history of cannibalism not exactly your simple country doctor milo had thought him spacey joked about frankenstein monsters milo was a selfadmitted sultan of cynicism but he was also a trained detective his hunches more often right than wrong neurotic delaware bunked down in eden getting paid handsomely to do a dream job and you just cant cope i returned to the house but couldnt get the catwoman out of my mind her ordeal bound to a chair while her husband made love to another woman the final scream such cruelty maybe that was it over the years moreland had seen too much cruelty radiation poisoning the hopeless deterioration of the bikini islanders the catwoman joseph cristobal the cargo cult leader absorbing the pain the way sensitive people often do confronting his helplessness but able to forget about it during dark hours in the bug zoo his lab his own private paradise now watching aruk deteriorate nearing the end of his own life his defenses had been shaken he needed to make sense of the cruelty needed someone to share it with that night at dinner there were five places set jo was last to come down she wore a white blouse and a dark skirt her face looked fresh and her hair was shiny and combed out go on with the small talk she sat and unfolded her napkin grapefruit one of my favorites the talk hadnt been small moreland giving a detailed lecture on the history of colonization hed seemed to lose his train of thought a couple of times now there was silence as jo peered at the serrated edge of her grapefruit spoon she cut a section from the fruit and the rest of us picked up our utensils moreland reached for a roll and spread it with apple butter he closed his eyes and chewed dad said pam his eyes opened and he looked around the table as if trying to locate the sound yes dear you were talking about the spanish ah yes machismos finest hour what gave the conquistadores a unique approach was the combination of risk taking and a strong religious commitment when you believe you have god on your side anythings possible hormones and god are unbeatable he nibbled on the roll then of course there was the easy funding outright theft in the name of heaven señor columbuss journeys were funded with the plunder of the inquisition hormones religion and money said pam very softly that just about sums up the world doesnt it moreland stared at her for a second a worried parental stare that he ended abruptly by shifting his attention to his bread in toto a force to be reckoned with the spanish they came to the pacific in the sixteenth century set about trying to do precisely what theyd done in he stopped and looked across the terrace gladys had come out of the house im not sure were ready for the next course dear theres a phone call dr moreland a medical call no sir well then please take a message its captain ewing sir morelands stooped frame jerked forward then he straightened how curious please excuse me after he was gone pam said this is the first weve heard from ewing in months i spoke to him once over the phone what a sour man i repeated what dennis had told me about ewings being exiled for the sex scandal yes i heard that too jo said hes crating and shipping lyman like luggage pam paled im sorry jo jo dabbed at her lips government is like junior high your status depends upon whom youre able to persecute maybe dad can work something out with them i doubt it said jo i think they shipped him already your connections dont help said robin what connections working at the defense department jos bosom heaved and she let out a barklike laugh thousands of people work at the defense department its not exactly as if im the secretary of defense i just thought im nothing said jo lowly g nerds dont count she stabbed the grapefruit turned the spoon freeing the last bits of pulp more silence heavier oppressive geckos racing along the rail would have been welcome but they were keeping a low profile tonight pam said gladys made lamb it looks great moreland came back out a loping skeleton an invitation to all of us dinner at the base tomorrow night casual formal i shall wear a tie that night i awoke at two in the morning and was unable to fall back asleep as i got out of bed robin turned away from me i slipped into some shorts and a shirt and she rolled back yokay honey think ill just get up for a while i whispered she managed to mumble restless a little if her head was clear enough she was thinking some things never change i bent and kissed her ear softly maybe ill take a little walk not too late i covered her shoulders pocketed the room key and slipped out of the bedroom as i passed spikes crate he snored a greeting nightynight handsome my bare feet were silent on the landing carpet the stairs were sturdy not a creak down in the entry the stone floor was cool and welcome as summer lemonade all the lights were off and the island silence saturated the house i opened the front door and stepped outside the moon was icewhite and the sky pulsed with stars starlight frosted the trees and the fountain turning the spatter to glycerine giving life to the gargoyle roof tiles i walked to the gates they were open and i looked down the long sloping road matteblack till it hit the onyx of the ocean something moved along the grass at the roads edge something else skittered in response i turned back fully awake now maybe id look over a few more charts i headed for my bungalow then stopped when i heard a door shut footsteps from the rear of the house the back door leading from the kitchen to the gravel paths slow deliberate footsteps they ceased continued someone came out into the open and stood looking up at the sky morelands unmistakable silhouette not wanting to talk to him or anyone else i retreated into the shadows and watched as he descended the path landing thirty feet in front of me something clunked in his hand a doctors bag same clothes hed worn at dinner plus a shapeless cardigan sweater he headed for the outbuildings passed my bungalow and continued past robins stopping at his office at the door he put the bag down fumbled in his pocket finally found the key but had some trouble inserting it in the lock starlight filtered through trees slashed his face diagonally highlighting a cucumber of nose the deep pouches columning his downturned mouth the door swung open he picked up his bag and entered the door closed silently the lights went on then off the room stayed dark the following morning brought cooler air and cottonswab clouds drifting from the east rain said gladys as she poured our coffee five or six days the clouds were translucent and filmy not a hint of moisture they pick up the water as they go she said offering the bread basket sucking it up from the ocean do you like whole wheat sure dr bill does too but a lotta people dont one time he had me bake rolls for the kids at school they didnt eat too many she tugged the corner of the yellow tablecloth we were the only ones at breakfast kids like the soft stuff we used to get lots of white bread on the supply boats now when we get anything its stale were you planning on swimming again yes well dont be fooled by those clouds be sure to put on sunscreen you got the nice olive skin maam but the doctor here with those pretty blue eyes he could burn robin smiled ill take good care of him men think theyre tough but they need to be taken care of how about some nice freshsqueezed juice at the lagoon the fish were quick learners approaching for a handout but swimming away quickly when we had nothing to give them robin managed to get one large latecoming pinkandyellow wrasse to nibble at her fingers then it too realized she was all show and it shot away to a high mound of coral where it snaked through a hole and disappeared she followed head turning constantly her eye for detail in full play when she stopped paddled in place and waved me over i joined her a tiny bald head floated in the crack chinless graybrown skull oversized eyes bright with intelligence a baby octopus legs as thin and flaccid as boiled spaghetti it kept staring finally retreated slithering into a crevice turning impossibly small we pressed closer it squirted ink in our faces i laughed got water in my tube and had to tread water to clear it the surface of the water was a clean metal plate the beach was empty i went under again tagging along with a school of yellow surgeonfish watching the bony sharp protrusions under their pectoral fins pivot at the sense of threat feeling the calmness of their blank black stares paradise we were back at the house by two jos door was closed and an untouched lunch tray sat on the floor nearby i imagined her tapping her keyboard in hopes of blunting her grief studying the wind something too vast to control moreland on the other hand delighted in manipulating natures small variables had he once harbored grand plans for the island was his own grief what had kept him up last night sitting in the dark i worked no medical oddities no gore and the only untimely death i found was a young woman with ovarian cancer another two cartons more routine then the name of a drowning victim caught my eye pierre laurent a twentyfouryearold sailor lost in a squall near the mariana trench the body had been returned to aruk and moreland had certified the death making note of the eighteenyearold widow four months pregnant with aruks future police chief right below denniss birth chart a tenpound baby healthy two more hours of tedium i liked that just as i was heading for the back room to fetch yet another box ben knocked and came in base just called navy copters picking you up in an hour on south beach vip treatment its either that or they send down a big ship or rowboats he took in the clutter of my desk and i thought i saw disapproval need anything by way of supplies no thanks are you coming tonight nope one hour youll all be leaving from here together he started to leave and i said hold on ill walk back with you he shrugged and we left together howre the vaccinations coming along i said all finished till next year tough job not really its for their own good you had a real rhythm going yesterday thats me he said natural rhythm the taste in my mouth matched his expression we walked in silence toward the big house as we neared the fountain he said sorry that was out of line im not like that what i mean is race isnt a big thing to me me neither forget it guess im bushed the baby was up all night how old six months boy or girl girl all of them slept great except her sorry i mean it no problem dr bill said the dinner was formal casual what does that mean tux jacket and jeans his smile was grateful who knows typical military give out rules without explaining them you serve any time no i said after a month in the guard i knew it wasnt for me but no choice by then i told them i was interested in medicine so they put me in a hospital on maui pulling sea urchin spines out of toes never even hit the water i love the ocean do you dive used to used to sail too had an old catamaran that dennis and i took out the few days a year we had enough wind what with the kids though no time and dr bill keeps me busy no complaints its what i like he gave another smile full and warm an old dented gray datsun station wagon was parked near the front steps of the house a chinese woman got out of it tiny with a boneporcelain face under very short hair she wore a red blouse tucked into blue jeans her eyes were huge she smiled at me and gave ben a sandwich wrapped in wax paper tuna he said kissing her cheek excellent dr delaware this is my wife claire claire chang romero dr alex delaware we exchanged greetings everything okay said ben we still on for hibachi dinner after homework addition practice for cindy and composition for ben junior he put his arm around her he was a small man but she made him look big walking her to the car he held her door open he looked happy i left casual formal for robin was a long sleeveless black dress with a mandarin collar and high slits on the side her hair was piled and mabepearl earrings glistened like small moons i put on the linen sportcoat shed bought me for the trip tropical wool slacks blue shirt maroon tie spiffy she said patting my hair down spike looked up at us with big eyes what i said he began baying like a hound the givemeattentionimsoneedy bit our dressing up was always a cue and the oscar goes to i said robin said poor baby and bent down and mothered him for a while then coaxed him into his crate with an extralarge biscuit and a kiss through the grill he gave out a bass snort then a whine what is it spikey probably i want my mtv i said his internal clocks telling him the grinds on in la aw she said still looking into the crate sorry baby no tv here were roughing it she took my arm no tv no daily newspaper the mail irregular packed on the biweekly supply boats cut off from the world so far i was surprisingly content how would it suit me long term how did it suit the people of aruk morelands letters had emphasized the isolation and insulation preparing us but thered been a bit of boast to it a man who hadnt switched from rotary phones doing it his way in the little world hed built for himself breeding and feeding his bugs and his plants dispensing altruism on his own schedule but what of everyone else on the island they had to know other pacific islanders lived differently during our stopover on guam wed had access to newsstands twentyfourhour cable radio bands of music and talk the travel brochures id picked up there showed similar access on saipan and rota and the larger marianas the global village and aruk was on the outside looking in maybe spike wasnt the only one who missed his mtv creedman had said moreland was extremely wealthy and moreland had confirmed growing up on ranchland in california wine country why didnt he use his money to improve communication there was no computer in his office journals arrived in the unpredictable mail how did he keep up with medical progress did dennis laurent have a computer without one how could he do his police tracking was the failure to find a repeat of the beach murder the result of inadequate equipment and was that why moreland was still worried alex i felt a tug at my sleeve what hon you all right sure i was talking to you and you spaced out oh sorry maybe its contagious what do you mean moreland spaces out all the time maybe its island fever or something too much mellow or maybe youre both working too hard snorkel all morning and read charts for a couple of hours i can stand the pain its all expenditure of energy darling and the air it does sap you i find myself wanting to vegetate my little brussels sprout i said taking her hand so itll be a real vacation for you too doc absolutely she laughed meaning what the body rests but the mind races i tapped my forehead the mind makes a pit stop somehow i dont think so no watch me tonight pinkies out hmph hmph how about them dodgers i went limp and rolled my eyes maybe i should bring a snorkel then in case you nod off in the soup moreland was sitting in the jeep when we got there wearing an ancient brown blazer and a tie the color of gutter water were waiting on pam he said looking preoccupied he started the car and gave it gas and a moment later the little red mg sped up and screeched to a halt pam jumped out flushed and breathless sorry she ran into the house moreland frowned and looked at his watch the first hint of paternal disapproval id seen i hadnt noticed any closeness either he checked the watch again an old timex milo would have approved you look lovely dear he said to robin as soon as shes ready well get going mrs pickers not coming understandably a few minutes later pam sprinted out perfectly composed in a blazing white trouser suit her hair loose and shining her cheeks flushed onward said moreland when she kissed his cheek he didnt acknowledge it he drove the way he walked maneuvering the jeep slowly and awkwardly down toward the harbor veering close to the edge of the road as he pointed out plants and trees at the bottom of the road he turned south the sun had been subdued all day and now it was retiring the beach was oystergray the water old nickel so quiet i thought of annemarie valdos sectioned like a side of meat on the flat rocks we got out and waited silently near the edge of the road how long of a copter ride is it i said short said moreland a scuffing sound came from the top of the coastal road a man emerged from the shadow of the barrier and came toward us tom creedman waving he wore a blue pinstripe suit white buttondown shirt yellow paisley tie tasseled loafers his black hair was slicked down and his mustache smiled in harmony with his mouth morelands eyes were furious tom bill hi moreland fille doctorandrobin insinuating himself into the middle of our group he tightened the knot of his tie pretty nifty personal aerial escort and all that not much choice if they want us there said moreland well said creedman we could swim youre a strong swimmer pam i saw you today taking those waves on the north end with chief laurent moreland blinked hard and snapped his head toward the water maybe i should try it one day said pam what is it a few knots do you swim tom not if i can avoid it creedman chuckled fished a woodtipped cigarillo out of his jacket and lit it with a chrome lighter sucking in deeply he examined the lagoon with a flinty stare and blew smoke through his nose foreign correspondent on assignment i waited for theme music funny isnt it he said after all the enforced segregation they decide its party time at least for the white folk i see ben and dennis werent included what do you think bill is brown skin a disqualifying factor moreland didnt answer creedman turned to robin and me maybe its in your honor any navy connections alex i played with a toy boat in the bathtub when i was five ha said creedman good line pam said you dont swim you dont sun what do you do all day mr creedman live the good life work on my book what exactly is it about creedman tapped his cigarillo and gave a groucho leer if i told you it would kill the suspense do you have a publisher his smile flickered the best whens it coming out he drew a finger across his lips pam smiled thats top secret too has to be said creedman too quickly the cigarillo tilted and he pulled it out the publishing business is vulnerable to leaks information superhighway the commodity is ephemeral meaning everyones out to steal ideas meaning billions are invested in the buying and selling of concepts and everyones looking for the golden idea and youve found it on aruk creedman smiled and smoked its not like that in medicine she said discover something important youve got a moral obligation to publicize it how noble said creedman then again you doctors chose your field because youre noble moreland said i think its coming his finger was up but he was still facing the ocean i heard nothing but the waves and bird chirps moreland nodded yes definitely seconds later a deep tomtom rumble sounded from the east growing steadily louder a big dark helicopter appeared over the bluffs sighted directly over us hovered then lowered itself on the road like a giant locust double rotors bloated body sand sprayed and we dropped our heads and cupped our hands over our mouths the rotors slowed but didnt stop a door opened and a dropladder snapped down hands beckoned we trotted to the craft eating sand ears bursting and climbed into a cabin walled with canvas and plastic and reeking of fuel moreland pam and creedman took the first passenger row and robin and i settled behind them piles of gear and packed parachutes filled the rear storage area a pair of navy men sat up front halfdrawn pleated curtains allowed us a partial view of the backs of their heads and a strip of greenlit panel the second officer looked back at us for a moment then straight ahead he pointed the pilot did something and the copter shuddered and rose we headed out to sea hooking southeast and following the coastline high enough for me to make out the bladelike shape of the island south beach was the point of the dagger our destination the hilt the blockade was no more than a paper cut from this height the mountaintops were a black leather belt the banyans obscured by burgeoning darkness and the ring of mountains the copter veered sharply and the east end of the island slid into view concrete shore and choppy water no trees or sand or reefs the windward harbor was a generous soupspoon indentation natural port ships large enough to look significant from these heights were moored there some of them moved strong waves i could see the froth piling up against a massive seawall we turned north toward the base empty stretches of black veined with gray toyblock assemblages that had to be barracks some larger buildings the copter descended and we touched down perfectly the trip as brief as an amusement park ride the blockades cruel efficiency clearer than ever the pilot cut the engine and exited without a word the second officer waited till the rotors had quieted before releasing our door we got out and were hit by a blast of humid air stale and chemically tainted the windward side said moreland nothing grows here a sailor in a contraption that resembled an oversize golf cart drove us through a sentry post and past the barracks storehouses hangars empty airstrips concrete fields crowded with planes and copters and disassembled craft made me think of harry amalfis aerial junkyard some of the planes were antiques others looked new one sleek passenger jet in particular would have done a ceo proud the harbor was blocked from view by the seawall a monstrous thing of the same raw construction as the blockade above it an american flag whipped and snapped like a lockerroom towel i could hear the ocean charging angrily hitting the concrete with the roar of a gladiator audience looking toward the bases western border i saw the area where picker must have gone down at least half a mile away twentyfoot chainlink fencing completed the banyans prison creedman had said the base was run by a skeleton crew and there were very few sailors on the ground maybe two dozen walking watching the golf cart veered across a nearly empty parking lot through a small drab garden up to a colonial building three stories high white board and brick green shutters headquarters capt elvin s ewing next door was a onestory building of the same design the officers club inside the club was a long walnut hallway deep red wool carpeting patterned with crossed sabers brass fixtures the paneling was lined with roiling seascapes and model ships in glass cases another sailor took us to a waiting room decorated with photo blowups of fighter jets and club chairs a sailor in dress uniform stood behind a hosts lectern glass doors opened to a dining room soft lighting empty tables the smell of canned vegetable soup and melted cheese the sailors saluted one another and the first one left without breaking step this way said the one behind the lectern young with clipped hair and a soft face full of pimples he took us to an unmarked door a sign hanging from the knob said captain ewing had reserved the room inside were one long table under a hammeredcopper chandelier and twenty bright blue chairs a portrait of the president wearing an uneasy smile greeted us from behind the head chair three walls of wood one blocked by blue drapes a new sailor came and took our cocktail order two different men brought the drinks creedman sipped his martini and licked his lips nice and dry why cant we get vermouth like this in the village bill moreland stared at his tomato juice and shrugged i asked the trading post to get me something dry and italian said creedman took a month and what i ended up with was some swill from malaysia pity go to any dutyfree in the booniest outpost and theyve got everything from chivas to stoli so whats the big deal about filling an order here its almost as if they want to do it wrong is that the theme of your book said pam incompetent islanders creedman smiled at her over his drink if youre that curious about my book maybe you and i should get together and discuss it that is if youve got any energy after your swims moreland walked to the blue drapes and parted them same view he said the airfield why they put a window here ill never know maybe they like to see the planes take off dad said pam moreland shrugged again how long did you and mom live here two years three men came in two wore officers garb the first was fiftyish tall and thickset with rough red skin and steel glasses the other even taller ten years younger with a long swarthy rubbery face and restless hands the man between them had on a beautiful featherweight gray serge suit that trimmed ten pounds from his two hundred six feet tall heavy shouldered and narrow hipped with a square face bullish features slit mouth ranchers tan his shirt was soft blue broadcloth with a pin collar his foulard a silver and wine silk weave his hair was bushy and black on top the temples snowwhite the contrast was almost artificial as dramatic in real life as on tv he looked like hollywoods idea of a senator but hollywood had nothing to do with his becoming one if newspapers and magazines could be believed the story was a good one born to a young widow in a struggling oregon logging camp nicholas hoffman had been tutored at home till the age of fifteen when hed lied about his age and enlisted in the navy by the end of the korean war he was a decorated hero who gave the military another fifteen years of distinguished service before entering the real estate business making his first million by forty and running successfully for the senate at fortythree his doctrine was the avoidance of extremes someone dubbed him mr middleoftheroad and it stuck true believers on both ends tried to use it against him the voters ignored them and hoffman was well into his third term after a nocontest race bill he said barging ahead of the officers and stretching out a meaty hand senator said moreland softly oh jesus roared hoffman cut the crap how are you man he grabbed morelands hand and pumped moreland remained expressionless hoffman turned to pam you must be dr moreland junior christ last time i saw you you were in diapers he let go of her father and touched her fingers briefly you are a doctor she nodded splendid creedman stuck out his hand and announced himself ah the press said hoffman captain ewing told me you were here so i said invite him show him open government in action or hell make something up on assignment writing a book on what nonfiction novel ah great what brings you here senator factfinding trip not one of those sunandfun junkets real work downsizing appraising military installations unbuttoning his jacket he patted his middle he had a small hard paunch that tailoring had done a good job of camouflaging and you must be the doctors from california he stuck out his hand nick hoffman dr delawares a psychologist said robin i build musical instruments how nice he glanced at the table shall we captain certainly senator said the redfaced officer his voice was raspy neither he nor the swarthy man had budged during the introductions youre at the head sir hoffman strode quickly to his place and removed his jacket the taller officer rushed to take it from him but hed already hung it on the back of the chair and sat down removing his collar pin and loosening his tie drink senator the officer said iced tea walt thanks the tall man left the redfaced man remained in place near the door join us captain ewing said hoffman motioning to one of the two empty chairs ewing removed his hat and complied leaving lots of space between his back and the chair can i assume everyone knows everyone elvin said hoffman i know everyone by name said ewing but weve never met mr creedman dr pam moreland dr and mrs delaware said hoffman captain elvin ewing base commander ewing put a finger to his eyeglasses he looked as comfortable as a eunuch in a locker room the officer returned with hoffmans tea the glass was oversized and a mint sprig floated on top anything else senator no sit down walt as he started to obey ewing said introduce yourself lieutenant lieutenant zondervein said the tall man looking straight ahead there said hoffman now were all friends emptying most of the glass with one gulp he picked out the mint sprig and chewed on a leaf are you traveling alone senator said creedman hoffman grinned at him just cant turn it off can you if you mean do i have an entourage no just me and yes its a leased government jet but i rode along with the base supplies the sleek craft id noticed actually continued hoffman there are three other legislative luminaries assigned to this particular trip senators bering petrucci and hammersmith theyre in hawaii right now arriving in guam tomorrow and i cant promise you they havent been sunbathing grinning i decided to come early so i could revisit my old stomping grounds see old friends no mr creedman it didnt cost the taxpayers an extra penny because my assignment is to assess facilities on several of the smaller micronesian islands including aruk and by coming alone i turned it into a cheap date he finished the tea crushed an ice cube swallowed and laughed i got to sit up with the pilot god the instrumentation on these things might as well have been trying to play one of those damn computer games my grandkids are addicted to did you know the average sevenyearold has more computer proficiency than his parents will ever achieve great eyehand skills too maybe we should train sevenyearolds to fly combat elvin ewings smile was anemic let me get you a refill senator said zondervein starting to get up hoffman said no thanks anyone else creedman lifted his martini glass lieutenant zondervein took it and went to the door ill check on the first course hoffman unfolded his napkin and tucked it into his collar mafia style he said but one wirephoto with grease spots on the tie and you learn so whats on the menu elvin chicken said ewing does it bounce i hope not sir roast or fried roast see that mr creedman simple fare he turned to ewing and for dr moreland sir hoffmans lips maintained a smile but his eyes narrowed until they disappeared dr morelands a vegetarian captain i believe i radioed you that from the plane yes sir there are vegetables there are vegetables fresh ones i believe so sir i hope so said hoffman too gently dr moreland maintains a very healthy diet or at least he used to i assume that hasnt changed bill anythings fine said moreland you were way ahead of your time bill eating right while the rest of us went merrily about clogging our arteries you look great been keeping up with the bridge no no you had how many master points ten fifteen havent played at all since you left nicholas really hoffman looked around bill was a great bridge player photographic memory and you couldnt read his face the rest of us were amateurs but we did manage to put together some spirited matches didnt we bill you really quit no more duplicate tournaments like the ones you used to play at the saipan club another shake of morelands head anyone here play said hoffman maybe we can get a game going after dinner silence oh well great game skill plus the luck of the draw a lot more realistic than something like chess zondervein returned with creedmans martini two sailors followed with a rolling cart of appetizers honeydew melon wrapped in ham hoffman said take the meat off dr morelands zondervein rushed to obey the ham tasted like canned sausage the melon was more starch than sugar gladys had said hoffman was a gourmet but gourmand was more like it he dug in enthusiastically scraping honeydew flesh down to bare rind and emptying his water glass three times dads been writing to you said pam did you receive his letters i did indeed said hoffman two letters right bill or did you send some i didnt get just two would you believe they just made their way to my desk the filtering process actually only the second one got to me directly maybe the three times you wrote personal on the envelope did the trick anyway i was tickled to receive it then i read the reference to your first letter and put out a search for it finally found it in some aides office filed under ecology you probably would have received a form letter in two or three months where do you get the ham elvin not smithwood or parma thats for sure its through the general mess sir said ewing as you instructed hoffman stared at him ewing turned to zondervein wheres the ham from lieutenant im not sure sir find out asap before the senator leaves yes sir ill go to the kitchen right now no said hoffman not important see tom we eat frugally when the public picks up the tab if you want great grub senator come over to my house you cook do you love to cook got a great beef tournedos recipe creedman smiled at moreland im into meat get much meat on the island said hoffman i make do it takes some creativity how about you pam do you like to cook not particularly only thing i can do is biscuits campside biscuits recipe handed down from my greatgrandmother flour baking soda salt sugar bacon drippings how long will you be staying said moreland just till tomorrow youve finished assessing stanton the process began stateside are you planning to close it down hoffman put down his fork and rubbed the rim of his plate were not at the decision stage yet meaning closure is likely i cant eliminate any possibilities bill if the base closes what will happen to aruk youre probably in a better position to say bill i probably am said moreland do you remember what i wrote about the blockade of south beach road yes i mentioned that to captain ewing did captain ewing give you his reason hoffman looked at ewing elvin ewings red face was aflame security he rasped meaning said moreland ewing directed his answer at hoffman im not free to discuss it openly sir the blockade was economical oppression nick said moreland hoffman cut free a white outer scrap of melon stared at it chewed and swallowed sometimes things change bill he said softly sometimes they shouldnt nick sometimes under the guise of helping people we do terrible things hoffman squinted at ewing again could you be a little more forthcoming for dr moreland elvin ewing swallowed thered been no food in his mouth there was some local unrest we appraised it given the data at hand and the judgment was that it had the potential to escalate and pose a hazard to navy security restricting contact between the men and the locals was deemed advisable in terms of risk management the proper forms were sent to pacific command and approval was granted by admiral felton gobbledygook said moreland a few kids got out of hand i think the navy can handle that without choking off the islands economy weve exploited them all these years its immoral to simply yank out the rug ewing bit back comment and stared straight ahead bill said hoffman my memory is that we saved them from the japanese that doesnt make us exploiters defeating the japanese was in our national interest then we took over and imposed our laws that makes the people our responsibility hoffman tapped his fork on his plate with all due respect he said very softly that sounds a little paternalistic its realistic pam touched the top of his hand he freed it and said local unrest makes it sound like some kind of uprising it was nothing nick trivial ewings lips were so tight they looked sutured shall i check on the second course sir said zondervein ewing gave him a guillotineblade nod actually its not quite that simple said creedman there was a murder a girl raped and left cut up on the beach the locals were sure a sailor had done it and were coming up here to protest oh said hoffman is there evidence a sailor was responsible none whatsoever sir said ewing too loudly they love rumors here the locals got liquored up and tried to storm dont make it sound like an insurgence said moreland the people had justification for their suspicions oh said hoffman surely you remember the people nick how nonviolent they are and the victim consorted with sailors consorted hoffman smiled put his fingers together and looked over them i knew the people thirty years ago bill i dont believe navy men tend to be murderers moreland stared at him ewing was nearly scarlet we were concerned about things getting out of hand we still believe that concern was justified given the facts and the hypotheticals the order came from pacific command nonsense said moreland the facts are that were a colonial power and its the same old pattern islanders living at the pleasure of westerners only to be abandoned its a betrayal yet another example of abusing trust hoffman didnt move then he picked something out of his teeth and ate another ice cube a betrayal repeated moreland hoffman seemed to be thinking about that finally he said you know that aruk has a special place in my heart bill after the war i needed peace and beauty and something unspoiled to us anyone tells you theres anything glorious about war has his head jammed up his rectum so high hes been blinded right elvin ewing managed a nod after the war i spent some of the best years of my life here remember how you and barb and dotty and i used to hike and swim bill how we used to say that some places were better left untouched perhaps we were more prescient than we knew maybe sometimes nature has to run her course thats the point nicholas aruk has been touched peoples lives are at i know i know but the problem is one of population distribution allocation of increasingly sparse resources ive seen too many illconceived projects that look good on paper but dont wash too many assumptions about the inevitable benefits of prosperity and autonomy look what happened to nauru nauru is hardly typical said moreland but its instructive hoffman turned to us any of you heard of nauru tiny island southeast of here smack in the center of micronesia ten square miles of guano bird dirt two hundred years of handsoff colonization by the brits and the germans then someone realizes the place is pure phosphate the brits and the germans collaborate on mining give the nauruans nothing but flu and polio world war two comes along the japanese invade and send most of the nauruans to chuuk as forced laborers after the war australia takes over and the native chiefs negotiate a sweet deal big share of the fertilizer profits plus australian welfare in sixtyeight australia grants full independence and the chiefs take over the nauru phosphate corporation which is exporting two million tons of gull poop a year a hundred million dollars in income per capita income rises to twentythousandplus comparable to an oil sheikdom cars stereos and junk food for the islanders along with a thirtypercent national rate of diabetes think of that one in three highest in the world no special hereditary factors either its clearly all the junk food same for high blood pressure coronary disease gross obesity i met an australian senator who called it land o lard throw in serious alcoholism and car crashes and youve got a life expectancy in the fifties and to top it off ninety percent of the phosphate is gone a few more years and nothingll be left but insulin bottles and beer cans so much for unbridled prosperity are you advocating the virtues of poverty nick no bill but the worlds changed some people think we need to stop looking at ourselves as the universal nursemaid were talking about people a way of life creedman said whoa you make it sound as though everything was hunkydory before the europeans came over and colonization spoiled everything but my research tells me there were plenty of diseases in the primitive world and that the people who didnt die of them would probably have died of famine i expected moreland to turn on him but he continued to stare at hoffman hoffman said there is some truth to that bill as a doctor you know that diseases said moreland as if the word amused him yes there were parasitic conditions but nothing on the scale of the misery that was brought over come on said creedman lets get real were talking primitive tribes pagan rituals no indoor plumbing moreland faced him slowly are you a wastedisposal expert in addition to all your other talents creedman said my resear did your research tell you that some of those primitive rituals ensured impeccable cleanliness practices such as reserving mornings for defecation and wading out to the ocean to relieve oneself that doesnt sound very hygien morelands hands rose and his fingers sculpted air it was fine until the civilized conquerors came along and told them they needed to dig holes in the ground do you know what that ushered in tom an era of filth cholera typhoid salmonellosis lungworm fever have you ever seen someone with cholera creedman ive have you ever held a dehydrated child in your arms as she convulses in the throes of explosive diarrhea the gnarled hands dropped and slapped down on the table research he muttered creedman sucked his teeth hed gone white i bow doctor he said softly to your superior knowledge of diarrhea the door opened zondervein and three sailors kitchen smells more food well said hoffman exhaling bon appétit other than hoffman no one ate much after his second dessert he stood and ripped his napkin free come on bill lets you and me catch up on old times nice to meet you all a glance at lieutenant zondervein who said how about the rest of us head over to the rec room theres a pool table and a bigscreen tv outside in the hall ewing gave him a disgusted look if youll all excuse me he left swiftly this way said zondervein do you get cable creedman asked sure said zondervein we get everything have a satellite dish excellent isnt there a dish at the trading post i said creedman laughed broke a year ago and no ones bothered to fix it does that tell you something about local initiative creedman and i played a couple of games of pool he was good but cheated anyway moving the cue ball when he thought i wasnt looking the bigscreen was tuned to cnn news lite he said only thing i get from the news is depressed said pam she and robin were sitting in chairs too big for them looking bored i caught robins eye she waved and sipped her coke a few minutes later zondervein brought moreland back he sagged with exhaustion pam said dad time to go after we landed creedman walked away from us without a word no one spoke during the ride back to the estate when moreland pulled up in front of the house it was nineforty i think ill catch up on work you all relax he patted pams arm have a good night dear maybe ill go into town oh i thought i might go for a night swim he touched her arm again held on to it that could be tricky pamela urchins morays you could run into trouble im sure dennis can keep me out of trouble he must have squeezed her arm because she winced dennis he said just above a whisper is engaged to a girl studying at the nursing school in saipan not anymore said pam oh they broke up a few weeks ago she touched his arm and he dropped it a pity said moreland nice girl she would have been valuable to the island fixing his eyes on his daughter dennis still is dear it would be best for all concerned if you didnt distract him turning on his heel he walked down toward the bungalows pams mouth was wide open she ran up to the house fun evening i said we were up in our suite sitting on the bed the way he just acted said robin i know hes under stress but loves the natives but doesnt want them dating his daughter it sounded more like he was shielding dennis from her it did maybe shes got an unfortunate history with men the first time i saw her i noticed the sadness in her eyes she smiled is that all you noticed yes shes goodlooking but i dont find her sexy theres something about her that sets up a clear boundary ive seen it in patients ive been wounded stay away that obviously doesnt apply to dennis the old man really lost it i said perfect capper to a charming dinner she laughed that base night of the uniformed dead and hoffman joe slick why do i get the feeling hoffmans sole purpose for the dinner was the half hour he and moreland spent alone then why not just drop over here maybe he wanted to be on his home turf not morelands you make it sound like some sort of battle i cant help but think it was the tension between them as if the two of them have some issue that goes way back at any rate moreland didnt get what he wanted for aruk whatever that is what do you mean he puzzles me rob talks about helping the island rejuvenating it but if hes as rich as creedman says it seems to me there are things he could have already done like improve communication put some of his fortune into schooling training at the very least more frequent shipping schedules instead he pumps a fortune into his projects walled in here like some lord while the rest of the island molders maybe the islanders know that and thats why theyre leaving we certainly havent seen any big show of civic pride not even a grassroots movement to protest the barricade she thought about that yes he is very much the lord of the manor isnt he and maybe the islanders know something else hoffmans right about some places not being set up for development look at aruks geography the leeward side has great weather but no harbor the windward side has a natural harbor but rocks instead of soil in between youve got mountains and a banyan forest full of land mines nothing fits right its like a geographic joke maybe everyone gets it but moreland and skip and haygood with their resort scheme which proves your point oh well looks like i signed on with dr quixote she got up and rolled off her panty hose frowning it was so out of character the way he just treated pam there doesnt seem to be much intimacy between them which makes sense with his being an absent father but till tonight hes never been harsh hes the one who sent her to boarding school i said and even with her md he doesnt consider her a colleague all in all no candidate for father of the year poor pam first time i saw her i thought homecoming queen but you never know do you she unbuttoned her dress and stepped out of it folded it over a chair and touched her wrist how does it feel i said excellent actually are you working tomorrow guess so maybe ill try to do something with those pieces of shell she went into the bathroom and screamed three of them no four racing back and forth lightpanicked on the white tile floor one scurried up the shower wall pointed its antennae at us waved robin was pressed into a corner fighting another scream one crawled up the side of the tub paused on the rim lozenge shaped redbrown armored shell as long as my hand six black legs the eyes too damn smart it hissed they all began hissing speeding toward us i pulled robin out of the room and slammed the door behind us checked the space beneath the door tight fit thank god my heart was hurtling sweat burst out of me and leaked down in cold itchy trails robins fingers bit into my back oh god alex oh god i managed to say its okay they cant get out oh god she gasped for breath i walked in and something touched my foot she looked down at her toes and trembled i sat her down she held on to my fingers shaking easy i said remembering the insects face stoic intense get rid of them honey please i will the light was off i felt it before i saw it how many were there i counted four it seemed like more i think four is all oh god i held her tight its all right theyre confined yucch she said yucch spike was barking when had he started maybe i should sic him on them no no i dont want him near them theyre disgusting just get them out of here alex call moreland i can take them in their cages but please get them out gladys arrived first bugs she said huge ones said robin wheres dr bill must be from the bug zoo it never happened before where is he gladys on his way you poor thing where are they i pointed to the bathroom she grimaced personally i hate bugs nasty little things little wouldnt be bad said robin working here doesnt bother you i said what the zoo i never go in there no one goes in there but dr bill and ben well something obviously comes out it never happened before she repeated hissing from behind the door i pictured the damn things chewing through the wood or escaping down the toilet and hiding in the pipes where the hell was moreland did you see what they were said gladys they looked like giant cockroaches said robin madagascar hissing cockroaches i said suddenly remembering them i really hate said gladys cockroaches in general one of the things i like about aruk is the dryness we dont get roaches lots of bugs period so we import them i mumbled i keep my kitchen clean some of the other islands youve got bugs all over the place got to spray all the time bugs bring disease not dr bills bugs he keeps them real clean thats a comfort i said a knock sounded on the suite door and moreland loped in carrying a large mahogany box with a brass handle and looking around i dont see how did you happen to notice what kind madagascar hissing roaches i said oh good they cant seriously harm you theyre in there he advanced to the bathroom door careful said robin dont let them out no problem dear he turned the knob slowly and took something out of his pocket a piece of chocolate cake that he compressed into a gummy ball spreading the door a crack he tossed the bait closed waited a few seconds later he opened the door again peered through nodded opened wider slipped in my new fudge loaf said gladys sounds came from inside the bathroom moreland talking soothingly he emerged moments later holding the mahogany box and giving the ok sign chocolate smears on his fingers crumbs on the floor thumps from within the box hiss youre sure you got all of them said robin yes dear they didnt lay eggs or anything he smiled at her no dear everythings fine it sounded patronizing and it got to me not really bill i said how the hell did they get here in the first place i dont know im sorry dreadfully sorry my apologies to both of you theyre definitely from the insectarium certainly aruk has no indig so howd they get out i suppose someone must have left the lid loose its never happened before said gladys thats us i said trailblazers moreland tugged at his lower lip rubbed his fleshy nose blinked i suppose i must have left the lid off its okay robin said squeezing my hand its over im so sorry dear perhaps the scent of your dog food if it was food they were after i said why didnt they head for the kitchen i keep my kitchen clean and shut up tight said gladys no flies not even grain weevils our door was locked i said and the dog foods sealed in plastic bags how did they get in bill he went over to the door opened and closed it a couple of times kneeled and ran his hand over the threshold theres some give to the carpet he said theyre very good at compressing themselves ive seen them manage spare the details i said you probably knocked a year off our lives im terribly terribly sorry he hung his head the cockroaches bumped inside the box then the hissing began again louder you did handle it perfectly he said locking them in thank you for not damaging them youre welcome i said id turned phone solicitors down with a kinder tone robin squeezed my hand again its okay bill she said were fine moreland said an unforgivable lapse im always so careful ill put double locks on the insectarium immediately and door seals well get working on it right now gladys call ramon and carl sleet apologize for waking them up and tell them ive got a job for them triple overtime pay tell carl to bring the swiss drill i gave him for christmas gladys rushed out moreland looked at the box and rubbed the oiled wood better be getting these fellows back he hurried to the door and nearly collided with jo picker as she padded in wearing robe and slippers rubbing her eyes is everything okay her voice was thick she coughed to clear it just a little mishap said moreland she frowned her eyes were unfocused took something to sleep did i hear someone scream i did said robin there were some bugs in the bathroom bugs the roaches hissed and her eyes widened go back to sleep dear said moreland guiding her out everythings been taken care of everythings fine when we were alone we let spike out and he raced around the room circling sniffing near the bathroom before charging in head down the dog food goes downstairs tomorrow said robin then she got up suddenly pulled back the bedcovers looked underneath the box spring and then stood smiling sheepishly just being careful she said are you going to be able to sleep i said hope so how about you my hearts down to two hundred beats a minute she sighed started laughing and couldnt stop i wanted to join in but couldnt manage more than a taut smile our little bit of new york she finally said manhattan tenement in our island hideaway those things could mug new york roaches i know she put my hand on her breast how many beats hmm i said hard to tell i need to count for a long time more laughter god the way i shrieked like one of those horror movies her forehead was moist curls sticking to it i brushed them away kissed her brow the tip of her nose so how long do we stay in bugland i said you want to leave plane crash unsolved murder the zombie base some fairly uncongenial people now this dont leave on my account i cant tell you i wont freak out if the same thing happens again but im okay now ms adaptable i pride myself on it sure i said but sometimes its nice not having to adapt true maybe im nuts but i still like it here maybe its my hand feeling better a lot better actually or even the fact this may be our last chance to experience aruk before the navy turns it into a bomb yard or something even bill hes unique aruk is unique she held my face and looked into my eyes i guess what im saying alex is i dont want to be back in la next week dealing with the house or some business hassle and start thinking back with regrets i didnt answer am i making sense doctor i touched my nose to hers curled my lip bared my teeth hissed she jumped up pounded my shoulder oh maybe i should have spike sleep in the bed and put you in the crate lights out a few selfconscious jokes about creepycrawlies and she was sleeping i lay awake trying to picture the roaches trekking all the way from the insectarium to our suite marching in unison the idea was cartoonish and even if the dog food had attracted them why hadnt they stayed in the sitting room near the bag roaches were supposed to be smart as bugs went why not head for an easier meal the fruit from the orchard instead theyd taken a circuitous journey scampering up the gravel paths across the lawn into the house somehow bypassing gladyss kitchen up the stairs under our door all because of a sealed sack of kibble despite morelands claim the bathroom door seemed too snug to let them in or out had we left it open before leaving for dinner at the base robin always left the bathroom door closed sometimes i didnt which of us had last used the lav why hadnt they come running out when we arrived home or at least hissed in alarm an alternative scenario theyd been placed in the bathroom and shut in someone up to mischief during the dinner at stanton the house empty someone seizing the opportunity to send us a message go away but who and why who had the opportunity ben was the obvious choice because he had access to the insectarium hed said his evening was full between fatherhood and a hibachi dinner with claire had he come back but why apart from the remark about natural rhythm hed shown no sign of hostility toward us on the contrary hed gone out of his way to make us feel welcome out of obligation to moreland were his own feelings something else i thought about it for a while but it just didnt make sense someone else on the staff cheryl too dull to be that calculating and once again what was her motive plus she usually left after dinner and no meal had been served tonight gladys same lack of motive and the idea of her purloining roaches seemed equally ludicrous there had to be at least a dozen groundskeepers and gardeners who came and went but why would they resent us unless the message had been meant for moreland my surmise about his attitude of noblesse oblige and the resentment it might have generated in the villagers could be right on target the good doctor less than universally loved his guests seen as colonial interlopers if so it could be anyone paranoia delaware the guy had kept thousands of bugs for years four had gotten out because he was old and absentminded and had forgotten to put a lid on tight spacey just as milo had said not a comforting thought considering the thousands of bugs but i supposed hed be especially careful now i tried to empty my head and sleep thought of the way jo picker had come in drowsy asking if someone had screamed robins scream had sounded a full ten minutes before why the delay the sleeping pill slowing her responses or no need to hurry because she knew and shed been alone upstairs all evening paranoia run amok what reason would a grieving widow have for malicious mischief shed said she was squeamish about insects had refused even to enter the bug zoo and there was no animosity between us robin had been especially kind to her even if she was a fiend how could she have gained access to our room her own room key the lock similar to ours or a simple pick most bedroom locks werent designed for security ours back home could be popped with a screwdriver i lay there and listened for sounds through the wall nothing what did i expect to hear the click of her keyboard widows wails i shifted position and the mattress rocked but robin didnt budge teachers voices from many years ago filtered through my brain alexander is a very bright little boy but he does tend to daydream is something wrong at home mrs delaware alexander has seemed rather distracted lately a soft liquid line of light oozed through a part in the curtains like golden paint freshly squeezed playing on robins face she smiled in her sleep curls dangling over one eye take her example and adapt i relaxed my muscles consciously and deepened my breathing soon my chest loosened and i felt better able to smile at the image of moreland with his chocolate cake and schoolboy guilt my body felt heavy ready to sleep but it took a long time to fall under the next morning the clouds were darker and moving closer but still remote we were ready to dive at ten spike was acting restless so we decided to take him along needing something to shade him we went to the kitchen and asked gladys she called carl sleet in from the rose garden where he was pruning and he trotted over carrying his shears his gray work clothes hair and beard were specked with grass clippings and his nails were filthy he went to the outbuildings and came back with an old umbrella with a spiked post and a blueandwhite canvas shade that was slightly soiled want me to load it for you no thanks i can do it put new locks on the bug house last night strong ones shouldnt be having any more problems thanks welcome got any fudge left gladys here you go she gave him some and he returned to his work eating gladys walked us through the kitchen dr bill feels awful about last night ill let him know there are no hard feelings that would be charitable now you two have a good time i pitched the umbrella on south beach and realized wed forgotten to bring drinks leaving robin and spike on the sand i drove over to auntie maes trading post the same faded clothes were in the windows which were flyspecked and cloudy inside the place was barnlike with wooden stalls lining a sawdust aisle and walls of raw board most of the booths were empty and even those that were stocked werent staffed more clothing cheap out of date beach sandals suntan lotion and tourist kitsch miniature thatched huts of bamboo and astroturf plastic dancing girls pouting tiki gods coconuts carved into blowfish the building smelled of cornmeal and seawater and a bit of backedup bilge the only other human being was a young plainfaced woman in a red tank top watching tv behind the counter of the third booth to the right her cash register was a scarred black antique next to it were canisters of beef jerky and pickled eggs and a halffull bottle of windex and a rag the front case was filled with candy bars and chips potato corn taro on the rear wall were a swinging door and shelves holding sealed boxes of sweets the television was mounted to the side wall that separated the stall from its neighbor sharing space with a pay phone she noticed me but kept watching the screen the image was fuzzy streaked intermittently with bladelike flashes of white a station from guam long shot of a big room with polished wood walls corporate logo of a hotel chain over a long banquet table senator nicholas hoffman sat in the center behind a glass of water and a microphone he wore a whiteandbrown batik shirt and several brilliantly colored flower necklaces the two white men flanking him were dressed the same way one i recognized as a legislator from the midwest the other was cut from the same hairtonicked hungrysmile mold four other men asians sat at the ends of the table hoffman glanced at his notes then looked up smiling and so let me conclude by celebrating the fact that we all share a vision of a more viable and prosperous micronesia a multicultural micronesia that moves swiftly and confidently into the next century he smiled again and gave a small bow applause the screen flickered went gray shut off the young woman turned it back on commercial

in a grass skirt rolling his hips and winking cmon brudda the woman flicked the remote control more black screen then a tenyearold sitcom she watched as the credits rolled then said can i help you

glossy quarterly entitled island world gorgeous smiling blackhaired girls and sunblushed tropical vistas the publications dates three to five years old boy those really are old said betty found em

me here you go after the babys born well probably be moving away my husband works construction and theres no work nothing at all not really this here is the biggest building in town a few years back

actually my moms stall but shes sick bad heart ive got time waiting for my baby so i take over for her and my husband delivers most of our stuffs delivery she touched her stillflat belly my husband would like a boy but i dont care as long as its healthy laughtrack noise from the tv she turned her head and smiled along with the electronic joy bye i said she waved absently when i got back to the beach robins snorkel was a tiny white duck bobbing near the outer edge of the reef our blankets were spread and spike was leashed to the umbrella post barking furiously the object of his wrath was skip amalfi stark naked peeing a high arcing stream into the sand several yards away anders haygood stood next to him in kneelength baggies watching skips bleachedbone buttocks said skinnydipping wasnt a habit his green trunks lay next to him like a heap of wilted salad spike barked louder skip laughed and aimed the stream closer to the dog shaking with glee as spike growled and spat drool then the arc dribbled and died spike shook himself off theatrically and moved closer to the two men i ran haygood saw me and said something to skip who stopped and turned offering a full frontal view i kept coming grinning skip looked over his shoulder at robins snorkel his urine trail was drying quickly a brown snake sinking into the sand spike was pawing the blanket finally moving enough of it to reach sand and scatter it skip stretched and yawned and massaged his gut is that going to be the official welcome at your resort i said smiling his face darkened but he forced himself to smile back yeah living naturally better watch the ultraviolet radiation it can lead to impotence whu the sun your hardon said haygood amused what the mans trying to tell you is bruise it and lose it watch the uv on your tool or youll be hauling limp wiener fuck you skip told him but he looked at me edgily its true i said too much uv to the genitals heats up the scrotal plexus and weakens the neurotestostinal reflex boil it and spoil it said haygood fuck you in the ass said skip looking for his trunks haygood lunged grabbed them up and began running down the beach stocky but fast skip went after him potbelly quivering holding his crotch spike was still drooling and breathing hard i sat down and tried to calm him robin had moved into shallower waters she stood lifted her face mask and waved then she saw the two men running and came out of the water what was that all about i told her how rude he was probably hoping youd come out and see him playing fireman shucks i missed it she squatted and petted spike mamas all right sweetie dont worry about those turkeys its gorgeous down there alex come on in maybe later is something wrong let me just stick around for a while in case they return though i may have traumatized old skip i recounted my uv warning and she cracked up you probably ruined what little sex life hes got reverse therapy my education is now fully validated dont worry about them alex dive with me if they come back well give spike a run at them spike can be dropkicked by a twelveyearold they dont know that tell them hes a neurotestostinal pit bull we visited every crag in the reef side by side and emerged an hour later to an undisturbed beach spike slept noisily under a cloud of sand flies the drinks had warmed but we poured them down our throats then robin stretched out on a blanket and closed her eyes and i picked up the spring issue of island world the article that had caught my eye was on page after comehither tourist pieces on pacific rim archaeological sites choice dive spots restaurants and nightclubs bikini a history of shame the author was a man named micah sanjay formerly a civilian official of the marshall islands us military government now a retired high school principal living in chalan kanoa saipan his story was identical to the one moreland had told me failure to evacuate the residents of bikini and majuro and the neighboring marshall atolls clandestine nighttime boat rides doling out compensation the exact same story down to the amount of money paid sanjay wrote matteroffactly but his anger came through a majuro native hed lost relatives to leukemia and lymphoma no greater anger than when recounting the payoff sanjay and six other civil servants assigned the job six names none of them moreland i reread the article searching for any mention of the doctor nothing if the old man had never been part of the payoff why had he lied about it something else he said the first night resonated guilt is a great motivator alex feeling himself culpable for the blast hed been a navy officer had he known about the winds was it guilt that had transformed him from a trustfund kid in dress whites to a wouldbe schweitzer coming to aruk to atone not that his lifestyle had suffered living in a grand estate indulging his passions aruk his fiefdom but his daughter couldnt be permitted to fraternize with the locals did he want the villagers isolated so he could enjoy aruk on his own terms an idealized refuge for noble savages with good hygiene and clean water maybe i was judging him unfairly residual anger about the cockroaches but it did appear that hed lied to me about the marshalls compensation program and that bothered me i looked over at robins beautiful prone body gleaming in the sun spike slept too i was hunched fingers tight on the magazine maybe moreland had indeed been in those boats another payoff team not sanjays one way to find out talk to the author sanjay had worked for the government forty years ago then as a school principal meaning he was morelands age or close to it still alive still on saipan robin rolled over umm this sun is great sure is i said hot too and the drinks are all gone ill bop over to the trading post and get us some more i jogged this time veering from the beach to the docks where skip and haygood sat dangling fishing poles haygood watched me skip kept his eyes on the water he had his trunks on and a tshirt the most clothes id seen him in inside the trading post betty aguilar was watching a game show and munching a mars bar hi back so soon couple of beers two more cokes youre definitely my best customer hold on ill get them for you does the pay phone work usually but if you want to call dr bills place i can let you use the one in back for free no this is long distance oh do you need change i thought id use my calling card i think thatll work she went in back and i lifted the receiver another rotary it took a while to get a dial tone a lot longer to work my way through several operators and finally obtain permission to use the card each successive connection was worse than the previous one and by the time i reached saipan information i was speaking through a hail of static and the echo of my own voice on onesecond delay but micah sanjay was listed and when i called his number an oldersounding man with a mild voice said yes sorry to bother you mr sanjay but im a freelance writer named thomas creedman on temporary stopover in aruk uhhuh i just happened to come across your article in island world on the nuclear testing in the marshalls that was a long time ago unsure if he meant the disaster or the magazine piece i pressed on i thought it was very interesting and extremely well done are you writing about bikini too im thinking about it if i can get a fresh slant i tried to sell that article to some mainland magazines but no one was interested really people dont want to know and those that do know want to forget easier on the conscience you bet his voice had hardened i think some of the most powerful scenes were your descriptions of the compensation process those nighttime boat rides yes that was tough sneaking around were you and the six other men the entire compensation staff there were bosses who ordered it from behind a desk but we did all the actual paying do you remember the bosses names admiral haupt captain ravenswood above them were people from washington i guess are you still in touch with the other men on the team if it would be possible for me to talk to them im not in touch but i know where they are george avuelas died a few years ago cancer but i cant say for sure if it was related the others are gone too except bob taratoa and he lives in seattle has a boy there but he had a stroke last year so im not sure how much he could tell you so theres no one else still in the marianas nope just me whered you say you were from aruk what is that one of those small islands up north a bit from here thats it anything to do there sun and write well good luck theres a doctor who lives here named moreland says he was in the navy when the tests went off says he treated some of the people whod been exposed moreland woodrow wilson moreland dont know him but there were lots of doctors some of them pretty good but they couldnt do anything for the people even if they wanted to those bombs poisoned the air and the water radioactivity got into the soil no matter what they say im convinced theyll never get the stuff out as i left the post i saw jacqui laurent and dennis standing in front of the chop suey palace the mother was talking and the son was listening scolding him being subtle about it no hand gestures or raised voice but her eyes flashed and the displeasure on her face was evident dennis stood there and took it his giant frame slightly bowed she looked so young a casual observer might have thought it a lovers spat she folded her hands over her chest and waited dennis scuffed the ground nodded similar look to the one pam had worn after moreland had reprimanded her same issue lord of the manor dropping in on one of his tenants this morning letting her know his displeasure about dennis and pam dennis looked from side to side saw me and said something jacqui put a hand around his thick forearm and propelled him quickly inside back at the estate i sat through a lunch of broiled halibut and fresh vegetables walked robin and spike down to the orchard and headed for my office moreland had left another folded card on my desk alex cannot locate catwoman file spirits overwrought were making night do penance for a day spent in a round of strenuous idleness wordsworth a fitting quote for that case dont you think bill i sat at my desk night do penance strenuous idleness the philandering husband always riddles as if he were playing with me why had he lied to me about the payoff time to talk the door to his office was unlocked but he wasnt in there and the lab door was closed i went over to knock and passing his desk noticed the reprints of my journal articles fanned like playing cards next to some newspaper clippings clippings about me my involvement in a mass childabuse case years ago my consultation to a grade school terrorized by a sniper accounts of court testimony in several murder cases my name highlighted in yellow milos too i remembered the message hed written about milos call detective sturgis off the job milo generally didnt identify himself by title researching him too thick pile of clippings on the bottom a homicide trial my testimony for the prosecution debunking the phony insanity plea of a man whod savaged a dozen women morelands notation in the margin perfect so id been selected for something other than a fine combination of scholarliness and commonsense thinking moreland definitely worried about the cannibal killer had he lured me here under false premises in order to pick my brain dr detective what did i have to offer did he have reason to believe the murderer was still on aruk a crash from inside the lab made me jump and my hand brushed the clippings to the floor i picked them up quickly and ran to the inner door locked i knocked hard a groan from inside bill another groan its alex are you all right a few seconds later the knob turned and moreland stood there rubbing his forehead with one hand the other was palm down dripping blood he looked stunned fell asleep he said behind him on the lab table were brightly colored boxes plastic cartons test tubes on the floor reduced to jagged glass your hand bill he turned his hand palm up blood had pooled and was trickling down his wrist and narrowing to a single red line that wiggled the length of his scrawny forearm i led him to the sink and washed the wound clean gash not deep enough to require stitching but still oozing steadily wheres your firstaid kit underneath pointing drowsily to a cabinet i applied antibiotic ointment and a bandage fell asleep he repeated shaking his head the colored boxes contained dehydrated potatoes and wheat pilaf precooked peas lentils rice mix nutritional research said moreland as if he owed me an explanation his attention shifted to the broken glass and he bent i reached out to restrain him ill take care of it working late he said weakly he glanced at the bandaged hand rubbed his mouth licked his lips usually i do some of my best work after dark got a late start making sure those locks got installed correctly im still mortified about what happened forget it i must have left the lid off and the door unlocked inexcusable must remember to check every detail he began massaging his temples very rapidly headache sleep deprivation he said i should know better at my age are you aware that most socalled civilizations are chronically sleep deprived before electricity people lit a candle or two then went to bed the sun was their alarm clock they were tuned to a natural cadence nine ten hours of sleep a day its a rare civilized man who gets eight do the villagers sleep well what do you mean theres not much technology on the island lousy tv reception less to keep them up tv he said is multiplechoice rubbish however if you miss it i can arrange something no thanks but i wouldnt mind a newspaper now and then just to stay in touch with the world im sorry son cant help you there we used to get papers more often when the navy let us ship things on their supply planes but now we depend upon the boats dont you find the radio news sufficient i noticed some american papers on your desk he blinked those are old research our eyes locked his were clear and alert now yes i use a clipping service in guam if youd like i can have them bulkorder some periodicals for you and if youd like to watch tv i can get you a portable set no its not necessary youre sure hundred percent please tell me if theres anything more you need by way of creature comforts i want your stay to be enjoyable he ran his tongue under his right cheek and frowned has it been enjoyable excepting last night of course were having a fine time i hope so one tries to be a good host he smiled and shrugged my apologies again about the hissers lets really forget it bill youre very gracious i suppose ive been living here by myself so long that the niceties of social discourse elude me staring at the floor again holding his bandaged hand with the other and getting that absent look in his eyes then he snapped out of it stood suddenly and surveyed the lab back to work dont you think you should rest no no im tiptop by the way what was it you came here for what id come for were piercing questions about samuel h and radiation poisoning payoffs halftruths and subterfuge what if anything his role had been forty years ago now something else why was my involvement in crime cases perfect i said just wanted to know if there were any specific cases you wanted me to look over oh no i wouldnt presume as i told you at the outset you have total freedom i wouldnt mind reviewing any other nuclear fallout cases you might have neuropsychological sequelae of radiation poisoning i dont think anyones studied it it could be a great opportunity for us to produce a unique theoretical base his head retracted an inch and he put a hand on the counter yes it could he began arranging boxes of dried food peering at ingredients straightening a test tube rack unfortunately samuels is the only radiation chart i took with me til i came across it i didnt know it was there or perhaps i left it there unconsciously wanting a reminder of what the terrible terrible things people do under the guise of authority yes i said authority can be horribly corrupting short hard nod another burdened look he stared at me then turned away and held a test tube of brown liquid up to the light his arm trembled it would have been an interesting paper alex sorry i havent any more data speaking of authority i said i was at the trading post this morning and happened to catch the tail end of hoffmans press conference in guam really he inspected another tube he was talking about his plan to develop micronesia he made his fortune building shopping centers so im not surprised that and socalled managed forestry his father was a lumberjack but hes responsible for more timber clearing than his father could have ever imagined he has a reputation for being ecologically minded there are ways of what of getting ones way without fouling ones own nest he chopped down rain forest in south america but supported national parks in oregon and idaho so the ecology groups gave him an excellent rating a fact he reminded me of last night as if that excused it excused what what hes doing here letting aruk die he put down the test tube and glared at me a loss of vigor doesnt imply the terminal state so you have hope for the island his hands dropped to his sides again skinny and rigid as ski poles blood had seeped under the bandage and crusted i always have hope he said barely moving his lips without hope theres nothing he lit a bunsen burner and i returned to my office why hadnt i been more forthright the fall his seeming fragility falling forgetfulness tremors sleep deprivation as he claimed or was he just an old man in decline declining along with his island his reaction to my suggestion that aruk was dying had been sharp the same type of frosty anger hed shown pam last night i wondered if hed once been a harder colder man without hope theres nothing hope was fine but what was he doing about it the same question why not take heroic measures to revive things rather than put his energy into the nutritional needs of bugs because he was running out of energy needed a universe he could control lord of the roaches where did i fit in i left to find robin but she found me first coming up the path with spike looking troubled whats wrong lets go inside we returned to the office and sat on the couch oh boy what is it i took another walk to the northeast corner of the estate where it curves away from the banyan forest actually i followed spike he kept pulling me there she pushed curls away from her eyes and rested her head on the back of the sofa the stone walls continue all around but as the road curves theres a very thick planting of avocado and mango that blocks the border hundreds of mature trees you have to really squeeze to get through spike kept huffing really yanking me after a hundred feet or so i figured out why someone was crying i ran to see she took my hand and squeezed it it was pam alex lying on a blanket between the trees picnic stuff with her a thermos sandwiches lying on her back wearing a sundress oh boy what the straps were down and one hand was here she cupped her own left breast her eyes were closed the other hand was up her dress we just burst in on her crying from pleasure no no i dont think so more like emotional pain shed been touching herself and for some reason it had made her miserable tears were running down her cheeks i tried to leave before she saw us but spike started barking and she opened her eyes i was mortified she sat up and adjusted her clothes and meanwhile spikes running straight to her licking her face our little protector lord lord poor you can you imagine alex the size of this place youd figure you could find a private spot without sherlock bones sniffing you out rotten luck i agreed though i guess a really private spot would have been in her room with the door closed howd she react a split second of shock then calm ladylike as if i was a neighbor dropping by to borrow sugar she invited me to sit down i wanted to be anywhere but there but what could i say no thanks ill just leave you to whatever dark and depressing sexual fantasies you were having ta ta meanwhile spikes sniffing the sandwiches and drooling the boy knows his priorities oh yeah the world stops for ham and cheese actually having him there was a good distraction she played with him for a while fed him and we were doing a pretty good job of pretending it never happened then all of a sudden she burst into tears and stuff just started pouring out how rotten her marriage had been what an ugly divorce i felt like a sponge soaking up her pain i dont know how youve done it all these years i didnt say a thing but she just kept going it was almost as if she was glad id found her maybe she was or being discovered lowered her defenses what was so rotten about her marriage her husband was also a doctor a vascular surgeon couple of years younger very brilliant very goodlooking the med centers most eligible bachelor love at first sight whirlwind courtship but sex with him was she couldnt respond so she faked it it had never been a problem for her before she figured it would work itself out but it didnt and eventually he realized it at first he didnt care as long as he got his soon though it began to bother him affront to his manhood he started pressuring her interrogating her then it became an obsession if she didnt come it wasnt real lovemaking eventually they started avoiding each other and he started having affairs lots of affairs not even trying to hide it with both of them working in the same place she felt she was a laughingstock she just sat there and told you all this it was more as if she was talking to herself alex she asked him to go into counseling he refused saying it was her problem so she went into therapy by herself and eventually things just broke down between them completely and she filed for divorce at first he was really rotten humiliating her with cracks about her being frigid telling her about all the girls he was going out with but then he had a change of heart and wanted to reconcile she turned him down he kept calling her begging for another chance she said no and pressed on with the divorce a month later he died in a freak accident working out in his home gym benchpressing the barbell fell on his chest and crushed him to death and she feels guilty extremely guilty even though she knows its not rational because she feels he really did still love her she cant get rid of the idea that he was overdoing the weight lifting because he was stressed out over her and to think the first time i saw her i thought she was the girl with everything the girl with nothing left i said so she packs up and returns here and finds another younger man did the flap over dennis come up no but it sure looks like you were right about her having man problems so maybe thats what bill was reacting to he doesnt want her hurt again so soon maybe cmere she climbed onto my lap and i held her close looks like you missed your true calling thats what im concerned about its not my calling you always talk about patients saying too much too quickly then growing hostile honey i said you werent probing you just listened and you have no professional responsibility i know alex but i like her basically she seems to be a sweet woman whos experienced some horrible things she was only three when her mother died and bill sent her away farming her out to relatives and then boarding schools she says she doesnt blame bill he was doing his best but its got to hurt is there anything more i should be doing for her if she seeks you out listen as long as it doesnt make you feel uncomfortable i dont want her to feel uncomfortable were all living together in close quarters this place i said is starting to feel like eden after the fall from grace no she said smiling no serpents just bugs maybe we should think about cutting our stay short rob no wait hear me out there are things bothering me that i havent told you she shifted position and stared up at me like what maybe im being paranoid but i cant get rid of the idea that someone planted those roaches i told her my suspicions but what would be the motive alex the only thing i can think of is that someone wants us out of here who and why i dont know but im pretty sure bill hasnt been totally straight about his reasons for bringing me over so there may be something going on that were totally unaware of i told her about morelands fall in the lab the crime clippings on his desk his knowledge of my friendship with milo you think he wants help with a crime she said the murder on south beach he says its the only major crime theyve had in a long time what could he want from you i dont know but he did show me the record of the autopsy and he claims no one else has seen it other than dennis each time i talk to him i get the feeling hes holding back either hes building up his courage or making sure he can trust me the question is will i ever be able to trust him because he lied to me about something else i recounted the case of samuel hs radiation poisoning and my conversation with micah sanjay that is odd she said but maybe theres an explanation why dont you just come out and ask him i was on my way to do just that but after he fell and started bleeding i guess i felt sorry for him ill deal with it and then we leave she looked sad i said there are also things about the murder i havent told you it was more than just a gory killing there was organ theft evidence of cannibalism she lost color got off my lap walked to a teak wall and traced the woods grain with her finger you thought i couldnt handle it i didnt think it was necessary to expose you to every disgusting detail she didnt answer i wasnt patronizing you rob but this was supposed to be a vacation would hearing about marrow being sucked out of leg bones have done you any good you know she said facing me when pam started unloading it was tough at first but then it felt good the fact that she trusted me breaking my routine and finding out my sympathies have been awakened isnt a bad thing ive started to realize how much i use work to escape people ive always considered you great with peop im talking about relating in depth alex especially to other women you know ive never done much of that growing up so close to my dad always trying to please him by doing boy stuff you always say were an odd couple the guy dealing with feelings the girl wielding power tools i got up and stood next to her being here she said away from the grind even for these few days has been a learning experience dont worry im not going to give it all up to be a therapist two shrinks in one house would be too much to bear but helping people gratifies me she threw her arms around me and pressed her face against my chest welcome to robins epiphany all that said we can leave early if youre uncomfortable here no theres no emergency im probably letting my imagination get out of control as usual she kissed my chin i like your imagination so youre okay with cannibals on the beach hardly but it happened half a year ago and as you said sex killers dont just stop so i figure he is gone youre a tough kid castagna she laughed not really first thing i did this afternoon was check my shoes for creepycrawlies and if something else happens you may just see me swimming for guam ill be right behind you okay if youre fine i am hey you calmed me down you can be my therapist nope why not ethical considerations i want to keep sleeping with you i went back to morelands bungalow locked now and no one answered the next time i saw him was at the dinner table that evening the bandage on his hand was fresh and he acknowledged me with a smile pam stood in a corner of the terrace hands at her sides she wore a bloodred chinese silk dress and red sandals her hair was pinned and a yellow orchid rested above her left ear forced festivity she turned and gave us a wave robin looked at me and when i nodded went over to her i sat down next to moreland hows the hand fine thank you some juice mixed citrus quite delicious i took some theres a case id like to discuss with you oh a man named joseph cristobal thirtyyearold file he complained of visual hallucinations white worms white worm people and then he died in his sleep you found a blocked coronary artery and gave the cause of death as heart failure but you also noted an organism called a tutalo i looked it up but couldnt find any mention of it he rubbed his crinkled chin ah yes joseph he worked here gardening looked healthy enough but his arteries were a mess loved coconut maybe that contributed he never complained of any cardiac symptoms but even if he had there wouldnt have been much i could have done today of course id refer him for an angiogram possible bypass surgery its the humbling thing about medicine acceptable practice inevitably resembles medieval barbering what about a tutalo he smiled no its not an organism its a bit more complicated than that son ah one second jo had come out ben and claire romero right behind her moreland sprang up touched jos hand briefly then continued on and gave claire a hug looking over his shoulder he said shall we continue our discussion after dinner alex jo seemed different eyes less burdened voice lighter almost giddy praising the food every third bite informing the table that lymans body had reached the states and been picked up by his family then waving off condolences she changed the subject to her research pronouncing that everything was proceeding grandly the sky turned deep blue then black the rain clouds were gray smudges they hadnt moved much since morning when jo stopped talking moreland strode to the railing where some geckos were racing when he waved a piece of fruit they stopped and stared at him dinnertime was probably a cue he handfed them then returned to the table and delivered a discourse on interspecies bonding avoiding my eyes i thought a bit of small talk followed before the conversation settled upon claire romero the way it often does with a newcomer she was wellspoken but very quiet the honoluluborn daughter of two high school teachers shed played violin in college and in several chamber groups and had considered a professional career in music why didnt you said jo nibbling a croissant claire smiled not enough talent sometimes were not our own best judges i am dr picker shes the only one who feels that way said ben she was a child prodigy i married her and took her away from it claire looked at her plate please ben you are immensely talented dear said moreland and its been so long since you played for us last year wasnt it on my birthday in fact what a lovely night that was ive barely played since dr bill she turned to robin have you ever built a violin no but ive thought of it i have some old alpine spruce and tyrolean maple that would be perfect but its a little intimidating whys that said jo small scale subtle gradations i wouldnt want to ruin old wood claires got a terrific old fiddle said ben french a guersan over a hundred years old he winked in fact it just happens to be down in the car claire stared at him he smiled back with mock innocence she shook her head well then said moreland clapping his hands you must play for us im really rusty dr bi im willing to assume the risk dear claire glared at ben please dear just a piece or two im warning you get out the earplugs warning duly noted would it be possible to play the piece you did for us last year the vivaldi claire hesitated glanced at ben i saw the case he said just lying there in the closet it said take me along if youre hearing voices perhaps you should have a long talk with dr delaware dear said moreland softly claire shook her head sure dr bill she played wonderfully but she looked tense mouth set shoulders hunched swaying in time with the music as she filled the terrace with a rich brocade of melody when she was through we applauded and she said thanks for your tolerance now ive really got to get going science projects due tomorrow moreland walked her and ben out pam nibbled a slice of passion fruit distracted robin took my hand she is good alex fantastic i said but i was thinking about a tutalo the other things id ask moreland when he returned he didnt when robin said lets go upstairs i didnt argue the moment we closed our suite door we were embracing and soon we were in bed kissing deeply merging hungrily afterward i sank into a molasses vat of dreamless sleep a welcome braindeath that made waking up in the middle of the night so much more unsettling sitting up sweating noises my head was fogged and i struggled to make sense of what i was hearing rapid pounding footsteps out in the hall someone running a tattoo of footsteps more than one person fast panic then shouts angry hurried someone insisting no spike barked robin sat up hair in her face she grabbed my arm a door slammed alex more shouts too far away to make out words no again a mans voice moreland we got up threw on robes opened our door carefully the chandelier over the entry was on whitening the landing my eyes ached struggling to stay open moreland wasnt there but jo was her broad back to us hands atop the banister a door down the hall opened and pam came running out wrapped in a silver kimono her face paperwhite the door stayed open and i had my first look at her room white satin bedding peachcolored walls cut flowers at the end of the landing her fathers door remained closed but i heard him again down in the entry we hurried next to jo she didnt turn kept looking at moreland and dennis laurent the police chief stood just inside the front door in full uniform hands on his hips a holstered pistol on his belt moreland faced him hands clenched he had on a long white nightshirt soft slippers his legs were varicosed stilts his hands inches from the police chiefs impassive face impossible dennis insane dennis held out a palm moreland came closer anyway listen to me dennis im just telling you what we i dont care what you found its impossible how could you of all take it easy lets just go one step at a time and ill do what i what you can do is end it right now dont even entertain the possibility and dont allow anyone else to theres simply no choice son the policemans eyes became black cuts so you want me to youre the law son its up to you to its up to me to enforce the law enforce it but but not fully you know what im saying dennis this must be stop denniss bass voice hit a note at the bottom of his register he stood even taller bearing down on moreland forced to look up moreland said this is psychotic after all you and i go with what i have said dennis and what i have looks bad and it could get lots worse i called the base and asked ewing to keep his men under watch he took your call as a matter of fact he did congratulations said moreland bitterly youve finally arrived doc theres no reas theres no reason to continue this insanity the police chief started to open the door moreland took hold of his arm dennis stared at morelands bony fingers until the old man let go ive got things to do doc stay here dont leave the estate how can you like i said i go with what i have and i said stop wasting your breath dennis made another attempt to leave and once again moreland reached for his arm this time the big man shook him off and moreland fell back dennis caught him as pam called out dennis looked up at us think son said moreland does it make im not your damn son and i dont need you to tell me what to think or how to do my job just stay up here till i tell you different thats house impris its good sense youre obviously not going to be of much help so im calling over to saipan and have them send me someone no said moreland ill cooperate im perfectly forget it im the not anymore said dennis just stay here and dont cause problems growling now his enormous shoulders bunched he looked up at us again focused on pam then scanned the banister from end to end eyes darting like the geckos whats going on i said he chewed his lip morelands head was down and he was holding it as if to keep it from falling off his neck pam said whats happened whats happened dennis dennis seemed to consider an answer then he looked back at moreland now leaning face to the wall a bad thing he said putting one foot out the door daddy can tell you all about it the door slammed and he was gone moreland remained in the entry not moving the chandelier turned his bald head metallic pam rushed down to him and we followed dad she put her arm around him his color was bad what is it dad he mumbled something what silence please daddy tell me he shook his head and muttered as dennis said a bad thing what bad thing more headshaking she guided him to an armchair in the front room he sat reluctantly remaining on the edge one hand scratching a knobby knee the other shielding most of his face the visible part was the color of spoiled milk and his lips looked like slices of putty whats going on daddy why was dennis so rude to you doing his job a crime there was a crime dad moreland dropped both hands in his lap defeat had stripped his face of structure each wrinkle was as black and deep as freshly gouged sculptors clay yes a crime murder who was murdered dad no answer when tonight i said another he cut me off with a handslash a terrible murder who said jo a young woman where dad victory park who was the victim pressed jo long pause a girl named betty aguilar pam frowned do we know her ida aguilars daughter she works idas stall at the trading post she came in for a checkup last week i introduced you to her when my god i said i just spoke to her today she was three months pregnant robin said oh no she was holding on to the sash of my robe eyes belladonnabright well thats certainly dreadful said jo not a trace of slur off the sleeping pills yes yes said moreland very dreadful yes yes yes he grabbed for the chairs arm pam braced him im so sorry daddy were you close to her i he began to cry and pam tried to hold him but he freed himself and looked over at the big dark windows the sky was still deep blue the clouds larger lower i delivered her he said i was going to deliver her baby she was doing so well with prenatal care she used to smoke and he touched his mouth she resolved to take good care of herself and stuck to it any idea why she was killed said jo moreland stared at her why would i know that you knew her moreland turned away from her why does dennis want you to stay up here i said not just me all of us were all under house arrest why daddy said pam because they its he listed forward then sat back heavily both hands glued to the chairs arms the fabric was a rose damask silk once expensive now i noticed the worn spots and the snags a stitchedup tear stains that could never be cleaned moreland rubbed his temples the way he had after his fall in the lab then his neck he winced and pam put a finger under his chin and propped it why are we under house arrest daddy he shuddered da he reached up removed her finger held on to it shaking ben he said they think ben did it he hid his face again pam left and returned with gladys who carried a bottle of brandy and glasses seeing moreland in that state frightened the housekeeper dr bill please go back to bed said pam well need you in the morning gladys wrung her hands please gladys moreland said im fine gladys in a voice that proved otherwise the old woman chewed her cheek and finally left brandy dad he shook his head she filled a glass anyway and held it out to him he waved off the liquor but accepted some water pam took his pulse and felt his forehead warm she said and youre sweating the rooms hot he said all the glass the windows were open and scented air flowed through the screens chilly air my hands were icy pam wiped morelands brow lets get some fresh air dad we moved to the terrace moreland offering no resistance as pam put him at the head of the empty dining table here have some more water he sipped as the rest of us stood around the sky was blue suede the moon a slice of lemon rind droplets of light hit the ocean i looked out over the railing watching as lights switched on rapidly in the village i poured brandy all around morelands eyes were fixed and wide insane he said how could they think it do they have evidence said jo no said moreland they claim he someone found him at the scene i said sleeping at the scene convenient isnt it who found him said jo a man from the village a credible man something new in her voice scientists skepticism an almost hostile curiosity a man named bernardo rijks said moreland chronic insomniac takes too many daytime naps he looked at the brandy more water please kitten pam filled a glass and he gulped it empty bernardo takes a walk late at night has for years down from his home on campion way to the docks along the waterfront then back up sometimes he makes two or three circuits says the routine helps make him drowsy wheres campion way i said the street where the church is said pam its unmarked the street where victory park is moreland gave a start tonight when he passed the park he heard groans and thought there might be a problem so he went to see what kind of problem i said drug overdose the parks a drug hangout used to be he said angrily when the sailors came into town theyd drink themselves silly at slims or smoke marijuana on the beach try to pick up local girls then head for the park bernardo lives at the top of campion he used to call me to treat the stuporous boys is he credible said jo hes a fine gentleman the problems not with him its moreland ran his fingers through the white puffs at his temples this is insane just insane poor ben i felt robin tense what happened then said jo after this bernardo went over to check the moaning he found long pause moreland began breathing rapidly dad said pam inhaling and letting the air out he said the moaning was ben lying there next to the foul scene bernardo ran to the nearest home woke the people up soon a crowd gathered among them skip amalfi who pinned ben down until dennis got there skip doesnt live nearby i said he was down on the docks fishing and heard the commotion apparently he now fancies himself the great white leader taking charge he twisted bens arm and sat on top of him ben was no danger to anyone he hadnt even regained consciousness why was he unconscious i pressed moreland studied his knees was he on drugs said jo morelands head snapped up no they claim he was drunk ben said pam hes as much a teetotaler as you dad yes he is has he always been i said moreland covered his eyes with a trembling hand touching his hair again he twisted white strands hes been completely sober for years how long ago did he have an alcohol problem i said very long ago in hawaii no no before that he went to college in hawaii he had problems as a kid his problem emerged when he was in high school teenage alcoholic said pam incredulous yes dear said her father with forced patience it happens he was vulnerable because of a difficult family situation both his parents were drinkers his father was an ugly drunk died of cirrhosis at fiftyfive lung cancer got his mother though her liver was highly necrotic as well stubborn woman i set her up with oxygen tanks in her home to ease the final months ben was sixteen but he became her fulltime nurse she used to yank off the mask scream at him to get her cigarettes poor genetics and environment pronounced jo moreland shot to his feet and staggered shaking off help from pam both of which he overcame dr picker after he was orphaned i put him up here exchanging work for room and board he started as a caretaker then i saw how bright he was and gave him more responsibility he read through my entire medical library brought his grades up stopped drinking completely sadness had replaced pams surprise jealousy of his devotion to ben or feeling left out because it was the first time shed heard the story completely sober repeated moreland incredible strength of character thats why i financed the rest of his education hes built a life for himself and claire and the children you saw him tonight was that the face of a psychopathic killer no one answered i tell you he said slapping the tabletop what theyre claiming is impossible the fact that it was a bottle of vodka near his hand proves it he drank only beer and i treated him with antabuse years ago the taste of alcohols made him ill ever since he despises it what are you saying said jo someone poured it down his throat the coolness in her voice seemed to throw him off balance i im saying he has no tolerance or desire for alcohol then thats the only alternative i can see she said someone forced him to drink but who would do that and why moreland gritted his teeth i dont know dr picker what i do know is bens nature how was betty killed i said she it was a stabbing was ben found with the weapon he wasnt holding it was it found at the scene it was embedded embedded echoed jo where in the poor girls throat is it necessary to know these things robin was squeezing my hand convulsively the whole thing is absurd said moreland they claim ben was right next to her sleeping with her his arms around her his head on her what was left of her abdomen that hed be able to sleep with her after something like that is absurd robin broke away and ran to the railing i followed her and covered her shoulders with my arms feeling her shivers as she stared up at the bright yellow moon back at the table jo was saying he mutilated her i dont want to continue this discussion dr picker the key is to help ben robin wheeled around what about betty what about helping her family yes yes of course thats she was pregnant what about her unborn child her husband her parents moreland looked away what about them bill morelands lips trembled of course they deserve sympathy dear i ache for them betty was my patient i delivered her for gods sake whooping cough i said whats that i spoke with her yesterday she told me you treated her for whooping cough when she was a kid she considered you a hero he slumped and sat back down dear god no one talked brandy got poured it burned a slow cleansing trail down my gullet the only sensation in an otherwise numb body everyone looked numb anyone know the time i said pam shot the sleeve of her kimono just after four rise and shine said jo softly i still dont see why were all locked up here for our own safety said moreland at least thats the theory whos out to get us no one ben is closely identified with this place i said so people may start talking moreland didnt answer jo frowned staying cooped up just makes us sitting targets youve got no security here anyone can walk right in ive never needed security dr picker do you keep any weapons around she said no if youre concerned with your safety i suggest you no problem said jo personally im fine its the only good thing that came out of losing ly when your worst fantasy comes true you find out you can handle things she got up and shuffled toward the living room tightening the belt of her robe big hips shifting like the pans of a balance scale when she was gone robin said shes got a gun a little pistol i saw it in an open drawer of her nightstand morelands mouth worked i despise firearms pam said hopefully she wont shoot someone by accident is there any way you can get some rest now dad youre going to be needing your strength ill be fine dear thank you for your ministrations but i believe ill stay up for a while he leaned over as if to kiss her but patted her shoulder instead hopefully when the sun comes up cooler heads will prevail there are some things id like to discuss with you i said he stared at me things we never got to last night yes certainly in the morning right after i call dennis im staying up too we can talk now he fidgeted with the neckband of his nightshirt of course what say we leave the terrace to the ladies and move to my office i squeezed robins hand and she squeezed back and sat next to pam who looked baffled but the two of them were already talking as moreland and i left whats so urgent he said flicking the lights on in the bungalow the newspaper clippings were gone from his desk so were all his other papers the wood surface gleamed we never talked about a tutalo surely you can see why that wouldnt be a priority at this time there are other things such as murder ben whats really going on with aruk he said nothing for a while then thats quite an agenda weve got nowhere to go very well he pointed crossly to the sofa and i sat expecting him to settle in a facing chair instead he went behind the desk lowered himself with a grimace opened a drawer and began searching you dont believe ben could have done this he said do you i dont know ben very well he gave a small tired smile psychologists answer very well i cant expect you to follow me blindly youll see hell be vindicated the notion of his butchering betty is beyond ridiculous all right trivial things first a tutalo you couldnt find an organism by that name because its not a germ its a fantasy a local myth the a stands for aruk aruk tutalo an imaginary tribe of creatures who live in the forest goes back years a myth no ones believed it for a long time except cristobal joseph hallucinated thats not belief you convinced him he hadnt seen anything pause he was a stubborn man have there been other sightings none since ive lived here as i said its a primitive idea creatures from the forest i said what do they look like pale soft hideous a shadow society living under the forest nothing unique to aruk all cultures develop fantasies of fanciful lustful creatures in order to project forbidden desires animal instincts the minotaurs centaurs and satyrs of ancient greece the japanese have a saucerheaded anthrocreature called the kappa who lurks by forest streams abducting children and pulling their intestines through their anuses witches rituals use animal masks to hide the faces of participants the devil himself is often thought of as the great beast with goat feet and a serpentine tail wooddemons anthrobat vampiric creatures werewolves the yeti bigfoot its all the same psychological defense what about the catwoman no no that was something totally different a response to trauma a response to cruelty worm people i said there are no mammals native to aruk one uses whats at hand tutalo is derived from an ancient island word of uncertain etymology tootali or woodgrub from what ive gathered theyre large humanoid with tentaclelike limbs slack bodied but strong and chalky white i find that particularly interesting perhaps a covert indictment of colonizers white creatures appearing on the island and establishing brutal control demonizing the oppressor precisely was joseph cristobal politically active on the contrary a simple man illiterate but fond of drink im sure that had something to do with it today your average villager would laugh at the notion of a tutalo he was your gardener did he sight the tutalo here he licked his lips and nodded he was working on the eastern walls tying vines working overtime everyone else had gone home it was well after dark fatigue was probably a factor as well where did he see the creature making its way through the banyans waving its arms then retreating he didnt tell anyone right away too scared he claimed but i suspect hed been drinking and didnt want to be thought of as a drunkard or oldfashioned so he suppressed the vision and began hallucinating at night it began as nightmares hed wake up screaming see the tutalo in his room could the original sighting have taken place as he slept i said could he have dozed off on the job and made up the vision to cover up i wondered about that but of course he denied it i also wondered if hed fallen off his ladder and hurt his head but there were no bruises or swellings anywhere on his body was he an alcoholic he wasnt a raving drunk but he did like his spirits could the visions have been alcohol poisoning its a possibility bill exactly how endemic is alcoholism on aruk he blinked and removed his glasses in the past it was a serious problem weve worked hard at education whos we ben and myself which is why whats happened tonight is madness alex you must help him what would you like me to do speak to dennis let him know ben couldnt have done it that he simply doesnt fit the profile of a psychopathic killer why would dennis listen to me i dont know that he would but we must try everything your training and experience will give you credibility dennis respects psychology majored in it in junior college what profile dont you think ben fits the fbis two forms of lustkiller hes neither the disorganized lowintellect spreemurderer nor the calculating sadistic psychopath the fbi had earned a lot of tv time with patterns of serial killers obtained from interviews with psychopaths careless enough to get caught but psychopaths lied for the fun of it and profiles rarely if ever led to the discovery of a killer occasionally confirming what police scut work and luck had already accomplished profiles had been responsible for some serious fallacies serial killers never murdered across race till they did women couldnt be serial killers till they were people werent computer chips people had the uncanny ability to surprise but even if id had more faith in the orderly nature of evil ben wouldnt have been easily acquitted right after lyman pickers death robin and i had discussed the hardness of his personality and i recalled the cold impersonal way hed jabbed needles into the arms of the schoolchildren family history of alcoholism rough childhood probably abuse from the ugly drunk father a certain rigidity tight control outwardly controlled men sometimes lost it when under the influence of booze or drugs a high percentage of serial killers committed their crimes buoyed by intoxication ill talk to him i said but i doubt itll do any good talk to ben too try to make some sense of this im shackled son if im to succeed with dennis i need to be impartial not bens advocate he blinked some more yes that makes sense dennis is rational and honest if he responds to anything itll be the rational approach rational and honest i said but you dont want him dating your daughter it had slipped out like loose change he recoiled sank heavily into the desk chair when he finally spoke it was in a low resigned voice so you despise me no bill but i cant say i understand you the longer i stay here the more inconsistent things seem he smiled feebly do they your love for the island and its people seems so strong yet you tonguelash pam for hanging around dennis not that its my business youve devoted your life to aruk and im just a visitor he folded his arms across his chest and rubbed the sweat from his forehead i know that this situation with ben is terrible for you i said but if im to stay here i need to know a few things looking away he said what else troubles you son the fact that aruks so cut off from the outside world that more of your energies havent been spent opening it up you say theres hope but you dont act hopeful i agree with you that tvs mostly garbage but how can the people ever develop when their access to information is so limited they cant even get mail on a regular basis its solitary confinement on a cultural level his hands started to shake again and spots of color made his cheeks shine forget it i said no no go on do you want to respond to what i just said the people have books theres a library in the church whens the last time new books came in he used a fingernail to scrape something off the desktop what do you suggest more frequent shipping schedules the leeward harbors too narrow for big craft but couldnt the supply boats sail more often and if the navy wont allow planes to land on stanton why not build an airfield on the west side if amalfi wont cooperate use some of your land and how is all this to be financed your personal finances are none of my business either but ive heard youre very wealthy who told you that creedman his laugh was shrill do you know what creedman really does for a living hes not a journalist hes worked for a few minor papers done some cable television work but for the last several years hes written quarterly reports for corporations his last client was stasherlayman have you heard of them no big construction outfit based in texas builders of government housing and other taxfinanced projects they put up tickytack boxes sell the management contract for high profits and walk away instant slum creedmans scribblings for them made them sound like saints if i hadnt thrown the reports out id show them to you you researched him after we caught him snooping i thought it prudent okay i said so hes a corporate hack is he wrong about your wealth he pulled on a long pale finger till it cracked righted his glasses brushed nonexistent dust from the desk i wont tell you im poor but family fortunes recede unless the heirs are talented in business im not which means im in no position to build airports or lease entire fleets of boats im doing all i can okay i said sorry for bringing it up then no apology necessary youre a passionate young man passionate but focused its rare when the two go hand in hand i may not hope from outward forms to win the passion and the life whose fountains are within coleridge said that another great thinker even narcotics didnt still his genius your passion even comes through your scientific writing son thats why i asked you to join me and here i thought it was my experience with police cases he sat back and let out another shrill laugh passionate and observant yes your experience with criminal behavior was a bonus because to me it means you have a strict sense of right and wrong i admire your sense of justice what does justice have to do with analyzing medical charts i was speaking in an abstract sense doing things ethically are you sure thats it what do you mean has the cannibal murder remained on your mind bill have you been more worried about recurrence than you let on because if thats it youre going to be disappointed ive gotten involved in a few bloody things mostly because of my friendship with milo sturgis but hes the detective not me he took time to answer staring at his wifes watercolors twisting his fingers as if they were knitting needles worrys too strong a word son lets just say the possibility of recurrence has remained in the back of my mind annemaries murder was my first real brush with this kind of thing so i read up on it and learned that recurrence is the norm not the exception when i learned you had some experience with murder in addition to your scholarly achievements i felt a great sense of appropriateness how similar is bettys murder to annemarie valdoss dennis claims there are similarities was betty cannibalized not he tapped the desk the flutter of wings outside a window made us both start nightbirds or bats not yet he said nothing was missing she was he shook his head decapitated and eviscerated but nothing had been taken what about the long bones one leg was broken hacked but not severed what kind of knife was used he didnt reply bill knives he said miserably a set of surgical tools were found there bens headshake yours an old set id once owned did you give it to ben no it was kept here in the lab in a drawer of this desk where ben had easy access he nodded almost crying but you must believe me ben would never take anything without permission never i know it sounds bad for him but please believe me annemarie had a drinking problem i said you implied betty did too did i back in the house you said she used to smoke and then you trailed off and said shed been taking excellent care of herself during her pregnancy the poor things dead why besmirch her memory because it may be relevant shes beyond hurt bill was she an alcoholic no not an alcoholic she was a friendly girl she smoked and drank a bit what does friendly have to do with it friendly he said to the sailors like annemarie one of those girls who went up to victory park was it common knowledge in the village i dont know whats common knowledge i heard it from her mother her mother complained about bettys promiscuity ida brought betty in to be treated for a venereal infection gonorrhea he nodded when a year ago before she became engaged we kept it confidential from mauricio her boyfriend tested him too under a false pretense negative eventually they married maybe he found out anyway and reacted this no not mauricio what was done to her was beyond no no impossible mauricios not a calculating sort hed never have thought to incriminate ben not smart enough hes simple as was betty i remembered bettys open manner and easy smile trusting me enough after meeting me to talk about herself no bra under the tank top simple and trusting i said a drinker overly friendly with the boys sounds like a perfect victim what was bens relationship with her they knew each other the way everyone on the island knows each other did ben know about her gonorrhea he thought i didnt discuss it with him but he could have found out read it in the chart ben was busy enough without sticking his nose where it didnt belong maybe he came across it by accident we both know youre not a compulsive filer no answer he got up and paced twisting his fingers again bobbing his neck i said learning that he could have assumed she was easy i didnt record the diagnosis in my notes i made sure to protect her what did you write just that she had an infection that required penicillin someone with bens medical sophistication could have figured it out bill and what about the lab tests did you destroy the results i dont believe so but still its not possible not ben why are you thinking in these terms because i have an open mind if that upsets you we can end the discussion he gritted his teeth this isnt the last time ill be hearing these kinds of speculations i might as well get used to it lets assume for the sake of argument that ben did know shed been infected why in the world would he murder her as i said it could have led him to believe she was easy one scenario is that theyd had a relationship for a while or even that last night was a onenight stand in either case they went up to the park got drunk and things got out of hand thats ridiculous you saw him with claire tonight he loves her theyve got so much going the children lots of psychopaths lead double lives no not ben and hes not a psychopath he didnt kill annemarie and he didnt kill betty does he have an alibi for annemaries murder he was never asked to present one but i remember the way he reacted to the murder utterly revolted did you tell him annemarie had been cannibalized no only dennis and i knew and now you but once again ben had access to the information and dennis knows annemaries murder file is here so even if ben does develop an alibi for the first murder dennis may suspect he read up on the case and pulled a copycat to disguise murdering betty hes not a premeditated killer this whole line of reasoning is spurious no one else knew about annemaries wounds the killer knew a killer who isnt ben what about the fishermen who found annemaries body alonzo rubino and saul saentz he said theyre even older than i sauls downright frail and they didnt know the details leaving only ben who might have you were at dinner tonight son was that the demeanor of a cannibal butcher do you mean to tell me he drove claire home tucked her in bed and left to commit murder he was in the park whats his explanation for that dennis hasnt interrogated him refuses to until theres an attorney present bens still free to offer an explanation has he he paused after dennis and i had words he was less than forthcoming when will ben have an attorney dennis has wired to saipan for a courtappointed lawyer there are no lawyers on the island no until now thats been a plus how long will it take for the appointee to get over the next boats due in five days if the base allows a plane to land it could be sooner why would the base cooperate all of a sudden because this is just what they want another nail in aruks coffin he made a fist and regarded it as if it belonged on someone elses arm the fingers opened slowly the bandage on his hand was soiled why is the navy waging war on the island bill the navys a branch of the government and the government wants to rid itself of responsibility bens arrest is yet another reason to abandon ship murderous savages cannibals no less and if the fiend who murdered annemarie was a navy man hes now off the hook so ewings got a vested interest in having ben prosecuted i thought you believed the killer had moved on perhaps he left and returned corpsmen fly in and out all the time a look at navy flight records would be instructive but try obtaining them theres more than one kind of barricade alex you said dennis never discovered any similar murders during the interim thats true as far as it goes but some of the places in the region ive heard theres a restaurant in bangkok that serves human flesh perhaps apocryphal perhaps not but theres no doubt things go on we never hear about he rubbed his head aruk has been abandoned but i wont abandon ben does senator hoffman also have a vested interest in aruks decline i said most probably strip away the veneer of political correctness and youve got a stripmall builder in cahoots with someone like creedmans employer stasherlayman the thought has occurred to me creedmans an advance man ive thought about that too at dinner creedman and hoffman acted as if they didnt know each other but during the discussion of colonialism creedman rushed to defend hoffmans point of view the fool he looked ready to spit that book of his no ones ever seen it and he wont be pinned down on details why else would hoffman invite him to that abysmal dinner nicholas does nothing without a reason have you found any connection between hoffman and stasherlayman not yet but we mustnt get distracted we must focus on ben when ben caught creedman snooping what was creedman after i have no idea theres nothing to hide what about the annemarie valdos file and not necessarily for nefarious reasons creedmans the one who told me about the murder said you did the autopsy had the details he sounded regretful maybe he smelled a good story no as much as id like to attribute something malicious to him he was snooping before annemaries murder now lets one more thing after you came back from speaking to hoffman alone you looked dejected why he refused to help aruk is that the only reason thats not enough i just wondered if there was some personal issue between the two of you he sat straighter stood and smiled oh there is we dislike each other immensely but thats ancient history and i simply cant allow myself to be drawn into nostalgia i acted stupidly with dennis and now im persona non grata but he may allow you to speak to ben please call the police station tomorrow and ask his permission if he grants it use your professional skills to offer ben psychological support hes living a nightmare he came around and rested a hand on my shoulder please alex we hadnt gotten into his lie about being part of the marshall islands compensation the nighttime boat rides and hed avoided explaining his reaction to pam and denniss friendship but the look in his eyes told me id taken things as far as i could tonight maybe thered be another opportunity or maybe id be off aruk before it mattered all right i said but lets get something straight ill give ben the benefit of the doubt till the forensics come in unless i get into that cell and he tells me he murdered betty or annemarie that happens ill march straight into denniss office and swear out a statement he walked away from me and faced the wall one of the watercolors was at eye level palms over the beach not unlike the one where barbara moreland had drowned delicate strokes washedout hues no people a loneliness so intense i accept your conditions he said im glad to have you on my side as we left for the house he noticed a fatpetaled white flower and started to describe its pollination oh shut up he told himself abruptly and we continued in silence inside he gripped my hand thank you for your help i watched him walk away quickly energized a man who studied predation where had he come from the night id seen him with his doctors bag what had he been doing in the dark lab id phone the police station in the morning but my first two calls would be to the airport at saipan and the company that chartered the supply boats upstairs spikes bark greeted me as i entered our suite robin wasnt back yet from talking with pam fourfifty am someone else i might be able to reach the connection broke a few times before i finally got an international line wondering if anyone could listen in and deciding i didnt care i told the desk officer at the west la station that i had urgent business with detective sturgis he said yeah i think hes here a minute or so later milo barked his own name stanley its livingstone hey he said buena afternuna its got to be what five in the morning over there just about whats up a bit of trouble another cannibal as a matter of fact shit i was kidding what the hells going on i told him about bettys murder and everything else that had been on my mind jesus he said after you told me about the first one i got curious so i played with the computers thankfully cannibalism hasnt caught on bigtime other than that milwaukee moron only thing i came up with was a tenyearold case place called wiggsburg maryland didnt sound that different from yours neck slash organ theft legs cracked for the marrow but they caught the bad guys pair of eighteenyearolds who decided lucifer was their main man had ordered them to carve up and dine on a local topless dancer where are they now jail i assume they were sentenced to life why there are two guys here who would have been around eighteen back then they like to cut things up and theyve been eyeing robin but theyre not suspects in the killing no ben does look good for it but do you have the maryland killers names and descriptions just to be thorough got the fax right here wayne lee burke keith william bonham both caucs brown and brown burke was six three one seventy bonham five five one fiftytwo appendectomy i dont need any more it doesnt match no big surprise things have gotten nuts but i dont see lads who suck out a young ladys bone marrow qualifying for early parole how far is wiggsburg from washington dc about an hours drive why theres another guy here dc background also creepy i filled him in on creedman sounds like a prince he said yeah ive heard of stasherlayman cause they built public housing projects years ago in south central while i was riding a car at seventyseventh division bad plumbing gang members hired to handle security immediate problems they sold the management contract then bailed had a deal to build a new jail too out in antelope valley till the locals found out about their record protested and got it kiboshed so what are they planning to build over there i dont know not that it has anything to do with cannibals so whats dr frankensteins reaction to his protégés predilection for intraspecies feasting total denial ben was his project rehabilitating a kid with a rotten background be interesting to know if that background includes any serious criminal activity moreland didnt mention if youve a mind to go back to the computer sure give me the particulars benjamin romero i dont know if theres a middle name hes thirty or so born here went to school in hawaii and did coast guard duty there trained as a registered nurse ill have a go at it hows robin handling all this shes a trooper but i want out the next boats are due in around five days if chief laurent allows us off the island well be on one of them why shouldnt he let you off public opinion of moreland and everything associated with him isnt too high right now were all under informal house arrest damned inconsiderate not to say illegal want me to have a little coptocop chat with him from what i saw tonight that might make things worse moreland tried to influence him and he hardened his stance maybe thats cause hes pissed at morelandnot with my daughter you dont maybe but ill try to handle it myself first if i have problems believe me youll hear about it okay bugs and cannibals sounds almost as bad as hollywood boulevard feeling rancid i showered robin returned as i was toweling off and i summarized my talks with moreland and milo and told her i wanted to book us on the next boat out she said its too bad it had to end this way but absolutely she sat down on the bed what was that construction company stasherlayman i think jo had something with their name on it in her room stack of computer printout i assumed it was something to do with her research the only reason it sticks in my mind is that when she saw me looking at it she slid a book over it how sure are you it was stasherlayman very big gothic initialssl then the name i read it just before she covered it an artists eye jo and creedman i said two people with dc connections two advance agents ive had a weird feeling about her since the roaches i didnt tell you because i thought i was just being paranoid but i couldnt stop thinking that she was alone in the house that night and the time lag between hearing your scream and coming in seemed odd she excused it as drowsiness due to sleeping pills but tonight she was out there before us lucid as hell motive stumped me but if shes doing dirty work for stasherlayman and wants to get rid of distractions that would serve nicely but then why not hide her gun alex she kept it right out there almost as if she wanted me to know she had it maybe she did trying to intimidate you it didnt seem that way there was absolutely no hostility between us in fact the more time i spent with her the friendlier she got as if i was helping her cope and cope she had tranquilized widow to sharpeyed interrogator in two days i said she sure had an interest in the murder did you notice the way she was quizzing moreland that would also make sense if shes got an interest in aruks decline but if this company builds things why would they want aruk to decline moreland said they build government projects milos memory backs that up lowincome housing prisons maybe they want the land cheap lowincome housing doesnt make sense she said if the people are all leaving but a prison might yes it might i said no locals to protest and what better place to dump felons than a remote island with no natural resources it would be politically beautiful which is where hoffman may fit in what if stasherlayman paid him under the table to find a site and he chose aruk because he remembered it from his days as base commander knew there wasnt much of a constituency if he embedded the prison or whatever it is in an extensive pacific rim revitalization cash infusion for the bigger islands whod notice or mind other than bill but right now bills in a position to cause troubles for the deal because he owns so much of the island which could be the real reason hoffman stopped over making a final offer that bill refused so hoffman pressured him maybe threatened him with something threatened him with what i dont know but remember my feeling they had some issue between them that went way back the first night i met bill he said something about guilt being a great motivator he could have done something years ago that he wants to forget something hes been trying to atone for all these years by being the good doctor she touched my arm alex if he is holding up a giant deal he could be in serious danger do you think hes aware of what hes up against i dont know what hes aware of and what he chooses to deny the mans an enigma and hes stubborn what about pam as his heir she could also be in a treacherous position if shes his heir why wouldnt she be because she has no roots in aruk and bill seems to view the island as his real child hes excluded pam from scientific discussion and just about everything else you saw her surprise when he discussed bens family history shes an outsider so it wouldnt surprise me if he bequeathed his holdings to someone else someone with a strong commitment to aruk she stared at me ben in some ways hes bills functional son and being accused of murder gets him out of the way sure but nothing ive heard indicates hes not a murderer in fact everything bill told me just added to the picture of guilt access to the weapon bettys medical records and annemaries autopsy file and remember our discussion about his being a hard guy no sympathy for pickers crash the way he vaccinated those children mechanically add alcoholism and a rotten childhood and youve got a pretty good textbook history of a psychopath maybe even his outward devotion to bill and the island is calculated maybe hes just after bills money maybe yes he is dispassionate but tonight at dinner you really think he could have been so lighthearted while planning to murder someone in a few hours planning to mutilate someone if hes a severe psychopath hes got an extremely low level of anxiety for all we know sitting here listening to claire play was part of the thrill are you saying he killed both girls or just betty it could go either way annemarie could have been murdered by a sailor and ben decided to do a copycat as a cover but why he and betty could have been having an affair maybe the baby was his he wanted out permanently when i talked to her she seemed thrilled about the pregnancy but who knows if he was so calculating alex howd he get caught so stupidly screwing ups another psychopathic trait look at bundy escaping from washington where theres no death penalty and murdering in florida where there is psychopaths walk a narrow line all screwed up inside constantly putting on a show a psychiatrist named cleckley labeled it perfectly the mask of sanity eventually the mask falls off and shatters ben used booze to get rid of his she shuddered its still hard to make sense of i can see using alcohol to lower his inhibitions but why stick around and get drunk after killing betty its possible he drank a little before meeting betty to take the edge off had some more with betty killed her before the total effect set in then boom bill said hed always drunk beer vodka could have been too much to handle i guess so she said rubbing her eyes but he always seemed decent i suppose i sound like one of those people who get interviewed on the news he was such a quiet guy well at least the part about whose baby betty was carrying can be tested whos doing the medical investigation dennis is bringing a lawyer over from saipan i assume hell call for a pathologist too she leaned against me heavily what a horror hows pam taking it at first she talked mostly about bill worried about him wanting to help but feeling he pushes her away he does shes not ready to give up she thinks she owes him for what coming through for her during the divorce she also talked more about herself said shed had problems with men before her marriage attracted to losers guys who got rough with her psychologically and physically after the divorce she was so low she was having suicidal thoughts her therapist wanted to establish a support system found out bill was her only relative and called him to pams surprise he flew out to philadelphia stayed with her took care of her even apologized for sending her away said losing her mother had been too much to handle hed been overwhelmed it had been a big mistake that he knew he could never make up for but would she like to come back and give him another chance but now that shes here she looked at the clock its almost daybreak tell you one thing ive learned from all this i could never be a therapist most therapy cases arent like this i know but its still not for me i admire you its a nasty job but someones got to do it im serious honey thank you i admire you too and despite all thats happened i have no regrets me neither she ran her fingers through my hair in a few days when were back in la im going to remember being with you everything else good about this place frame it in my mind like a picture psychic sculpting i doubted i had the talent by ten am the reservations were booked back to saipan in five days lax in a week id try to find a good time to tell moreland if i didnt find one id tell him anyway i phoned the aruk police station a man with a sibilant voice told me the chief was busy when will he be free whos this dr delaware im staying at knife castle yeah i know ill give him your message robin was still sleeping and i went down to breakfast jo was there by herself eating heartily morning she said get any sleep not much its something isnt it you come to an outoftheway place think youre escaping bigcity crime and it runs after you like a mad dog i buttered a piece of toast true life can be a prison sometimes outoftheway places make the best prisons she wiped her lips i suppose thats one way of looking at it sure i said the isolation and poverty for all we know there are all kinds of behavioral aberrations rampant is that what youre looking for in your research i havent gotten far enough to develop hypotheses looks like i wont were booked on the next boat out that so she placed a dollop of marmalade on a scone the sun was behind her crowning her with a rainbow aura how long are you planning to stay till i finish wind research i said what exactly are you looking at currents patterns ever hear of the bikini atoll disaster atomic blast over in the marshall islands shifting winds showered the region with radioactive dust ive heard of it but i study weather from a theoretical standpoint she nibbled the scone and gazed at the sky there are wet winds coming as a matter of fact lots of rain look i followed her finger the clouds had moved inland and i could see black patches behind the white fluff when will the rain get here next few days it could delay your getting out the boats wont sail if the winds are strong are we talking winds or a storm hard to say the house probably wont fly away thats comforting it could be just rain very little air movement if the winds kick up stay inside youll be fine the charter company didnt mention anything about delays they never do they just cancel without warning great its a different way of life she said people dont feel bound by the rules sounds like washington she put the scone down and smiled but held on to her butter knife washington has its own set of rules ill bet how long have you been working for the government since i got out of grad school her eyes returned to the clouds as they get lower they pick up moisture then they turn jetblack and burst all at once its something to see youve been to the region before she examined the cutting edge of the knife no but ive been other places with comparable patterns another glance upward it could come down in sheets only problemll be if the cisterns fill too high for the filters to handle and the germ count rises i thought bill had the water situation under control not without access to the town he doesnt but you heard laurent hes stuck here all of us are guilt by association at least youve got your gun she raised her eyebrows put the knife down and laughed pointing her finger at the coffeepot she pulled an imaginary trigger crack shot i said it was lys howd he get it through baggage control he didnt bought it in guam he always traveled armed exploring dangerous places filling her juice glass she drank and looked at me over the rim as you said its impossible to escape crime actually you said that i said life could be a prison ah i stand corrected she put the glass down snatched up the scone bit off half and chewed vigorously its incredible being that close to a psychopathic killer ben seemed okay maybe a little too pukka sahib with bill but nothing scary she shook her head you never know whats inside someones head or maybe you do wish i did i said dipping her hand into the pastry basket she scooped up croissants muffins and rolls and then broke off a cluster of grapes working lunch she said standing good talking to you sorry you didnt have time to solve the mysteries of the island psyche she headed for the door to the house when she got there i said speaking of prisons this place would make an especially good one dont you think us territory so thered be no diplomatic problems remote with no significant population to displace and the oceans a perfect security barrier her mouth got small like devils island interesting idea and politically expedient ship the bad guys halfway around the world and forget about them with the crime situation back home i bet it would play great in peoria crumbs trickled from her hand dusting the stone floor squeezing the pastries are you thinking of going into the prison business no just thinking out loud oh she said well you could take it one step further when you get back home write your congressman yet another folded card on my desk o let not time deceive you you cannot conquer time in the burrows of the nightmare where justice naked is time watches from the shadow wh auden below that a dont you think einstein would agree b what was he getting at now the ultimate power of time deceitful time einstein times relativity the nightmare death impending mortality an old man losing hope making a typically oblique cry for help if so i was in no mood to oblige i read a few more charts but couldnt concentrate returning to the house i encountered gladys coming out the front door im glad i caught you doctor dennis chief laurents on the phone i picked it up in the front room dr delaware dead air then a click and background voices the loudest was dennis giving orders i said im here chief oh yeah my man said you had something to tell me i was wondering if i could come into town to talk to ben pause why moral support dr moreland asked me i know its a tall order no kidding okay i asked you dont want to do it i dont particularly want to mix in i said any idea when the rest of us will be allowed off the estate soon as things quiet down robin and i have reservations out in five days any problems with that no promises no ones allowed off the island till we settle this does that include the sailors on the base he was silent the noise in the background hadnt subsided actually he said maybe you should come down to talk to him hes acting nuts and i dont want to be accused of not providing proper care create any technicalities im not an md what are you phd psychologist close enough check him over pams an md shes no head doctor what now that i want you youre not interested are you concerned about a suicide attempt another pause lets just say i dont like to see prisoners behave like this whats he doing nothing thats the point not moving or talking or eating even with his wife there he wouldnt acknowledge her i guess youd call it catatonic are his limbs waxy you mean soft if you position him does he stay that way havent tried to move him we dont want anyone claiming brutality we just slide his food tray in and make sure hes got enough toilet paper im bending over to protect his rights until his lawyer shows up whens that if guam can free up a public defender and stanton lets him fly in hopefully in a couple of days hold on he barked more orders and returned to the line listen you coming or not if so ill send someone to pick you up and drive you back if not thats fine too pick me up i said when soon as i can get someone over thanks see you then dont thank me he said im not doing it for your sake or his he came himself an hour later emotions hidden behind mirrored shades a shotgun clamped to the dash of the little police car as i walked out he looked up at the gargoyle roof tiles and frowned as if in imitation i got in the car and he took off speeding around the fountain and through the open gate downshifting angrily and taking bumps hard his head nearly touched the roof and he looked uncomfortable when we were out of sight of the estate he said ill give you an hour which is probably more than you need cause hes still playing statue think hes faking youre the expert he grabbed the gearshift as we went around a sharp curve his forearms were thick and brown corded and veined and hairless white crust flecked the corner of his mouth he told me you two grew up together bitter smile he was a couple of years older but we hung out he was always small i used to protect him against who kids making fun his family was trash he was too didnt comb his hair didnt like to bathe later he changed so much you couldnt believe it he whipped his head toward the window spat returned his eyes to the road after he moved in with moreland yeah all of a sudden he got superstraight studied all the time preppy mailorder clothes and dr bill bought him a catamaran we used to go out sailing id have a beer he never touched it all that due to morelands influence probably the military too we did that at the same time also i was an mp in the marines he was coast guard then he got married kids all that good stuff probably decided it was a good idea to keep the straight life going the next sentence came out a snarl i liked the bastard hard to reconcile that with what he did he glanced at me and picked up speed whatre you trying to do put me on the couch dr bill tell you to do that no sometimes i lapse into shoptalk he shook his head and put on more speed turning the final dip to the harbor into a rollercoaster swoop the water enlarged as if at the hands of some celestial projectionist blue mottled platinum where the clouds hovered laurent shoved the shift lever hard yanked it back into neutral gunned the engine stopped so short i had to brace myself against the dash my fingers landed inches from the shotgun and i saw his head swivel sharply i put my hands in my lap and he chewed his cheek and stared out the windshield more people than usual on the waterfront mostly men milling around the docks and congregating in front of the trading post which was closed the only open establishment in fact was slims bar where a few more drinkers than usual loitered smoked and swigged from longnecks i picked out skip amalfis fair hair among the sea of black then his father hovering nervously at the back of the crowd skip was animated talking and gesturing and brushing hair out of his face some of the villagers nodded and gesticulated with their arms slicing the air choppily pointing up front street toward the road that led up to victory park laurent put the car into gear and rolled down so fast i couldnt focus on anyones face ignoring the stop sign on front street he made a sharp right and raced toward the municipal center the parking spaces facing the whitewashed building were all taken nosing behind a crumbling toyota he jerked the key out of the ignition freed the shotgun and got out carrying the weapon against his thigh his size made it look like a toy slamming the car door he marched toward the center onlookers moved aside and i rode his wake managing to get inside before the remarks to my back took form the front room was tiny dingy and hot filled with the saltyfatty smell of canned soup nicked walls were covered with wanted posters interpol communiqués lists of the latest federal regulations two desks messy with phones tilting on mounds of yet more paper one held a hotplate the only spot of color was a tool company calendar over one of the workstations starring a longtorsoed pneumatic brunette in a red spandex bikini that could have been used for a handkerchief a middleaged deputy sat under sleek tan thighs writing and moving a toothpick around in his mouth skinny he had a jutting stubbled chin and a sunken lipless mouth lots of missing teeth his hair was limp and graying fringing unevenly over his collar his uniform needed pressing but his engraved metal nameplate was shiny ruiz ed said dennis this is dr delaware the psychologist from the castle ed pushed away from his desk and the legs of the folding chair groaned against the linoleum floor the skin under his eyes was smudged a pile of plasticwrapped toothpicks was at his left hand he lowered his head to the wastebasket and blew out the pick in his mouth selected a new one tore the plastic rested the splinter on a ridge of bare gum and laced his hands behind his head anything said dennis uhuh ed manipulated the pick with his tongue and watched me no action from the jokers at slims nah just big talk the sibilant voice he touched the revolver in his belt with his left hand i thought of something and filed it away why dont you take a walk up and down front check things out ed shrugged and rose to a slumping five four pocketing more toothpicks he ambled out the door dennis said you can sit in his chair i took my place under miss redilathe and he settled half a buttock atop the other desk and folded his arms across his chest ed may not look like much to you but hes reliable exmarine in vietnam he won enough medals to start a jewelry store southpaw too he took off the mirrored glasses his light eyes were clear and hard as bottle glass so it reminded me that bens lefthanded i know because i saw him vaccinating the kids at the school i read annemarie valdoss file moreland said the killer was probably righthanded to me probably means not for sure i didnt answer laurents arms tightened and his biceps jumped morelands no forensic pathologist he was good enough for the valdos case he chewed his cheek again and shot me a closemouthed smile are you his rentasherlock supposed to raise doubts about my investigation the only thing he asked me to do was give ben moral support if my being heres a problem take me back and ill catch up on my sunbathing another bicep flex then the smile widened flashing white look at that i pissed you off thought shrinks didnt lose their tempers i came to aruk to do some interesting work and get away from city life since i got here its been nothing but weirdness and now youre treating me like some kind of sleazeball im not morelands surrogate and i dont enjoy being placed under house arrest when those boats pull up i plan to be on one i stood he said take it easy sit down ill make coffee switching on the hotplate he pulled packets of instant and creamer and styrofoam cups out of his desk it aint beverly hills café au lait that okay depends on what kind of conversation goes with it grinning he went through a battered rear door i heard water run and he returned with a metal coffeepot that he placed on the hotplate you want to stand suit yourself i waited until the pot bubbled before sitting black or cream black tough guy deep chuckle no offense just trying to take the tension off sorry if i rubbed you wrong before lets just get through this he fixed two cups handed me one terrible but the bitterness was what i needed i know damn well bens a lefty he said but all moreland said in annemaries case was that the killer was righthanded if she was grabbed from behind and done like this tilting his head back he exposed his adams apple and ran a hand along his throat if she was cut from the front it could have been a lefty he shifted his weight yeah i know what youre thinking we dropped it before it was finished but its not like some big city tons of money to follow every lead hey i said bigcity cops dont always follow through i watched thugs burn la down while the police sat around waiting for instructions from braindead superiors you dont like cops my best friend is one seriously he stirred creamer into his cup and sipped with surprising delicacy ive got a pathologist flying in looking at annemaries file as well as bettys i dont know if shell be able to make any determination about how betty got cut because her head was taken clean off maybe though im no expert shifting again he got up and sat behind the other desk propping his feet up does your gut tell you bens guilty i said my gut what the hells that worth my friends a homicide detective his hunches have led him to some good places well he said good for him im just one third of a dinkyshit threeman police force on a dinkyshit island eds my main backup and my other deputys older than him you probably never needed more till now i didnt do i think bens guilty it sure as hell looks like it and hes not bothering to deny it only one who thinks otherwise is dr bill with his usual he shook his head his usual singlemindedness i said he forced a smile my word was fanaticism dont get me wrong i think he probably could have won a nobel prize for something if hed put his mind to it hes helped my mother and me plenty giving her a free lease on the restaurant till things get better paying for my schooling i felt like a shithead mouthing off to him last night but youve got to understand hes like a moray eel gets hold of something and wont let go what the hell does he want me to do let ben walk on his sayso and watch the whole damn island explode is the island near exploding hotter than ive ever seen it a lot worse than when annemarie got killed and we had grumblings then the march up south road no march just a few kids shouting and waving sticks but look where it led now some people think they were fooled into believing a sailor did annemarie and theyre doubly pissed fooled by ben and dr bill cause bens seen as dr bills boy and even though people admire dr bill theyre also nervous about him you hear stories about what mad scientist shit growing all this fruit and vegetables bringing some into town but rumor is he hoards it is that true who the hell knows guys who work the estate say he fools around with dehydration nutritional research but who cares whats to stop anyone from growing their own stuff my mother does dr bill set her up years ago with soil and seeds and she grows her own chinese vegetables for the restaurant but people get dependent they like to piss and moan doesnt take much to get their tongues flapping annemarie was a newcomer no roots here but everyone liked betty including the sailors he turned toward me very slowly meaning moreland said shed socialized with them as had annemarie socialized yeah betty liked to party before she got engaged but for your own safety i wouldnt repeat that any chance betty and ben had an affair not that i heard but who knows but whatever betty did she was a nice kid didnt deserve to be ripped up like that i know i spoke to her the morning before she died he put his cup down where at the trading post i bought drinks and magazines she told me about her baby he arced his feet off the desk and they hit the floor hard yeah her mom said she loved the idea of having a baby real pain clouded his eyes anyone whod do that should have his nuts cut off and stuffed down his throat the phone rang he grabbed it yeah no not yet no not before his lawyer i dont know he slammed the phone down that was mr creedman wants to do a story for the wire services opportunity knocks i said meaning hes a writer now hes got a story what do you think of him not much me neither first day he got here he hit on my mother she straightened him out soon enough he trained his eyes on me he was a handsome man but i thought of a rhino ready to charge so tell me doc is ben one of those guys when you hear about his killing someone you say no way couldnt be i dont know him well enough to answer that he laughed got my answer not that ive got any grudge against him ive always admired him for the way he pulled himself up i grew up without a father but my mothers good enough for ten parents bens mom was a dirty drunk and his dad was a real asshole beat the hell out of him just for laughs according to you guys isnt that exactly the kind of thing that grows killers it helps i said but there are plenty of abused kids who dont end up violent and people from good homes who turn bad sure he said anythings possible but were talking odds i took psychology learned about early influences someone like ben i guess its no surprise he cracked i guess the big surprise is the time he had in between acting normal in between what instead of answering he finished his coffee id barely touched mine and he noticed yeah its lousy want some tea instead no thanks the situations really bad he said into his empty cup bettys family mauricio claire her kids everyone thrown together people cant escape each other the phone rang again he got rid of the caller with a couple of barks everyone wants to know everything he looked above me at the bikini girl i should take that down ed and elijah like it but its disrespectful he got up and came toward me ive seen plenty doctor but never anything like what happened to those two women one thing you might want to know i said after i read the valdos file i called my detective friend he ran a search for similar murders and came up with one ten years old in maryland whyd you ask him to look i didnt he did it on his own why hes a curious guy checking out the island savages huh yeah i know about that one two satanists ate a working girl he shot out some details my computer rarely works right but i phone stuff in to the mps on guam and they hook into ncic what do you think of the similarities i think satanic psychos have some sort of script any evidence ben was into satanism nope have you ever seen evidence of satanism on aruk not a trace everyones catholic but ben was in hawaii ten years ago who knows what kind of shit he picked up did he take any side trips to the mainland like to maryland good question ill look into it for all i know he killed girls in hawaii and never got caught for all i know he was lucky the only thing they got him for was indecent exposure the look on my face made him smile thats what i meant by acting normal in between when i said ten years ago he peeped in some ladys window with his pants down and his dick out he was in the guard and they handled it ninety days in the brig thats how a lot of sex killers get started isnt it watching and beating off then moving on to the heavy stuff sometimes this time he looked disgusted okay have your hour with him give him his moral support behind the battered door was a warren of small dim rooms and narrow corridors at the back was a dented sheetmetal door bolted by a stout iron bar laurent removed my watch and emptied my pockets placed my belongings on a table along with his gun then unlocked the bar raised it and pocketed the key pushing the door open he let me pass and i came up against grimy gray bars and the sulfurstink of excreta a twocell jail a pair of threepace cages each with a cement floor a grated translucent window a double bunk chained to the wall a crusted hole with heelrests for a toilet the ceilings were six and a half feet high black mold grew in cracks and corners the plaster had been scored by decades of fingernail calligraphy laurent saw the revulsion on my face welcome to istanbul west he said with no satisfaction usually guys dont stay here for more than a few hours sleeping off a drunk the nearer cell was empty ben sat on the lower bunk of the other chin in hand well well looks like weve had some movement said laurent loudly ben didnt budge the keys jangled again and soon i was in the cell locked in and laurent was outside saying trust me with your wallet and your watch doc i smiled do i have a choice thanks for the vote of confidence one hour tapping his own watch ill leave the door open so you can shout he left inside the cell the stink was stronger the heat almost unbearable i tried to find a place to stand that allowed me some distance from ben but the cramped space prevented it so i contented myself with keeping maximum distance from the floor latrine as i scanned the graffiti names dates none of them recent a large depiction of exaggerated female genitalia above the bunk sgraffito message get me out of this hole ben didnt move his eyes were unfocused hello i said softly though my fiveten height missed the ceiling by a few inches i found myself hunching silence as complete as at the estate but not at all peaceful after only seconds in here my nerves screamed for some noise dr bill sent me to see if theres anything i can do for you ben he kept perfectly still not even a blink hair greasy face streaked with sweat tracks my armpits were already sodden ben i took hold of his right arm and moved it from under his chin stiff and unyielding as he resisted me no catatonia i let go repeated my greeting he continued to tune me out three more attempts five minutes passed okay i said youre a political prisoner giving the world the silent treatment as a protest against injustice still no response i waited some more his cheeks were sunken almost as hollow as morelands and his eyes looked remote no eyeglasses theyd been taken from him along with his shoelaces and belt and watch and anything else hardedged an angry boil had broken out on the back of his neck i kept staring at him hoping my scrutiny would cause him to react his nails were gnawed almost to the quick one thumb bloody had he always been a biter id never noticed or had betty aguilar resisted and snapped off some keratin a clue hed tried to conceal by chewing his other fingers i looked for nail bits on the floor nothing but inlaid dirt and scuffmarks but they could have been tossed down the toilet hole big black ants singlefiled under the bunk after morelands zoo they were laughable no scratches on his face and hands his color was bad but he was unmarked how well do you see without your glasses silence slow count to one thousand this isnt exactly the behavior of an innocent man ben nothing what about your family i said claire and the kids no response i know this has been a nightmare for you but youre not helping yourself nothing youre being a fool i said loud as i could without attracting denniss attention pigheaded like moreland but sometimes it pays to think independently involuntary flinch then back to stoneface sins of the father i went on people are already making that connection his lower lip twitched guilt by association i went on thats why i had to come down here morelands confined to the estate because dennis is afraid of what people might do to him were all confined its gotten ugly silence people are angry ben its only a matter of time before they start wondering about his being dr frankenstein what he does in that lab if maybe annemarie and betty were his idea as well as yours the lip dropped then snapped shut i gave him a few more minutes then came closer and spoke to his left ear if youre really as loyal as you make out tell me what happened if you butchered betty on your own just admit it and let them know moreland had nothing to do with it if you have another story tell it too youre not helping yourself or anyone else this way nothing unless moreland did have something to do with it i said no movement maybe he did all those latenight walks god knows what he was up to i saw him one night two am carrying his doctors bag treating who and those surgical tools were his another flinch stronger flick of his head what i said he clamped his mouth shut he studies predators maybe his interest isnt limited to bugs he blinked hard and fast exactly the way moreland did when he was nervous is he in on it with you ben did he teach you aruks own dr mengele half a headshake turned into a full one okay i said so why clam up like this back to immobility you want me to believe you did do it alone okay ill buy it for the moment no surprise i guess given your family history silence your criminal history too i added some sex killers start off as peepers some of them search for new ways to deal with their impotence annemarie wasnt penetrated sexually and i bet betty wasnt either more blinking as if to make up for lost time dennis told me about the hawaii arrest soon everyone will know about it including claire and the kids and dr bill if he doesnt already he let out hot sour breath i forced myself to remain close what else were you up to back then ever travel to the mainland when you were in the guard see the sights maybe washington dc blank look peeping tom i said vivaldi on the terrace doesnt cancel it out whatever else you did over there will come out too once they really start checking no reaction the reason i mentioned dc is its not far from a place called wiggsburg maryland his eyes angled downward puzzled distressed then they were staring straight ahead again as unmoving as when id entered i was coated with sweat had become accustomed to the sulfur stench the funny thing is ben its still hard for me to think of you that way despite the evidence do you actually like to eat people odd for someone raised by a vegetarian unless thats the point he began breathing hard and fast is it your way of slapping moreland in the face he inhaled deeply held his breath his hands began curling and tightening the knuckles almost glassy i stepped back but kept talking the brain the liver the bone marrow how does something like that start when did it start he struggled to stay calm moreland taught you a lot about medicine did it include dissection his chest swelled and his skin turned as gray as the cell floor then he stopped stilling his eyes composing himself another slow count to two thousand i stood there watching him he pressed one hand against his breastbone his eyes suddenly clear not with insight washed by tears he began shaking flung his arms wide as if welcoming crucifixion staring at me i moved back further my spine at the wall had i pushed it too far his arms fell turning away he whispered sorry for what ben long silence getting into this getting into this slomo nod stupid he said barely audible what was getting into this killing betty no he said with sudden strength he bent so low his brow touched his knees the back of his neck was exposed as if for the executioners ax the boil seemed to stare at me a fiery cyclops eye you didnt kill her he shook his head and mumbled whats that ben but but what silence but what silence but what ben no one will believe me why you dont all i know are the facts that dennis gave me unless you tell me different why should i believe otherwise dennis doesnt why should he he looked up still bowed face angled awkwardly he knows me then if youve got an alibi give it to him he straightened and returned his eyes to the wall shaking his head what is it i said no alibi then whats your story more headshaking then silence whats your last memory before they found you with betty no answer when did you start drinking last night i didnt but you were drunk when they found you they say you didnt drink but you were drunk i dont drink since when a long time since you cleaned up in high school hesitation nod were you drunk in hawaii the peeping tom bust he started to cry again growled and stiffened and managed to hold it in check what happened in hawaii ben nothing it was a big mistake you werent peeping suddenly he laughed so heartily it caused him to rock rattling the bunk taking hold of his cheeks he tugged down and created a sadclown face horribly at odds with the laughter big mistake big big big mistake after that he stopped talking fluctuating between long bouts of silence and incongruous laughter some kind of breakdown or faking it i just dont understand it ben you claim you didnt kill betty but you seem awfully comfortable being a suspect maybe it is something to do with moreland im going back to the estate to talk to him i moved toward the cell door you wouldnt understand he said try me he shook his head whats so damned profound that you cant part with it i said the fact that you grew up low status and now youre being thought of as the scum of the earth again sure its a cruel irony but what happened to those girls was a hell of a lot crueler so forgive me if i dont shed tears i shaking his head again everything comes round ben big insight im a psychologist ive heard it before you youre wasting your time dr bill is best to cut me loose why i dont stand a chance because of who i am what you just said scum family scum child before dr bill took me in they wanted to send me to reform school i used to do bad things bad things thats why this makes sense to everyone dennis knows me and he thinks i did it when they brought me in their faces everyones he looked back at the wall put a finger to his mouth and tried to get a purchase on what remained of the cuticle what about their faces i said the finger flew out no youre wasting your time they found me there with her i know i wouldnt couldnt have done it but they found me what can i say im starting to think i this time he let the tears come when his sobs subsided i said have you ever done anything like this before no did you kill annemarie valdos no what about the peeping tom thing that was stupid a bunch of us from the guard were on weekend leave we went to a club in waikiki everyone was drinking and partying usually i had ginger ale this time i thought i could handle it had a beer stupid stupid then another im a stupid asshole okay we tried to pick up some girls couldnt went to walk it off in some residential neighborhood i had to take a needed to urinate found a garage wall behind some house the window to the house was open she heard we got caught i did the others ran he looked at me that doesnt sound terrible i said if thats really the way it happened it is thats the only filthy thing ive ever done since i reformed what was your relationship with betty i knew her knew her family did she have a reputation for fooling around i guess did you fool around with her no no affair no i love my wife my life is clean her baby wasnt yours i love my wife my life is clean repeating it wont make it so he started to come toward me stopped himself its true did you know she had the clap surprise on his face genuine i dont know about that my life is clean so howd you end up in the park with your head on bettys entrails i its a its a crazy story youll never believe it closing his eyes just go tell dr bill to forget about me hes got important things to do youre pretty important to him he shook his head violently tell me the story ben the head kept shaking why not he stopped another smile enigmatic too stupid i couldnt even tell claire wouldnt believe it myself try me im used to strange stories silence keeping quiet just makes you look guilty ben everything makes me look guilty he said if you keep your mouth shut you cant swallow flies did moreland tell you that his quotations are usually a little more elegant no he said sharply my father what other words of wisdom did your father give you keeping his eyes closed he tightened the lids lying down on the bunk face to the skimpy straw mattress okay i said maybe you should save it for your lawyer anyway dennis has called for a public defender from saipan itll take at least two days maybe longer anything you want me to tell moreland other than to abandon you no movement i called out denniss name deputy ed ruiz shuffled in and produced a key say anything i didnt answer the toothless mouth creased in contempt figures his old man never said anything either when we used to throw his ass in here just lie there like hes doing like some damn piece of wood then soon as the lights went out hed start having those drunkdreams screaming about things eating him alive he put the key in the lock when it got so loud we couldnt stand it wed hose him off and that would work for a while then hed sleep again and go right back into those dts all night like that next morning hed be denying he did anything few days later hed be sauced up again insult some woman or grab her take a poke at some guy and be back in here the same damn thing all over he came forward pointing at ben only difference is daddy used to sleep on the top bunk wed put him on the bottom but hed always find a way to get up there no matter how drunk then of course hed roll off in the middle of the night fall on his ass crack his head but climb right back on top the stupid shithead stubbornstupid some people dont learn he snickered and turned the key behind me ben said hold on ruiz looked at him with disgust hey killer bracing one bony hand against the edge of the cell door usmc tattoo across the top how much time do i have left said ben the doctor here is ready to go i can wait i said if hes got something to tell me ruiz mashed his lips and peered at his watch suit yourself eighteen minutes he lingered near the door well take all eighteen i said he walked away very slowly when i turned back to ben he was on his feet next to the toilet hole squeezing himself into a corner this is the story he said in a dead voice i dont care what you think of it the only reason im telling you is so youll pass it along to dr bill okay though you probably wont why not you cant be trusted whys that the way you talked about him before hes a great man you have no idea hey i said if you dont trust me to deliver the message save it for your lawyer lawyers cant be trusted either the one in hawaii didnt do well by you there was no trial in hawaii he said i pled guilty and the guard gave me some brig time they said it wouldnt go on my record obviously they cant be trusted either lifes rough i said im sure bettys family thinks so too he stared into the filthy pit i said sixteen minutes left without shifting position he said when we got home from dinner claire was upset with me for pressuring her to play she didnt show it but thats the way she is i shouldnt have done it wringing his hands we had a tiff mostly she talked and i listened then she went to bed and i stayed up trying to read to get rid of my anger sometimes that works for me not that im angry a lot and we dont have many tiffs we get along great i love her tears what did you read medical journals dr bill gives me his when hes through i like to educate myself which journals new england journal archives of internal medicine tropical medicine quarterly do you remember any specific articles one on pyloric stenosis another on gallbladder disease he rattled off more medical terminology suddenly looking at ease how long did you read maybe an hour or two one hour or two theres a big difference i we got home around nineforty the tiff took maybe another ten minutes mostly it was cold silence then claire was in bed by ten so i guess a little over an hour maybe an hour and a half then the phone rang some guy saying there was a medical emergency what time was this i dont know when im not working i dont watch the clock bill taught me time was valuable but when im home not paying attention to time is my freedom he looked at me in a new way childlike craving approval i understand i said thinking of the auden poem moreland had just left me o let not time deceive you burrows of the nightmare naked justice he scratched his cheek then his chest gazed into the latrine as if he wanted to crawl in it was probably eleventhirty he said or around then who called some guy you dont know who he shook his head small island like this i said id think youd know everyone at first i thought it was one of the gardeners at the estate but it wasnt which gardener carl sleet but it wasnt when i said carl he didnt acknowledge and this guys voice was lower when you said carl he didnt identify himself he was talking fast very upset and the connection was bad like a long distance call that surprised him why would anyone call me long distance no the worst calls are the local ones the long distance ones if you get a satellite linkup youre fine but most of the island lines are old and corroded all right i said some guy you didnt recognize calls you sounding upset ive been wracking my brain to see if i could figure out who it was but i cant why was he upset he said there was an emergency a heart attack on campion way near the park and they needed help he didnt say who had the heart attack no it all happened very fast as if he was panicked whyd he call you instead of moreland he said he had called dr bill and dr bill was on his way and told him to get me because i was closer to campion so i grabbed my stuff and went what stuff crisis kit paddles epinephrine other heart stimulants i figured id start cpr till dr bill got there then the two of us then what happened i left the house did claire see you go no i snu left as quietly as possible i didnt want to wake her or the kids did she hear the phone ring i dont know usually she doesnt the phones in the kitchen and theres no extension in the bedroom we keep the ringer on low at night with no bedroom extension how do you hear emergency calls im a light sleeper and we usually leave the bedroom door open tonight it was shut claire shut it cause she was mad when it rang i ran over and picked up on the first ring meaning no one could verify the call or the time frame so you left with your medical kit i said yes did you walk or drive drove i got to the park maybe five minutes after the call close to midnight must have been it was really dark there are no streetlights on the island except for front street at first i couldnt see anything was worried id run over the patient so i parked and walked as i got closer i saw someone lying by the side of the road just one person what about the caller no one else i assumed whoever had called it in had chickened out and i figured it would take another few minutes for dr bill to get there so i went over opening my kit ready to start and someone grabbed me grabbed you how like this hooking his left arm around his neck he did a rough imitation of a police choke hold a left arm uh no it came from this side reversing the hold i guess it was the right i cant be sure it was so sudden and i blacked out next thing i remember is denniss face staring down at me looking really weird angry other people all of them staring down at me my head feels as if its about to explode and my necks stiff and i think something happened to me and theyre there to rescue me but their faces their eyes are hard then someone i cant see calls me killer and theyre all looking at me the way they used to look at me when i was the way they did before i changed i waited a while before saying anything else thats it great story huh the one thing you can say for it is if you killed her it sure wasnt premeditated if it had been youd have prepared something useful his smile was rueful yeah great planner so what do i do tell your lawyer the story and see what he says youll tell dr bill its important to me his knowing im innocent ill tell him thank you i heard footsteps anything else i can do for you ben he bit his lip have dr bill tell claire im sorry for pressuring her to play for everything do you want to see her no not like this ask her to tell the kids something that im away on a trip once more tears welled ed ruiz opened the metal door times up on the way back to the office he said have fun a real blast i said next time i bring streamers and funny hats he let me in dennis was at his desk he put the phone down looking annoyed time well spent he asked me i shrugged well the screws are already turning dr bill doing his thing what thing is that i just got a call from oahu landau kawasaki and bolt highpowered law firm senior partners some motormouth named alfred landau flying over in a couple of days scratch the public defender flying into stanton nope into saipan by chartered jet then a private yachts taking him the rest of the way if it cant fit into the keyhole harbor im sure theyll find a way of getting him to shore he drummed the phone receiver must be nice to be rich let me take you back as we stepped outside tom creedman intercepted us he was wearing a white polo shirt white shorts and tennis shoes all that was missing was a racquet instead he carried a thin black attaché case in one hand a pocket tape recorder in the other the crowd on the waterfront had dispersed somewhat a few stragglers remained on the south end among them were skip amalfi and anders haygood skip pointing to the spot where annemarie valdos had been found going to wimbledon tom said laurent yeah me and the queen got a minute dennis not even half of one come on doctor creedman blocked me see the suspect dr delaware lets go said dennis moving to his car creedman didnt budge care for some coffee dr delaware sure i said surprising both of them great said creedman lets boogie im taking him back said dennis for his safety ill take him back dennis no way ill take the risk i said its not your risk to assume said dennis no i said what law are you invoking to restrict my movement he hesitated for a beat material witness to what you spoke to him with your permission lets call mr landau and see what he has to say about it denniss huge shoulders spread even wider he touched his belt looked up and down front street fine he said savagely youre on your own creedman and i walked past campion way to the next unmarked road past angry stares and mutters ooh he said the natives are restless youre pretty relaxed about it why not i have nothing to do with good ol dr bill on the contrary the fact that he evicted me works in my favor he grinned then continued you on the other hand need to watch your back but im here to stand up for you buddy unzipping the attaché he peeled back a flap and revealed a chunky chrome automatic sixteen shots he said gaily im sure thatll do the trick in the event of civil unrest very few of the natives own arms safe place and all that do you usually carry only during periods of stress bring it over with you bought it in guam bargain price owned by an army lieutenant who ran up some debts took beautiful care of it he zipped the case im just up the hill pretty close to the murder scene not close enough what do you mean by the time i got there the crowd was thick no chance to get close i would have liked a close look at mr romeros face right after they caught him editors like that kind of immediacy the emptiness in a psychopaths eyes im sure you can make something up his smile died thats not very kind alex i winked his round face stayed angry even after he restored the smile but i understand the cognitive dissonance must be painful for you coming here expecting pleasure island and getting auschwitz did ben have anything exculpatory to say nothing an editor would be interested in what a sicko he continued cutting them up then eating them ever see that kind of thing before the road had taken on a steeper slant and though he kept up an athletic pace his breathing got louder see what cannibalism on other islands no i meant back in the states when you were on the crime beat did i say i was ever on the crime beat i think you did the first time we met i think i didnt not my meat pardon the joke no alex i did politics dog eat dog he laughed have you seen it before i shook my head first time for everything he said we progressed up the hill passing small houses children dogs cats women with frightened eyes drew the children closer as we neared window shades lowered suddenly tsk tsk he said paradise lost his house was at the top where the street deadended a pale blue cottage with a full ocean view hugged by pink oleander and yellow hibiscus a volkswagen bug sat at the end of a shatteredstone driveway much of the surrounding property was overrun by ivy and flowering vines the nearest house was a hundred feet away separated by a splintering wooden fence inside was a different story freshly painted white walls black leather couches oriental rugs that made the vinyl floor look better than it was limitededition posters teak and lacquer furniture in the closetkitchen next to the dining area a castiron ceiling rack bore expensive copper pots german cutlery in a wooden case adorned a counter all the appliances were european and they looked brandnew let me fix you a drink said creedman heading for a portable brassandglass bar just a coke he poured the soda and fixed a double scotch for himself johnnie black ice from a small chromefaced swedish freezer i looked around the main space was an officeliving room computer and printer thousandwatt battery pack brass reflector telescope stereo set cd rack german twentyinch tv hooked up to a beefy cable that ran up through the ceiling had a dish he said but a wind blew it down looks like youve settled in for the long run i like to live well lime with that sure he brought the drinks and we sat down the ocean was framed beautifully through a wide window best revenge he said sipping living well revenge against who whoever deserves it he took a long slow swallow and emptied his glass sucking in an ice cube he moved it around his mouth so what can i do for you i said nothing alex just trying to be friendly fellow ugly americans and all that too bad we didnt get much time together before you left who said im leaving he smiled arent you eventually how about you ive got no schedule one advantage of freelancing sounds nice it is we drank and he emptied his glass can i get you another one no thanks dont mind if i do he poured himself a taller scotch and returned its really something isnt it this blood fest guess i am on the crime beat now back in dc it never appealed to me because the vast majority of criminals were total shitforbrains the police and the prosecutors were no rocket scientists either are politicians smart some of them he laughed a few nicholas hoffman he took a long slow sip smart enough from what i hear so when are you packing out im not sure yet tom so what happens to your project with moreland there isnt much of a project what was it all about anyway reviewing his files to see if we could find themes themes patterns of disease mental disease all kinds thats it thats as far as it got and if you found patterns then what wed write it up for a medical journal maybe a book of our own hows your own book going great going to add a chapter on the murders you better believe it so hows robin fine doggy okay too great any chance moreland put ben up to killing those girls i exaggerated my surprise why would he he put the drink down uncrossed his legs scooted forward lets face it alex the guys strange hes a little different like norman bates was different that place those bugs and what the hell does he do all day in that lab it sure aint medicine cause ben handles most of the medical situations or at least he used to till pam came over so whats the old guy up to all day i dont know come on youve been working with him in separate buildings whats he hiding i dont know that hes hiding anything his mustache turned down the black line was as flat as a greasepencil scrawl but he smoothed it anyway he probably told you about the hassle ben gave me probably made me out to be a thief he said you were looking for something were you sure reporters instincts because the minute i got to that place i started having a strange feeling about what just general weirdness and obviously i was right all that dogooding and his best boys a serial killer people are pissed alex if you care about that pretty lady and that cute little pooch youll head back to lala land pronto his voice had stayed low and even but his eyes were holes burnt in linen that sounds almost like a warning tom word to the wise alex strategic assessment based upon the data at hand i smiled and that sounds kind of corporate almost like a quarterly report he reached for the scotch missed groped got hold of it drank when he lowered the glass his lower lip was wet and shiny guess id better be taking you back to weird castle guess so we left the house and he walked ahead of me and got into the vw the engine squealed but it wouldnt turn over damn he said without a trace of regret battery must have gone dead id call harry or skip for a jump but theyre back in town with everyone else ill walk i started down the road i feel terrible he called after me when i looked over my shoulder he was smiling the clouds had moved directly over the shoreline and the air was warm and sticky i encountered no one on my way to the harbor but a stray yellow mutt with a gray muzzle heeled for a while then ran off as i reached front street a group of young men standing near the intersection watched me over their cigarettes grumbling as i passed and ignoring my good morning denniss police car was still parked in front of the municipal center he wouldnt want to play taxi id accepted creedmans invitation in order to check him out hed wanted me there for the same reason pumping me and warning me off then stranding me his decor said someone was paying him well his reaction to my crack about quarterly reports said it was probably stasherlayman had it been a mistake to let him know i was onto that no matter id be gone soon i walked along the docks ignoring stares the municipal centers door opened and dennis came out followed by three small men one middleaged the others in their twenties they all wore thin shirts and jeans and talked wildly as dennis tried to appease them the middleaged man stamped a foot waved a fist and shouted dennis said something and the fist waved again the man pointed and touched his heart dennis put a hand on his shoulder the man shook it off angrily people started to move in from the street dennis glared and they dispersed very slowly the older man stamped and touched his heart again one of the younger men turned and i got a look at his face plain round acned unmistakable resemblance to betty aguilar dennis ushered them back inside and i continued south i hadnt gone far before i heard footsteps behind me a quick look back some of the youths id passed at the intersection four of them hands in pockets advancing quickly i stopped looked at them blankly and when that didnt stop them tried to stare them down they kept coming i crossed the street ending up in front of the trading post the structure was sealed with yellow crimescene tape some things were the same everywhere slims bar was closed now too but several beer swillers loitered in the gravel bed that served as the taverns parking lot the four men behind me hesitated then jogged across i reversed direction and headed back toward the center the youths picked up speed one of them had something in his hand a short wooden club like a cops billy but sawnoff i ran they did too their mouths were open and their eyes were fixed the police station wasnt far but the hangerson at slims could be a problem as i got closer they closed rank forming a human wall skip amalfi among them flushed his lips pursed in an attempted belch anders haygood next to him stolid and sober the gray eyes amused the boys to my back shouted something the slims crowd moved forward caught in the middle more shouts loud murmuring then someones voice above it all idiots jacqui laurent had burst through the slims crowd taller than most of the men she wore a greasespecked apron over her flowered dress and was waving something big castiron frypan one of the slims crowd said something she cut him off shut up you moron what do you think youre doing the four young men were close enough for me to hear their panting i whipped around the one with the club came forward making small circles with the weapon he had a feather beard and long hair some of his shirt buttons were missing exposing a hairless chest jacqui was at my side ignacio she grabbed for the club ignacio held on she tugged someone laughed she curled her lip big shots big heroes ganging up on an innocent guy who says hes innocent said one of the slims crowd he lives up there yeah yeah motherfu so said jacqui so what so hes what a what henry so hes a guest up at the castle so what does that mean that we act like animals someones been acting like an animal said skip and it aint you shut uplook whos talking skips nostrils opened hey hey yourself shut up and listen youre an animal and that animals a pig skip moved forward haygood held him back thick arms taut come on big man said jacqui jerking the club you going to attack me a woman with a frypan that how you get your jollies or is peeing at women your only thing skips chinless face paled and he struggled in haygoods grip haygood said something and skip made the sound of a hungry kid refused supper big shot said jacqui big shot with your bladder every time a woman goes on the beach you follow her and pee near her blanket like a dog marking very brave skip lunged haygood restrained him and some of the other men joined in holding him back easy man said one of them come on said jacqui suddenly wresting the billy from ignacios grip and waving it along with the skillet go at me skip you like to get tough with women right maybe you had something to do with betty tough guy skip snarled and haygood did something to his shoulder that made his face go limp like a dog said jacqui following every new woman around peeing you think thats funny she ran her eyes over the other men any of you think thats funny peeing on the beach near a womans blanket did it happen to any of your sisters or your mamas cause he did it to me when he first came over remember that skip back to the others that your idea of brave boys peeing on women and beating up on innocent men silence big tough machomen gang up on a guest whats his crime visiting how do you think this island will ever get anywhere you treat people like this the men avoided her eyes skip was rubbing his shoulder haygood turned him around and tried to move him away skip shoved haygoods arm away but walked jacqui stared at the slims crowd until it began to fall apart soon no one was left but the four youths whod stalked me the one named ignacio stared at the billy in jacquis hand she pointed the frypan at them you should be ashamed of yourself i have a good mind to tell your mothers one of the youths started to smirk think thats funny duane ill tell your mama first go ahea want me to really duane first ill tell her about what i saw on north beach duanes mouth slammed shut the other boys stared at him yeah so he said yeah so jacqui tapped a firm thigh with the skillet you really want me to do that duane whu said one of the other boys giggling whud you do duane nuthin sure was nothing said jacqui and duanes nose twitched ah fuck he said lets get the fuck out of here good idea said jacqui all of you scoot they slunk away the other boys surrounding duane as he cursed them when they were well past the center jacqui faced me what did you think you were doing walking home its not a good time to play tourist i see that she inspected the billy frowned and put it in her pocket walking all the way back to the castle my ride didnt come through she gave me a puzzled look i told her about creedman whatd you want with him he invited me her expression said i was a cretin come on ill get dennis or a deputy to drive you dennis already offered i said i turned him down so i doubt hell want to she scraped something off the bottom of the frypan hefted the utensil as if considering braining me men she said why does everything have to be a contest come on well go ask him again hell do it hes been raised on the fifth commandment her fingers prodded the small of my back strong her skin was creamy and unlined her body big and strong shed been eighteen when shed given birth to dennis but even up close she could pass for his sister come on she said i cant be here forever she walked very fast swinging the pan in a semicircle big breasts heaving mouth slightly parted i said what did you see that boy duane do on north beach she grinned never really saw him heard him chuckle fooling around with his girlfriend is that unusual not for north beach kids go there all the time avoiding south beach because of the murder so what was the big threat i pressed she laughed high and girlish it relaxed her face and made her seem even younger shifting closer to me she said the big threat dr delaware was that the boy was no good at it his girlfriend was not very happy with him more laughter as her hip nudged mine you know wham bam thank you maam ah i said ah she smiled tightening the arc of the pan and scraping her flank her dress blew up revealing brown leg ah she went into the center first i stuck my head in saw dennis huddled with bettys family and backed out quickly i waited next to the police car keeping my eyes on the street quiet had settled over the waterfront the rain clouds seemed to sag deputy ed ruiz came out a few minutes later and said lets go the ride to the estate was silent he stopped in front of the big gates this far enough thanks i got out when you leaving aruk soon as the boats come in he stuck his head out of the car listen ive got nothing against dr bill he helped my daughter out of a real bad situation a few years ago scraped herself on some coral got this infection we thought shed lose the leg till he saved it his toothless mouth folded inward ill forward your regards i said but things change you know not everyones down on him some people know him better than others the ones hes helped directly yeah but others they dont know he let the wheel spin back ben did those girls and you know it lets say he did what does dr bill have to do with it silence you think hes somehow involved he didnt answer but people are saying he is people talk maybe i said someone wants dr bill to leave and this is a golden chance to get rid of him why because he owns too much of the island thats the point he said angrily he owns too damn much nothing much to go around and each year its less people get tired of wanting those that want start thinking about those that got gladys was running a manual carpet sweeper over the secondfloor landing looking tired but moving quickly as i approached the door to my suite she put a finger to her lips robins napping she whispered thats why im using this instead of the hoover thanks for telling me i whispered back can i fix you some lunch no thanks is dr bill around somewhere claire came by to see him brought kiko for us to take care of ive got him in a cage in the laundry room claire had the children with her poor little things so scared robin let them play with spike she looked ready to cry dennis promised to have someone watch them so who does he send elijah moon everyone calls him moojah hes supposed to be a police deputy but hes my age got a belly out to here what good can a fat old man do i started down the stairs then stopped gladys yes doctor you cooked for senator hoffman when he was the base commander i was head cook sailors working under me she frowned tough job he liked his food fancy all sauced up always had to be something new we used to send over for that really expensive beef from japan cows that do nothing all day but sit around and eat rice kobe beef right and vegetables you never heard of and oysters and all kinds of expensive seafood nothing local mind you had his crabs shipped from oregon dungeness crabs new england lobster philippine scallops he was always clipping recipes out of magazines and sending them over to me try this gladys why do you ask i was just curious what kind of relationship he and dr bill had the night we had dinner at the base they talked privately and dr bill was really upset afterwards i know she said the next day he didnt eat a thing for breakfast or lunch and him so thin in the first place any idea why no but he never liked hoffman her eyes misted i dont believe ben did anything sir the people down in the village do then theyre stupid for all dr bills accomplished theres a lot of resentment toward him she gripped the sweeper and the soft flesh of her arms quivered ungrateful welfare bums dr bill tried to get them to work but they dont want to know about that do they did you know he offered free leases on the trading post and hardly anyone was interested even those that rented stalls hardly showed up except to cash those welfare checks government keeps sending those checks why should anyone bother the nerve to resent him anger had pulled her voice out of a whisper she slapped her hand over her mouth what with bens troubles its too bad about dr bill and hoffman i said it would be good to have friends in high positions lot of good hed do she said that one was always for himself used to come up here and eat dr bills food and cheat at cards illegal bridge signals can you believe that he was no gentleman doctor did dr bill know he cheated of course thats how i know he used to joke about it with me saying nicholas thinks hes fooling me gladys i told him it was terrible he should put an end to it he laughed said it wasnt important cheating at bridge i said so hoffmans wife went along with it no she it was she colored what a thing shameful half the time hoffman invited himself played tennis and sunned ordered food from the kitchen like i was still working for him like everything here was his the hand clamped over her lips again this time she blushed behind it everything i said you know a big shot used to having things his way ill tell you something else dr delaware the man was heartless back when i was still his cook a plane full of sailors went down men and their wives and children returning to the states she dipped a hand the crash moreland had mentioned after pickers accident nineteen sixtythree all those people she said a tragedy so what did hoffman do that evening he sends over a crate of scallops on ice and orders me to fix him coquilles st jacques she resumed sweeping miss castagna said youll be leaving soon im sorry from the way you treat miss castagna i can tell youre a gentleman and we need more kindness on aruk in the whole world doctor but aruk would be a good place to start i was surprised to find moreland in my office slumped in an armchair reading a pathology journal he looked like a skeleton coated with wax putting down the magazine he sat up sharply hows ben i summarized my time in the cell he said nothing the journals table of contents was on the front cover and hed circled an article bloodstain evidence defense research i said someone called him on an emergency someone who sounded like carl thats what he said his fingers looked frail as sparrows feet they cracked as he flexed them meaning you dont believe him meaning its not much of a story bill a long time passed doesnt that indicate to you he said that hes innocent surely someone as intelligent as ben could concoct a firstrate story if his object was to get away with something hes intelligent but hes also highly troubled i said drink was once a problem for him and he obviously reacts strongly to it now and hes got at least one prior sexual offense indecent exposure in haw i know about that he said that was nonsense i took care of that for him i let the non sequitur stand he said so even after speaking with him you judge him guilty things look bad for him but i try not to judge yes yes of course youre a psychologist last time we spoke that was why you wanted me to see him bill he picked up the journal rolled it hefted it blinking forgive me son im on edge youre certainly entitled to your opinion though i wish you felt differently id love to change my opinion bill if youve got information im listening more important communicate it to the lawyer you hired he bent low in the chair maybe youve done all you can do for the time being i said maybe you should start looking after your own interests down in the village theres a lot of hostility toward you alfred landau is the best he said softly his firm handled barbaras will after she died she was a wealthy woman what she left me enabled me to buy up more parcels of land alfred was most helpful did he handle bens arrest in hawaii too minimally that was a military affair i made a few calls used my former rank he stood youre absolutely right id better call alfred now youre not concerned about what i just told you the anger down in the village it will pass i told him about the near confrontation with the four boys and how jacqui had stepped in im sorry it came to that thank god you werent harmed but youre not out of harms way bill bettys family is enraged lots of idle talks circulating about you that seemed to genuinely perplex him youre a have among havenots bill ive always shared despite that youre still lord of the manor and the serfs arent doing well i its hardly the feudal system isnt it i said bettys murder is the spark that lit tinder but its obvious to me after just a few days here that things were heating up well before he shook his head the people are good but their lives are falling apart bill their entire society is shutting down whens the last time the gas station pumps worked ive put in for a shipment you own that too and i ration my personal vehicles the same way i do theirs they know that they also know how you live and measure it against their own existence more people leave than stay betty and her husband were planning to leave perfect climate for provocateurs and youve got some skip amalfis been having fun whipping up the crowd and i wouldnt be surprised if tom creedman starts to take a more active role i was up at his place after visiting ben and he you didnt tell him anything i hope his eyes were bright with alarm no i said trying to hold on to my patience he asked but i played dumb asked about what if ben had told me anything significant what you and i were working on he also clearly wanted to convince me to leave which makes sense if hes still working for stasherlayman and they want to control aruk have you seen the interior of his house he shook his head rooms full of brandnew furniture computer equipment expensive appliances yes i remember he received a large shipment shortly after he arrived right after i asked him to leave here meaning hed planned all along to settle down in his own place came up here to snoop what was he looking for bill i told you i dont know not a clue none taking hold of the journal he rolled it again and let it unfurl jo picker has something to do with stasherlayman too that lifted him off the chair what how do you know robin saw their literature in her room shes another one from washington and she was here alone the night the roaches ended up in our room i weve already established that was my fault leaving the cage open do you actually remember leaving it open that absent look came into his eyes no but i you really believe she could be working for them too i think its likely and im bringing it up to warn you because youll be dealing with her after im gone which is what i came to tell you robin and i are leaving on the next boat he took hold of the chair it slid forward and he lost his footing i shot up and got hold of him just before he tumbled clumsy oaf he said jerking away and pulling at his shirt as if trying to rip it off clumsy goddamned old fool it was the first time id heard him swear i managed to sit him back down pardon my language the next boat is when a week five days ah well he said in a clogged voice you must do what you feel is best theres a time for everything time is important to you i said he stared at me ben told me that it made me think of your last note the auden poem times deceit your question about einstein what exactly were you getting at he looked up at the ceiling what do you think it meant to take time seriously but to understand that its relative what kind of deceit were you referring to more of the absent look then einstein in his own way he was a magician wouldnt you say turning the universe on its end as if reality was one big illusion forcing us all to look at reality in a new way unencumbered by time unencumbered by prior assumptions he lowered his gaze and met mine and you want me to do that bill what i want really doesnt matter does it son a new way i said being skeptical about reality reality is to a good extent what we want it to be he got up inhaled stretched and cracked more joints the great thinkers i said always something to learn from them he answered as if we were reciting responsively i still dont understand the note bill he came up to me moving into my personal space the way he had with dennis a big clumsy intrusive bird i felt as if i was about to be pecked and had to control myself from retreating the note he said actually you did very well with the note son bon voyage the rain came just before milo called robin and i were reading in bed when i felt the air turn suddenly heavy and saw the sky crack the windows were open and a burnt smell drifted through the screen for one knifestab moment i thought of fire but as i looked out the water began dropping panes of plate glass filming the view the burnt smell turned sweet gardenias and old roses and cloves spike began barking and circling and the room got dimmer and warmer i shut the windows blocking out some but not all of the sound robin got up and stared through a now filmy pane the phone rang hows everything said milo bad and getting worse i told him about my experiences in the village but were booked for home smart move you can always stop over in hawaii for a real vacation maybe i said but i knew wed be jetting back to la as quickly as possible robin there got some house stuff to tell her i handed over the phone and robin listened her smile told me things were going well when i got back on he said now your stuff though now that youre leaving who cares tell me anyway first of all both maryland cannibals are still locked up the asshole who only cut the victim is eligible for parole but has been refused the asshole who cut and dined isnt going anywhere thank god it wasnt an la jury right la jury couldnt convict adolf hitler whats that sound static on your end rain i said think of a shower on high and triple it typhoon no just rain supposedly they dont get typhoons here supposedly they didnt get crime either i moved closer to the window only the tops of the trees were visible through the downpour above the rain clouds the sky was milkwhite and peaceful nope no wind just lots of water i hope it lets up in time for the boats to come get us daylight come and you wanna go home huh well when you hear the rest youll wish it were sooner guess who covered the cannibal case for a local rag creedman didnt even have to look for him his name was right there on the articles then someone else took over midcase and that made me a little curious so i dug deeper no one at the paper remembers creedman specifically but i found out thered been some hassle with the local police around the same time he got pulled off the story officers leaking information to his paper and others for money a bunch of cops got fired did reporters get fired too couldnt find that out but its a good bet anyway creedmans next gig of record was at a dc cable station some kind of business show but he only lasted three months before getting hired by stasherlayman constructions dc office communications officer the company issued a press release describing major balancesheet problems their stock went way down and the owners bought it all up and went private next year profits went way way higher manipulation maybe the owners are just a couple of lucky guys and maybe lawyers go to heaven who are the owners two brothers from oregon inherited it from their daddy moved to texas big liberals on paper funding ecology research humane solutions to crime oregon i said hoffmans constituents was he part of the buyout if he was it didnt hit the news but they did contribute big to his last reelection how big three hundred thou what they call soft money gets around the spending limits seeing as hoffman didnt have to put out much he was a shooin thats very sweet so it wouldnt surprise me if hes backing them on some island project he chairs a committee that considers big federal development grants has the power to let things through or hold them up but i cant find anything smelly the cops who got fired i said were the leaks directly related to the cannibal murder i had trouble getting details the press doesnt believe in full disclosure when it comes to the press but the firings took place right after the arrest did you get any names of fired cops i heard paper rustling white tagg johnson haygood ceru anders haygood thats what it says he lives here one of the guys who likes to cut things up his buddys been whipping the crowd up against ben likes to pee when women are watching wonderful so he and creedman got booted at the same time they know each other ten to one theyre both on stasherlaymans payroll same for my nextdoor neighbor she claims to be a scientist but both she and creedman are carrying guns that they picked up in guam jesus alex just sit tight till the boat comes in dont try to find out any more all right i said but now im starting to think moreland could be right about ben being innocent not that hes got much of a story i wuz framed ten points for the detective its always i wuz framed unless its i blacked out or he started it bens two for three claims he was choked out the rest is blank brilliant i told him the rest of bens account beyond lame he said needs a fourprong walker you know alex a real bad smells coming through the line even with creedman and haygood in cahoots over some development deal that doesnt get benjy off the hook hell for all you know hes on stashers payroll too you watch your back what should i do about the info on creedman and haygood nothing if the lawyer moreland hired is really so sharp let him do something with it ill tell him not you name alfred landau honolulu whens he getting over there two or three days perfect timing ill wait till youve left meanwhile ben sits there rotting ben aint going anywhere no matter what anyone says or does they found him lying on the goddamn body convenient isnt it or stupid he said but that just makes it typical i had an idiot last month carjacked and killed some citizen then drove the car for a couple of days before taking it to the dealer to complain about the fucking brakes funny except the citizens just as dead dont deal with it alex ill call landau as soon as youre off the island and dont feel bad about ben from what youre telling me that jail cell may well be the safest place for him right now im not sure of that were not talking maximum security just a hole at the back of the building the victims family visited the police station today i saw the look in their eyes it wouldnt take much of a mob to pull him out sorry about that but where else can he go hows security at the estate nonexistent just stay put alex stay in your goddamn room pretend its a second honeymoon and you dont even want to come out okay you definitely have your passage booked definitely if the storm didnt stall things see you soon enough of this paradise shit cheryl brought dinner up to our room and we picked at it darkness made its entrance virtually unnoticed the rain got stronger relentless slapping the sides of the house but still warm no lightning the air was flat deenergized as i sat there and did nothing times edges melted time einstein a magician bending reality relativitymoreland a moral relativist trying to excuse himself for something guilts a great motivator all these years all his accomplishments propelled by a troubled conscience milo was right it wasnt my battle robin smiled from across the room id told her what milo had learned and shed said so its good were leaving she was curled up now with some old magazines that had come with the suite spike snored at her feet peaceful scene damned domestic pretending was fun i pointed to a wet window listen to it she let her hand drop to spikes head it was a dark and stormy night i laughed went over and kissed her hair she put the vogue on her lap and reached up to stroke my face this isnt so bad huh when you get down to it making the best of a bad situation is the heart of creativity she teased my tongue with hers our mouths collided all the electricity here we were slowdancing toward the bed fumbling with buttons when the knocks on the door added thunder pams voice on the other side is anyone in there we opened the door is dad with you she stood dripping in a khaki raincoat drenched black face shinywet under a snarl of running makeup no said robin i cant find him anywhere all the cars are here but he isnt we were supposed to get together an hour ago maybe dennis or one of the deputies picked him up i said no i called dennis dads not in town ive searched the outbuildings and every square inch of the house except your room and jos she hurried next door jo answered her knock quickly she had on a bathrobe but looked wide awake is dad with you no have you seen him at all this evening sorry been in all day touch of the stomach bug she placed a hand on her abdomen her hair was combed out and her color was still good when she noticed me studying her she stared back hard oh god said pam this weather what if hes outside and fell older people do tend to spill said jo ill help you look she went inside and returned wearing a tentlike transparent slicker over a black shirt and black jeans matching hat rubber boots whens the last time you saw him she said i followed her eyes down to the entry water had pooled there gladys and cheryl were standing next to it looking helpless around five said pam he was in his office said he just had a little work would be in soon we were supposed to have dinner together at seven and its already eightthirty i spoke to him just before that i said thinking of morelands tumble in the lab hmm said jo well im sorry havent noticed a thing been out of commission since noon bad stomach i said she gave me another challenging look could he have gone off the grounds no said pam wringing her hands he must be out there gladys get me a flashlight a big powerful one she started for the stairs lets look for him in a group i said is anyone else here no dad sent the staff home early so they wouldnt get caught in the rain to the maids did anyone stay behind gladys shook her head cheryl watched her mother then imitated the gesture her usual stoicism was replaced by a rabbity restlessness sniffing rubbing her fingers together tapping a foot a sharp glance from gladys stilled her okay said jo lets do it logically did you check the insectarium i said i tried to get in said pam but couldnt the new locks do you have the keys alex no the lights were out and i pounded hard on the door no answer doesnt he work in the dark sometimes said jo doesnt he keep things dark for the bugs i guess so said pam panic stretched her sad eyes youre right he could be in there couldnt he what if hes lying there hurt gladys any idea where we can find a duplicate key i checked all the ones on the rack maam and its not there cheryl grunted then lowered her head gladys turned to her what nothing momma do you know where dr bill is cheryl uhuh have you seen him just in the morning when before lunchtime did he say anything to you about going somewhere tonight no momma gladys lifted her daughters chin cheryl nothin momma i was in the kitchen cleaning the oven then i made lemonade you said it had too much sugar remember gladyss face tightened with irritation then resignation set in yes i remember cher damn damn said pam youre sure about the keys on the rack yes maam he probably forgot as usual he gave it to ben said cheryl i saw it shiny lot of good that does said pam all right im going back over to the insectarium and try to get in through one of those windows the windows are high said jo youll need a ladder gladys said pam her voice was so tight the word was a squeak in the garage maam ill go get it ill come with you said jo i can hold the ladder or climb it myself youre sick i said let me she closed her door and positioned herself between pam and me im fine it was just a twentyfourhour thing still no problem she said firmly you probably dont have rainclothes right i do come on lets not waste any more time she and pam hurried down picked up gladys and headed toward the kitchen cheryl remained alone in the entry fidgeting again looking everywhere but up at us then right up at us at me what is it cheryl i said um can i get you something lemonade no too sweet coffee no thanks she nodded as if expecting the answer kept bobbing her head is everything okay cheryl said robin the young woman jumped forced herself to stand still robin went down to her whats the matter hon cheryl kept looking up at me its pretty scary i said dr bill disappearing like this she began rubbing her thighs over and over i followed robin down what is it cheryl said robin cheryl looked at her guiltily turned to me one hand kept rubbing her leg the other patted a pocket i need you she said on the verge of tears i looked at robin and she went to the far end of the front room the rain was beating out a twotwo rhythm smearing the picture windows cheryls rubbing had intensified and her face was compressed with anxiety sweating conflict then i remembered that moreland had used her to deliver milos phone message did dr bill give you something for me cheryl running her eyes in all directions she took a folded white card out of her pants pocket and thrust it at me stapled shut on all four corners i started to pull it open no he said its for secret okay ill look at it in secret i palmed the card she started to leave but i held her back when did dr bill give it to you this morning to deliver tonight if he didnt come to the kitchen if he didnt come to the kitchen by a certain time she looked confused why would he come to the kitchen cheryl tea i fix the tea you fix tea for him every night at a special time no distraught she tried to pull loose again staring at my pocket as if expecting the paper to burst through gotta go one second tell me what he told you give it to you if he didnt want tea nod when do you usually make him tea when he tells me she started to whimper looked down at my hand on her arm i let go okay thanks cheryl instead of running off she held back dont tell momma morelands trusty courier hed figured her limited intelligence would keep her on track eliminate moral dilemmas wrong all right i said momma will be mad i wont tell her cheryl i promise go on now you did the right thing she hurried away and i took the card to robin it was too dark to read and i didnt want to put on the lights hurrying back up to our suite i popped the staples morelands familiar handwriting disr what said robin a library catalogue number some kind of reference probably a volume or page number hes been leaving cards since we got here quotes from great writers and thinkers stevenson auden einstein the last one was something about time and justice the only great thinker i can come up with who matches disr is disraeli did you notice a book by him up here no only magazines maybe theres an article on disraeli architectural digest i said house and garden sometimes they run features on ancestral homes of famous people she divided the magazines and we started scanning tables of contents french vogue i muttered yeah thatll be it what disraeli wore when addressing parliament now available at armani boutique what the hells he getting at even at his darkest hour the old coots playing games she discarded an elle started scrutinizing a town country using poor cheryl as a messenger i said if he had something to tell me why couldnt he just come out and say it maybe he feels its too dangerous or maybe hes just going off the deep end i picked up a sixyearold esquire everything he does is calculated i feel like a character in a play his script even this disappearance middle of the night so damned theatrical you think he faked it who knows what goes on in that big bald head i sympathize with the fact that his lifes falling apart but the logical thing would have been to beef up security and wait until bens lawyer arrives instead he lets the staff go home early and puts his daughter through this rain hit the window so hard it shook the casement i ran my finger down another contents page tossed it why choose me to play clue with he obviously trusts you lucky me it makes no sense rob he knows were leaving i told him this afternoon unless in his own nutty way he thinks thisll keep us here maybe that or something else spurred him to action but he could also be in real trouble knew he was in danger and left a message for you because youre the only one hes got left what kind of trouble someone could have gotten in here and abducted him or he fell like he did in the lab yes she said ive noticed he loses his balance a lot and the absentmindedness maybe hes sick alex or just an old man pushing himself too hard either way his being out there on a night like this isnt a pleasant thought the rain kept sloshing spike listened tense and fascinated we finished the magazines nothing on disraeli there are books in your office she said in back where the files are but theyre not categorized i said thousands of volumes no system not too efficient if hes really trying to tell me something then what about that library off the dining room she said the one he told us wouldnt interest us maybe he said that because he was hiding something a book on or by disraeli what is this nancy drew and joe hardys blind date lets at least check what could it hurt alex all weve got is time we went downstairs again the house was a scramble of streaks and shadows hidden angles and blind corners ripe with charged air we passed through the front room and the dining room the library door was closed but unlocked once inside i turned on a crystal lamp dim light the salmon moiré walls looked brown the dark furniture muddy very few books maybe a hundred volumes housed in the pair of cases unlike the big library this one was alphabetized fiction to the left nonfiction to the right the former mostly readers digest condensed editions of bestsellers the latter art books and biographies i found the disraeli quickly an old british edition of a novel called tancred inside was a rosepink laceedged bookplate that said ex libris barbara steehoven moreland the name inscribed in a calligraphic hand much more elegant than morelands i turned hurriedly to page no distinguishing marks or messages nothing noteworthy about line eighteen or word eighteen or letter eighteen nothing noteworthy about anything in the book i read the page again then a third time handed it to robin she scanned it and gave it back so maybe disr stands for something else could it be something medical shrugging i flipped through the book again no inscriptions anywhere the pages were yellowed but crisp at the edges as if never handled i put it back pulled out another volume at random gone with the wind then forever amber a couple of irving wallaces all with barbara morelands bookplate her room said robin so he probably thinks of the big one as his leaving something there makes more sense its right behind your office maybe he pulled something out and left it for you this isnt exactly strolling weather she wagged a finger at me and someone forgot to bring his rain slicker unlike the alwaysprepared dr picker wonder if she packed her little gun under that giant condom i should have insisted on going with her and pam maybe i should go over to the bug zoo and see what the two of them are up to no she said if jo is armed i dont want you out there in the dark what if she mistakes you for an intruder or pretends to you really suspect her at the very least shes working for stasherlayman she frowned and pams out there with her lets go see if bill left anything for you two targets in the dark forget it i buttoned my shirt at the neck and raised the collar you go back and lock yourself in the room and ill dash over ill circle around from the back and avoid the bug house she grabbed my arm no way are you leaving me alone waiting for you to return will drive me batty ill be quick if i dont find anything in ten minutes ill forget about it no youll get drenched well get drenched together lets just forget the whole thing rob if moreland wanted to send a message he should have used western union alex please you know if i wasnt here youd be running to that bungalow i dont know that at all come on the point is you are here let me go in and out or forget about it nancy please alex what if hes in danger and our not helping leads to tragedy theres already been plenty of tragedy and what can disraeli have to do with helping him i dont know but like you said hes got reasons for everything he may play games but theyre serious ones come on lets make a quick run for it youll catch a cold young lady on the contrary its a warm rain think of it as showering together you always like that we were soaked immediately i held her arm and rainblinded and slickfooted concentrated on staying on the paths no worries about the gravelcrunch the downpour blocked it out vertical swimming new olympic event the downpour felt oily as it rolled off our skin slow going till i spotted the yellow light over my office door i stopped looked around no one in sight but an army could have been hiding and i knew if moreland was out there it would be nearly impossible to find him before morning i glanced toward the insectarium lights still off pam and jo hadnt gotten in the rain chopped our necks and our backs deeptissue massage i tapped robins shoulder and the two of us made a dash for the bungalow the door was unlocked as id left it i got robin inside then myself and flipped on the weakest light in the room a glassshaded desk lamp water flooded the hardwood floor our clothes clung like leotards and we sounded like squeegees when we moved books and journals on my desk piles of them that hadnt been there this afternoon medical texts but nothing by or about disraeli no references beginning disr then i found it hefty and blue on the bottom of the stack the oxford dictionary of quotations i flipped to page samples of the wisdom of benjamin disraeli line justice is truth in action all that for this the crazy old bastard robin read the quote out loud i tried to recall the auden quote naked justice justice is truth wanting me to do something to ensure justice but what suddenly i felt tired and useless dropping a sodden sleeve onto the desk i started to close the book then noticed a tiny handwritten arrow on the bottom of page pointing to the right instruction to turn the page i did a notation in morelands handwriting parallel to the spine i rotated the book that turned out to be the wisdom of gustave flaubert two quotations one about growing beards the other demeaning the value of books more games moreland had been reading flaubert the day hed shown me the office léducation sentimentale in the original french sorry dr bill i took latin in high school tapping the book i felt something hard under the righthand leaf ten pages down wedged into the spine and taped to the paper a key brass shiny new i removed it underneath was another handwritten inscription the letters so tiny i could barely make them out thank you for persisting gustaves girl will be assisting gustaves girl said robin gustave flaubert i said the girl who comes to my mind is madame bovary i told bill id read the book years ago meaning what i thought madame bovary was married to a doctor got bored had affairs ruined her life ate poison and died a doctors wife barbara is he trying to tell us she committed suicide he told me she drowned but maybe but why bring that up now could that be what he feels guilty about sure but it still doesnt make sense making such a big deal about that now i tried to reel the books plot through my mind then the truth came at me nastily and unexpectedly like a drunk driver no not his wife i said dropping the key in a wet pocket i shut the book stomach turning what is it alex another emma i said is going to help us a girl with eight legs something hidden near her cage said robin or in it he may have hidden it in the bug zoo to keep it from jo she claimed to be queasy about bugs and this afternoon i told him my suspicions of her shes there right now holding the ladder for pam be interesting to see if she actually goes in what could he be hiding something to do with either the murders or stasherlaymans plan bens arrest made him realize things are bad and he has to play whatever cards hes got the door opened suddenly and jo and pam sloshed in i closed the book of quotations and tried to look casual dropped the shiny key into my pocket as the two women wiped the water from their eyes pam shook her head despondently jo fixed her gaze on me and shut the door what are you folks doing out we wanted to help said robin started looking around the grounds but it got to be too much so we ducked in any luck at the insectarium pam shook her head miserably jo scanned the room the windows are bolted shut and layered with wire mesh i managed to break the glass with the flashlight but the wire wouldnt bend so all i could do was shine it around and look in as best i could far as i could see hes not there he didnt answer my shouts said pam we got a pretty good look cant break the door either said jo three locks plate steel and the hinges are inside she removed her hat rain had gotten underneath and her hair was limp im going back out said pam reconsider jo told her even if he is out there with this kind of limited visibility i dont see how youd spot him i dont care as she rushed for the door jo stared at me what about you well stay here for a while then return to the house let us know if you find him pam left jo put her hat back on are you armed i said excuse me are you carrying your gun she smiled no weather like this it could flood why think i need protection anyone could be out there the hostility down in the village the rainll probably keep people away but who knows were all pretty vulnerable traipsing around so said jo so we need to be careful fine ill be careful she threw the door open and was gone i opened the door a crack and watched as she melted into the downpour whyd you do that said robin when i closed it to let her know i was onto her maybe itll prevent her from trying something maybe not we stood there then i cracked the door again and looked outside nothing no one for what that was worth now what said robin now we either go back to our room and wait till daylight or you go back and wait and i use the key and see what gustaves girl can do for us she shook her head third option we both go visit emma not again im the one who had the pet tarantula thats some qualification whats yours im nuts she touched my arm think about it alex where would you rather i be with you or alone with jo next door theres no reason for her to think we have any way of getting in there its the last place shell look for us especially if she really is bugphobic nancy i said nancy nancy nancy am i wrong hes a strange old man alex but in a crazy way hes left a logical trail maybe we should see the rest of it mr hardy i checked again twice waited checked again finally we snuck out staying out of the pathlights as much as we could we took a tortuously slow route to the big building stopping several times to make sure we werent being followed the rain kept battering us i was so wet i forgot about it there finally the three new locks were dead bolts the key fit all of them one final look around i pushed the steel door and we slipped in it closed on total darkness the windowless anteroom safe to turn on the light the space was exactly as i recalled empty the white tiles spotless and dry no one had entered recently we squeezed out our clothes i shut off the lights and pushed open the door to the main room cold metal handrails robins hand even colder a softer darkness in the zoo speckled by pale blue dots in some of the aquariums muted moonlight struggled through the two windows jo and pam had broken each was dead center in the long walls the glass punched out but the wire mesh remaining water shot through on both sides making a whooshing noise hitting the sill and running down to the concrete floor collecting in shiny blots something else shiny window shards sharp and ragged as ice chips we waited giving our eyes time to adjust the same rotten produce odor peat moss overripe fruit steps down thirteen moreland had said i took in the central aisle rows of tables on each side the work space at the far end where he concocted insect delicacies movement from some of the tanks but again the rain overpowered the sounds thirteen steps hed said it twice then counted each one out loud making a point knowing this night would eventually come and preparing us for a descent in the dark i took robins hand what i could see of her expression was resolute step number one now i could hear it scurrying and slithering as we got closer to the tanks even as we searched for moreland i knew we wouldnt find him he had something else in mind welcome to my little zoo gustaves girl will be assisting the little glass houses were dark and identical where was the tarantula on the left side toward the back as i tried to pinpoint the spot robin guided me to it the cage was dark the mulch floor still nothing on the table nearby maybe moreland had removed the creature and left something in its place i stooped and looked through the glass nothing for a moment maybe id misunderstood i started to hope emma shot up out of the moss and leaves and i fell back eight bristly legs drummed the glass frantically the spiders body segments pulsed half a foot of body slow confident movements shes spoiled eats small birds lizards immobilizes crushes good evening emma i said she kept stroking then scooted back down and sat in the mulch light from a neighboring tank hit her eyes and turned them to black currants focused black currants looking at robin robin put her face up against the glass the spiders lipless mouth compressed then formed an oval as if pushing out a sound robin tickled the glass with one fingertip the spider watched robin made a move for the top lid and i held her wrist the spider shot up again its okay alex no way dont worry he said she wasnt venomous he said she wasnt venomous enough to kill prey so she crushes im not worried i have a good feeling about her womens intuition whats wrong with that i just dont think this is the time to test theory why you and not me who says it has to be anyone why would bill put us in danger his being reasonable isnt something id take to the bank dont worry but your hand my hands fine though youre starting to hurt my wrist i let go and before i could stop her she nudged the lid back half an inch and was dangling her fingers in the tank that damned dexterity the spider watched but didnt move i cursed to myself and kept still sweat mixed with the rain on my skin i itched the spider pulsed faster robins entire hand was in the tank now hanging limply the spider compressed its own mouth again enough pull it out her face expressionless robin let her fingers come to rest near the spiders abdomen touching tentatively then with greater confidence stroking the tarantula turned languidly spreading to accept the caresses nudging up against robins undulating fingers covering them encompassing robins hand robin let the animal rest there for several moments then slowly lifted her hand out of the aquarium wearing the spider like a grotesque hairy glove bending her knees she placed her palm flat on the table the spider extended one leg then another stretching again testing the surface peering back toward its home it walked off the hand then back on nosing robins fingertips robin smiled hey fuzzy one you feel a little like spike as if encouraged the spider continued up robins forearm and came to rest on her upper sleeve its weight pulling down at the fabric my emma youve been eating well the spider curled around robins bicep hugging the arm then inched forward like a steeplejack scaling a pole coming to a stop on robins shoulder nuzzling the side of robins neck stopping right near the jugular all the while robin talked and stroked see alex were buddies why dont you see if theres anything in the tank i started to put my hand in then stopped was there another one in there mr emma oh hell hadnt i read somewhere that the females were the tough ones removing the glass lid completely i peered down saw nothing and plunged in my hand groped leaves and soil and branches then something hard and grainy lava rock something underneath paper i pulled it out another folded card too dark to read i found a tank whose blue light was strong enough impressive though emma may be at first sight everythings relative size as well as time relative something bigger than the tarantula my eyes drifted to the last row of tanks one aquarium larger than the others twice as large a big piece of slate resting atop the lid what lived there was twice emmas length my brontosaurus significantly more venomous over a foot of flatbodied leather whip spiked tail antennae as thick as linguini scores of legs i remembered how the front ones had pawed the air furiously as we approached the flat cold hostility i havent quite trained it to love me sadistic old bastard robin was reading over my shoulder emma still resting on hers oh she said before she could get brave again i ran to the back of the zoo the centipede was just where it had been the first time half out of its cave the rear quarters concealed it saw me before i got there antennae twitching like electrified cables all the front legs pawing this time battling the air everythings relative including my willingness to go along with his little game i was about to leave when i noticed another difference about the large aquarium the entire tank was raised off the table resting on something more pieces of slate when id seen it a few nights ago it had sat flush i ran my hand along the surface of the table dust and chips moreland remodeling creating a miniature crawlspace it looked just wide enough to accommodate my hand as i extended my arm the centipede coiled as my fingers touched the edge of the slate platform the creature attacked the glass a cracking sound made me jump back the pane was intact but i could swear i heard the glass hum robin behind me now i tried again and once more the monster lunged kept lunging using its knobby head to butt the glass while snapping its body into footlong curlicues something oily oozed down the glass like that rattlerinajar game in old westerns i knew i was safe but each blow sent a jolt to my heart robin made a small high wordless sound i turned to see the spider doing pushups on her shoulder jammed my hand under the slate and kept it there the centipede kept hurling itself more cracking sounds more venomous exudate then something coarse and throaty i could have sworn was a growl came from inside the aquarium rising above the rain i groped hyperactively touched something waxy and yanked back the centipede stopped attacking tired finally it glared and started again crack crack crack i was back in the waxy thing felt inert but god knew predators pull it out stuck crack right angles more paper thicker than the card the centipede continued to tantrum and secrete i clawed the wax thing got a purchase with my nails and pulled hard enough to feel it in my shoulder the wax thing slipped out of reach and i fell back kept my balance and crouched eye to eye with the centipede separated from its maniacal thrusts by a quarter inch of glass that trembled with each impact its primitive face dead as rock then an infusion of rage turned it nearly human human like a deathrow resident the tank rocked i found the corner of the wax thing again pinched clawed scraped crack missed tried again it moved then resisted stuck to the tabletop taped the bastard hooking a nail under the tape i tugged upward felt it give one more yank and the damned thing came out thick wad of waxy paper the edges crumbling between my fingers as i stepped away as fast as i could robin followed me so did emmas black eyes crack crack the beast reared up against the lid trying to force it off noble in its own way i supposed a hundredlegged atlas fighting for liberation i could smell its fury bitter steaming hormonally charged another push the slate atop the lid bounced and i worried it would break the glass spotting a flowerpot at the end of the aisle filled with dirt i used it for ballast the centipede continued lunging the entire front of the aquarium was filmy with slime crack nightynight you prick taking robin by the hand i hurried back to the front of the insectarium stopping at a spot where the light through one of the broken windows was strongest then i realized emma was still with us why had i ever worried about her everythings relative time too morelands point nothing was what it seemed i unfolded the wax paper more pieces flaked off dry old dark paper black or deep blue oversized scored with light lines blueprints squares and circles semicircles and rectangles symbols i couldnt understand lines tipped with arrow points directional angles an aerial layout the rectangles and squares were probably buildings the largest structure on the south side nearby a round thing water waves within the front fountain the main house oriented i located the insectarium with its thirteen steps and central spine lots of small rectangles angling off like vertebrae the baths i found my office morelands the other outbuildings to the east a mass of overlapping amorphous shapes that had to be treetops the edges of the banyan forest a map of the estates center but what did he want me to see the longer i studied the sheet the more confusing it got networks of lines as dense as the streets on an urban map shapes that had no meaning words in japanese the original construction plans said robin can you make any sense of it she took the blueprints and studied them all those months at the jobsite in la reading plans she traced lines came to a stop maybe this guiding my hand to a rough spot a pimpling of the paper like braille pinhole i said right in the center of this building here his office and look at this leading out of the office she ran her finger along a solid line that continued off the paper due east out of his bungalow through the neighboring buildings past the border of the property straight into the banyans a tunnel i said or some kind of underground power cable she said flipping the sheet and examining the back this has to be it a circle had been drawn around the pinhole a tunnel under his office i said that explains the night i saw him go in there and turn the lights off he went underground she nodded hes got a secret hiding place and hes inviting us to see it she lifted emma from her shoulder talked soothingly to the spider and stroked its belly eight limbs relaxed and stayed that way as the animal was returned to its home pausing a moment robin smiled nothing like new friends i said careful or ill take her home with us i folded the blueprints tucked them in my waistband under my jacket and we edged out of the insectarium the rain had lightened a bit and i could make out the shapes of shrubs and trees nothing twolegged then i heard something from behind and froze scraping a tree branch rubbing against something we pressed ourselves against the wall and waited no human movement morelands bungalow was just a short walk under swaying trees off in the distance the main house was visible lights on pam and jo back we made a run for it the door was unlocked probably from pams initial search or had moreland left it that way for us doublesided key lock once inside i tried to bolt it with the key to my office and when that didnt fit the new one no go wed have to leave it open too and the lights off the door to the lab was closed morelands desk was clear as it had been this afternoon except for a single shiny object his penlight robin took it and we crouched behind the desk and shielded by wood spread the blueprints on the floor she shined the light on the plans the ink had run our hands were indigo yes she said definitely from behind there pointing to the lab door she gave an uneasy smile what is it all of a sudden i have visions of something disgusting on the other side i was just there and there was nothing but test tubes and food samples nutritional research or she said hes feeding something the lab looked untouched keeping the penlight low robin walked around pausing to consult the blueprints then resuming finally she stopped in the center of the room and stared puzzled at a blacktopped lab table with a cabinet below whatevers down there would have to start here a rack full of empty test tubes and an empty beaker sat on the counter i placed the glassware on a nearby bench then pushed the table it didnt budge wheels at each corner but they werent functional no sink so no plumbing but attached somehow to the floor i opened the cabinet below as robin aimed the penlight nothing but boxes of paper towels removing them revealed a metal rod running the height of the rear wall springs a handle i pulled down encountered some resistance then the rod lowered into place with a click the table shifted rolled and robin was able to push it away easily underneath was more concrete floor a fivebytwo rectangle etched deep seams a concrete trapdoor but no handle i stepped down on a corner of the rectangle pressed and removed my foot testing it the slab rocked a fraction of an inch then popped back into place giving off a deep resonant sound like a huge spinning top maybe it needs more weight said robin lets do it together no if moreland can move it by himself i can too i dont want to trigger it too hard and have it slam up in our faces i toed another corner a bit more give the slab bounced back again pressure on the third corner caused it to yield further and i caught a view of the slabs side at least half a foot thick more metal underneath some kind of pulley system moving to the fourth corner i felt myself being lifted and jumped off the slab rocked hard stopped then began rotating very slowly barely making a full arc before continuing until it was perpendicular with the floor it came to a halt shaking the floor i tried to move it locked into place rectangular opening four feet by two dark but not black distant illumination from below i got down on my belly and peered down concrete steps similar to those in the insectarium thirteen again but these were striped with green astroturf leading to grayness guess this is why they call spies moles i said robins smile was a faint courtesy she brushed wet curls away from her face and took a deep breath stepped toward the opening i blocked her and went in first the tunnel was seven feet high and not much wider tubular walls of reinforced concrete trowel seams marked by steel studs the light id seen from above came from a caged mining fixture wired to the ceiling forty paces in the distance the astroturf lay over dirt ending at a railroad track that bisected the tube narrow track with polished pine ties too small for a train probably designed for a handcar but none was in sight no rain sounds i touched the ground the soil was hardpacked and dry perfect seal rapping the walls produced no tone either the concrete had to be yards thick i told robin to wait and returned to the tunnels mouth the slab loomed like a gigantic stiff lip from down here the lab was a black hole i climbed the stairs tested the slab a second time just as immobile set into place by a mass of gears and counterweights responsive to a special series of pressures probably a safety feature installed by the japanese army to prevent crushed fingers or accidental imprisonment probably some way to close it safely from below but i didnt know it and we had no choice but to leave the entry exposed maybe the best thing was to get out of here and wait till morning i climbed back down to robin and offered her the choice weve come this far alex lets at least follow it for a while and see where it leads if it extends past the property line well be under the banyans land mines if there are mines you have doubts i said if you wanted to hide something what better way to discourage intruders than a rumor like that you want to test that hypothesis hes down here she gazed into the tunnel he clearly wants us there too why would he want to hurt us he wants me i said he brought me over for this whatever its important to him look at all the precautions he took cryptic messages voices of wise ones bugs hes like a big kid playing games hideandseek she said maybe im way off but i dont think hes a bad man alex just a secretive one i thought of moreland and hoffman and their wives playing bridge on the terrace hoffman cheating moreland never letting on all right i said lets play we walked along the track passing under the glow of the caged light and slipping into darkness a hundred paces later the glint of an identical fixture came into view then another the monotony became pleasant the tunnel was more pleasant than id imagined warm dry silent no bugs what do you think it was originally said robin an escape route for the japanese or some kind of supply channel we reached the second light and were nearly out of its glow when we saw something against the wall cardboard boxes scores of them piled neatly in columns just like the case files in the storeroom confidential files was this what moreland wanted me to see i pulled down a box the flaps were folded closed but unsealed inside ziplocked plastic bags dried fruit and vegetables i tried another carton more food a third contained pharmaceutical samples and bottles of pills antibiotics antifungals vitamins minerals dietary supplements then bottles of something clear tonic water the antimalarial properties of quinine another carton more dried fruit gatorade dr bills secret stash i said he grows stuff in his garden preserves it and brings it down here maybe were dealing with a survivalist the question is whats his armageddon robin shook her head and fished out canned goods from another box beef stew chicken and rice so much for vegetarianism i said she looked sad maybe armageddons the destruction of the island could be hes planning to stay underground under the forest i said protected by those mines real or phony its pretty nuts but there are bunkers full of folks just like that all over the states the problem is they also tend toward hairtrigger paranoia a lust for the big battle that doesnt seem like bill why because he says he despises weapons everything the mans said or done is suspect including his altruism aruk imports food at two three times the usual cost bill helps out with occasional handouts but stockpiles all this stuff for himself if hes been planning to go under for a while that would explain why he hasnt been more aggressive promoting business for the island maybe hes given up on aruk on reality maybe hes concentrating on creating his own little subterranean world came up with the idea after finding the blueprints somewhere in the house eventually he discovered the tunnel instant caveman she took something else out of the box a foil packet with a white label freezedried combat meal she read aloud segment b reconstituted carrots beets peas lima and string beans soya protein then a whole bunch of vitamins united states navy issue oh boy what the date tiny numbers at the bottom of the label february sixtythree was his last year in the navy i said he bought the estate that year hes been doing this for thirty years poor man she said hes obviously quite content damned proud of what hes accomplished why do you say that because now he wants to show it off six more ceiling lights two more large caches of food and medicine we kept walking automatically like soldiers drained of further conjecture track and ties slipping past hypnotically my watch said wed been underground nearly half an hour but it felt both longer and briefer times deceit another caged bulb then a patch of green just beyond another astroturf strip another flight of stairs fifty yards ahead thirteen steps up to a metal door no handles or locks i pushed expecting ponderous weight another tricky leverage system it opened so easily i had to stop myself from falling forward on the other side was an upsloping concrete ramp lit by a weak bulb we climbed till we came to yet another door metal grillwork radiating circles of iron crisscrossed by spokes beyond it total darkness i knocked and pushed but this one didnt give then my brain put the grill design in context a web what had moreland called websa beautiful deceit enough i turned to head back down the ramp saw the first door closing behind us rushed to catch it and failed it slammed shut refused to yield trapped in the ramp ensnared morelands thin face appeared in my head long loose limbs fleshy snout pouchy eyes loping walk arachnid walk not a camel or a flamingo predators robin put her hand to her mouth i stopped breathing panic became a tight necktie then light appeared behind the web letting in a draft of very cool air the same chill id felt coming over the walls from the banyan forest the webbed door swung open i saw walls of hewn stone then blackness a cave the choice was to stay there and risk another entrapment or step through and take our chances with whatever was on the other end i stepped through a hand settled lightly on my shoulder i spun around damn you bill but the eyes that stared back werent morelands dark slits at least the left one was its mate was a wideopen milkywhite crescent drooping heavily tugging at a ragged lid no iris the white was shot through with capillaries the face around the orb was white too the eyes lower than mine set into an elliptical neckless head that rested on meager sloping shoulders misshapen and hairless except for three patches of colorless down ridges of skin in place of ears a mouth opened less than a dozen teeth some of them no more than yellow buds framing them was a pouchlike puckered aperture no lower lip the upper one thick cracked liverish a smile why wasnt i screaming i smiled back the hand so light on my shoulder an inch of downy skin separated the mouth from a nose that was two black holes under a nub of pinkwhite flesh twisted like a pigs tail wens and scabs keloid tracks and crater scars danced across the face a moonscape in closeup a sharp smell fumed from the skin familiar smell hospital corridors antibiotic ointment the hand on my shoulder sat so delicately i barely felt it i looked at it four stumpy broadtipped fingers the thumb clubbish and spatulate no nail on the index finger more of that soft downy hair dimpled knuckles the wrist thin and frail laced with babyblue veins and scabbed heavily disappearing into the cuff of a white shirt clean white oxford buttondown khaki trousers cinched tight around a thin waist the cuffs rolled thick a man i supposed protruding from under the cuffs brown loafers that looked new a boysized man five feet tall if that maybe eighty pounds hhh he said hhhii whispery rasp id heard voices like that before burn victims the larynx and vocal cords seared learning to talk from the gut the pouchmouth stayed open as if struggling for speech more medicinal smell mouthwash the single eye watched my face the pouch twisted upward in what might have been a smile hi i said the eye studied me some more blinked winked no eyebrows but the skin above the sockets creased into deep dual crescents that simulated brows neckless chinless that congealedfat complexion but soft i thought of the baby octopus in the lagoon the hand slid off my shoulder the mouth closed and pouted sad had i done something wrong i tried smiling again the arm hung loosely very loosely an invertebrate grace fingers curling in ways that normal fingers couldnt serpentine no even a snake had more firmness white and flaccid wormlike he scratched a thigh a cuff rode up and i saw something shiny atop a loafer brandnew penny he saw something behind me and his head lowered shyly hi i heard robin say then i saw something behind him another man emerging from the shadows even smaller so severely hunchbacked his head seemed to protrude from his chest redandblack plaid buttondown blue jeans hightop sneakers two good eyes one ear the eyes soft innocent curling a finger he turned his back on us and stepped further into the cave the first mans forehead creased again and he followed we tagged along tripping and stumbling as our feet snagged on bits of rock the little soft men had no trouble at all gradually the cave turned from black to charcoal to dovegray to gold as we stepped out into a huge domed cavern lit by several more of the caged fixtures rock formations too blunt to be stalagmites rose from the floor a bank of refrigerators filled one wall ten of them smallish a random assortment of colors and brands avocado gold hues fashionable thirty years ago the wires met at a junction box attached to a thick black cable that ran behind a crag and out of the room in the center of the cavern were two wooden picnic tables and a dozen chairs shag area rugs were scattered over a spotless stone floor a whirring humming noise came from behind the junction box a generator the rain slightly audible now a tinkle but everything was dry moreland came in and sat at the head of the table behind a large bowl of fresh fruit he wore his usual white shirt and his bald head looked oiled his hands took hold of a grapefruit four more small soft people filed in and sat around him two wore cotton dresses and had finer features women the others were dressed in plaid shirts and jeans or khakis one of the men had no eyes at all just tight drums of shiny skin stretched across the sockets one of the women was especially tiny no larger than a sevenyearold they looked at us then back at moreland their ruined faces even whiter in the full light place settings before each of them fruit and biscuits and vitamin pills glasses of bright orange and green and red liquid gatorade empty bottles were grouped in the center of the table along with plates full of rinds and pits and cores the two men whod brought us stood with their hands folded moreland said thank you jimmy thank you eddie rolling the grapefruit away he motioned the men took their places at the table some of the others began to murmur deformed hands trembled moreland said its all right theyre good runny eyes settled upon us once again the blind man waved his hands and clapped alex said moreland robin bill i answered numbly im sorry to put you through such a rigamarole son and i didnt know youd be coming dear are you all right robin nodded absently but her eyes were elsewhere the tiny woman had engaged her visually she had on a childs pink party dress with white lace trim a white metal bracelet circled a withered forearm a childs curious eyes robin smiled at her and hugged herself the woman licked the place where her lips should have been and kept staring the others noticed her concentration and trembled some more the generator kept up its song i took in details framed travel posters on the walls antigua rome london madrid the vatican the temples at angkor wat jerusalem cairo more cartons of food lined up neatly across from the refrigerators portable cabinets and closets a couple of dollies so many refrigerators because they had to be small enough to fit down the hatch i pictured moreland wheeling them through the tunnel now i knew where hed gone that night with his black bag where hed gone so many nights all these years barely sleeping working to the point of exhaustion the fall in the lab a sink in the corner was hooked up to a tank of purified water gallon bottles stood nearby no stove or oven because of poor ventilation no the air was cool and fresh and the rain sound was faint but clear so there had to be some kind of shaft leading up to the forest no fire because the smoke would be a giveaway no microwave either probably because moreland had doubts about the safety worries about people whod already been damaged his lie about being part of the nuclear coverup a partial truth lots of partial truths right from the beginning hed swaddled the truth in falsehood events that had happened but in other places other times einstein would approve its all relative times deceit everything a symbol or metaphor the other quotes all for the sake of justice testing me i looked at the scarred faces huddled around him white wormlike joseph cristobal tying vines to the eastern walls hadnt hallucinated thirty years ago three decades of hiding punctuated by only one mishap one of them going stircrazy emerging aboveground and heading toward the stone walls cristobal sees is gripped by fright moreland diagnoses hallucinations lying to cristobal for justices sake soon after cristobal gives one last scream and dies just like the catwoman what had she seen please said moreland sit down theyre gentle theyre the gentlest people i know we squeezed out our soaked clothes and took our places around the table as moreland announced our names some of them seemed to be paying attention others remained impassive he cut fruit for them and reminded them to drink they obeyed no one spoke after a while he said finished good now please wipe your faces very good now please clear your plates and go into the game room to have some fun one by one they stood and filed out slipping behind the refrigerators and disappearing around a rock wall moreland rubbed his eyes i knew youd manage to find me with emmas help i said yes shes a dear times deceit including the deceit you used to bring me over youve been leading up to this since the first day i got here havent you he blinked repeatedly why now i said because things have come to a head pams up there looking for you scared to death i know ill tell her soon im sick probably dying nervous system deterioration neck and head pain things go blank out of focus i forget more and more lose equilibrium remember my tumble in the lab maybe that was just lack of sleep he shook his head no no even when i want to sleep it rarely comes my concentration wanders it may be alzheimers or something very similar i refuse to put myself through the indignities of diagnosis will you help me before theres nothing left of me help you how documentation this must be recorded for perpetuity and taking care of them we must figure out something so theyll be cared for after im gone he stretched his arms out youve got the training son and the character commitment to justice mr disraelis justice truth in action exactly there is no truth without action the great thinkers i said his eyes dulled and he threw back his head and stared at the caverns ceiling once upon a time i thought i might develop into a significant thinker shameless youthful arrogance i loved music science literature yearned to be a renaissance man he laughed medieval man would be more like it always mediocre occasionally evil he ruminated some more snapped back to the present licking his lips and staring at us robin hadnt stopped glancing around the room her eyes were huge truth is relative alex a truth that hurts innocents and causes injustice is no truth at all and an evasive action thats rooted in compassion and leads to mercy can be justified can you see that did the second nuclear tests take place near aruk because i know you lied about bikini if so how was the government able to conceal them no he said thats not it at all standing he walked around the table stared at the boxes against the wall nothing you do is accidental i said you told me about the nuclear blast and samuel h for a reason you held on to samuels file for a reason guilts a great motivator what are you atoning for bill putting his hands behind his back he laced his fingers long arms spidery arms i was in the marshalls during the blast he said perhaps thats why im dying looking down how have i lied you didnt participate in the payoffs i know i spoke to a man who did true he said so whats the point what were the blasts a metaphor for yes he said exactly a metaphor he sat back down retrieved the grapefruit rolled it injections son medical injections long slow nod well never know exactly what they used but my guess is some combination of toxic mutagens radioactive isotopes perhaps cytotoxic viruses things the military was experimenting with for decades whos they he jerked forward bony chest pressing against the table edge me i put the needle in their arms when i was chief medical officer at stanton i was told it was a vaccination research program confidential voluntary and that as chief medical officer i was responsible for carrying it out trial doses of live and killed viruses and bacteria and spirochetes developed in washington for civil defense in the event of nuclear war the ostensible goal was to develop a single supervaccine against virtually every infectious disease the paradise needle they called it they claimed to have gotten it down to a series of four shots provided me experimental data pilot studies done at other bases all false he took hold of the white puffs over his ears compared to the soft people his hair was luxuriant hoffman he said he gave me the data brought the vials and the hypodermics to my office personally the patient list seventyeight people twenty families from the base sailors their wives and children he told me theyd agreed to participate secretly in return for special pay and privileges safe study but classified because of the strategic value of such a powerful medical tool it was imperative the russians never get hold of it military people could be trusted to be obedient and they were showing up for their injections right on time rolling up their sleeves without complaint the children were afraid of course but their parents held them still and told them it was for their own good he pulled at his hair again and strands came loose when exactly did this happen i said the winter of sixtythree i was six months from discharge had fallen in love with aruk barbara and i decided to buy some property and build a house on the water she wanted to paint the sea she told hoffman and he informed us the navy was planning to sell the estate it wasnt waterfront but it was magnificent hed make sure we got priority a bargain price in return for conducting the vaccination program secretly he never stated it as a quid pro quo but he got the message across and i was eager to receive it blissful stupid ignorance until a month after the injections when one of the women whod been pregnant gave birth prematurely to a limbless anencephalic stillborn baby at that point i really didnt suspect anything those things happen but i felt we should be doing some monitoring pregnant women were included in the experiment he looked down at the table i had doubts about that from the beginning was reassured by hoffman when i reported the stillbirth he insisted the paradise needle was safe the data proved it was he bent low talking to the table that baby no brain limp as a jellyfish it reminded me of things id seen on the marshalls then one of the children got sick a fouryearold lymphoma from perfect health to terminally ill nearly overnight he raised his head his eyes had filled with tears next came a sailor grossly enlarged thyroid and neurofibromas then rapid conversion to anaplastic carcinoma its a rare tumor you generally only see it in old people a week later he had myelogenous leukemia as well the rapidity was astonishing i started to think more about the nuclear tests in the marshalls i knew the symptoms of poisoning whyd you tell me you were part of the payoff couching my own guilt actually i was asked by my superior to participate but managed to get out of it the idea of placing a monetary value on human life was repulsive in the end the people who did participate were clerks and such im not sure they had a clear notion of the damage craving confession for years wanting some sort of absolution from me but not trusting me enough to go all the way instead hed used me the way a defensive patient uses a brandnew therapist dropping hints exploiting nuance and symbol embedding facts in layers of deceit i suppose he said sounding puzzled i was hoping this moment would arrive eventually that youd be someone i could communicate with his eyes begged for acceptance my tongue felt frozen im sorry for lying to you son but id do it all over again if it meant getting to this point everything in its time everything has a time and place life may seem random but patterns emanate like a child tossing stones in a pond the waves form predictably something sets off events they acquire a rhythm of their own time is like a dog chasing its tail more finite than we can imagine yet infinite he wiped his eyes and bit back more tears i took robins hand after the other illnesses did you go back to hoffman of course and i expected him to become alarmed take some action instead he smiled thirty years old but he had an evil old mans smile a filthy little smile sipping a martini i said perhaps you dont understand nick something we did to these people is making them deathly ill killing them he patted me on the back told me not to worry people got sick all the time he gave a sudden hateful look a baby without a brain he said a toddler with endstage cancer that poor sailor with an old persons disease but he could have been dismissing a case of the sniffles he said he was sure it had nothing to do with the vaccines theyd been tested comprehensively then he smiled again the same smile he gave when he cheated at cards and thought he was getting away with it wanting me to understand that hed known all along id planned to conduct an autopsy on the baby the next day decided to do it right then but when i got to the base mortuary the body was gone all the records were gone too and the sailor whod been my assistant had been replaced by a new man from hoffmans staff i stormed back to hoffman and demanded to know what was going on he said the babys parents had requested a quick burial so hed granted compassionate leave and flown them to guam the previous night i went over to the flight tower to see if any planes had left none had for seventytwo hours when i got back to my office hoffman was there he took me for a walk around the base and began talking about the estate it seemed all of a sudden some other buyers had surfaced but hed managed to keep my name at the top of the list and to lower the price it was all i could do not to rip out his throat he put on his glasses instead he said the word tapered off he put a hand on his chest and inhaled several times instead i thanked him and smiled back invited the bastard and his wife to my quarters the next night for bridge now that i knew what he was capable of i felt i needed to protect barbara and pam she was only a baby herself but on the sly i began checking the others whod been injected most looked fine but a few of the adults werent feeling well vague malaise lowgrade fevers then some of the children began spiking high fevers he dug a nail into his temple there i was the kindly doctor reassuring them dispensing analgesics and ordering them to drink as much as they could in the hope some of the toxins would be flushed out but unable to tell them the truthwhat good would it have done what curse is worse than knowing your own death is near then another child died suddenly of a brain seizure another family supposedly flown out overnight and this time hoffman informed me my involvement with the paradise needle was terminated i was to attend to all base personnel except the vaccinated families new doctors had arrived for them three whitecoats from washington when i protested hoffman ordered me to begin a new project reviewing twenty years of medical files and writing a detailed report busywork sounds familiar he smiled weakly yes im a horrid sneak being direct has always been difficult for me i used to rationalize it as the result of growing up an only child in a very big house one wanders about alone acquires a taste for games and intrigue but perhaps its just a character flaw what happened to the rest of the vaccinated patients said robin more were growing ill and rumors had finally gotten out on the base about some kind of mysterious epidemic too much to keep secret so the doctors from washington issued an official memo an unknown island organism had infiltrated stanton and strict quarantine was imposed the sick people were all isolated in the infirmary and quarantine signs were nailed to the doors understandably everyone gave the place a wide berth then i heard a rumor that all the vaccinated families would be shipped back to the walter reed hospital in washington for evaluation and treatment i had a pretty good idea what that meant he pulled down on his cheeks i sneaked over to the infirmary one night after midnight one attendant was on guard at the front door smoking not taking the job seriously which was typical of the base nothing ever happened here everyone had a slipshod attitude i managed to sneak in through a rear door using a skeleton key id lifted from hoffmans office the smug bastard hadnt even bothered to put on a new lock reaching out he grabbed the grapefruit clawing so hard juice flowed through his fingers some of them he said softly were already dead lying in cots unconscious rotting others were on the verge of losing consciousness sloughed skin was everywhere limbs the room stank of gangrene he began crying tried to stop then to hide it it took a while before he resumed and then in a whisper bed after bed crammed together like open coffins i could still recognize a few of their faces no attempt was being made to treat them no food or medication or iv lines they were being stored the grapefruit a mess of pulp and rind the last ward was the worst dozens of dead children then a miracle some of the babies were still alive and looking relatively healthy dermal lesions malnutrition but conscious and breathing well their little eyes followed me as i stood over their cribs i counted nine he stood again and circled the room unsteadily i still dont understand it perhaps the relatively low dosage had protected them or something in their newborn immune systems or maybe there is a god wringing his hands he walked to the refrigerators and faced a coppercolored kenmore sometimes its good to be a sneak i got them out four the first time five the second swaddled in blankets so their cries would be muffled but it wasnt necessary they couldnt cry all that came out was croaking facing us the vaccine you see had burned their vocal cords he picked up his pace stalking an invisible victim i had no place to take them but the forest thank god it was winter winter here is kind warm temperatures dry id discovered the caves hiking had always liked caves smile secretive places used to spelunk when i was at stanford did a senior thesis on bats i didnt think anyone else knew of them and there was nowhere else to go what about the land mines i said he smiled the japanese had plans to lay mines but they never quite got around to it the night of the knives he nodded you spread the rumor i said i planted the seed when it comes to rumors theres never a shortage of gardeners where was i i placed them in a cave not this one i didnt know about this one or the tunnel once they were secreted i checked them over cleaned them up gave them water and electrolytes returned to the infirmary disassembled their cribs scattering the parts in the hope they wouldnt be missed and they werent the entire place was a charnel house corpses and dying people had slid onto the floor lying on top of one another body fluids dripping ill never forget the sound even now when it drizzles his face took on that absent look and for a moment i thought hed slip somewhere else but he started talking again louder then a complication one of the adults had survived too a man as i was finishing with the layettes he came in reaching for me falling on me i nearly died of fright he was putrid i knew who he was aircraft mechanic huge fellow enormously strong perhaps thats why the symptoms hadnt taken him over as rapidly which isnt to say he wasnt gravely ill his skin was pure white as if bleached one arm gone no teeth no hair but able to stagger he hadnt been a good man a bully really with a vicious temper id patched up men hed beaten i was worried hed have enough strength to somehow set off an alarm so i dragged him out too it nearly killed me even starved he must have weighed a hundred and eighty pounds it took so long to get him across the base i was sure some sentry would see me but i finally made it i put him in another cave away from the babies and tended to him as best i could he was shaking with chills skin starting to slough trying to talk and growing enraged at his inability he kept looking at the stump where his arm had been and screaming a silent scream rabid anger his eyes were wild even in that condition he frightened me but i calculated it would only be hours lurching toward a chair he sat i was wrong he lasted five days fluctuating between stupor and agitation hed actually get up and lurch around the cave injuring himself horribly but remaining on his feet his premorbid strength must have been superhuman it was on the fifth day that he managed to escape id been at the base got back that night and he wasnt there at first i panicked thinking someone had discovered everything but the babies were still in their cave i finally found him lying under one of the banyans semiconscious i dragged him back he died two hours later but not before joseph cristobal saw him i said he nodded the next day gladys came to my office and told me about joe one of the other workers at the estate had told her joe had a fit claimed to have seen some kind of forest devil a tutalo no he smiled i made that up too tootali is the old word for grub but theres no myth planting the seed i said so joes story wasnt taken seriously joe had always been odd withdrawn talked to himself especially when he drank what concerned me were his chest pains they sounded suspiciously like angina but with anxiety it was hard to know as it turned out his arteries were in terrible shape there was nothing i could have done youre saying the sighting had nothing to do with his death perhaps he said his condition was complicated by fright did you let him go on believing there were monsters he blinked when i tried to discuss it with him he covered his ears very stubborn man very rigid ideation not schizophrenic but perhaps schizoid i didnt answer what should i have done son told him hed really seen something and endanger the babies they were my priority every spare moment was spent with them checking on them bringing blankets food medicine holding them in my arms despite everything i did two of them got progressively worse but every night that passed without one of them dying was a victory barbara kept asking me what was wrong each night i left her a light dose of sleeping medicine in her bedside water helped shuttling back and forth never knowing what id find when i got there do you understand yes i said but all these years they havent come aboveground not unsupervised they havent they need to stay out of the sunlight extreme photosensitivity similar to what you see in some porphyric patients but they have no porphyria and ive never been able to diagnose never been able to find out what they were gi where was i looking baffled shuttling back and forth said robin ah yes after a week or so it finally got to me i fell asleep at my desk only to be shaken awake by a loud roar i knew the sound well a large plane taking off seconds later there was a tremendous explosion a navy transport had gone down over the ocean something about the fuel tanks the crash hoffman ordering gladys to prepare coquilles st jacques that night celebrating with the quarantined patients on board i said eliminating any witnesses the doctors from washington as well said moreland plus three sailors whod guarded the infirmary assigned as flight attendants and two medics my god said robin the patients would have died anyway said moreland most probably were dead when they loaded them on an airborne hearse but the doctors and the medics and the flight crew were sacrifices all in the name of god and country eh why werent you eliminated said robin he put his hands together and studied the table ive thought about that many times i suppose it was because i bought myself some insurance the day of the crash i invited hoffman over for drinks in my quarters no wives just us fellas in our snappy dress whites veddy dry martinis back then i was still indulging as he picked pimiento out of his olive i told him i knew exactly what hed done and had made a detailed written record that id filed somewhere very safe with instructions to make it public if anything happened to me or any member of my family that i was willing to forget the whole thing and move on if he was he bought that it was a theatrical little stunt i got the idea from one of those stupid detective shows barbara used to watch but apparently it did the trick he smiled and said bill your imaginations been working overtime pour me another one then he drank up and left for months i slept with a gun under my pillow dreadful thing i still hate them but he never moved against me the way i see it he decided to deal because he believed me and felt it was the easy way out evil people have little trouble believing everyone else lacks integrity the next day a sailor delivered a sealed envelope to my quarters discharge papers three months early and the deed to the estate excellent price including all the furniture the navy moved us in and we were provided with a year of free electricity and water the pretense continued even our bridge games continued along with his cheating i said his cheating and my pretending not to know thats as apt a metaphor for civilization as any isnt it he gave an unsettling laugh meanwhile my real life continued at night and any other time i could get away without attracting too much notice i hadnt discovered the tunnel yet and i hid a ladder so i could climb the wall the two babies whod deteriorated passed away as did another the first was a little girl named emma hers was the only name i actually knew because id treated her as a newborn for herniated umbilicus her father had made jokes about how shed look in a bikini and i told him that should be his biggest problem he looked ready to cry again managed to blink it away she died of malnutrition i buried her and conducted a funeral service as best i could a month later a second little girl left me bone marrow disease then a little boy from pneumonia that wouldnt respond to antibiotics the other six survived youve just met them whats their health status i said physically and mentally none of them have normal intelligence and they have no speech i taught myself the rudiments of iq testing administered the nonverbal components of the wechsler tests and the leiter they seem to fall in the fiftytosixty range though jimmy and eddie are a bit brighter their nervous systems are grossly abnormal seizures motor imbalance sensory deficits altered reflexes poor muscle tone even when i can get them to exercise then theres the photosensitivity the slightest bit of uv exposure eats up their skin even living down here hasnt managed to protect them completely you saw their eyes ears fingers extensive fibrosing probably something autoimmune the actual process isnt unlike leprosy theyre not in danger of imminent wasting but the erosion continues steadily theyre sterile a blessing i suppose not much libido either thats made my life easier i still dont see how youve managed to keep them down here all these years at first it was difficult son i had to confine them now its not a serious problem they may not be normal but theyve learned what the sun does to them half an hour outside and theyre in pain for days ive made every effort to provide them with as rich a life as possible here let me show you he took us to an adjoining room slightly smaller than the dining area beanbag chairs and homemade cases full of toys and picture books a phonograph connected to a battery pack next to it a stack of old s the top one burl ives singing childrens songs jimmy crack corn a model train set in disarray on the shag carpet some of the soft people sat on the floor fooling with the tracks others reclined on the chairs fingering dolls they greeted him with smiles and raspy cries he went to each of them whispered in their ears hugged and patted and tickled when he turned to leave one of them the larger woman took hold of his hand and tugged he pulled back she resisted giggles all around a familiar game finally moreland tickled her under the arm and she gave a silent widemouthed laugh and let go tumbling backward moreland caught her kissed the top of her head pulled a barbie doll out of the case and gave it to her look suzy movie star barbie look at this beautiful fancy dress the woman turned the figurine suddenly engrossed her features were saurian but her eyes were warm be right back kids said moreland we left the room and walked down a narrow stone passage how often do you come down here i asked optimally two to five times a day less frequent than that and things get out of hand his thin shoulders sagged it sounds impossible said robin its a challenge but i keep my other obligations to a minimum virtually no sleep no wife sending his own daughter away as a toddler allowing the island to decay his one recreation the insects a small world he could control studying predators in order to forget about victims we came to a third room six portable chemical toilets and two sinks attached to large water tanks outfitted with sterilization kits a cloth partition halved the space three latrines and one basin on each side cutouts of men pasted on the stalls to the left women to the right a strong wave of disinfectant moreland said ive toilet trained each of them it took some time but theyre quite dependable now next were the sleeping quarters three smaller caves each with two beds more books and toys piles of dirty clothes on the floor we still have a ways to go on neatness who does their laundry said robin we handwash everythings cotton they enjoy laundry time ive turned it into a game the clothes are old but good brooks brothers and similar quality brought in years ago in several boatloads i couldnt order too much at a time didnt want to attract attention come come theres more he led us back into the passageway it narrowed and we had to turn sideways at the end was another webbed door he saw me looking at it japanese ironwork beautiful isnt it on the other side was an exit ramp descending steeply its terminus out of view the door was fastened with an enormous lock the soft people confined forever moreland produced a key rammed it into the lock pushed the door open and the three of us walked to the bottom of the ramp sometimes when its very dark and i can be sure theyll behave themselves i take them up to the forest for nighttime picnics moonlight is kind to them they love their picnic time mentally theyre children but their bodies are aging prematurely arthritis bursitis scoliosis osteoporosis cataracts one of the boys has developed significant atherosclerosis i treat him with anticoagulants but its a bit tricky because he bruises so easily he stopped stared at us ive learned more about medicine than i ever believed possible do you have any idea of their life expectancy said robin moreland shrugged its difficult to say theyre deteriorating but theyve survived so many crises who knows with good care all or most of them will probably outlive me he leaned against the wall and that is the issue thats why i must arrange something for them why havent you gone public and gotten them care she said what would that accomplish dear subjecting them to the scrutiny of scientists and doctors scientists condemned them to this life how long would they last out in the monstrosity we call the real world no i couldnt allow that to happen but surely they theyd wither and die dear said moreland straining for patience he reached for the open door and took hold of one of the bars what they need is continuity a transfer of care his eyes moved from robin to me studying waiting i could hear music from the game room a scratchy record lou lou skip to my lou he said i want you to be their guardians once im gone im not a physician i said as if that was the only reason i can teach you what you need to know its not that difficult believe me ive been composing a manual you just pointed out how tricky it you can learn son youre a smart man raising his voice when i didnt answer he turned to robin bill she said hear me out he said dont close your minds please but why me i said give me the real answer this time i already have your dedication to you dont even know me i know enough ive studied you and now that ive met robin im even more convinced with two people sharing the challenge it would be how did you really find me bill coincidence or fate choose your nomenclature i was in hawaii taking care of some legal matters with al landau my hotel delivered the daily paper despite my aversion to what passes for news i skimmed it the usual corruption and distortions then i came across an article about a case in california a little girl in a hospital poisoned to simulate illness you helped bring the matter to resolution references were made to other cases youd been involved in abused children murders various outrages you sounded like an interesting fellow i researched you and learned you were a serious scholar bill please son listen intellectual vigor and humanity dont always go together one can be an a student but a d person and you have drive i need someone with drive and you dear youre his soulmate in every way i tried to find words the look on his face said no language existed that would work mind you im not proposing a oneway deal care for my kids properly and the entire estate and all my other property holdings on aruk will be yours in addition to excellent real estate in hawaii and california securities a bit of cash what i told you about my family fortune dwindling was true but its still substantial of course ill have to give a generous inheritance to pam as well as some stipends to trusted individuals but the rest would be yours once the kids are all gone you can see why i need someone with integrity someone who wouldnt kill them to get to the money i now trust you both of you when your duties are through youll be wealthy and free to enjoy your wealth in any way that pleases you robin said pams a doctor why dont you want her to take over he shook his head so vigorously his glasses fell off his nose retrieving them he said pams a wonderful girl but not equipped she has vulnerabilities my fault i dont deserve the title father she needs to get out in the world to find someone who values her the kind of relationship you two have but you will have assistance from ben ben knows i let him into my confidence five years ago the kids have come to adore him hes been a tremendous help taking shifts as my strength ebbs you dont want him to take over said robin i considered it but he has his own family my kids need fulltime parents singleminded isolated parents as hed been after barbara died and pam was sent away what he wanted was philosophical cloning i felt stunned and sick ben will continue to pitch in he said between the three of you the task is doable bens in no position to help anyone i said he will be once we get past this nonsense al landaus brilliant especially when defending an innocent man please accept my offer ive taken you into my confidence im at the mercy of your good graces he picked up robins hand and held it in both of his a womans touch he said it would be so good for them smiling now you know everything do we i said he let go of her hand whats the problem son the written report you threatened hoffman with does it exist of course where is it he blinked hard in a safe place if we progress youll know the precise location and you want us to believe its the only reason he let you live all these years he thumbed his chest and smiled im here am i not i think theres more bill i think hoffmans always known you wouldnt expose him because hes got something on you the smile evaporated he took a step up the ramp and ran his hand over the rough stone wall my guess is the two of you are locked together i went on like rams with tangled horns hoffman cant move in and destroy aruk overnight because you might expose him but hes still able to grind the island down gradually because hes younger than you confident hell survive you and eventually have his way and ill bet controlling aruks important to him on two levels the money from the development project and he wants to erase what he did thirty years ago from his mind no no youre giving him way too much credit hes got no conscience he simply wants to exploit for profit he turned around suddenly you have no idea what he has in mind for aruk a penal colony like devils island his mouth stayed open and he managed to work it into another smile very good how did you figure it out hes in with stasherlayman and in addition to instant slums they build prisons aruks location is perfect the dregs of society shipped and warehoused far far away with nowhere to escape very good he repeated very very good the bastard told me the details that night at dinner he wants to call it paradise island clever eh but theres more the waters surrounding aruk will be used to sink other dregs barrels of radioactive waste hes confident of receiving environmental clearance because of aruks obscurity and because once the economy shuts down completely and the islands depopulated therell be no one to protest nuclear dumpsite i said perfect complement to the prison toxic waters another escape deterrent if hoffman pulls it off he manages to fight crime and pollution on the mainland and pocket big cash payoffs from stasherlayman cute cute is not an adjective id apply to him different music drifted from the game room a woman singing this old man he plays two when did you first suspect he was involved when the navy started treating us differently ewings predecessor was no saint but he was civil ewing has the demeanor of an assassin did you know he was sent here as punishment for lewd behavior tied a woman down and took photographs from the moment i met him i knew hed been sent to punish aruk and that hoffman had to be behind it who else even knew about the place i wrote to him he never answered then ben caught creedman snooping in my files and i asked al landau to do some research he learned the skunk had worked for stasherlayman and what they were all about but i had no idea it was a dumpsite till hoffman bragged about it after dinner apologizing for not answering hed been so busy then that same smile were your letters threatening i said poo give me credit son i was discreet nuances not threats nuances that he ignored he said he hadnt wanted to put anything in writing thats why hed come personally whyd he invite all of us to dinner for cover but you notice that he got me alone thats when he boasted and made his offer to buy you out at a laughable price i refused and reminded him of my little diary what did he say he simply smiled if hes worried about the diary why cant you get him to stop the project i we negotiated he pointed out that stopping completely would be impractical things have gone too far to reverse whats already been done would call attention to aruk and you agreed to consider it because of the kids exactly though the bastard thinks its my own lifestyle i dont want jeopardized he grimaced youre right he and i are stalemated he doesnt want publicity and neither do i my only goal is to let my kids live out their lives in peace how long do they really have five years maybe six or seven hoffmans project will take years to complete even under the best of circumstances you know the government so hopefully he and i can achieve some sort of compromise ill sell off token bits of land to the government take my time delay things without seeming unduly obdurate the trading post and your other waterfront holdings he nodded and the money will be set aside for you two a compromise i said as you both let aruk die he sighed aruks been good to me but im an old man and i know my limitations priorities must be set what ive demanded from hoffman was to slow things down did he agree he didnt refuse the man coldbloodedly murdered six dozen people why would he give in to you because of my insurance i still dont understand why if you can ruin him you dont have more power he scratched the tip of his nose ive told you everything son he reached out to pat my shoulder and i backed away no i dont think so i said when you returned from talking to him you looked shellshocked not like someone whod negotiated a compromise hoffman reminded you about something didnt he no answer whats he holding over you bill he stepped further into the ramp first things first he said my offer first answer my question these things are irrelevant honestys irrelevant oh i forgot the truth is relative truth is justice getting into irrelevant areas that bring about injustice is deceitful this old man he plays ten all right i said youre entitled to your privacy i looked at robin she cocked her head very slightly toward the cavern goodbye bill he held me back please everything in due time please be patient his crinkled chin shook so hard his teeth knocked ill tell you everything when the times right but first i must have your commitment i believe ive earned it what im offering you would enrich your lives we cant give you an answer just like that he climbed further up the ramp meaning you think im mad and your answer is no lets get back and clear our heads you too pam needs to know youre safe no no this isnt right son leaving an old man in the lurch after ive flayed my soul open for you im sorry he clutched my arm why not just agree youre young robust so many years ahead of you think of what you can do with all that wealth his eyes brightened perhaps you could figure out a way to save aruk think of the meaning that would bring to your lives what else is there to life but finding some kind of meaning i removed his fingers from my arm the record in the game room had caught the old man playing ten over and over i was wrong he said behind me youre not the compassionate boy i thought you were im not a boy i said and im not your son the retort bursting out of me the same way it had out of dennis laurent the look on his face i felt like a bad son a maddening man mad or on the brink of it no youre not he whispered indeed youre not robin took my hand and we both left the ramp moreland watched us not budging after wed gone a few steps he turned his back on us robin stopped tears in her eyes bill she said just as sound came from the top of the ramp moreland looked and almost lost his balance another noise hollow metallic came from above just as he straightened then rapid muffled footsteps two figures in black rain slickers barreled down the ramp one grabbed moreland the other stopped for a fraction of a second then came toward us glossy wet slickers galoshes all that rubber buffed brighter by moisture like giant seals anders haygood splashed water on us as he waved the automatic his heavy face was calm the lower half shadowed by stubble wide mouth set gray eyes as dead as pebbles against the wall practiced boredom excops familiarity with rousting suspects he frisked me then robin she gave out a highpitched sound of surprise not reacting was agonizing from where i was standing i could see tom creedman with his grip on moreland from the way his fingers hooked it must have hurt but moreland wasnt showing it staring at creedman as if trying to snag his eyes creedmans face was rain specked and sweating his gun jammed against morelands rib cage the boys from maryland i said off on a south seas lark creedmans black mustache arced in surprise haygood flipped me around with a surprisingly light touch his cleft chin looked rough enough to hone a blade i smiled whyd you pull me over officer a muscle in his cheek jumped he put his gun against my heart and chucked robins chin his hand dropped lazily onto her chest brushing squeezing robins eyes closed haygood continued to touch her studying me i looked at creedman the water rolling off the top of his hat and into his eyes he flinched and haygood finally let go of robin never met a cannibal before i said who did the surgery or was it both of you fuck off said creedman haygood said chill but it was unclear who he was addressing creedman frowned but shut up the rain louder theyd opened some kind of hatch aboveground found the tunnel with the help of all the doors id had to leave open the slab sticking out of the laboratory floor theyd probably climbed down and walked some distance before figuring out where it led unable to broach the webbed door theyd retraced their steps made it over the wall and come in from the other end the rain blocked out the music from the game room i could still hear the nagging drone of the generator the boys from maryland i repeated reporter buys information from cop on a murder case gets them both fired reporter finds a job with stasherlayman and procures cop a position there too must be a close friendship creedman wanted to say something but a look from haygood silenced him haygood the pro he kept his gun steady while examining the cavern with all the passion of a camera youve done lots of cute things for the company i said so now you get a sunandfun assignment but does the home office have any idea you handled it by replicating the murder that got you into trouble in the first place slicing up women and pretending to eat them or maybe you didnt pretend you did say you were a gourmet cook tom what is this said haygood a bomb shelter or something if i know about maryland dont you think others do creedman looked at haygood haygood continued to inspect the cavern what they dont know i said is the part of it thats wishful thinking tom telling me it was a rapemurder when it wasnt a few problems in the potency area creedman turned red and tightened his grip on moreland haygood repeated a bomb shelter japanese supply tunnel said moreland my little sanctuary keeping his eyes away from the game room what do you have down here old furniture clothes a few books lets take a look theres nothing interesting anders lets take a look anyway haygood waved us forward with the gun and told creedman bring him over creedman poked moreland and the old man tripped forward you two out said haygood when theyd passed he looked down the narrow opening and frowned dont surprise me doctor you go in front tom anything happens kill the girl creedman didnt argue id have pegged him as the one in charge class snobbery haygoods police experience gave him the edge i thought back to the day wed arrived haygood on the dock butchering the shark with quiet authority haygood and skip amalfi was skip just a cover allowing haygood to come across as the aimless beachbum all along haygoods attitude toward him had been a mixture of patience and contempt watching amused as skip peed on the sand remaining in the background as skip harangued the villagers tolerating him the way you tolerate a dull sibling skip stupid enough to get sucked into a fantasy of running a resort the dream probably planted by haygood skip peeing in front of women had he also been involved in the cannibal murders probably not too unstable but he had served his purpose the night of betty aguilars killing fishing on the docks as haygood knew he did most every night there to hear bernardo rijkss cries of alarm rushing over to subdue ben haygood and creedman had murdered both girls first annemarie valdos on the beach a rehearsal for betty and setting up ben and the stimulus to local unrest that had justified the blockade then betty in victory park what had they used to lure her dope money one last fling before motherhood cutting her throat and carrying out the mutilation drawing ben out with a bogus emergency call then choking him out pouring vodka down his throat and positioning him with the corpse an excop would know how to pull off a perfect choke hold an excop would know about positioning corpses the park because it was secluded and a common spot for partying and because rijks the insomniac walked by every night even if rijks hadnt heard the moans he could have been led by a nightstrolling creedman not as neat but no reason for anyone to catch on because ben came from trash and betty had been promiscuous ben lying asleep on the carnage an absurd alibi skips outrage genuine hostile to moreland because his father resented the old man hed eagerly whipped up the villagers anger framing ben had killed three birds with one stone damaging moreland irreparably getting rid of his protégé and causing another deep rip in aruks social fabric hastening the exodus from the island hoffman and stasherlaymans war of attrition perhaps hoffman had decided to speed things up after coming face to face with the old man his stubbornness believing moreland cared about the island when all he really wanted was a few years of peace for the kids moreland willing to do anything to prevent hoffman from finding out about the kids willing to let aruk die buying time the two of them circling like wrestlers waiting for an opening still the same thing bothered me if moreland had that kind of power over hoffman why not bargain harder creedman stepped in front of me stay back the thin mustache was beaded with perspiration sure tom but when this is over share some gourmet recipes with me how about girl bourguignon creedmans nostrils opened from behind haygood cleared his throat and creedman grabbed moreland and cuffed him through the passage then he turned sideways and squeezed in himself when he was several paces ahead of us haygood cupped robins buttock squeezed and shoved go babe then the heel of his hand hit me in the lower back we filed out when the passage widened creedman stopped and haygood herded us into the center the dead eyes shifted as he heard something music from the game room the broken record removed something new asserting itself above the generator the wheels on the bus go round and round what the said creedman the game room was less than thirty feet away the door partially open haygood said whats with the music i like music said moreland as i said its my refuge kiddie music said creedman you are one buggy old fart his eyes brightened do you bring little girls down here to play moreland blinked hardly hardly creedman imitated maybe you bring kiddies down here to play doctor the doors on the bus go open and shut projection said moreland whats that a freudian term projecting ones own impulses onto someone else thats what you just did tom oh fuck off you selfrighteous bag of shit to us bet you didnt know dr bill here was once the ace pussyhound of the us navy bigtime stud chased everything in a skirt the younger the better remember those days dr bill chasing and bagging dark meat light meat any kind of meat just couldnt control your pecker could you drove poor mrs bill to oneway surfing moreland said nothing did nothing that blank look turned herself to shark chum said creedman because dr bill here couldnt stop playing doctor with the local pussy nice advantage that md knock some little thing up do your own abortion unlike you i said assault with a dead weapon creedman snarled haygood clicked his tongue and said check out all these doors maybe you should said creedman youre the expert haygood shrugged and pushed robin moreland and me close together backing away he said not the stomach the head and creedman raised his gun till it was half a foot from robins right eye any problems he said i want to see her brains on the wall he stepped back some more pausing a few feet from the entrance to the latrine then flattening himself against the wall the way cops do and inching toward the opening gun first waiting looking back at us waiting some more he peeked in took a long slow look the broad face puzzled moving to the next door just as carefully wait i said its rigged that door and the others hes got it boobytrapped haygood turned he is nuts i said stockpiling food and clothes and survival gear preparing for the end of the world id let you blow yourself up but hes rigged enough explosives to turn us all into soup that so said haygood tell him bill nonsense said moreland utter nonsense haygood thought a while what doors are you saying are rigged that one for sure i said the room where the musics coming from has a package of dynamite hooked up to the record player the cable runs into another room connected to a generator listen the drone hes got it set up so if the record arms lifted boom there are probably other traps too but thats the one he showed us ridiculous said moreland go take a look anders how about you go in there haygood told him turn off the music while i watch you moreland blinked id rather not why not because its silly said moreland come over here said haygood moreland ignored him come over here pissant moreland closed his eyes and moved his lips silently creedman took hold of his shirt and yanked him forward move you crazy asshole moreland passed within haygoods reach and haygood got behind him go he said shoving the old man moreland stumbled and stopped id rather not go or ill kill you sir id rather okay said haygood smiling at me thanks for the tip doc what else should we know about i wish i knew the driver on the bus says move on back fucking maniac said creedman lets shoot all of them right now and get the hell out of here anders i dont think so said haygood ordered by his bosses to keep moreland alive till the insurance policy was found hoffman going along with the stalemate for thirty years willing to wait a while longer thirty years of silence from moreland had convinced him the paradise needle had been forgotten so hed felt safe in refocusing his energies on aruk wanting to destroy the island depopulate it rebuild it in his own image moreland claimed it was simply greed but i doubted it i visualized hoffman at a dc power lunch with the brothers from stasherlayman soft money changing hands a discussion of potential sites for a multibilliondollar project with hoffman getting a chunk of the profits storing human garbage along with plutonium and cobalt and strontium the need for an isolated spot a remote place with no political constituency hoffman smiling and coming up with one finding out that moreland still lived on aruk but that the doctor was unable or unwilling to reverse the islands economic problems the population sliding the welfare checks coming in regularly what little commerce there was dependent upon the navy base send in the advance team creedman haygood the pickers probably others the goal hasten the decline and isolate moreland so that the old man would sell out cheap then moreland starts writing letters and the teams told to speed things up creedman and haygood coming up with a grisly touch perverse mastery over the case that had ruined their careers a side benefit slaking their own hatred for women the team lyman pickers plane crash an accident or had his big mouth offended the higherups haygood living on harry amalfis airfield had been in a perfect position to mess with the plane creedman the crash had taken place just after robin and i finished drinking with him outside the restaurant creedman and jacqui had both gone inside but after the explosion only jacqui had come out creedman not bothering because hed known someone else had known too jo opting out at the last minute opting out of the base dinner too to plant the roaches and now she was up there with pam okay lets get out of here said haygood pointing back to the rear ramp those boxes in the tunnel said creedman there could be something important in them they could also be rigged well check it out later i opened a few boxes i said all i saw was food and drugs and bottled water like i said hes planning for armageddon stop being so helpful said creedman it wont do you any good haygood said come on folks out he might have been guiding a tour he turned his back on the music room and began to herd us forward actually i said he does have some kids down here a strangled noise rose from morelands throat haygood stopped that so right in there i pointed to one of the sleeping areas haygoods eyes followed want to see before he could answer i shouted kids kids kids creedman cursed and haygoods hand tightened around his gun but he stayed calm and kept his eyes on the sleepingroom entrance nothing happened haygood smiled very funny sir onward then a small white face appeared in the doorway to the music room two others three four five six all of them openmouthed and wideeyed with wonder except the blind one he was making quick little circles with his hands lesions and scars bright as stripjoint neon haygoods calm finally shaken creedmans face lost its color oh shit he said and took his eyes off me i hit him hard under his nose grabbed for his gun as he went down but missed shoving robin out of the way i threw myself on top of him haygood wheeled around the soft people began croaking and rasping looking at moreland moaning that burnvictim moan moreland ran toward them haygood aimed his gun at the old mans back the soft people kept coming and haygoods bafflement gave way to revulsion and fear as he stepped back i had creedmans gun now and was punching blindly at his face haygood charged moreland shoved him to the floor kicked at his head aimed at me the soft people were between us i crouched low they kept coming at haygood and he struck out at them wildly as they cowered and moaned retreating closer to the door he believed was rigged to blow he stopped trapped confused brassy hair visible above the throng i pointed creedmans gun at it but i was an easy target too and he raised his gun arm high while fending off the soft people with his free hand i shifted sharply to the right trying to stay clear of the soft people so they wouldnt be caught in the middle haygood lost sight of me as he shoved and circled moreland got to his feet hurled himself at haygood haygood turned reflexively at the movement and fired morelands left arm turned red and he fell the soft people converged upon his prone form haygood looked for me but i was behind him i shot him five times his black slicker exploded he stood there for a second collapsed the soft people were all over moreland croaking and moaning as he bled robin was shouting my name and pointing creedman trying to get up holding his face blood gushed through his fingers one eye was swollen shut and his nose was already blackening i put the gun to his forehead he sank back down robin pressed herself against the wall staring at me all the blood moreland struggled to stand the wounded arm dangling dripping the other arm trying to shield the soft people they were entranced by haygoods corpse gray skin eyes really dead now dull and empty as the sharks gaping mouth leaking pink vomitus blood spread from under him settling in the crevices of the stone floor id turned him into a sieve i felt big as a building sick to my stomach id never owned a firearm never imagined killing anyone robin being there to see it morelands blood took me away from those thoughts his sleeve was dyed crimson and red drops hit the floor with a soft plunk he seemed unaware kept trying to calm his kids as robin ran to him he said its all right dear right through the muscle the latissimus and im leaking not spurting so the brachial arterys been spared probably the basilic vein ill be fine get me a clean shirt from the basket in there and ill staunch it he smiled down at the smaller of the men whod met us at the end of the tunnel a little booboo eddie daddys going to be just fine go help gordon pointing to the blind man who was up against a wall grimacing and threshing the air go eddie tell him everythings okay the little hunchback obeyed robin came back with a plaid shirt and moreland pressed it against his arm smiling at me he said wonderful bluff were a good team one of the soft women looked at haygoods body and started to whimper bad man said moreland bad bad man all gone sally hell never come back creedman gasped his face was ballooning i yanked him to his feet lets get out of here said robin theres still jo to consider i said where is she tom creedman stared at me more shock than defiance and his eyes were glassy had i hit him that hard i repeated the question he cried out in pain held his head started to go loose when i saw his eyes roll back i propped him up moreland had managed to quiet the soft people and was guiding them back into the game room despite the wound he looked revitalized play some more music kids how do the daddies on the bus go silence come on now the daddies on the bus go ee ee ee right read read readyou should read too itll make you smart go get some books down jimmy give everyone a book ill be right back he smiled closed the game room door bolted it from inside the music resumed all right he said eyes full of fear is there another way out besides the two ramps i said im afraid not so either way we could be walking into something but were trapped down here too said robin the longer we stay down the more dangerous it gets and youre still bleeding bill ill be fine dear taking the rear ramp i said will lead us into the forest and zero visibility so i vote for the tunnel moreland didnt argue i shook creedman back to consciousness holding him by the scruff i pushed him past the smaller rooms and into the large entry cavern his weight dragged the hand id pummeled him with was beginning to throb stay behind me i told robin and moreland if shes waiting for us at the hatch mr gourmet here will be her first course the return trip seemed a lot quicker moreland maintaining a good pace despite his age and his injury silent no attempts to convince us of anything the one time our eyes met his begged to let go forget about the things he hadnt revealed creedman was limp with dejection but conscious he tried to get me to do all the work and i had to shove him every other step the silence of the tunnel emptied my head until i thought of haygood perforated remembering what hed done to annemarie and betty helped the shark the molding of bleached white jaws nailed over the door trophies i didnt want one fifty feet from the hatch i ordered creedman to stay silent his face was so bloated that his eyes could barely open and his nose leaked filmy bloodstreaked mucus we reached the astroturfed steps and the open hatch the lab above was a square yellow sun someone had turned the lights on no choice but to go on motioning moreland and robin back i propelled creedman up one step at a time his rain boots squeaked but he kept quiet then as we approached the top he began to struggle a sharp jab of the gun in his back stopped him three more steps we waited quiet from above two more steps one no sign of jo we were in the room was just as wed left it except for the doorway to the front office a man sat there bound to a chair gagged thin scraggly gray beard spiked hair carl sleet the gardener whose voice had drawn ben to the park his eyes zoomed to creedman pupils constricted his fingers flexed below wrists secured to the chair legs with plastic ties the kind policemen used had haygood taken care of him first but no creedman looked as confused as i was i stood there trying to figure out what to do next jo appeared in the doorway hands up no weapon dont shoot she said cheerfully now how about i move my scumbag out of the way so you can get your scumbag through her gun sat atop the books on morelands desk well out of reach she produced something out of nowhere and held it up white card in a black leatherette holder next to a silver badge some sort of government seal on the card but i was too far away to read the small print wherere robin and dr moreland she said waiting for me to give them the okay i heard shots anyone actually hit moreland was wounded i heard six shots one then five more i said nothing she laughed and waved the card dont worry its genuine except for the name i stepped closer department of defense a numbered division that meant nothing to me jane marcia bendig senior investigator i stood there gripping creedman wishing i had three more arms and a weapon for each look i can understand your being wary she said but if i wanted to shoot you youd be dead i am a crack shot i didnt respond okay she said i can get in big trouble for this but would giving you my gun make you feel better maybe suit yourself she stepped back and i managed to keep my gun on creedman and pocket hers happy she said my laugh scared me ecstatic okay youre the guy in charge now why dont you give your friends the word moreland and robin came up jo said looks like that arm needs attention doctor im fine doesnt look fine to me youre not a physician carl sleet made a noise put a lid on it she said and sleet obeyed moreland said carl carls been naughty said jo pilfering petty cash tools your old surgical kit putting cockroaches in peoples rooms when he thinks no ones looking he tends to skulk around places he shouldnt be ive had my eye on him for some time tonight instead of leaving with the other members of the staff he stayed in one of the storage sheds thought he was watching me she smiled after i dropped pam off i went back and watched him some more did you know that you hum when youre bored carl not advisable when skulking sleet writhed in the chair she turned to me when you and robin showed up at the bug zoo he was off in the bushes watching you after you went in he waited then made a call from the lab phone right here his pals got over in a jiff probably waiting down the road outside the gates they left him here to stand watch went into the lab were gone for a long time and came back then they headed for the walls and that was the last i saw of them i decided to take carls place id like my gun now please i have others in my room but like i said i could get in real big trouble i hesitated pretty please she said in a harder voice i handed her the automatic thanks ill take custody of your scumbag now producing more plastic ties i gave her creedman and she bound his wrists behind him and moved him closer to carl sleet carl said moreland sadly sleet refused to look at him okay said jo lets get these losers locked up and see to that arm after all these years carl said moreland all these years carls been bearing a grudge against you doc or at least thats his excuse im sure the money they paid him didnt hurt a grudge said moreland sleet still avoided looking at him jo said something about a cousin who saw a monster and died of a heart attack carl says you told the guy he was crazy instead of giving him heart medication thats not true his arteries were clogged highly advanced athero you dont have to convince me freeing sleets limbs from the chair she stood him up placed him face to the wall and flipped creedman around in the same position did sleet say anything about calling ben to the park i said no i summarized bens alibi well she said im sure old carl will be forthcoming when he finds out what its like to be charged with multiple murder creedman stiffened and she said watch it can i assume some of the five shots went into haygood all five i said dead or did you leave him to bleed down there dead nothing worse than a bad cop she said even before he got busted in maryland he was a suspect in some burglaries he and mr creedman have been doing bad things for a long time who pays the bills i said stasherlayman you wont find their name on any checks all cash mr creedman here is the bursar haygoods really dead huh big smile for a split second then it was gone slip of professionalism something personal haygood monkeying with the plane your husband he wasnt my husband though we did have a relationship was he also he was a botanist just like he said keeping me company she frisked creedman i tried to talk him out of going up in that heap traveling with me was always tough for him okay lets put these morons somewhere safe and see to that arm does the tunnel lead all the way into the forest yes said moreland what do you keep down there dr m moreland didnt answer she frowned cmon im one of the good guys its a long story i said its a very long story we moved sleet and creedman to the house locking them in separate basement closets and put moreland on a sofa in the front room gladys ran in from the kitchen stared at the bloody sleeve and put her hand to her mouth hes been shot but its not serious said jo tell pam to bring her medical stuff gladys ran up the stairs and pam came rushing down seconds later carrying a black bag moreland waved at her from the couch hello kitten she suppressed a cry unsnapped the bag and crouched next to him oh daddy im all right kitten pulling scissors from the bag she began cutting away at the sleeve clean through the latissimus no arterial jo hooked a finger at robin and me as we left moreland called out my name i stopped thank you alex another beseeching look once in the living room jo took an armchair under barbara morelands beautiful sad face tell me whats down there said jo we did she tried to maintain her composure but each revelation knocked it looser when we were through she was pale unbelievable six of them down there all these years locked up for their own good said robin twilight zone unbelievable think hes crazy im asking you professionally now obsessive i said and a hero of sorts everyone else went down on that plane that plane they like plane crashes dont they must have somehow heard defense was sending someone here and figured it was ly all he wanted to do was see the trees bring some photos back for his pals but they assumed he was the agent me the tagalong top of everything else theyre sexist pigs cold laugh six of them she said crazy are they is there any danger going down there theyre harmless said robin but sick she described some of their physical anomalies jo said and what did he call this toxic injection the paradise needle she repeated it talk about a christmas gift for years weve been watching the financial angles but this is gorgeousmoreland actually kept records of the injections so he says her eyes sparkled these people theyre all retarded yes i said but not vegetables no more like small children any way they could testify in court i dont see how apart from mental incompetence they cant speak damaged vocal cords she winced still just the visual impact we can video them get moreland to list all their problems a whole other line of evidence thank you dr m are you after hoffman i said or the entire stasherlayman organization she smiled lets just say weve been working on this for a long time major financial angle the kind of thing that raises everyones taxes by a couple of bucks but the taxpayers never find out about ive got to go down there and see them with my own eyes start documenting im going upstairs to get my camera then id appreciate it if one of you would take me back i wouldnt approach them without moreland i said apart from what they just went through theyve got all sorts of physical problems sensitivities such as he mentioned sunlight there may be others what does sunlight do to them destroys their skin my flash isnt uv at the least theyll panic when they see you theyve been down there so long lets hold off till were sure we cant hurt them she thought all right but ive got to see this if hes right about the arm only being a flesh wound he should be able to take me himself she tapped her leg very fast checked her watch and stood lets go see how hes doing his whole purpose in life all these years has been sheltering them said robin hes not going to use them i understand the mans got principles but things change you have to adapt a strand of hair looped over one eye and she shoved it away the gun was in her waistband she ran a finger over the butt things change quickly morelands arm was bandaged and it rested on his chest a thermometer protruded from his mouth pam read it a hundred are you comfortable there daddy or should we try to get you up to your bed this is fine kitten he saw us i used to call her that when she was little pams look said it was another lost memory she snapped her doctors bag shut howre we doing said jo i thought of how shed waited upstairs knowing we were down there with creedman and haygood using us but id just shot a man in the back and there was no anger left in me ill survive said moreland he stole a glance at me jo said i know about what youve got down there dr moreland whenever youre ready to show it to me hes not going anywhere said pam its something of an emergency a lots at stake right doctor moreland didnt answer what are you talking about said pam its complicated said jo i think i can help your father in a big way if he can help me whats going on daddy moreland held out a hand to her and grasped her fingers shes right it is complicated kitten i should get down there down where moreland blinked pam said whos she to tell you what to do daddy no answer who are you jo jo flashed her badge pam stared at it long story said jo come with me for a sec she put her arm around pam just as shed done a few hours ago pam shook her off angrily im not leaving him alone its fine said moreland thank you for taking care of me go with her please for my sake i dont understand daddy robin said moreland could you go along and help explain things robin said sure why cant you tell me daddy i will kitten all in due time but right now i need some rest go with them please darling the three women left and moreland beckoned me closer the rain was hitting the picture windows sharply like buckshot on metal he stared up at me chewed his lip blinked your questions down there about what hoffman had over me the things creedman said about me down there theres some truth to them moving with difficulty he faced the back of the sofa i was a different man back then alex women having them meant so much to me forcing himself to face me he said ive made mistakes big ones i know dennis thinks the man who died at sea was his father but hes wrong he tried to speak couldnt im not judging you bill though the room was dim i could see dark spots on the white couch spots of his blood his eyes were sunken and dry when did you figure it out you paid for denniss schooling bens too but ben gave you something in return and you got upset about dennis and pam getting close so upset you spoke to jacqui about it and she called dennis off i didnt think you were a racist then after what creedman said it made sense it must have been hard since pam came back oh he said more exhalation than word as a father im a disgrace theyve both turned out better than i deserve i sent pamela away because i didnt couldnt cope after barbara died propping himself up no thats not all of it i sent her away because of the guilt about jacqui and the others many others i did serve as my own abortionist barbara had never been a happy woman i made her miserable he sank back down again the bastard was right i was a repugnant lecher lecher with surgical training but jacqui refused to terminate barbaras death made me realize how could i hope to raise a daughter and you already had kids he closed his eyes i put the needle in their arms my life since thens been a quest for redemption but i doubt im redeemable jacqui was such a beautiful thing barely eighteen but mature i was always hungry not that its an excuse but barbara was a lady she had different drives a woman alone on the sand the day before she died it was the baby that drove her to it he said the fact that id actually let it get that far how did she find out someone told her hoffman had to be he and barbara were chums bridge partners a younger man paying her attention so barbara went along with his cheating he smiled i suppose she can be forgiven that tiny revenge did their playing go beyond bridge i truly dont know anythings possible but as i said barbara wasnt inclined to the physical toward the end she hated me fiercely and she always liked himfound his interest in cuisine and tailoring charming then why did he tell her about jacqui to wound me after our dinner at the base we spoke of several things including the fact that hed seen barbara in honolulu the day before she died he took the picture i showed you id never known it was mailed from her hotel compliments of the manager id always thought it a courtesy did she go to honolulu to be with him he claimed not that their running into each other was a coincidence at the hotel bar he was there on navy business maybe its true barbara did like to drink he told her about jacqui and dennis she cried on his shoulder about my whore and my little bastard shattered was his exact word then he smiled that smile but how did he find out back in those days i was less than discreet discretion wasnt part of being a firstrate cocksman so hoffman or a member of his staff could easily have heard something or even seen something there was an empty hangar on the north end of the base little unused offices we officers used to be with girls from the village play rooms we called them mattresses and liquor and portable radios for mood music we still thought of ourselves as war heroes entitled did hoffman bring girls there not that i saw his only lust is for power and when jacqui gave birth to a fairhaired baby he figured it out a beautiful baby a beautiful woman was it only aruk you fell in love with bill he smiled jacqui and i shes a very strong woman independent over the years weve reached an understanding a fine friendship i believe its been good for both of us thinking of the oil over the mantel i said strong unlike your wife did barbara have a history of depression he nodded shed been chronically depressed for years taken shock treatment several times in fact the trip to hawaii was for her to consult yet another psychiatrist but she never showed up for her appointment probably spent her time drinking with hoffman instead he sensed her vulnerability told her what id done and the next morning she walked into the ocean some of his weight shifted onto the wounded arm and his breath caught i helped him find a comfortable position so you see thats the hold he has over me keeping it secret from pam i killed her mother and so did he in that sense we are partners rams locking horns just as you said beautiful analogy my friend are you offended by my thinking of you as a friend no bill all these years ive yearned to expose him convinced myself the reason i havent done it is the kids safety then tonight you began asking questions and i was forced to confront reality i acquiesced because i knew it would ruin pam i sent her away because i was overwhelmed and guilty but also because i didnt want her here on the chance that she and dennis so what happens she comes back and it starts he grabbed my arm and held tight what do i do theres no escape tell her how can i in due time youll be able to men have mistreated her because i abandoned her shell despise me give her some credit bill she loves you wants to get closer to you being unable to is the biggest source of her pain he covered his face it never ends does it she loves you i repeated once she realizes the good things youve done gets to really know you she may be willing to pay the price the price he said weakly everything has its price the microeconomics of existence he looked up at me is there anything else you need to know not unless theres something else you want to tell me long silence the eyes closed his lips moved incoherent mumbles whats that bill terrible things he said barely louder time deceives youve made mistakes i said but youve also done good ever the shrink his face contorted and i took his cold limp hand bill terrible things he repeated then he did sleep it was a big beautiful room in a big beautiful hotel one glass wall looked out to white beach and furious surf yesterday id seen dolphins leaping the three walls were koa panels so densely figured they seemed to tell a story crystal chandeliers hung above black granite floors up in front was a banquet table laden with papayas and mangoes bananas and grapes and thick wet wedges of the kind of orangeyellow honeysweet pineapple you get only when you harvest it ripe sterling silver coffeepots were set every six feet their shine bluewhite other tables too round seating ten interspersed around the hall hundreds of men and a few women eating and drinking coffee and listening robin and i watched it on tv from a suite upstairs room service and suntan lotion and every newspaper and magazine we could get our hands on here he goes she said hoffman stood up at the center of the big table dressed in a mocha suit white shirt and yellow tie a banner at his back he talked paused for applause smiled the banner said pacific rim progress a new dawn another oneliner laughter he continued talking and smiling and pausing for applause then he stopped and only smiled something changed in his eyes a shuttersnap flicker of confusion if i hadnt been looking for it i probably wouldnt have noticed if i hadnt been looking for it i wouldnt have been tuned to cspan the camera left him and swung to the back of the room a tall gaunt old man in a brandnew charcoalgray suit walked toward the front next to him walked a woman id known first as jo picker then as jane bendig officiallooking in a navyblue suit and highnecked white blouse for the last three days shed worked nearly twentyfour hours a day the easy part using tom creedmans computer to send bogus messages by email the hard part convincing moreland he could redeem himself the doctors and psychologists at the medical center had helped some examining the kids with care and compassion assuring the old man they were clinicians not technocrats jane shared her grief with him talked numbers morality absolution eventually she just wore him down now he walked ahead of her behind the two of them six men in blue suits flanked a massive black thing like pallbearers black thing with legs a shuffling variant of the circus horse stirring and confusion at the other tables too moreland and jo kept marching the black cloth seemed to float in midair some men next to hoffman began to move but other men stopped them zoom on hoffmans face still smiling he mouthed something an order to a man standing behind him but the man had been restrained moreland reached hoffman hoffman started to speak smiled instead someone shouted whats going on and that seemed to shake hoffman out of it im sorry ladies and gentlemen this mans quite disturbed and hes been harassing me for quite a the men in blue suits flicked their wrists and the black cloth seemed to fly away six soft misshapen people stood there hands at their sides placid as milksated babies ruined skin highlighted mercilessly by the chandelier the doctors at the medical center had established that only uv was a threat the black sheet protecting them from the stares of gawkers gasps from the room the blind one began bouncing and waving his hands staring up at the light with empty sockets my god said someone a glass dropped on the granite and shattered two bluesuited men took hold of hoffmans arms moreland said my name is woodrow wilson moreland im a doctor i have a story to tell hoffman stopped smiling a few days later on the plane back to la it hit me firstclass flight seats like club chairs the defense departments generosity allowing spikes crate a seat of its own dinner had been salmon stuffed with sole mousse id indulged in half a bottle of chablis and fallen asleep robin had finished only a third of a glass but shed drifted off too now her head was heavy on my blanketed shoulder sweet sleep but i came out of it thinking about haygood who hed been as a child was there a mother out there whod mourn him stupid thoughts but inevitable i tried to shake myself out of it thinking of the good id been part of ben freed some limited hope for aruk the kids liberated and well cared for moreland hospitalized too and evaluated no alzheimers no obscure neurological disease just an exhausted old man id visited him an hour before we left he hadnt told pam or dennis yet holding back his entire life after the paradise needle a struggle against impulse heroism thrust upon him hed reinvented himself a thirtyyear transformation from a cruel womanizer to the patron saint of aruk but yet he felt guilty other sins things for which there was no atonement as id left his hospital room hed called out time deceives the same thing hed told me as he bled on the white couch another confession is there anything else you need to know cold hands still afraid not unless theres something else you want to tell me a long silence before hed closed his eyes and mumbled terrible things time deceives offering himself to me defenses down his world unraveling the first time id comforted him instead of pursuing it the second time id just kept walking not wanting to know terrible things times deceit his unique brand of deceit presenting a veiled truth while changing time and context telling me about cannibal cargo cults because he suspected annemaries death had been part of a moneydriven conspiracy recounting the nuclear blast because hed been part of another technological horror discussing joseph cristobals vision and a tutalo because he yearned to unload the secret of his kids and something else the first case hed discussed with me moments after wed met discussing in great detail but unable to locate the file because thered never been a file the catwoman a lovely lady sweet nature clean habits thirty years old her mother was morose abused and humiliated by a philandering husband forced to watch him make love to another woman the husband dead years later eaten away by lung cancer a ravaged chest im all right kitten kitten kitten i used to call her that when she was little pam not remembering sent away too young to remember anything but moreland remembered everything hed exiled her to the best schools turned her into an orphan whod become a woman demeaned by men marrying a philandering abuser turning off sexually humiliated had she too watched her husband rut with a lover those sad eyes driven to depression to the brink of suicide shed admitted to robin so fragile her therapist searched for family support located and phoned moreland to pams surprise he flew to philadelphia offered a shoulder to cry on and more had she told him the details of the humiliation or had he assigned one of his lawyers to find out the facts little kitten pouring her heart out to daddy the truth torturing daddy because of his guilt about sending her away guilt about having once been exactly the kind of man who hurt her a few days later the philandering husband dies in a freak accident falling barbell ravaged chest and kitten returns to her birthplace is there anything else you need to know not unless theres something else you want to tell me had moreland stalked the young surgeon or had he hired someone to make things right he was a wealthy man with the means to arrange things the obsessives talent for rationalizing extreme measures the barbell hovering over that arrogant chest the man whod hurt his kitten so deeply or maybe it had been an accident and i was letting things get away from me terrible things hed said had to be id never know did i care at that moment i did maybe one day i wouldnt robins breath reached my nostrils hot tinged with coffee and wine a pretty darkhaired flight attendant smiled as she walked
