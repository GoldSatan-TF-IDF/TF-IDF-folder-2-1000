harry turtledove west and east chapter theo hossbach lay on a cot in a military hospital in cambrai all of him was fine except for the last two joints on the ring finger of his left hand he wouldnt see those again until and unless what the resurrection of the flesh preachers liked to talk about turned out to be the straight goods theo doubted ittheo doubted almost everything people in authority saidbut you never could tell one thing theo didnt doubt was that he was lucky to be there or anywhere along with the commander and driver hed bailed out of a burning panzer ii theyd all run for some bushes a couple of hundred meters away hed made it ludwig and fritz hadnt it was about that simple the bullet that amputated those last two joints came later he didnt know whether it was aimed at him in particular or just one of the random bullets always flying around a battlefield the one by beauvais seemed to have had more of them than most theo might have been prejudiced hed never had to bail out of a panzer before or he might not have been the french and english had stopped the wehrmachts drive at beauvais and it hadnt got started again this made two wars in a row where the schlieffen plan didnt quite work hitlers generals came closer to pulling it off than the kaisers had but what was that worth a nurse came by she took his temperature normal very good she said as she wrote it down do you need another pain pill yes please he answered those two missing joints seemed to hurt worse than the stub he had left phantom pain the doctor who cleaned up the wound called it he could afford to dismiss it like that it wasnt his hand here the nurse gave theo the pill watched while he swallowed it and wrote that down too he figured it was codeine it made him a little woozy and it constipated him it also left him less interested in the nurse who wasnt bad looking than he would have been if he werent taking them every four to six hours but it pushed away the pain both real and phantom most of the soldiers in the ward with him had nastier wounds most but not all the fellow two beds down wore a cast on his ankle because hed tripped over his own feet and broken it i wasnt even drunk he complained to anyone whod listen just fucking clumsy woozy turned to drowsy theo was dozing when hearing his own name brought him back to himself the nurse was leading a captain over to his cot the pink waffenfarbe on the mans totenkopf collar patches and edging his shoulder straps said he was a panzer man too you are uh theodor hossbach he said theodosios hossbach sir theo said resignedly how was he supposed to explain that his father had been slogging through a translation of gibbons the decline and fall of the roman empire at just the wrong time he got the panzer captains attention anyhow theodosios well well no wonder you go by theo no wonder at all sir theo agreed you are a radio operator you are familiar with the operation of the fu radio set yes sir theo knew he still sounded resigned every panzer in the wehrmacht used the fu except commanders vehicles which carried the longerrange fu if he was a panzer radioman hed damn well better know how to use the standard set a pfennigs worth of thought was evidently too much to hope for then the captain got to the point can you return to duty a radio operator in a panzer ii is not required to do much with his left hand that was true and then again it wasnt a radioman didnt need to do much with his left hand to operate the radio when it came to things like engine repairs or remounting a thrown track though theo knew he could have said no his hand was swathed in enough bandages to wrap a christmas present or maybe a mummy he hesitated no more than a heartbeat as long as they give me a jar of those little white pills sir im good to go they will the captain said with a glance toward the nurse that warned someones head would roll if they didnt youll have it by the time i come back for you in half an hour or so a couple of other fellows here i want to scoop up if i can a doctor gave theo the codeine and a reproachful look you should stay longer youre nowhere near healed ill manage theo said im sick of laying around lying the doctor said automatically no sir im telling the truth right the doctor looked more reproachful yet theo hadnt thought he could maybe were lucky to get rid of you maybe you are most of me doesnt need the bedonly my hand when the panzer captain came back for theo he had one other fellow who walked with a limp in tow and a discontented expression on his face the last guy i want is shirking he growled id bet my last mark on it even if i cant prove it well i just have to make do with you two lets go theyd laundered theos black coveralls putting them on again did feel good the other panzer crewman whose name was paul seemed to feel the same way once he had the black on he stood taller and straighter and seemed to move more fluidly the captain bundled them both into a citroen hed got somewhere or other and headed west they drove past and through the wreckage of a nearly successful campaign dead panzersgerman french and britishlittered the landscape along with burntout trucks and shotup autos here and there german technicians salvaged what they could from the metal carcasses just outside of mondidier the captain stopped you boys get out here he said were regrouping for a fresh go at the pigdogs theyll fit you into new crews whatll you do sir theo asked head for another hospital and see how many men i can pry loose there the officer answered the more the better we can use experienced people god knows theo felt shy about joining a new crew hed spent his whole military careerhed spent the whole warwith ludwig and fritz theyd understood him as well as anybody did theyd put up with him if another driver and commander had lost their radioman he made a sour face hed feel like a woman marrying a widower and trying to live up to the standard his first wife had set to his relief he didnt have to do that the personnel sergeant assigned him to what would be a brandnew crew the commander was a sergeant called heinz naumann he had bandages on his neck and his left handand maybe in between too burns getting better he said laconically on his coveralls he wore the iron cross first class and a wound badge sooner or later theo knew a wound badge would also catch up with him by contrast the driver was just out of training his coveralls werent faded and shapeless you could cut yourself on their creases he was a big fellow with dark hair who moved like an athlete his name was adalbert stoss theo was from breslau way off in the east naumann came from vienna stoss hailed from greven a small town outside of munster its a wonder we can understand each other he said with a grin grin or not he wasnt kidding as far as theo was concerned stoss and naumann had different strange accents they probably thought he talked funny too well manage heinz said oh sure adalbert went on grinning he seemed happy as could be to have escaped basic and come out to join the grownups ator at least nearthe front theo had seen that reaction before most of the time it wore off as soon as the rookie saw his first body with the head blown off training was hard work to say nothing of dull but you hardly ever got killed there in real war on the other hand i was hoping theyd give me a panzer iii naumann said but noits another ii he eyed theos bandaged finger you arent complaining though are you not right now theo allowed in a panzer iii the radioman sat up front next to the driver he also served a hullmounted machine gun that wouldnt be much fun with a bad hand then again a panzer iii now thats a real fighting machine i know i know thats why i wanted one the sergeant said along with two machine guns a panzer iii mounted a mm cannon unlike the panzer iis mm gun which fired only armorpiercing ammo the bigger weapon had highexplosive shells too that made it a lot more useful against infantry out in the open a panzer iii also carried thicker armor and boasted a more powerful engine a panzer iii was a real panzer a panzer ii was a training vehicle oh you could fight with it the wehrmacht had been fighting with it and with the even smaller lighter panzer i ever since the fuhrer gave the order to march into czechoslovakia more than six months ago now but it would be nice to have a fighting vehicle that matched the ones the enemy used would have been nice panzer iiis were still scarce while there were lots of iis and even these days quite a few little obsolete is there were also panzer ivs which carried a shortbarreled mm gun and were designed to support infantry not to attack enemy armor there were supposed to be panzer ivs anyhow theo didnt think hed ever seen one i know what im doing in a ii stoss said they never let us drive a iii in training most of the practice we got was in those turretless panzer i chassisyou guys know the ones i mean theo nodded so did heinz naumann what you used in training was as cheap as the wehrmacht could get away with and still do the job theo doubted whether any panzer iiis were within a hundred kilometers of a training base you didnt practice with those babiesyou got them into the fight eager as a puppy adalbert asked you know where theyre going to throw us in sergeant nope naumann answered far as the generals are concerned were just a bullet point us at the enemy and we knock him over or he knocks us over theo remembered the antitank round slamming into his old panzer iis engine compartment he remembered opening his escape hatch and seeing nothing but flames hed followed his panzer commander out the turret hatch instead ludwig hadnt made it much farther theo hadwhich didnt stop that bullet from finding him a little later on the new panzer ii looked like the one that had burned theos station was behind the turret just in front of the bulkhead that separated the fighting compartment from the one housing the engine he couldnt see out the smells were familiar oil gasoline cordite leather metal sweat he didnt smell much lingering fear which argued that this panzer hadnt seen a lot of action he started fiddling with the radio no matter what the manufacturer claimed every set was different heinz naumann said something theo ignored it indeed he hardly heard it like the radio he was good at tuning out anything that didnt directly concern him sometimes he tuned out things that did concern him naumann spoke again i said is it up to snuff uh it seems to be theo came back to the world good pay some attention next time all right whatever you say sergeant theo answered ludwig had tried to keep him connected too sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt when theo got interested in a radio or in whatever was going on inside his own head everything else could go hang they motored west toward the front the next morning naumann rode along standing up with his head and shoulders out of the turret that was how a panzer commander was supposed to do things when not in combat a lot of commanders looked out even when their machine was in action the vision ports in the turret just didnt let you see enough there was talk of building a panzer ii with a proper cupola for the commander the panzer iii had one so did a lot of foreign panzers not the ii not yet theo had another reason for liking the way heinz did things with the hatch open some of the mild spring air got down to him then a bullet cracked past naumann the commander dove back inside the turret faster than you could fart panzer halt he shouted halting adalbert stoss said and hit the brakes instead of using the traversing gear heinz manhandled the turret into position with the two handgrips on the inside the machine gun snarled several short bursts at something at somebody theo couldnt see out so except for the gunshot he had no idea what was going on not counting his earphones the radioman on a panzer ii was always the last to know maybe i got him maybe not sergeant naumann muttered then he spoke into the tube that carried his voice to adalberts seat forward forward ja stoss agreed as the panzer got moving again the driver asked a soldier behind our lines or a franctireur dont know i never saw enough of him to tell whether he had a uniform heinz said after a pause for thought he added sounded like a military rifle thoughnot a little varmint gun are the frenchies trying to infiltrate us that wouldnt be so good adalbert said no it wouldnt heinz thought some more then he said hossbach report this back to regimental hq if its not just one guy with a gun the higherups need to know about it were in map square k just west of avrigny got that k west of avrigny theo repeated he sighed as he made the connection and delivered the message ludwig had always been on him because he was happier with his own thoughts that with the rest of the world now naumann had figured out the same thing in about a minute and a half theo would have liked to do something about that but doing something about it would have involved changing and he didnt care to change his panzer commanders would just have to cope with it and so would he from greasy to messy staff sergeant alistair walsh nodded in weary approval the anglofrench counterattack pushing east from the outskirts of paris was still making progress greasy was actually the hamlet of gressy a few miles west of where walsh was now where walsh was now was in messy which looked exactly the way its name made you think it would messy had good reason for looking that way only a few weeks earlier the germans had bombed and shelled the place to chase the allied defenders back toward paris and then after the german attack ran out of steam both here and up near beauvais english and french guns pounded messy to push back the boches a few buildings were still standing and didnt seem too badly damaged but that wasnt from lack of effort on either side hardly anyone lived in the ruins people who could get out had done so before the germans arrived they hadnt come back to reclaim whatever might be left of their homes and property a lingering sicksweet stench said not everybodyd got away or walsh might have been getting a whiff of dead germans after three days everybodyand every bodysmelled the same as much to blunt the reek as for any other reason walsh lit a navy cut beside him second lieutenant herman cavendish looked around and said so this is victory walsh hadnt liked the subaltern ever since cavendish brought the first order to counterattack the anglofrench strike had worked which didnt make the veteran noncom like the very young officer any better sir when you set this against it looks like a rest cure walsh said maybe cavendish had been born in maybe not if he had he was still making messes in his nappies he hadnt seenor for that matter smelledthe western front he hadnt got shot there either walsh had done all of those things however much he wished he hadnt for a wonder cavendish heard the reproach in his voice the youngster blushed like a schoolgirl i know youve been through a good deal sergeant he said stiffly but i do believe i am gaining on you when it comes to experience that he could come out with such claptrap straightfaced only proved how much experience he didnt have yet telling him so would have been pointless precisely because he lacked the experience that would have let him understand what an idiot he was being walsh didnt even try whatever you say sir he answered one of the things staff sergeants did was ride herd on subalterns till their nominal superiors were fit to go around a battlefield by themselves without getting too many of the soldiers under their command killed for no reason cavendish might have been doing his best to prove he hadnt reached that point yet pointing east he said well weve given the boches a proper whatfor this time eh his posh accent only made that sound even stupider than it would have otherwise walsh wouldnt have thought such a thing possible but cavendish proved him wrong sir the germans came from their own border all the way to paris weve come from paris all the way to messy walsh said if you want to call that a proper whatfor well go ahead there are times when i doubt you have the proper attitude sergeant cavendish said would you sooner be fighting behind paris no sir not a bit of it walshs own accent was buzzing welsh and lowerclass welsh at that what else to expect from a miners son he went on id sooner be fighting in bloody germany is what id sooner be doing but that doesnt look like its in the cards does it ingermany by the way the subaltern said it the possibility had never crossed his mind dont you think thats asking a bit much evidently sir walsh left it right there if the french generalsto say nothing of the british generals which was about what they deserved to have said of themwere worth the paper they were printed on the german high command wouldnt have been able to impose its will on them with such effortless ease that had happened the last time around too the boches ran out of men and materiel then while the yanks gave the allies all they needed no yanks in the picture now worse luck just the german generals against their british and french counterparts christ help us walsh thought as if to remind people whod forgotten second lieutenant herman cavendish for instance that they hadnt gone away german gunners began lobbing shells into messy when they started landing too close for comfort walsh jumped into the nearest hole in the ground it wasnt as if he didnt have plenty of choices he thought cavendish would stay upright and make a brave little speech about command responsibilitytill a flying fragment did something dreadful to him but no the subaltern dove for cover too hed learned something anyhow walsh wouldnt have bet more than tuppence hapenny on it after ten minutes or so the bombardment eased off walsh cradled the schmeisser hed taken off a dead bochefor throwing a lot of lead around at close quarters nothing beat a submachine gun if the germans decided they wanted messy back he was ready to argue with them but no hunchedover figures wearing fieldgray and coalscuttle helmets loped forward this was just harassing fire hate they would have called it in the last war somebody off in the distance was yelling for a medic so the bastards serving a had earned their salary this morning lieutenant cavendish went off to inflict his leadership on someone else walsh lit a fresh navy cut he climbed out of the hole to see what the shelling had done to the hamlet a skinny little stubblecheeked french sergeant puffing on a pipe emerged from cover about the same time he did the frenchman waved ca va tommy he called va bien et tu walsh ran through a good part of his clean french with that he waved toward the east then spat the french noncom nodded fucking boche he said his english was probably as filthy as most of walshs francais a couple of his men came out he started yelling at them he was a sergeant all right walsh checked on the soldiers in his own section the fellow whod bought part of a plot came from a different company that was something anyhow after nodding rather smugly walsh wondered why it should be the british army was no better off because the wounded man wasnt from his outfit and that other company was weakened instead of his in the larger scheme of things so what but it was a bloke walsh didnt know not one he did you didnt want one of your mates to stop one maybe that was a reminder you were too bloody liable to stop one yourself of course you had to be an idiot not to know as much already still there was a differencewhether there should have been or notbetween knowing something and getting your nose rubbed in it are we supposed to move up again sergeant asked a soldier named nigel like lieutenant cavendish he spoke like an educated man he didnt sound toffeenosed doing it though nobodys told me if we are walsh answered you can bet your last quid the lieutenant would have too he wasnt supposed to speak ill of officers he was supposed to let the men in his charge form their unflattering opinions all by themselves by the way nigel and bill and the others chuckled they needed no help from him hes a bit gormless aint he bill said he came from the yorkshire dales and sounded like it the word wasnt one staff sergeant walsh would have chosen it wasnt one hed heard before he took the kings shilling more than half a lifetime ago well hed heardand useda lot of words hed never imagined back in his civilian days gormless was one you could actually repeat in polite company oh maybe a bit walsh said and they chuckled again he added say what you want about him thoughhe is brave well yes but so are the germans nigel said even some of the frenchmen i suppose they are wed be a lot worse off if they werent walsh said half of them are bolshies though can you imagine what would happen if the nazis and reds were on the same side nigel plainly could by the way he rolled his eyes he didnt fancy the notion some communist official would say the germans are the workers friends and all the fellow travelers would decide they didnt feel like fighting any more its not going to happen chum walsh declared not without relief theyre slanging away at each other on the far edge of poland you ask me anyone who wants poland enough to fight over it has to be daft anyone whos not a pole you mean nigel said them too walsh said with more than a little heat look at that bloody bosnian maniac princip in he got millions and millions killed because he couldnt stand the damned austrian archduke suppose that was worth it do you just as bloody fucking stupid to go to war over poland there you go bill grinned at him from under the dented brim of his tin hat now youve solved all the worlds problems you have go tell the boches to quit shooting at ustwas all a misunderstanding like then get on your airplane and fly off to wherever the hell you go to pick up your nobel prize walsh told him where the hell he could go and where he could stuff the nobel prize they all laughed they smoked another cigarette or two and then they were ready to get on with the war again sergeant hideki fujita had spent more time than he cared to remember in manchukuo hed got used to all kinds of noises he never would have heard in japan wolves could howl foxes could yip if he was wrapped in a blanket out where the steppe gave way to the desert hed fall asleep regardless and hed stay asleep no matter what kind of racket the animals made out there he lived like an animal himself he also lived like an animal here in the pine woods on the russian side of the ussuri the river that formed the northeastern border between manchukuo and the soviet union he dug himself a hole he jumped down into it and he slept howling wolves yipping foxes hooting owls they didnt bother him a bit tigers tigers were a different story when a tiger roared or screamed even gunfire seemed to hesitate for a moment those noises always woke him up too though hed sleep through gunshots or through artillery that didnt come too close you had to learn to fear gunshots not tigers if you heard that roar you were afraid and on the double fujita quickly found out he wasnt the only one who felt the same way one of the superior privates in his squad a student called shinjiro hayashi said something deep down inside your head knows that whatever makes that noise wants to eat people hai fujita exclaimed thats just it he came off a farm himself he often had the feeling that hayashi looked down his nose at him though a japanese private who let his sergeant know for sure that he looked down his nose at him was asking for all the trouble in the world and a little more besides hayashi wasnt dumb enough to do that and there were times when having a guy who knew things came in handy hayashi spoke some chinese for instance when we came here from the mongolian border they said thered be tigers here said shigeru nakayama another private i thought it was more of the same old crap they always give new people but they meant it a major in the regiment had had his men drag in an enormous tiger carcass he hadnt killed it russian artillery had but he took possession of the hideand of the innards a tigers gall bladder was worth plenty to the people who cooked up chinese and japanese medicines you could probably get something for the rest of the organs too but hayashi spoke another truth when he said the tiger will make noise to let you know its there you never hear the damn russian who puts a bullet in your back as if on cue russian mortar bombs started landing on the japanese position like any soldier with even a little experience in the field fujita hated mortars you couldnt hear them coming till they were almost there then they sliced you up like a sashimi chef taking a knife to a fine chunk of toro unlike the tuna belly you werent dead before they started you sure could be by the time they got done though fujita jumped into a hole he had more uses for them than sleep alone fragments snarled by overhead a couple of hundred meters away a japanese soldier started screaming as if a tiger had clamped its jaws on his leg several rifle shots rang out a few seconds later another soldier shrieked zakennayo fujita muttered under his breath the russians sent elaborately camouflaged snipers high up into pines that overlooked japanese positions soldiers must have come out to pick up the man the mortars woundedwhereupon the snipers did more damage in the russojapanese war the japanese had accepted surrenders and treated enemy prisoners as well as any of the soft western powers did even if yielding was a disgrace in japanese eyes things hadnt worked like that on the mongolian border if you gave up there you took your chances and the mongolians and soviets werent what anybody would call gentle either the game was rough here too for that matter fujita didnt think any army in the world casually accepted surrenders from snipers any more than most soldiers were willing to let machine gunners give up japanese guns began to move the russians had the edge in artillery here as they did on the edge of the gobi the soviets might not believe in god but they believed in firepower and some of the dugouts they built would take a direct hit without collapsing what they didnt know about field fortifications wasnt worth knowing they got to show that off in this forest fighting too somewhere up ahead lay the transsiberian railroad and victory cut the railroad line and vladivostok would start to wither away that would leave the ussr without its great pacific port which was exactly what japan had in mind unfortunately the russians could read maps too they were going to defend the railway line with everything they had and if they didnt have more than the generals in the kwantung army thought before they started this war fujita would have been amazed somewhere up ahead lay hill the latest strong point the japanese needed to subdue before they pushed on toward the two parallel lengths of iron track that were the main reason for the attack main reason sergeant fujita shook his head absent the railroad this was terrain only tiger hunters would ever want to visit the russians had more of their seemingly limitless cannon up at the top of hill down toward the bottom they had machinegun nests barbed wire to guide troops into the machine guns lines of fire and minefields to maim any soldiers the machine guns happened to miss fujita had already stormed one of the red armys fortified hills he didnt want to do it again of course his superiors cared not a sens worth about what he or any other enlisted man wanted enlisted men were tools to be usedor used upas officers saw fit airplane engines droned overhead fujita could see only bits of sky through the tall pines and firs and spruces and other trees he had trouble naming he couldnt make out what was going on up there japanese planes had an engine note different from that of their russian foes a little higher a little thinner everybody said so fujita believed it but he had trouble hearing it himself when bombs started bursting on top of hill and on the westfacing slope he felt like cheering that would give the russians something to think about airplanes full of bombs could counteract their superiority in cannon his excitement didnt last long once the planes got done pounding the russian position what would happen next infantry would go forward and try to clean it outthat was what and then all the red army men the bombs hadnt killed would grab their rifles and wait at their machine guns and slaughter as many japanese as they could sure enough lieutenant hanafusas whistle squealed come on the platoon leader shouted time to dig them out we can do it may the emperor live ten thousand years he trotted forward banzai fujita echoed as he scrambled out of his hole he didnt care about living years himself though he certainly hoped the emperor would he did hope he would last another thirty or forty going up against another one of these hills made that a lot less likely but he couldnt hang back it wasnt just that his own superiors would do worse to him than anything the russians could dream up they would yes but that wasnt what got him moving you couldnt seem a slacker in front of your men you were brave because they watched you being brave and they were brave because you had your eye on themand because they didnt want to let their buddies down ahead machine guns started hammering fujita shook his head as he dodged around trees no the bombers hadnt cleared out everybody on the ground they never did by the nature of things they couldnt that was up to the infantry red army khaki was a little darker a little browner than the color the japanese used neither was very well suited to the deep greens and browns of these pine woods fujita scrambled behind a tree he raised his rifle made sure that the helmet had an unfamiliar outline and pulled the trigger down went the russian one less roundeyed barbarian to worry about fujita thought somebody ran past him toward the higher ground ahead a moment later the japanese soldier wailed in despair he was hung up on barbed wire cleverly concealed among the ferns and bushes that grew under the trees the way he jerked and struggled reminded fujita of a bug trapped on flypaper a trapped bug might struggle for quite a while one of the russian machine guns soon found the japanese soldier he didnt jerk any more after that but hung limply like a dead fly fujita shivered that could have been him as easily as not if that private hadnt rushed forward he might have done it himself rushing forward was what the japanese army taught its soldiers aggressiveness won battles if it also got people killed that was just part of the cost of doing business urra the russian shout rang through the woods a submachine gun stuttered somewhere off to fujitas left the japanese preferred rifles because of their longer range the russians liked weapons that could fire rapidly at close quarters a lot of the fighting in these woods was at very close quarters because half the time you didnt see the other guy till you fell over himor he fell over you advance toward the rear an officer shouted the japanese had no command for retreat that one did the job though hill wouldnt fall today neither would the railroad linenot here anyhow chapter shanghai had seen better days pete mcgill snorted when that piece of brilliance crossed his mind it was a good thing he was a marine corporal he made a fine leatherneck if hed gone into the detective racket instead his deductions wouldnt have put sherlock holmes out of business any time soon of course shanghai had seen better days he couldnt think of one spot in china that hadnt seen better days better years probably better centuries peking where hed been stationed till just a little while before sure as hell wasnt the same since the japs occupied it japan occupied shanghai too the japanese had dominated the area since the early s and threw the chinese out in november a year and a half ago now the battle not far outside of town was supposed to have cost chinese casualties and japanese the ratio said a lot about the quality of the two armies involved that the chinese stayed in the fight after taking such losses again and again said how much they hated the japs the usa had pulled most of its marines out of peking to help protect americans in shanghai who were far more numerous than in the former capital that was what the united states loudly proclaimed anyhow if you read between the lines you saw that marines in peking were trapped if trouble with japan flared up the garrison at the us legation would have to be written off shanghai was a port troops here had some kind of chance of getting on a ship and heading for hong kong or manila or somewhere mcgill didnt worry about it worrying about foreign policy wasnt in a corporals job description he worried about making sergeant one of these days he worried about the twenty bucks us hed lost in a poker game on the train down from peking he worried about finding a good cheap whorehouse he hadnt much cared for the couple of places hed visited here till he found some suckers and won back what hed losthow often did you run into four sixes for crying out loudcheap came first he didnt like worrying about the japs anyway so he did as little of it as he could like any marine he was convinced he was part of the best fighting outfit in the world back when peking still belonged to china hed brawled with japanese soldiers hed cheered the american baseball team against the japanese nine but things werent the same any more now that the japs were at war with china they didnt go in for friendly brawling theyd mob you if you messed with them it was an article of faith that one marine was tougher than one jap one marine sure as hell wasnt tougher than six or eight or ten slanteyed little yellow monkeys and that was how things worked out nowadays american british and french warships lay alongside japanese naval vessels in the harbor their guns were supposed to give the western powers bargaining strength against the chinese and the japs theyd done the job against the chinese till the chinese didnt hold shanghai any more against japan japan had far more firepower here than all the western powers put together and japan had fighters and bombers galore which the western powers here didnt the crew of the american gunboat panay could have preached a sermon about that japanese airplanes had sent her to the bottom of the yangtze oh the japanese government apologized and paid an indemnity afterwards but that didnt do the dead sailors a hell of a lot of good so americans and westerners generally had to watch themselves in shanghai these days but you could still have yourself a hell of a good time if you did watch yourself things cost more here than they did in peking with only a corporals pay pete noticed the difference still compared to honolulu or even manila shanghai remained a pretty good deal it had compensations peking lacked too most of the dancehall hostesses at the clubs here were white russians refugees first from the red takeover and then from the japanese domination of what was now called manchukuo mcgill couldnt remember the last time hed danced with a white woman in peking he wasnt sure he ever had here he could do it as much as he wanted for anything from ten cents to a dollar mex a dance depending on how fancy the joint was and some of the white russian gals were real stunners too stunners or not a lot of them were vampires who could put bela lugosi to shame their main goal was separating soldiers and sailors and businessmen from cash between dances they wanted to drink you ordered them champagne or wine or whiskey they got ginger ale or apple or grape juice or weak tea it went on the chit as booze though you paidthrough the nose some of petes naive buddies wondered how the girls could drink so much and never show it he knew better than that anyhow if the girl he was dancing with was pretty enough he didnt care too much and vera tonight was all that and then some her hair was the color of jean harlows if a peroxide bottle helped it along as it was supposed to have done for harlow pete didnt feel like fussing she had big blue eyes a button nose and a mouth as red and sweetlooking as a strawberry moving south she came equipped with everything else a girl needed too and she could really dance she danced well enough to make pete a man born with two left feet feel like a good dancer himself she also clung to him tighter than a coat of paint if that wasnt inspiration he didnt know what would be she must have felt his hardon bumping against her but she didnt seem to mind she let him kiss her too her mouth turned out to be even sweeter than it looked they went on clinging to each other after the music stopped a slinky chinese gal in a dress slit up to there brought fresh drinks to the sweating chinamen in black tie who played some pretty good hot jazz somebody tapped pete on the shoulder distracted he half turned there stood a buddy of his a marine named puccinelli grinning the dago said why dont you make an honest woman out of that broad man you looked like you were gonna lay her right here on the dance floor why dont you get lost pooch mcgill suggested sweetly if hed thought vera would go for it she might have been pouring down phony drinks but pete hadnt hed guzzled enough real whiskey to make it seem like fun not craziness vera tugged at his arm a little champagne she said dancing makes you thirsty yes dancing made pete horny hows about you and me go off somewhere quiet just the two of us he asked even half in the bag he watched the cash registers chinging behind the white russian girls big baby blues he gave his own mental shrug it wasnt as if he thought she was with him because of the charm of his own blunt ruddy features if you were looking for love or even for a facsimile that seemed reasonable while it was going on in places like this you needed to keep your wallet in your hand sixty dollars mex vera said that was four times the going rate for a chinese girl in a shanghai brothel it was also fifteen bucks american or a goodly part of a months pay but when john henry started yelling you really wished that asshole on the train hadnt had four of a kind ouch pete said vera considered she wasnt like a whorehouse whoreshe had some discretion about clients and prices her features softened a little all right yankee for you fifty mex she said she does like mesome anyway pete thought he also knew damn well she wouldnt come down twice where can we go he asked she took his arm follow me she said right then he would have followed her through ice or fire or a minefield he didnt have to go that far only to a little room over the dance hall it had a bare dim light bulb hanging from the ceiling a mattress on an iron bed frame one cheap chair and a nightstand with a pitcher and basin and a couple of folded towels on top it was astringently clean and astringently neat which made it stand out among the many whores rooms pete had visited you like it veras mouth twisted as she slid out of her dress it is my palace sweetheart any room with you in it is a palace pete said hoarsely he might regret blowing so much jack tomorrow but he sure didnt now she looked even better naked than she had in the tightfitting silk he hadnt dreamt she could she gave him a wry smile an eager one like you almost i forget i do this for money pete wished she hadnt said almost but right this minute he didnt care why she was doing it as long as she was he flicked off the light and reached for her even in the sudden darkness he knew just where the bed lay lieutenant colonel borisov glowered at the assembled red air force pilots and copilots you people have been sitting around on your asses too damn long the squadron commander growled high time you went out and earned some of the rubles the workers and peasants of the soviet union are paying you lieutenant sergei yaroslavsky stirred on his folding chair that was monstrously unfair and borisov had to know it it wasnt the flyers fault that the unpaved byelorussian airstrip turned to gluey mud in the spring thaw everything turned to mud during the fall and spring rasputitsas time to make the poles sorry they climbed into the sack with that dog turd of a fascist hitler borisov went on if they think they can get away with refusing the ussrs just demands theyd better think twice now sergei nodded that was more like it blame the enemy not your own side sitting next to him anastas mouradian raised a thick dark eyebrow one of these days the copilot and bombaimer aboard sergeis sb would end up in more trouble than he could hope to escape an emotional armenian he couldnt keep what he was thinking off his face enough propaganda just give us the mission and let us take care of it something like that had to be in stas mind it was in sergeis mind too but he had sense enough not to show it what nobody saw wouldnt get reported to the nkvd of course the nkvd could haul you away and shoot you or chuck you into a camp north of the arctic circle with no excuse at all but why make things easy for the chekists if you gave them a reason to jump on you you were almost asking for it like a girl in tight clothes that didnt cover enough of her our target is the railroad line that runs southeast from wilno to molodetschna colonel borisov went on wilno to the russians vilna to the poles vilnius to the lithuanians one town with three names depending on who was talking about it and who held it at any given moment it was in polands hands now marshal smiglyridz had refused to give it back to the ussr the lithuanians also wanted it again though they hadnt ruled there for centuries sergei didnt show annoyance and he didnt show relief either whether he showed it or not he felt it they werent going to fly into east prussia today it wasnt that the germans didnt have fighters and antiaircraft guns inside of polandthey did but they seemed much more serious about defending their own people than they did about protecting a bunch of poles questions borisov asked no one said anything borisov did not have a manner that encouraged queries his face said dont waste my time not all questions did waste time but the ones that didnt got asked no more than the ones that did after the meeting broke up sergeant ivan kuchkov asked his superiors well how are they going to fuck us over this time the railroad coming out of wilno sergei answered that wont be so bad kuchkov said he was the bombardier in charge of actually dropping the bombs on the enemys head it took brute strength and he had plenty he was short and squat and muscular he was also one of the hairiest human beings sergei had ever seen people called him the chimp but rarely to his faceyou took your life in your hands if you did i was thinking the same thing yaroslavsky said i was hoping the same thing anastas mouradian said which sounded almost identical but meant something different most of the winter whitewash had been scrubbed off their sb what was left gave the tupolev bombers summer camouflage of brown and green an old faded look the sb itself was starting to seem old and faded to sergei the twoengined machine had seemed a worldbeater in the early days of the spanish civil war it could outrun and outclimb the biplane fighters marshal sanjurjos fascists and their italian and german allies threw against it but those days were long gone now sergei and his crewmates had fought as volunteers in czechoslovakia there hed made the unhappy discovery that the sb was no match for the german messerschmitt quite a few of his comrades whod discovered the same thing didnt come back to the rodina bfs had done far too many of the motherlands flyers in this latest squabble with the poles and germans too better bombers were supposed to be on the way till they arrived the sb soldiered on it was what the soviet union had if losses ran high well they did that was all factories could crank out more planes and osoaviakhim flight schools could crank out more pilots armorers wheeled bombs over to the plane the carts didnt sink into the ground a sure sign the rasputitsa was done at last heres hoping they all land on the hitlerites cocks kuchkov said and the poles sergei added fuck the poles fuck their mothers fuck their daughters fuck their sisters and fuck their ugly old aunties too ivan declared he was as sergei had seen before a man of limited vocabulary and strong opinions the poles arent worth shit the fucking germans theyre the ones we need to worry about he wasnt wrong sergei had seen enough of the germans to alarm him too they wont stop us the pilot declared neither kuchkov nor mouradian tried to tell him any different both big radial engines on the sb thundered to life sergei ran through the checklist everything came up green other bombers were jouncing down the runway and flying west when his turn came sergei joined them getting up in the air again felt good till the shooting started he could remember what a joy flying was supposed to be but the shooting started all too soon during the winter soviet troops had bitten off a disappointingly small chunk of northeastern poland a few of them fired at the westbound sbs on the theory that anything in the air was bound to be dangerous the chimps profanity echoed brassily through the speaking tube that connected the bomb bay and the cockpit and the poles banged away at the bombers for all they were worth black puffs of smoke burst among the sbs the antiaircraft fire was so quick and accurate sergei wondered if germans were manning the guns down on the ground one of the sbs had to turn back with smoke and flame coming from the starboard engine yaroslavsky hoped the crew got down safely that clang was a chunk of shrapnel biting into the fuselage sergei eyed the gauges he tested all the controls khorosho mouradian asked da khorosho sergei answered and everything did seem fine part of him that only came out in times of stress wanted to thank god the new soviet man who ruled his mind more often than not told that other part to shut up and go away there was the railroad line stretching off toward wilno borisov didnt tell us where he wanted us to hit it did he mouradian said sergei thought back no i dont believe he did that probably meant some red air force higherup hadnt told borisov maybe none of the higherups had even stopped to worry about it since they figured one length of track was as good as another im going to start the bombing run he flew straight and level changing course only as mouradian aligned them more closely on the railway line now ivan mouradian bawled through the speaking tube and the stick of bombs fell free as soon as they did yaroslavsky swung the bomber into a hard turn and mashed down the throttle even polish fighters could outrun the sb and if messerschmitts were in the neighborhood messerschmitts were in the neighborhood the slabsided fighters tore into the sbs that had pressed deeper into poland a blast from the dorsal machinegun turret said one of them was thinking about coming after sergeis plane gutless whore ivan yelled hes running like a prick with the clap too bad sergei said he exchanged a look with mouradian they wore identical shaky grins no matter how the chimp felt neither was sorry that german hadnt kept chasing them no not a bit sergei thought and came down on the throttle even harder a groundcrew man walked up to hansulrich rudel at what had been a french airstrip till the wehrmacht overran it these days stukas flew out of it to pummel the former owners and their english allies excuse me lieutenant the enlisted man said and stood there waiting whats up franz rudel asked the mechanic had served in the trenches in the last war he still recalled the strict and formal discipline of the kaisers army which made him seem out of place in germanys new more easygoing military colonel steinbrenner wants to see you right away sir franz said what kind of trouble am i in hansulrich assumed he was in one kind or another he was a white crow in the squadron a teetotaling ministers son didnt mix well with most of the harddrinking hardwenching pilots they teased him and he shot back there hadnt been any brawls yet but it was bound to be only a matter of time even his rear gunner thought him a queer duck but franz only shrugged sir you think a colonel tells me anything like that hansulrich didnt he walked over to the colonels tent everything all around was green the air was soft and sweet and mild with spring if you didnt notice the faint deathreek that lay under the sweetness rudels nose was used to it so most of the time he didnt this morning for some reason he did an unfamiliar kubelwagen was parked next to the tent the little utility vehicle was built on a volkswagen chassis production of passenger cars naturally was on hold for the duration a kubelwagen could take four people almost anywhere and carry a machine gun too if you didnt need armor plate or a cannon what more could you want he ducked into the tent rudel sir reporting as ordered yes yes colonel steinbrenner nodded to the two men standing next to the folding table that served as his desk these gentlemen have some questions they want to ask you the gentlemen in question didnt wear luftwaffe bluegray instead their uniforms were somber black with ss runs on one collar tab the older ss man said so youre rudel are you thats right hansulrich answered automatically good come with us the blackshirt said whats going on that was also an automatic yelp just come well talk about it later the ss man answered numbly rudel went was this what russian officers felt when somebody from the nkvd came for them he didnt know hed never been a russian he did know people at the airstrip stared as he climbed into the kubelwagen with himmlers hounds the younger one started up the machine as it rolled away hansulrich wondered if hed ever come back after a little more than a kilometer the driver pulled off the narrow winding road and stopped everything was very quiet a couple of black cows grazed in an emerald meadow off in the distance a french farmer guided a horsedrawn plow he probably would have used a tractor before the war but where would he get gas for it now the plow might have been sitting in the barn since his father put it there but you did what you could with what you had what were the ss men going to do with him the older one lit an overstolz from a pack he took out of his breast pocket when he held out the pack hansulrich shook his head thats right the blackshirt said as if reminding himself you dont drink either do you what if i dont rudel said were you going to give me a cigarette before you put one between my eyes the two big men in black looked at each other then as if on cue they threw back their heads and laughed like loons a jackdaw flew out of a nearby tree chattering in annoyance thats not what we brought you out here for the younger one said tears leaked from the corners of his eyes he dabbed at them with his sleeve before dissolving in giggles again oh dear he couldnt stop laughinghe was helpless as a baby and his partner wasnt in much better shape had rudel needed to he thought he could have disarmed them both without breaking a sweat evidently though he didnt need to what he didnt understand was why he didnt need to well what did you bring me out here for he asked irritably nice to know our reputation goes ahead of us the older one said did he mean it hansulrich already at sea had trouble telling the ss man gathered himself he finally went on as a matter of fact rudel we wanted to talk to you because youre known to be loyal huh hansulrich knew the uncouth noise made him sound like a moron but it was what came out of his mouth because youre known to be loyal the ss man repeated patiently maybe he had a small child at home and didnt mind saying the same thing over and over again or maybesince he didnt wear a wedding ringhed just done a devil of a lot of interrogations we want to root out disloyalty wherever we find it people whose loyalty we trust can help us do that this colonel in charge of your squadron for instance has he ever done anything or said anything to make you think hes not doing all he can for the reich and the fuhrer colonel steinbrenner never rudel said at once telling the truth was easy and came as a relief hes replacing somebody who wasnt reliable the younger ss man said tactfully reminding his superior of something he might have forgotten ja ja the other blackshirt said not so patiently this time if he had forgotten he wasnt about to admit it but so what that doesnt mean he walks on water himself not by a long shot as far as i know hes a good national socialist hansulrich said wunderbar maybe he does walk on water then what about the other people in your squadron the older man persisted anybody saying rude things about the fuhrer because the offensives slowed down a little bit the offensive in france hadnt slowed down it had stopped no matter how german radio tried to disguise that it was obvious to anyone who spent time at or over the front the wehrmacht hadnt taken paris it hadnt wheeled around behind the city from the north the goal in and now again a generation later it was scrambling to try to cover its long weak southern flank against french counterattacks it wasnt trench warfare of the sort that had murdered so many of the kaisers soldiers but german troops werent storming forward to glory right this minute either cautiously hansulrich answered nobodys very happy about it im not very happy about it myself that last sentence made the older ss man close his mouth on a question rudel could guess what it was he would have wanted to know exactly who was unhappy and what the unhappy people had said easy to put a noose around someones neck with testimony like that but the blackshirt had to see rudel wouldnt say anything worth hearing not if he admitted he wished the war were going better what about your crewmate sergeant whatshisname dieselhorst the younger ss man said some people have told us funny stuff about him then theyre a pack of lying pigdogs hansulrich answered hotly nothings wrong with albertnot one single thing you hear if it werent for him i wouldnt have come back from a couple of missions you want to listen to the scheisse some people come out with youd better haul me away too he wondered if they would albert dieselhorst loved germany but he didnt love the people who ran it these days and he wasnt shy about saying so which must have been why informers tipped these fellows off to him if they had enough evidence theyd know rudel was protecting his sergeant then he and dieselhorst would both catch it but the blackshirt said take an even strain buddy weve got to check this stuff out you know its our job its our duty he noddedhe liked the sound of that better it made him seem more like a soldier less like the secret policeman he was take him back the older ss man said he hasnt got anything good for us doesnt look that way the fellow behind the wheel agreed he started up the kubelwagen expertly turned around on the narrow road and started east toward the airstrip rudel couldnt let out the sigh of relief that wanted to explode from him they might notice it and know it for what it was the older man did have the decency to say good luck to you when they dropped hansulrich off the kubelwagen chugged away groundcrew men and flyers stared at rudel if the ss arrested somebody right after this he wouldnt be able to live it down the gang would have to wait and see that everyone stayed safe before they trusted him again sooner or later they would he hoped sarah goldman walked through the streets of munster toward the only bakery in town that still served jews it was late afternoon the only time jews were allowed to shop they got whatever was left after all the aryans bought what they needed it wasnt fair of course nothing had been fair since the nazis took over more than six years ago now shed only been twelve then she hadnt understood all the reasons why her parents and her older brother were so upset well she did now no one who lived in germany jew or aryan could fail to understand these days british bombersor maybe they were frenchhad come over a few nights before nothing fell very close to the goldmans house for which sarah thanked the god in whom she was having more and more trouble believing a labor gang worked to fill in a crater one of the bombs had blown in the street a grayhaired man with only one arm shouted at the men to work harder he was probably a sergeant mutilated in the last war some of the men were petty criminals some were too old to worry about getting conscripted none seemed inclined to work any harder than he had to put your backs into it you lugs the gang boss growled if you dont theyll put you to work in a camp that made his charges speed up at least for a little while it made sarah shudder as she walked by she didnt know what happened to people who went to places like mauthausen and dachau all she knew was it wasnt good noshe also knew they didnt come out again her imagination took it from there took it all kinds of unpleasant places she shuddered again hey sweetheart one of the guys in the gang called he waved to her and rocked his hips forward and back his buddies laughed sarahs spine stiffened she walked on with her nose in the air that only made the laborers laugh harder she ignored them as best she could she hadnt wanted to look at them at all she was afraid shed see her father sweating through pickandshovel work samuel goldman wounded war veteran holder of the iron cross second class professor of classics and ancient history street repairer it was the only work the nazis would let him have her brother had worked in a labor gang for a while too saul was a footballer of nearprofessional quality he exulted in the physical where his father grudgingly acknowledged it and when his gang boss rode him and hit him once too often for being a jew hed smashed in the nasty little mans head with a shovel hed got away afterwards too sarah didnt know how but he had his athletic training must have let him outrun everyone who chased him and the police and the ss were still looking for him a slow smile spread across sarahs face hed found a hiding place theyd never think of how many of the people on the street at this time of day were jews intent on getting whatever the hateful authorities would let them have you couldnt tell by looking not most of the time worried expressions and threadbare clothes meant nothing during wartime plenty of impeccably aryan germans were worried and shabby too and sarah couldnt recognize jews from the synagogue either her family was secular with mostly gentile friends she couldnt remember the last time shed gone to shul her father had told her he felt more jewish now with the nazis persecuting him than he ever had before if that wasnt irony what was a young man in a wehrmacht uniform his left arm in a sling smiled at her as she walked past she didnt smile back she thought she might have if she were an aryan he was nicelooking up till hitler took over shed always thought of herself as more german than jewish even with everything that was going on her father and brother had tried to join up when the war started they still wanted to be germans the recruiters wouldnt let them it was all so monstrously unfair the jewish grocers shop and bakery sat across the street from each other before the war started brownshirts had amused themselves by swearing at jewish women who went in and out theyd chucked a rock through the grocers window too naturally the police only yawned now most of the brownshirts were carrying rifles sarah hoped the french and the englishyes and the russians toowould shoot them she got some sad potatoes and turnips some wilting greens and a couple of wizened apples at the grocers it all cost too much and too many ration points when she grumbled josef stein only shrugged its not like i can do anything about it the proprietor said i know sarah sighed but its not easy for my family either you want easy what are you doing here stein said she walked across the street to the bakery the bread was what the ration book called war bread it was baked from rye and barley and potato flour it was black and chewy the alarming thing was that people who remembered the last war said it was better than what they ate then that bread had been eked out with ground corn and lupine seedsand some people insisted with sawdust too the bakers son stood behind the counter isidor bruck was only a couple of years older than sarah hed played football with her brother though he wasnt in sauls class but then who was no doubt his parents had named him isidor to keep from calling him isaak that kind of thing amused sarahs father whod told her isidor meant gift of isisnot the sort of name a jew ought to wear she didnt think the brucks had given it to him because of what it meant but even so this is a pretty good batch he said as he put the loaf in her cloth sack you always say that sarah answered or your father does if hes back there instead we always mean it too we do the best we can with what they let us have isidor said if they gave us more wed do better you know what we were like before before everything happened we were the best bakery in town jews goyim we were better than everybody sure isidor sarah said as far as she could remember he was right whenever the goldmans wanted something special theyd come to the brucks bakery she remembered things as ordinary as white bread with a fond longing she wouldnt have imagined possible only a couple of years before she gave him money and more ration coupons just handling the coupons printed with the nazis eagle holding a swastika in its claws made her want to wash her hands but she had to use themshe or her mother if they didnt the family wouldnt eat it wouldnt eat well any which way aryans couldnt eat well under rationing though they could keep body and soul together jews had trouble doing even that he handed her her change some of the bronze and aluminum coins also bore the eagle and swastika she liked the older ones from the weimar republic better they didnt make her wish she could be a traitor against the government or at least that the countryher country in spite of everythinghad gone in a different direction take care isidor said as she turned to go hope i see you again before too long sure sarah said and then wondered if she should have she could see his reflection in the front window as she walked to the doorneither brownshirts nor british bombs had broken this one yes he was watching her she had to ask herself how she felt about being watched what would she do if he asked her to go walking in the botanical gardens or through the park just south of them that held the zoo those were the most exciting dates jews could have these days even movie theaters were offlimits sarah didnt look especially jewish but isidor did the ticket seller would surely ask for his id and trouble would follow right away a bakers son in ordinary times she would have laughed at the idea these days werent all jews equal in misery anda coldly pragmatic part of her mind whisperedif anybody kept food on the table wouldnt a baker the things you had to think about she was glad when the door swung shut behind her chapter up atop the us conning tower lieutenant josef lemp imagined he could see forever no land was in sight ireland lay off to the north cornwall to the east but neither showed above the horizon grayblue sky came down to meet greenblue sea in a perfect circle all around the boat the eye couldnt judge how wide that circle was why not believe it stretched to infinity and beyond why not only one reason youd get killed in a hurry if you did three petty officers on the conning tower with lemp constantly scanned air and sea with zeiss binoculars the u had almost circumnavigated the british isles to reach this position as far as the royal navy and the raf were concerned she made an unwelcome interloper they had ways of letting her know it too but the uboat needed to be here convoys from the usa and canada and argentina came through these waters without the supplies they carried england and her war effort would starve and british troopships ferried tommies and raf pilots and the planes they flew to france sink them before they got there and they wouldnt give landsers and luftwaffe flyers grief one of the petty officers field glasses jerked hed spotted something up in the sky lemp got ready to bawl the order that would send everybody on the tower diving down the hatch and the u diving deep into the sea then the binoculars steadied the petty officer let out a sheepish chuckle only a petrel he said thats all right rolf lemp said better to jump at a bird than to miss an airplane rolf nodded you bet skipper the surface navy was all spit and polish and formality there was no room for that kind of crap aboard uboats the men who sailed in them laughed at it they were a raffish lot given to beards and dirty uniforms and speaking their minds but when the time came to buckle down to business nobody was more dangerous lemp had his own binoculars on a strap around his neck the conning tower also carried a massive pair on a metal pylon for times when a skipper needed to trade field of view for magnification rolf stiffened again this time like a dog coming to the point smoke where away lemp asked grabbing for his field glasses bearing about the petty officer answered you can make it out just above the horizon back and forth back and forth moving the binoculars that way was second nature for lemp and sure as hell there was the smudge well lets see what weve got he said excitement tingling through him go below boys down the hatch they went shoes clanging on iron rungs lemp the last man there dogged the hatch take us to schnorkel depth he ordered as he descended the u slid below the surfacebut not far below the tube mounted atop the submarine let the diesels keep breathing even so lemp was not enamored of the gadget which didnt always work as advertised the shipfitters back in kiel wouldnt have installed the dutchinvented device on his boat if hed been in good odor with the powers that be after sinking an american liner while believing it to be a big freighter he wasnt he was lucky they hadnt beached himmaybe lucky they hadnt shot him no one who remembered the last war wanted to see the usa jump into this one lemp turned to gerhart beilharz the engineering officer whod come with the schnorkel is the damned thing behaving he asked oh yes sir beilharz said enthusiastically he was all for his new toy of course he washe wouldnt have been messing with it if he werent normally an extra engineering officer on a uboatespecially one two meters tall who wore an infantry helmet to keep from smashing his head open on the overhead pipes and valveswas about as useful as an extra tail on a cat but if they were going to have the schnorkel along having somebody aboard who knew all about it seemed worthwhile it did have its uses with it in action the uboat could make eight knots just below the surfacebetter than twice her submerged speed on batteries and she could keep going indefinitely instead of running out of juice inside a day best of all with the schnorkel the u could charge the batteries for deep dives without surfacing that was good for everybodys life expectancy except the enemys lemp could have gone twice as fast in approaching the ship or ships making that distant smoke plume had he stayed surfaced maybe it was a lone freighter a fat tasty target maybe sure but the odds were against it freighters in these waters commonly convoyed and zigzagged they commonly had destroyers escorting them and destroyers loved uboats the way dogs loved catseven cats with two tails better to be a cat o nine tails lemp thought with all the torpedoes the u carried he could flog england even worse than that if he could keep england from flogging back hed bring the uboat home so he could go out and try it again so the english have the chance to kill me again as he did every time that thought surfaced he made it submerge once more he peered through the periscope nothing but smoke not yet eight knots was a walk even if it wasnt a crawl he could come closer to the enemy with the schnorkel than he could staying on the surface he did have to give it that an alert lookout whod spot a light gray uboat hull even against a gray sky wouldnt notice the hollow pole that kept the diesels chugging if he did spot it he might think it was a piece of sea junk and keep his big mouth shut what have we got skipper somebody asked the first time he put the question lemp heard it without consciously noticing it whoever it was asked the same thing again this time lemp did notice convoy theyre zigzaggingaway from us at the moment even tubby freighters could go as fast as the u did on the schnorkel what kind of escorts warships destroyers corvettes frigates i cant make that out at this distance i see twobound to be more on the far side of the convoy lemp muttered to himself if he was going to get close enough to fire at the enemy ships either theyd have to swerve back toward him or hed need to surface and close the gap before diving again he didnt much want to do that if he could see the enemy theyd be able to see him after he came up trouble was you couldnt fight a war doing only the things you wanted to do can we sneak up on them sir that was lieutenant beilharz both more formal and more optimistic than most of the submariners unhappily lemp shook his head afraid not he said and then prepare to surface beilharz grunted as if the skipper had elbowed him in the pit of the stomach the youngster wanted his pet miracleworker to solve every problem the sea presented well no matter what he wanted he wouldnt get all of it lemp wanted to be taller and skinnier than he was he wanted his hairline to quit receding tooactually he wanted it never to have started he wasnt going to get everything his heart desired either compressed air drove seawater out of the ballast tanks up came the u lemp scrambled up the ladder and opened the conningtower hatch as always fresh air air that didnt stink hit him like a slug of champagne he knew he would have to dive again soon no matter what british binoculars werent as good as the ones zeiss made but even so and he had ratings scan the sky to make sure they spotted enemy airplanes before anyone aboard the planes saw them how close could u cut it that was always the question then one of the petty officers yelped airplane he squawked sounding as pained as a dog with a steppedon paw scheisse lemp said crisply well that settled that go below well dive he knew the u had no other choice shooting it out on the surface was a fight the sub was bound to lose and if machinegun bullets holed the pressure hull she couldnt dive at all in that case it was auf wiedersehen vaterland the ratings tumbled down the hole one after another again lemp came last and closed the hatch behind him the uboat dove deep and fast he hoped the plane hadnt spotted it but he wasnt about to bet his life sure as the devil that splash was a depth charge going into the water the damned englishmen had a good notion of what a type vii uboat could dothe ash can burst at just about the right depth but it was too far off to do more than rattle the submariners teeth well were home free now lieutenant beilharz said gaily like hell we are lemp had more experience and before very long one of the warships from the convoy came over and started pinging with its underwater echolocater sometimes that newfangled piece of machinery gave a surface ship a good fix on a submerged target sometimes it didnt you never could tell splash splash more depth charges started down unlike an airplane a destroyer carried them by the dozen one burst close enough to stagger lemp the light bulb above his head burst with a pop somebody shouted as he fell over someone else called weve got a little leak aft lemp didnt need to give orders about that the men would handle it he waited tensely wondering if the englishmen up there would drop more explosives on his head they were waiting too waiting to see what their first salvo had done only a little more than a hundred meters separated hunter and hunted it might as well have been the distance from the earth to the moon splash splash those sounded farther away lemp hoped he was hearing with his ears not his pounding heart the bursts rocked the u but they were also farther off lemp let out a soft sigh of relief they were probably going to make it and they did even if they had to wait till after dark to surface by then of course the convoy was long gone the english had won the round but the u stayed in the game vaclav jezek pointed to a loaf of bread the french baker in laon pointed to the price above it the czech soldier gave him money the baker handed over the torpedoshaped loaf jezek knew only a handful of french words most of them vile sometimes you could make do without off in the distance german artillery rumbled vaclav started to flinch then caught himself if the nazis were hitting laon again he would have heard shells screaming down before the boom of the guns reached his ears they had plenty of other targets in these parts a truth that didnt break his heart they hadnt got into laon along with french african and english troops most of a regiments worth of czech refugees helped keep them out vaclav had fought the germans inside czechoslovakia hed got interned in poland figuring that was a better bet than surrendering to the victorious wehrmacht and hed gone to romania and crossed the mediterranean on the most rickety freighter ever built just to get another chance to let the germans kill him they hadnt managed that either hed done some more damage to them especially after he got his hands on an antitank rifle a frenchman didnt need any more the damned thing was almost as tall as he was it weighed a tonne but the rounds it fired each as thick as a mans finger really could pierce armor not all the time but often enough and what those rounds did to mere flesh and blood its bullets flew fast and flat and they were accurate out past a kilometer and a half just the shock of impact could kill even if the hit wasnt in a spot that would have been mortal to an ordinary rifle round the germans hadnt got into laon but theyd knocked it about a good deal stukas had bombed the medieval cathedral to hell and gone no using those towers as observation points not any more the nazis had blasted the bejesus out of the ancient houses and winding streets up on the high ground too the lower more modern part of the city was in better shapenot that better meant good loaf under his arm vaclav trudged past a citroens burntout carcass he wore new french trousers of a khaki not quite so dark as czech uniforms used his boots were also french and better than the czech clodhoppers hed worn out but his tunic with its corporals pips on his shoulder straps remained czech and he liked his domed czech helmet much better than the crested ones french troops wore the steel seemed twice as thick he had the helmet strapped to his belt now he didnt want that weight on his head unless he was up at the front he smiled at a pretty girl coming past with a load of washing slung over her back in a bedsheet she nodded with a small smile of her own but only a small one vaclav was a tall solid fair man when the french saw him half the time they feared he was a german even if he did wear khaki that he couldnt speak their language didnt help from behind vaclav someone did speak in french to the girl with the laundry she sniffed stuck her nose in the air and stalked away oh well the man said this time in czech they cant shoot me for trying she was cute she sure was sergeant jezek agreed sergeant benjamin halevy was a frenchman with parents from czechoslovakia fluent in both languages he served as liaison between the french and their allies parents from czechoslovakia didnt exactly make him a czech though his curly red hair and proud nose shouted his jewishness to the world jew or not he was a good soldier vaclav didnt love jews but he couldnt quarrel about that and halevy had even stronger reasons to hate the nazis than he did himself those german guns in the distance thundered again halevy frowned wonder what the fuckers are up to he said they arent shooting at me right now vaclav said as long as they arent they can do anything else they want there you go youre an old soldier sure as shit the sergeant said other guns started barking french s halevy listened to them with a curious twisted smile i wish we had more heavy guns around laon we could hit the nazis hard theyve got this long southern flank just waiting for us to take a bite out of it that would be good vaclav said hitting the nazis hard always sounded good to him if only he were doing it in czechoslovakia of course by the time the brass sees the obvious and moves part of what we need into place for a halfassed attack the germans will have seen the light too and theyll hand us our heads halevy said vaclav wondered if the jew had been that cynical before he became a noncom whether halevy had or not what he came out with sounded all too likely to the czech maybe we ought to move up without waiting for the brass jezek said halevy laid a hand on his forehead are you feverish no real proper old soldier ever wants to move up the bastards in feldgrau have guns you know the way he pronounced the german word said he could sprechen deutsch as vaclav could best way i can see to throw the germans out of czechoslovakia is to start by throwing em out of france vaclav said well when you put it like that sergeant halevy rubbed the side of his jaw tell you what talk to your czechssee what they think ill go chin with a couple of french captains i know find out if theyll go with it jezek found his countrymen had as many opinions as soldiers that didnt faze him as far as he was concerned germans were the ones who marched and thought in lockstep but most of the czechs were ready to give the enemy one in the slats as long as the odds seemed decent i dont want to stick my arm in the meat grinder thats all one of them said ano ano sure vaclav said if theres a chance though lets see what the jew tells me halevy came over to the czechs tents a couple of hours later the french officers say they want to wait two days he reported how come vaclav asked were ready now dammit they say they really are bringing stuff up to laon the sergeant replied yeah and then you wake up vaclav said halevy spread his hands do you want to attack without any french support well no vaclav admitted no artillery no flank coversure as hell that was sticking your arm in the grinder there you are then halevy said uhhuh here i am here we are stuck vaclav said ill believe your captains when i see the stuff between you me and the wall thats what i told em too the jew said but trains rolled into laon after the sun went down rattles and rumbles and clanks declared that tanks were coming off of them when morning rolled round again some of the metal monsters sat under trees while camouflage nets hidvaclav hopedthe rest from prying german eyes he asked now that theyre here why dont we attack today instead of waiting till tomorrow benjamin halevy shrugged a very french shrug if i knew i would tell you even going tomorrow is better than retreating i suppose so vaclav said darkly but if we attack today maybe well still be advancing tomorrow if we dont go till tomorrow weve got a better chance of retreating the day after im a sergeant halevy said what do you want me to do about it vaclav had no answer for that a corporal himself he knew how much depended on officers caprices tomorrow then if he didnt sound enthusiastic it was only because he wasnt the french dignitaries with the power to bind and loose set the attack for sunup more or less the germans would be silhouetted against a bright sky for a while that would helpnot much but a little at big guns in back of laon started bellowing more big guns than vaclav had thought the french had in the neighborhood maybe theyd moved those up the day before too if they had maybe theyd had good reason to delay the attack till now maybe maybe maybe big clumsy antitank rifle slung on his back vaclav marched north and east into the rising sun willi dernen was sleeping the sleep of the justor at least the sleep of the bloody tiredwhen the french barrage started hed dug a little cave a bombproof a veteran of the last war would have called it into the forward wall of his foxhole now he scrambled into the shelter like a pair of ragged claws shells kept raining down s s s he hadnt known the damned frenchmen had moved so much heavy stuff into laon life was full of surprises the big blond private from breslau could have done without this one somebody not far away started screaming the other landser didnt sound hurt just scared shitless willi wouldnt have blamed the other poor bastard if he was hed had to chuck his own drawers a couple of times and he hated artillery fire worse than anything else war brought while those packages kept coming in you had no control over whether you lived or died if one of them burst in your hole you were strawberry jam and it didnt matter one goddamn bit if you were the best soldier in your regiment if you came up against a poilu with a rifle or even a bunch of poilus with rifles well hey you had a rifle too and a chance what kind of chance did you have against some arselick throwing hot brass at you from ten kilometers away damn all that was what poilus were coming willi was mournfully sure of that the froggies wouldnt lay on a bombardment like this without following it up they might not have been eager when this war started eager or not they were fighting hard now the germans had done their damnedest to take france out in a hurry their damnedest hadnt been quite good enough now it looked like the frenchies turn another voice shouted purposefully through the din stand by to repel boarders that had to be corporal arno baatzs idea of a joke talk about arselicks awful arno didnt just qualify he had to be in the running for the gold medal every soldier in willis section hated baatzs guts if the french were going to blow somebody skyhigh why couldnt it be him the barrage kept up for what seemed like a hundred years in fact it was half an hour that crazy kike scientist whod fled the reich one jump ahead of national socialist justice had a point of sorts everything was relative as soon as the artillery let up dernen popped out of his hole in the ground like a jackinthebox awful arno might bewasan arselick but he was bound to be right the french would be coming willi wouldnt have been surprised if the drastically revised landscape in front of laon slowed them down he didnt fancy crossing terrain full of shell holes some as small as a washtub others large enough to swallow a truck you had to pick your way through and past the obstacles that gave the fellows whod lived through the barrage a better chance to punch your ticket for you panzers the cry rang out all up and down the german line willis mouth went dry just looking at the armored murder machines he couldnt remember so many french panzers in the same place at the same time sure as the devil the french high command had finally learned something from the way the germans handled their armor being on the receiving end of the lesson was an honor willi could have done without he nervously looked back over his shoulder where were the german panzers to stop this onslaught theyd always been thin on the ground in this part of the front the generals had concentrated them on the other wing it almost worked too but almost was a word that got a lot of soldiers killed one of the french panzers started spraying machinegun fire toward the german line idiotically a couple of german mgs fired back their bullets spanged harmlessly from the panzers thick iron hide and as soon as they showed themselves other enemy panzers gave them cannon fire till they fell silent it didnt take long then flame spurted from the first french machine it stopped short hatches flew open the driver radioman and commander bailed out one of them his coveralls on fire dove into a shell hole the other two got shot before they could find cover willi didnt know for sure whether one of his bullets found the panzer crewmen if not though it wasnt for lack of effort the german antitank gun knocked out another enemy machine a moment later then the surviving french panzers shelled it into silence on they came poilus loping along among and behind them after snapping off a couple of more shots willi ducked for cover he knew what was coming and it came a burst of machinegun bullets cracked past less than a meter above his head then he heard one of the sweetest noises ever there were german panzers around here after all one of them fired at the french machines clang that was a hit willi thought it came from a mm gun too he really hadnt known there were any panzer iiis in the neighborhood fire from the french panzers paused they had to traverse their turrets to bear on the new threat and their commander was also the loader and gunner they couldnt shoot fast no matter how much they wanted to the german panzer i and ii suffered from the same problem not the iii commander loader and gunner all fit within its angular turret because of that edge the panzer iii knocked out two more french vehicles in quick succession its hull machine gun sprayed death at the advancing foot soldiers and made them sprawl for cover but then the froggies started shooting back damn them some of their panzers mounted mm cannon the iii was armored better than the i and ii but willi didnt know of a panzer in the world that could stop mm ap rounds the german machine showed smoke and then flame willi hoped some of the crewmen got out a few panzer is and iis still tried conclusions with the french armor willi could see how that would play out even if it took a while he didnt like the ending on the movie that ran in his mind he didnt like retreating either but he just hoped he could do it without getting shot in the back then corporal baatz yelled fall back through etrepois that was the tiny village behind the stretch of line the section was holding willi had heard the frenchies who lived there pronounce the name awful arno made a horrible hash of it german artillery came to life then pounding the ground in front of the line that would make the poilus take cover if anything did trying not to think about short rounds willi scrambled out of his hole he ran hunchedover and zigzagged maybe it did a little good maybe not he dove into a crater a round must have dug a moment later another landser joined him boy this is fun wolfgang storch panted fun like getting all your teeth pulled out theyd gone through basic together they still argued about who hated awful arno worse wolfgang was more apt to speak his mind than willi who usually had a sunnier disposition but there wasnt anything to be sunny about not right now there wasnt fun yeah sure those were all the words dernen had in him storch fired a couple of rounds from his mauser thatll make em keep their heads down he said in some satisfaction cmon you ready to do some more moving i guess willi hoped hed find reinforcements rushing up through etrepois he didnt the village was only a few houses and a tavern marking a crossroads frenchwomen with impassive faces watched the germans retreat a few weeks earlier their own men had been the ones giving ground the wehrmacht was on the move then willid had his pecker up now now he was discovering what the frenchies had known ever since december when the german blow fell in the west if you had the choice between advancing and retreating advancing was better now there was a profound bit of philosophy shaking his head willi left etrepois behind him after so long on the ebro front madrid was a different world for chaim weinberg it was different for everybody in the abraham lincoln battalion for everybody in all the international brigades that didnt make the embattled capital of spain though the republican government had been operating out of barcelona for quite a while now an improvement over the trenches in the far northeast looking at the devastation all around him chaim said they had to destroy this place in order to save it didnt they mike carroll only grunted the handrolled cigarette in the corner of his mouth twitched fascists destroyed this fuckin place to destroy it he answered thats what marshal sanjurjos assholes do he talked slow like a foulmouthed gary cooper he looked a little like him too he was tall and fair and lean and rugged chaim short and squat and dark fit in fine in spain people stared at mike wondering if he was a german better to be thought a gary cooper lookalike no one in republican spain loved germans grimacing chaim shook his head that wasnt true no one in republican spain admitted to loving germans that wasnt the same as the other just as republicans had to lie low in land sanjurjos nationalists held so the jackals of hitlerism needed to smile and pretend wherever the republic still ruled one sides firing squads or the others took care of fools who slipped as far as chaim was concerned the nationalists massacred while the republic dealt out stern justice that somebody on the other side might see things differently bothered him not a pesetas worth somebody on the other side wouldnt have seen what the fascists had done to madrid spanish bombersand those of their italian and german allieshad been working the city over for two and a half years buildings looked as skeletal and battered as a barebranched forest at the tag end of a hard winter spring would clothe the forest in green spring was here in madrid but this town still smelled like death it would be a long time recovering if it ever did well that was what the international brigades were here for they were the best fighters the republic had chaim would tell people so at any excuse or none few spaniards seemed to want to argue with him they knew they had no military skill to speak of that shamed a lot of them maybe it should have made them proud insteaddidnt it argue they were more civilized than most many internationals including some of the abe lincolns had fought in the last war chaim and mike were both too young for that but like the rest of the marxistleninists and fellow travelers whod come to spain to battle fascism they were motivated they hadnt stood on the sidelines when reaction went on the march here theyd come to do something about it funny yknow chaim said looking away from a skinny dog snapping at something disgusting in the gutter they were set to take us out of the line six months ago when the big war fired up he jerked a thumb toward the northeast toward the rest of europe the world beyond the pyrenees yeah well mike paused to blow a smoke ring he owned all kinds of casual offhand talents like that bastards back there finally figured out we knew what we were doing down here better believe it weinberg had his full measure of the new york city jews passionate devotion to causes how could you not be enthusiastic about putting a spike in hitlers wheel plenty of folks even jews seemed not to get excited about fascism dumb assholes chaim thought scornfully artillery rumbled off to the northwest the nationalists were closest to the heart of the city there in fact theyd pushed into madrid in the northwest most of the university lay in their hands it had gone back and forth for the past couple of years whenever one side felt strong it tried to shove out the other now it looked as if both sides had decided to shove at the same time like a couple of rams banging heads only time would tell what sprang from that the university was less than two miles north of the royal palace chaim had been by the palace just to see what it looked like marshal sanjurjo had declared he would restore the king of spain if his side won that sure hadnt kept the nationalists and germans and italians from knocking the snot out of alfonso xiiis digs if he ever came back he could live in the ruins or in a tent like everybody else when chaim said as much mike carroll made a sour face if the reactionary son of a bitch comes back that means weve lost yeah well if we do we probably wont have to worry about it any more chaim said he didnt mean they would get over the border to france either the nationalists didnt take many prisoners come to that neither did the republicans chaim didnt know which side had started shooting men who tried to give up that didnt matter any more the spaniards might not make the worlds greatest professional soldiers but when they hated they didnt hate halfway he listened anxiously to find out whether any of the newly launched shells would gouge fresh holes in the rubble right around here in that case they might gouge holes in him which was not something he eagerly anticipated but the bursts were at least half a mile off nothing to get hot and bothered aboutnot for him anyhow if some poor damned madrilenos had just had their lives turned inside out and upside down well that was a damn shame but they wouldnt be the first people in spain whose luck had run out nor the last republican guns answered the nationalist fire those were french s the sound they made going off was as familiar to chaim as a telephone ring the republicans had a lot of them ancient models spain had bought from france after the last war and brand new ones the french had sent over the pyrenees when the big european scrap started all at once the neutrality patrol turned to a supply spigot when the french and english realized hitler was dangerous after all and then after the wehrmacht hit the low counties and france itself the spigot to spain dried up the republic would have been screwed except sanjurjo also had himself a supply drought the germans and italians were using everything they made themselves one of the explosions from the s sounded uncommonly large and sharp weinberg and carroll shared a wince chaim knew what that kind of blast meant the french guns mostly fired locally made ammunition these days and locally made ammo not to put too fine a point on it sucked chaim carried mexican cartridges for his french rifle he didnt trust spanish rounds german ammunition was better yet but impossible to get these days except by plundering dead nationalists a barmaid stepped out of a cantina and waved to the two internationals vino she called invitingly chaim surprised himself by nodding cmon he told mike we can hoist one for the poor sorry bastards at that gun suits carroll said you rarely needed to ask him twice about a drink very often you didnt need to ask him once the cantina was dark and gloomy inside it would have been gloomier yet except for a big hole in the far wall it smelled of smoke and booze and sweat and urine and hot cooking oil and faintly of vomitlike a cantina in other words mike did order wine chaim told the barmaid cerveza he tried to lisp like a castilian she understood him anyhow off she went hips working she brought back their drinks then waited expectantly chaim crossed her palm with silver that made her go away he raised his mug heres to em heres to whats left of em anyway carroll said they both drank mike screwed up his face vinegar hows yours piss chaim answered sure as hell the beer was thin and sour but save for a few bottles imported from germany hed never had beer in spain that wasnt you could drink it he did and mike got outside his vinegary red he raised his glass for a refill the barmaid took care of him and chaim he paid this time outside the notdistantenough enemy guns started booming again again nothing came down close enough to get excited about that was good enough for chaim hed go back up to the line pdq till he did what was that line eat drink and be merry he thought and deliberately forgot the rest of it chapter peggy druce positively hated berlin the philadelphia socialite had visited the capital of germany several times between the wars shed always had a fine old time then if you couldnt have a fine old time in the berlin of the vanished longedfor days before hitler took over you were probably dead if you could have a fine old time in this miserable land of blackouts and rationing something had to be wrong with you almost all civilian cars had vanished from the streets even the parked ones were in danger one propaganda drive after another sent people out to scavenge rubber or scrap metal or batteries that didnt mean the streets were empty though soldiers paraded hither and yon jackboots thumping when they passed by reviewing stands they would break into the goose step otherwise they just marched the characteristic german stride looked impressive as hellthe nazis sure thought so anyhowbut it was wearing soldiers even german soldiers were practical men they used the goose step where they got the most mileage from it in front of their big shots in other words when the bosses werent watching they acted more like ordinary human beings columns of trucks and halftracks and panzers also rumbled up and down berlins broad boulevards peggy took a small nasty satisfaction in noting that the treads on the tanks and halftracks tore hell out of the paving repair crews often followed the armored columns patching up the damage a berlin copa middleaged man with a beer belly and a limp hed probably got in the last warheld out his hand to peggy and snapped papieren bitte jawohl she replied jafuckingwohl she thought as she fumbled in her purse her german had got a lot better than it was when she first arrived in berlin getting stuck somewhere would do that to you she found her american passport and pulled it out with a flourish here she said or maybe hier the word sounded the same in english and auf deutsch the cop blinked he didnt see an eagle that wasnt holding a swastika every day he examined the passport then handed it back you are an american he turned truth to accusation he was a cop all right ja peggy was proud of herself for leaving it right there she damn near added nothing gets by you does it or very good sherlock or something else that would have landed her in hot water her husband always said she talked first and thought afterwards good old herb she missed him like anything he knew her all right what is an american doing in berlin the cop demanded he took it for granted that even though the usa was neutral americans wouldnt be progerman maybe he wasnt so dumb after all and peggy gave him the straight truth trying to get the hell out of here and go home as soon as the words were out of her mouth she wished she had them back too late as usual shed given another cop the straight truth not too long ago and hed hauled her down to the station on account of it if a desk sergeant with better sense hadnt realized pissing off the united states wasnt exactly phi beta kappa for the reich she might have found out about concentration camps from the inside if this policeman was another hothead if his desk sergeant was too you never wanted to get in trouble in hitlers germany and since the germans themselves were walking on eggs after a failed coup against the fuhrer you especially didnt want to get in trouble now the cop paused he lit a hoco like any other german cigarette these days it smelled more like burning trash than tobacco if you dont want to be in berlin to begin with what are you doing here he asked reasonably i was in marianske lazne when the war started peggy answered using the czech name with malice aforethought sure as hell the berlin cop said you were where give a kraut a slavic place name and hed drown in three inches of water marienbad its also called peggy admitted light dawned oh in the german sudetenland the policeman exclaimed how lucky for you to be there when the fuhrers forces justly reclaimed it for the reich well no peggy said for the first time the cops face clouded over see keep trying peggy jeered at herself youll stick your foot in it sooner or later trying to extract the foot she added i almost got killed for a wonder it worked ach ja in wartime this can happen the cop said rough sympathy in his voice everything would have been fine if he hadnt added with those miserable murderous czech brutes all around you should thank heaven you came through all right peggy bit down hard on the inside of her lower lip to keep from blurting something that would have got her sent to dachau or buchenwald or some other interesting place count to ten she thought frantically no count to twenty in czech the czechs hadnt been the problem the germans had shelling and bombing marianske lazne was one thingthat was part of war but the way the nazis started in on the jews who were taking the waters after overrunning the place no she didnt want to remember that none of it passed her lips herb would have been proud of her hell she was proud of herself the only thing she said was can i go one moment the berlin cop was selfimportant like most policemen the world around first tell me why you have not returned to the united states i was supposed to go back on the athenia but it got sunk on the way east peggy said ach so the miserable british they would do anything no matter how vicious to inflame relations between your country and mine the policeman proved he could parrot every line goebbels propaganda ministry spewed forth like almost everybody in the us embassy peggy figured it was much more likely that a german uboat had screwed up and torpedoed the liner like germany england loudly denied sinking her if anyone knew whod really done it he was keeping it a deep dark secret to peggy that also argued it was the germans everything was secret around here whether it needed to be or not that was several months ago though why have you not left since the policeman persisted because your government wont let me go unless i have full passage back to america and thats not easy to arrange not with a war on peggy said the nazis had come right out and said they were afraid shed tell the british just what she thought of them if she stopped in the uk on the way home shed promised not to but they didnt want to believe her maybe they also werent so dumb after all dammit the cop scratched his head you may go he said at last your passport is in order and you are lucky to be here instead of in one of the decadent democracies enjoy your stay he gave her a stiffarmed salute and stumped away peggy didnt burst into hysterical laughter behind him that also proved she was winning selfcontrol as she neared fifty she walked down the street when she stepped on a pebble she felt it her soles were wearing out leather for cobblers was in short supply and as stringently rationed as everything this side of dental floss some shoe repairs were made with horrible plastic junk that was as bad as all the other german ersatz materials what passed for coffee these days tasted as if it were made from charred eraser scrapings she started to go into a cafe for lunch food these days was another exercise in masochism the sign on the dooreintopftagstopped her though sure as hell sunday was what the master race called onepot day the only lunch available was a miserable stew but you paid as if youd ordered something fancy the difference was supposed to go into winter relief peggy had heard it got spent on the military instead that sounded like the kind of shabby trick the nazis would pull she was damned if she wanted to give hitler her money when hed use it to blow up more of france a country she liked much better than this one she had some breadwar bread and black but tolerable once you got used to itand apples back in her hotel room she hadnt intended to eat them today but shed forgotten about eintopftag she wouldnt put an extra pfennig in the fuhrers war chest and eintopf was always swill anyway tomorrow tomorrow would take care of itself shed believed that ever since she was a little girl if coming much too close to getting killed several times the past few months hadnt changed her mind nothing less was likely to joaquin delgadillo flattened out behind a pile of broken bricks like a cat smashed by a tank the republican machine gun up ahead spat what seemed like an unending stream of bullets not nearly far enough above him stinking communists he muttered into the dirt this machine gun happened to be french not russian joaquin couldnt have cared less like everybody in marshal sanjurjos army to the depths of his soul he was convinced the people on the other side took their orders straight from stalin after all werent the international brigades fighting in the ruins of madrids university city too and werent the international brigades a bunch of reds whod come to meddle in what was none of their damned business germans and italians fought on marshal sanjurjos side joaquin didnt think of them as meddlers they were allies and they werent spraying machinegun rounds right over his head maricones someone from his side of the line shouted at the internationals even groveling in the dirt the way he was joaquin giggled oh it wasnt that he hadnt called the republics foreign mercenaries faggots along with anything and everything else he could think of it was just that his own battalion co major uribe was the biggest fairy who didnt have wings most of the time joaquin would have had trouble understanding how a flaming queer could rise so high in the nationalists straitlaced army not with bernardo uribe the major was quite simply the bravest man and the fiercest fighter hed ever seen the only miracle with uribe was that he hadnt got his head blown off long since as long as he stayed alive nobody was going to care where he stuck his dick as abruptly as if someone had shut off a faucet the machine gun fell silent major uribes high sweet voice rang through the bruised silence look alive sweethearts were liable to have company for tea the first time he came out with something like that joaquins eyes almost bugged out of his head the second time the major did it delgadillo nearly pissed himself laughing now he took it for granted so did sergeant carrasquel joaquin never laughed at him carrasquel was the kind of guy whod tear off your head and then spit in the hole he was a good sergeant in other words majors right he rasped now those fuckersll hit us sure as the devil dont let em push you back joaquin ground his teeth something in his lower jaw twinged one of these daysif he lived if he ever got out of the linehed have to visit the dentist he feared that worse than he feared facing the international brigades hed seen a lot of war he knew what it could do hed never been to the dentist what you didnt know was always scary he did know that if sergeant carrasquel ordered no retreat somebody behind the line would be waiting to shoot him if he tried both sides gave troops that duty to make sure people kept their minds on what they were supposed to be doing the only trouble was that while you could call the men in the international brigades every filthy name in the book anybody whod ever bumped up against themand joaquin had along the ebroknew they were damn good fighting men between the devil and a hard place a rock and the deep blue sea as joaquin chambered a round in his old mauser he hardly noticed the phrases were all mixed up in his head he didnt want to look out over the brick pile that had sheltered him from the enemy machine gun if some rotten red with a scopesighted rifle was up on some high ground waiting to blow his brains out a grenade burst maybe fifty meters in front of him something clanged off his brick pile flipped up in the air and fell down a few centimeters from his face it was a bent tenpenny nail along with grenades from every country in europe both sides used homemade models a quarterkilo of explosives some nails or other metal junk a tobacco tin if you had one a blasting cap a fuse you could blow yourself up too of course but you could also do that with a factorymade bomb where grenades went off men wouldnt be far behind grenades werent like machinegun bullets they didnt fly very far joaquin popped up for a lookand a shot if he had one he hated to show himself yes he wore a helmet a spanish one almost identical to the german style but it wouldnt keep out a rifle bullet hed seen much too much gruesome proof of that sure as hell there was an international scrambling from one bit of maybecover to the next the fellow had red hair and foxy features wherever he came from he was no spaniard catching sight of joaquin he started to bring his rifle to his shoulder too late joaquin fired first the foxyfaced man from god knew where clutched at himself and started to crumple joaquin didnt wait to find out whether he was dead or only wounded down he went again some other hard case from the middle of europe or across the sea might be drawing a bead on him right now most spaniards on both sides were lousy shots without false modesty joaquin knew he wasnt he had been but sergeant carrasquel cured him of it carrasquel was a veteran of the fighting in spanish morocco he knew how to make a rifle do what it was supposed to do hit what you aimed at all the survivors in his squad shot well and so did the internationals some of them had learned soldiering a generation earlier in a harsher less forgiving school than even spanish morocco the younger reds had picked up their trade from the veteransand anyone who lived through a few weeks of fighting made an infinitely better soldier than a raw recruit joaquin wriggled like a lizard to find a fresh place from which to shoot no one before had been watching the rubble pile from which hed fired somebody would be now he was grimly certain of that you didnt want to give them two chances at you for that matter you didnt want to give them one chance at you all too often though you had no choice he raised himself up high enough to see over his new pile of bricks once upon a time this miserable wreckage had housed the department of agriculture hed seen a shattered sign that said so the ruins had changed hands a lot of times since then though joaquin gasped there squatted an international not three meters away the red looked just as surprisedand just as horrifiedas joaquin felt neither man had had the faintest idea the other was around they both fired at the same instant they were both veterans both experienced fighting men both presumably good riflemen they both missed fuck joaquin said fervently he grabbed a broken brick and flung it at the international the brick didnt miss it thudded against the other mans ribs and kept him from working the bolt on his french rifle the fellow said something hot and guttural then he jumped down behind joaquins rubble pile and tried to stick him with his bayonet with a desperate parry joaquin drove aside the long knife on the end of the other rifle hed learned bayonet fighting sergeant carrasquel made sure you learned everything that had anything to do with soldiering hed learned it but hed never had to use it before he knocked the internationals feet out from under him with the barrel of his own rifle then they were clawing and grappling and kneeing and gouging there in the dirt they were a couple of wild animals snapping for each others throats one of them would get up again the other wouldnt it was as simple and mindless as that in the end what else did war come down to a rifle cracked it wasnt joaquins when he heard it he figured it had to be the internationals and if it was he had to be dead and hearing the reverberations from the next world he prayed he would rise to heaven not sink down to hell but the foreigner was the one who groaned and went limp hardly believing he could joaquin shoved the mans suddenly limp body away from him he bloodied his hands doing ita human being held a shocking amount of gore there on the ground a couple of meters off to one side sprawled sergeant carrasquel rifle in hand you had a little trouble there he remarked only a little joaquin said as coolly as he could with his heart threatening to bang its way out of his chest after a moment he managed to add gracias de nada carrasquel said if you wouldve shot the asshole in the first place you wouldntve had to dance with him dance some dance joaquin laughed like a crazy man relief could do that to you then he lit a cigarette and waited for whatever horror came next luc harcourt sewed a second dark khaki hash mark onto the left sleeve of his tunic he sewed much better now than he had before he got conscripted work with needle and thread wasnt something the french army taught you it was something you needed to learn though unless you wanted your uniform to fall apart you had to make repairs as best you could the french quartermaster corps was unlikely to minister to your needs sergeant demange came by things were quiet in front of beauvais the way they had been on the border before the germans made their big winter push luc wished that comparison hadnt occurred to him he was proud that the poilus and tommies had stopped the nazis at beauvais and not let them get around behind paris the way they planned he was even proud hed made corporal which surprised him he sure hadnt cared a farts worth about rank when the government gave him a khaki suit and a helmet the gitane that always hung from the corner of demanges mouth twitched when he saw what luc was doing sweet suffering jesus he said theyll promote anything these days wont they it must be so luc answered innocently youre a sergeant after all you had to pick your spots when you razzed a superior after hed just razzed you was a good one demange wasnt just a superior either he was a professional old enough to be lucs fatherold enough to have got wounded in he was a skinny little guy without a gram of extra fat no matter how old he was luc six or eight centimeters taller and ten kilos heavier wouldnt have wanted to tangle with him demange had never heard of the rule book and knew all kinds of evil tricks outside of it he grunted laughter now even if it didnt light his eyes funny man you know what that twocentime piece of cloth is dont you its all the thanks youre gonna get for not stopping a bullet yet if they keep promoting me for that i hope im a marshal of france by the time the wars over luc poked himself with the needle nom dun nom he made demange laugh again this time in real amusement the war may go on a long time sonny but it aint gonna last that long well maybe not luc chuckled too it wasnt a bad line and a sergeants jokes automatically seemed funny to the men he led german s started going off in the distance luc looked at his watch yes it was half past two those shells would land on a road junction a kilometer and a half to the south when the boches werent trying to pull the wool over your eyes they could be as predictable as clockwork dumb cons sergeant demange said with a contemptuous wiggle of his gitane like were going to run anything through there at this time of day what kind of jerks do they think we are the same kind they are probably luc answered then they really are dumb demange said maybe englishmen wouldnt notice what theyre up to but were french by god weve got two brain cells to rub together eh most of us do im not so sure about our officers harcourt said that was safe enough any sergeant worth his miserable joke of a salary looked down his nose at the men set over him privates looked at sergeants the same way something sergeants tended to forget and demange had been a noncom a very long time oh officers he said youre rightofficers cant find their ass with both hands half the time but theyll have sergeants to keep em from making donkeys of themselves sure sergeant luc said and left it right there yes lieutenants and captains did need sergeants at their elbow but that said more about their shortcomings than about any great virtues inherent in sergeants so it seemed to a newminted corporal anyhow demange stamped out his cigarette just before the coal singed his lips then he lit another one and strode off to inflict himself on somebody else in the platoon luc lit a gitane of his own it wasnt as good as gitanes had been before the war everything had gone down the crapper since then captured germans loved french cigarettes though luc knew why too their own were even worse poor sorry bastards he thought puffing away and what they used for coffee a dog would turn up its nose at that horrible stuff almost as big as a light plane a vulture glided down out of the sky and started pecking at something in the middle of the kilometer or so that separated the french and german lines right here maybe it was a dead cow or sheep more likely it was a dead man if it was luc hoped it was a dead boche the germans had been falling back in these parts so the odds were decent it was closer to him blackbirds hopped across the tornup cratered dirt with their heads cocked to one side plenty of worms out thereand plenty of new worm food too even after the vultures ate their fill the vultures and the blackbirdsand no doubt the wormsliked the war just fine you could walk around out in the open sergeant demange was doing it odds were the germans wouldnt open up on you luc didnt want to play the odds it would be just his luck to have some eager german sniper itching to test his new telescopic sight right when he decided to take a stroll peeking out of his foxhole he could see germans moving around in the distance that had happened last fall too the boches had stayed very quiet in the west while they were flattening czechoslovakia the french had advanced a few kilometers into germany skirmished lightly with the wehrmacht and then turned around declared victory and marched back across to their own side of the border when the wehrmacht marched into france it didnt dick around if luc never saw another stukabetter yet if no stuka pilot ever spotted him againhe wouldnt shed a tear and if the war ever ended he would happily buy drinks for all the stuka pilots who hadnt spotted him demange came back just before sunset got a job for you corporal harcourt the stress he gave the rank convinced luc it would be a dirty job and it was when it gets good and dark take a squad to the german lines nab a couple of prisoners and bring em back for questioning the boys with the fancy kepis want to know what the damned boches are up to thanks a bunch sergeant luc exclaimed somebodys gotta do it i figure you have a better chance to come back than most after a moment demange added if it makes you feel any better im coming along i played these games in the trenches last time around actually it did make luc feel better the sergeant was a handy man to have around in a tight spot luc was damned if hed admit it though he rounded up the men hed been leading since he made pfc a couple of veterans and the new fish just finding out what the water was like the news thrilled them as much as it had him why us one of them whined because youll get your miserable ass courtmartialed if you try and wiggle out thats why luc explained maybe the germans wont do for you your own side you know damn well they will be ready an hour before midnight nobody bugged out before the appointed hour the french soldiers must have feared their own gendarmerie worse than the nazis sergeant demange said well get em at the latrine trenches easiest way i can think of to nab the sons of bitches cmon he made it sound easy of course sounding easy didnt mean it was luc had already had that lesson pounded into him they had to make it across nomansland without any german sentries spotting them the night was dark but even so then they had to get past the enemys forward positions luc was sweating enough to let him smell his own fear sergeant demange by contrast took everything in stride this is too fucking simple he whispered as the frenchmen crawled past the german foxholes no tenmeter belts of wire no continuous trench line nothing to it he sounded affronted as if hed expected the germans to do a better job and wanted to ream them out for being sloppy luc wasnt so choosy finding the latrine trenches proved easy enough something in the air gave them away the germans used lime chloride to keep the stench down but even that couldnt kill it clutching their rifles the frenchmen waited in the bushes nearby they didnt have to wait long a yawning boche ambled over and squatted above a trench demange hissed at him in bad german luc thought he said hed blow the nazi a new asshole if he didnt get over here right now that made the enemy soldier finish what he was doing a lot faster than hed expected to he didnt even try to clean himself he just yanked up his trousers and followed orders amis amis he whispered in equally bad very frightened french were no friends of yours shut up if you want to keep breathing after a moment luc added you stink abstractly he sympathized hed stunk worse than this a time or two he was just glad the prisoner didnt want to be a hero that would have shortened everybodys life expectancy a few minutes later another german stood at the latrine trench and unbuttoned his fly sergeant demange asked him if he felt like getting circumcised with a bullet the boche pissed all over his own boots after that he was amazingly cooperative we need more than two luc asked nah they asked for a couple and thats what well give em demange answered now lets get the fuck out of here luc had never heard an order he liked better the german captives were at least as good at sneaking across broken ground as the poilus herding them along they didnt let out a peep till they were inside the french lines they seemed pathetically grateful still to be alive luc knew exactly how they felt paris is worth a something one french king or another had said that or something like that a hell of a long time ago so much alistair walsh knewso much and not a farthings worth more the veteran underofficer had picked up bits and pieces of knowledge over the years but too many of them remained just that bits and pieces they didnt fit together to make any kind of recognizable picture staff sergeant walsh did know what paris was worth to the nazis even if not to that longago and forgotten at least by him french king it was worth everything and since they couldnt get their hands on itno matter how bloody close theyd comethey were doing their goddamnedest to ruin it for everybody else hed got leave at lastonly a fortyeighthour pass but fortyeight hours were better than nothing he could go back to the city of light he could drink himself blind he could watch pretty girls dance and take off their clothes he could visit a maison de tolerance where a girl would take off her clothes just for him if she happened to be wearing any when he walked into her upstairs room he could do all thatif he didnt mind taking the chance of getting blown up while he did it or the almost equally unpleasant chance of spending big chunks of his precious irreplaceable leave huddling in a cellar somewhere and praying no bomb scored a direct hit on the building overhead the luftwaffe visited almost every night now ever since it became clear the french capital wouldnt fall into germanys hands like a ripe plum hitler seemed to have decided to knock it flat instead with so much of northern france under german occupation his bombers didnt have to fly far to get there they could carry full loads every night drop them and go back to bomb up again for a second trip before daybreak all of which made paris the greatest show on earth the circus just had to find itself a new slogan paris was every pinball machine and every fireworks display multiplied by a million searchlights darted everywhere trying to pin bombers in their brilliant beams so the antiaircraft guns could shoot them down tracers from the guns scribed lines of red and gold and green across the skys black velvet even the bursting bombs were beautifulif you didnt happen to be too close to one when it went off paris had already taken a lot of punishment the arc de triomphe had a chunk bitten out of it the eiffel tower was fifty feet shorter than it had beenand a meteorologist whod been up at the top was never buried because they couldnt find enough of him to put in a coffin the louvre had been hit so had notre dame you needed to be determined then or maybe a little loopy if you wanted to visit paris some people said hitler had vowed to wipe the capital of germanys great continental rival off the face of the earth others claimed he was trying to terrify the parisians and the french in general into tossing in the sponge from what walsh knew of the corporal whod promoted himself fieldmarshal and from what he knew of germans that last seemed likely to him schrechlichkeit they called itfrightfulness if you went into paris with a fortyeighthour pass you had a respectable chance of not coming back on the other hand if you were anywhere near paris with pass in hand and you didnt go in well you might never see another chance and so walsh jumped into the back of a british lorry along with the other lucky sods whod wangled a bit of leave the lorry bounced over potholes the size of baby washtubs just outside of town it got a flat the passengers piled out to give the driver a hand changing a tire in the rapidly deepening dark was always an adventure walsh learned some bad language hed never heard before for a man whod been a soldier for more than half a lifetime that was almost worth the trip into town by itself hitler might hope to frighten the parisians into surrendering but he hadnt had much luck yet the city was blacked out of course but it seemed noisier than ever touts stood in front of every establishment shouting out the delights that lay beyond the black curtains quite a few of them used english they knew a lot of tommies would be here to blow off steam girls one of them yelled beautiful girls wine whiskey that all sounded good to walsh he pushed past the tout and into the dive the glare of the electric lights inside almost blinded him loud jazz blared from a record before the war there likely would have been a band how many of the musicians were playing to amuse their buddies in the trenches right now above the bar a sign said paris can take it in english and what was bound to be the same thing in french whiskey walsh told the barkeep and slid a silver shilling across the zinc surface coming up the fellow answered in tolerable english he was graying at the temples a black patch covered his left eye socket he didnt look piraticalhe looked tired and overworked ice why bother walsh answered with a shrug the bartender gave him his drink he hadnt asked for good whiskey he hadnt got it either he consoled himself with the reflection that he probably also wouldnt have got it if he had asked for it he made the drink disappear and put another shilling on the bar why dont you fill that up again but of course the bartender did he nodded toward the stage the girls they come on soon good enough pal walsh knocked back the fresh drink after a couple good and bad didnt matter so much any which way your tongue was stunned the girls werent wearing much when they started their number what they did have on sparkled and swirled transparently as they started gyrating on the little stage they werent so gorgeous as they would have been at the folies bergeresthis was just a little placebut they werent half bad and they rapidly started shedding their minimal costumes walsh pounded the bar and whooped so did other soldiers and flyers in a camouflaged rainbow of uniforms just before the girls got down to their birthday suits airraid sirens started screaming polylingual profanity filled the air burning it bluer than all the tobacco smoke already had after yelling through a megaphone in french the bartender switched to english cellar this way must go raids very bad what no doubt propelled half the fellows in the joint down into the cellar was the hope that the naked cuties would come down with them no such luck though the girls had somewhere else to hide some of the rowdierread younger and drunkermen started to go up and look for them then even in the cellar they heard the german bombs whistling down that stopped that no matter how rowdy you were you didnt want to meet explosives head on thunderous blasts staggered walsh and everybody else a few men screamed walsh didnt but he didnt blame them either it wasnt as if he never had when he was under fire then the lights went out more hoarse shouts rose walsh put his hand on his wallet just in case sure as hell before long another hand touched his there in the pitch blackness when he stomped his boot came down on a toe somebody yelped the hand jerked away in a hurry eventually the lights came on again the allclear warbled the crowd in the cellar trooped upstairs the bartender started serving drinks somebody cranked up the gramophone on came the girls except for ambulances and fire engines wailing outside the raid might never have happened except chapter behind sergei yaroslavskys sb columns of black smoke rose above wilno some of the columns had surely come from the bombs his plane had dropped well he said in some satisfaction were finally starting to get somewhere oh yes anastas mouradian nodded if he was anywhere near as pleased as sergei he hadnt bothered telling his face about it somewhere but where weve got the poles on the run sergei almost shouted to make himself heard over the drone of the sbs twin radial engines it took a while but now we do a week from now we wont just be bombing wilno well be shelling itsee if we wont the poles are brave but that only helps so much when you havent got the horsesor when the horses are all youve got mouradian nodded again hed heard the same stories sergei had about how polish cavalrymen squaretopped csapkas on their heads and drawn sabers gleaming in the sun had charged red army tanks you did have to be brave to do something like that didnt you also have to be out of your mind not many of the poles whod galloped forward galloped back again all right fine we have the poles on the run now what mouradian said after what seemed a pause for consideration his russian was fluent but carried a throaty armenian accent he sounded a little like stalin on the radio sergei thought so anyhow but mouradian got offended when the russian told him so if you listened to stas armenian and georgian were nothing like each other but if you listened to him explaining that he still sounded like stalin he also took a perversea caucasianpride in being difficult what do you mean now what sergei said we take back the chunk of poland pilsudski stole from us while we were fighting our civil war thats what and what do the poles do then anastas inquired better yet what do the germans do then the germans couldnt do what sergei suggested human beings werent made that way mouradian chuckled indulgently as he might have at a sixyearold showing off sergei went on but who cares what they do if the poles make peace with us the nazis have to get out of poland right theyre good at marching into places they arent so good at marching out again stas said which was bound to be true he added besides theyre still at war with us any which way they have been since czechoslovakia well so what sergei didnt like to think about czechoslovakia he and stas and ivan kuchkov had come out again which a lot of other volunteers hadnt hed first made the acquaintance of the bf there if he never saw another angular german fighter he wouldnt be sorry so hitler will find some other way to keep the fight going mouradian predicted he hates the soviet union worse than he hates france and england that held a nasty ring of truth yaroslavsky was glad to have to pay attention to his flying for a little while as he descended toward this new airstrip on what had been polish soil he may hate us but is he crazy he asked leveling off again does he want a twofront war germany almost won the last one anastas answered which was true even if unpalatable and it doesnt look like americas going to get into this one sergeis grunt could have been taken as one of effort because he was cranking down the landing gear a hydraulic or electrical system would have been easier on the pilot it also would have been more expensive and harder to build heand every other sb pilotwent on working the crank without american soldiers and munitions france and england likely would have lost the world warthe first world war it was now that didnt make soviet citizens love the usa american troops in the north and the far east had done their best to strangle the russian revolution in its cradle theyd gone home grudgingly only after their best turned out not to be good enough the bomber set down roughly and taxied to a stop groundcrew men trotted up as the crew scrambled out of the plane how did it go comrades the chief maintenance sergeant asked we put the bombs on target in wilno sergei said not much antiaircraft fire the poles are wearing down about time the sergeant said i dont know why they got so excited over wilno to begin withor why we want it come to that damn town is full of litvaks and jews he spat in the dirt before sergei could answer that or even think about it much ivan kuchkov stiffened like an animal taking a scent he cocked his head to one side listening intently then he said something worse than his usual matlaced obscenities messerschmitts heading this way sergei started running before he heard the planes himself so did everybody else within earshot of the chimp long before the pilot got to the trenches on one side of the runway he did hear the hateful roar of the fighters engines that only made him run harder he didnt run hard enough to get to the trenches before the s machine guns and cannon started stitching down the airstrip dust spurted up from the hits rounds slammed into the metal and doped fabric covering his sb he didnt look back he did a swan diveif you could imagine a spastic swaninto the zigzagging trench that maintenance sergeant landed in the trench beside him too goddamn close sergei said panting im lucky i didnt break my ankle jumping down here the sergeant didnt answer he wouldnt either a bulletor more likely a mm roundhad taken off the top of his head blood and brains soaked into the black dirt one second hed been running for cover the next it was over lots of worse ways to go pilots found too many of them if you got shot down you were liable to have a lot of time to think before you finally smashed bozhemoi anastas mouradian said poor bugger cashed in his chips all at once didnt he i was thinking the same thing sergei answered as the messerschmitts zoomed away at just above treetop height now he could smell the maintenance mans blood and the nastier smells that said his bowels and bladder had let go when he stopped one za stalina mouradian added somberly about every third red army tank and red air force bomber had for stalin painted on its side you fought for stalin and you died for stalin too he looked after the s they were long gone now you see the nazis havent dried up and blown away well no sergei didnt like to admit that oh he knew poles could kill him too but the germans damn them were much too good at such things he wondered what theyd done to his plane it wasnt burning anyhow a couple of bullets through the engines sure wouldnt do it any good though two of the tires on the landing gear were flat that would make getting it out of the way for repairs even more fun than it would have been otherwise theyd have to do it fun or not they couldnt just leave the sb in the middle of the runway not only did it clog soviet air operations here it sent the luftwaffe an engraved invitation to come back planes we can fight back against planes stas said and sergei made himself nod it was trueto a point the bf outdid anything the red air force flew both biplane and bluntnosed monoplane polikarpov fighters were last years modelsno year before lastsnext to it new machines that could meet the fearsome messerschmitts on even terms were supposed to be in the works but the hot soviet planes werent here yet and the germans had theirs now in a low voice mouradian went on what happens if the nazis throw their panzers at us sergei took a deep breath then immediately wished he hadnt it wasnt just that he smelled the butchershop and outhouse reeks of the groundcrew mans sudden demise but the dampearth smell of the trench reminded him of a newdug grave hed smelled that smell when they put his mother in the ground hitler wouldnt do that he protested remembering how stunned hed been then he may be crazy but hes not stupid hed really have a twofront war if he did well maybe i hope youre right mouradian said but so would we and we didnt the last time around only one thing was left for sergei to do then swear at the japanese he did it with a flair and verve that made even the chimp eye him in surprised admiration with any luck at all it would satisfy nkvd informers tooassuming ivan kuchkov wasnt one sarah goldman stared at the rectangle of yellow cloth her mother held it had crudely printed fistsized stars of david on it each sixpointed star bore four black hebraiclooking letters jude the jews of munster the jews of germany were going to have to put the stars on their clothes and announce to their aryan neighbors what they were but that wasnt the worst part oh no the worst was that the goldmans like every other jewish family in germany had to give up clothing ration points to get the cloth with which to mark themselves whoeverd come up with that masterpiece of bureaucratic chutzpah must have won himself a commendation from himmler or even from hitler himself they arent just nasty sarah said theyre ugly she tried to imagine wearing a yellow star on the breast of a jacket or blouse shed been shabby beforejews got far fewer clothing points than aryans but her mother was good at mending and making do come to that she wasnt bad herself how were you supposed to make do with a star that shrieked jew at the world i might have known it would happen i should have known her father said when he came back from his work on the labor gang that night he was thinner than sarah ever remembered seeing him he did more than the food he got could support most nights he fell asleep like a dead man right after supper but he somehow seemed to limp less than usual and his eyes were clear and bright what do you mean you should have known hanna goldman demanded who do you think you are heydrich or somebody god forbid sarahs father answered sarah nodded and shivered at the same time heydrich might have been the scariest nazi in business not least because he looked like such a perfect aryan samuel goldman went on but when the wehrmacht didnt roll into paris hitler and goebbels needed something to take peoples minds off the war jews are perfect for that the nazis can jump all over us and how are we going to hit back no one said anything for some little while the words held painfully obvious truth jews had always been scapegoats in germany the same way they had in russia when things went wrong somewhere else you could set people banging on the kikes then youd feel better and the people would feel better and if the jews didnt feel better well who cared about them banging on jews was the national equivalent of kicking your cat after a cop gave you a ticket while sarah got the dishes as clean as she could with cold water her mother cut out the yellow stars and started sewing them onto clothes after sarah got done washing and drying she sat down to help the radio blared out insipid music and then stories about how german bombers were pulverizing paris and the luftwaffe was singlehandedly driving the communist hordes out of poland pausing for a moment sarahs mother said if things were going as well as the newsmen say we wouldnt be sitting here doing this you think fathers right then sarah asked your father is right most of the time hanna goldman answered the trouble is he thinks that ought to do him some good samuel goldman had already headed for bed sarah shut up and went back to sewing her mother didnt usually sound so cynical that was more her fathers style but people whod been married a long time did have a way of growing together and if sewing yellow jewish stars onto clothes wasnt enough to turn a saint cynical what would be how could you sink lower than this sarah found out how the next afternoon when she went out shopping it was a mild even a balmy spring day she wore a white linen blouse probably the best one she owned or it had been the best one anyhow till the yellow star with the big black letters went onto her left breast people stared at her as she walked by of course they did she would have stared herself if someone else had put on anything that ugly it wasnt my idea she wanted to shout youre the ones who voted for the nazis you did this not me but that wouldnt have done her any good chances were it would have got her locked up at least she had the sense to realize as much she saw a few other jews out and about they had to be to get what they could in the scant time german regulations grudged them most looked as embarrassed as she felt a few wore the star with dignity and one or two might not have had it on not by the way they acted sarah envied them their coolness knowing she couldnt come within kilometers of matching it nobody pointed at her and jeered she didnt see germans pointing and jeering at other jews either she didnt hear anybody yelling lousy kike or something filthier yet had even the aryans had all the antisemitic propaganda they could stomach she wouldnt have imagined such a thing possible she wouldnt have imagined it but maybe it was a fiftyish man with a double chinhe looked like a mason or perhaps a plumberwalked down the street toward her as they passed he gravely tipped his hat and went on she almost tripped over her own feet in astonishment had someone from the ss seen him do that he might have wound up in a concentration camp at the least he would have got a stern talkingto it hadnt stopped him what was the world coming to sarah walked a little straighter after that another manthis one an obvious veteran of the last wartipped his hat to her before she got to the grocers she bought what vegetables she could and waited for the clerk to serve her as long as any aryans were in the shop he was supposed to take care of them even if theyd come in after she did but one of the women who had come in after her waved her forward saying go on dear you were next are you sure sarah feared a trap when ordinary politeness could scare you you were a jew in the third reich but the hausfrau took two steps back and waved her to the counter the clerk took her money and her ration coupons she got out of the grocery as fast as she could on the way home a middleaged mananother obvious veteran with a bad limp and a scarred facenodded to her and said congratulations on your medal sweetheart medal sarah wished she hadnt echoed it that only gave him the chance to let fly with whatever nastiness bubbled inside of him he pointed to the yellow star your pour le semite there he too tipped his hat then stumped down the sidewalk sarah needed a few seconds to get it when she did her jaw dropped the highest german decoration in the last warthe equivalent of the modern knights cross with oak leaves swords and diamondshad the simple french name of pour le merite for merit it meant and this stranger had punned off it inventing a medal called for the semite that took brains it also took nerve suppose someone other than a jew had heard what would have happened to him then nothing good to her amazement at supper her father reported the same joke from his labor gang it must be all over town then she exclaimed all over the country id guess father said things like that they spread faster than the grippe why bother with the stupid stars then if they only make people laugh at them and treat us better instead of worse sarah said youre asking the wrong person you need to talk to the fuhrer not me samuel goldman said but one thing did occur to me whats that sarah wondered if she really wanted to know if the party ever decides it wants to round up as many jews as it can were a lot easier to spot wearing our yellow stars oh in a way that made sense in another why would they want to do such a meshuggineh thing sarah asked because theyre germans and theyre convinced were not her father said sadly if theres more bad news from the front who knows what theyll do no one knew even the nazis didnt not yet that was the scariest part about it pete mcgill was in love this was his first timethe crushes hed had on girls before he dropped out of high school to join the corps didnt count so what if she was a white russian taxi dancer whod turned tricks on the side before pete got to know her if anything that only made him burn harder his marine buddies in shanghai thought hed gone round the bend hey man dont you think she still sleeps around for cash while you aint looking herman szulc asked in what were no doubt intended for reasonable tones whatever they were intended for they didnt fly with pete watch your mouth shultzie or ill rearrange your face for you he growled you and who else szulc didnt back down from anybody he was a leatherneck too more marines had to grab them and hold them back or they would have gone for each other this sucks pooch puccinelli said i like drinking with both of you assholes but now we cant go out together soon as we all try it youll have a couple and do your best to knock each others brains out he aint got no brains szulc said fuck you you dumb polack pete said fuck your somebody clapped a hand over his mouth before he could come out with anything irrevocable he went to see vera whenever he got off duty when he couldnt see her he thought about her the touch of her the scent of her the taste of her he had it bad so bad he had no idea how bad it was none so blind as he who will not see vera on the other hand could see very clearly she could see she had a meal ticket here if things went the way she wanted them to she wouldnt have to sell her time and her body any more she didnt do it because she enjoyed it she did it for the same reason a man built chairs to make a living shed always hoped someone would fall for her so she wouldnt have to any more she hadnt really expected itit seemed like something out of a soppy movie but she had hoped and now it had happened a rich american no less to vera all americans were rich even a marine corps corporal the rest of the girls at the golden lotus were madly jealous of her in a different way so was sam grynszpan the jew who owned the place like her though for different reasons he was what was bloodlessly called a stateless person no rich american was likely to fall in love with him he was short and squat and had a wide mouth and bulging eyes that made him look like a toad with five oclock shadow jealous or not he gave good advice dont let this one get away his office was tiny and cramped and stank of stale cigar butts dont worryi wont vera answered she spoke russian to him he used a mix of russian and polish with her flavored with yiddish and french they could both get along in six or eight different languages going around with pete was doing wonders for her english she could have been polishing her japanese just as easily tall busty blond women fascinated asians as she had reason to know to her these days men were men regardless of where they came from well almost shed never met even a japanese major as openhanded as pete mcgill you may really get to like himwho the hell knows grynszpan said maybe vera left it right there she knew pete was nuts about her she also knew exactly why the sweaty athletics they performed together in her little upstairs room he was a puppy he didnt want anything fancy he hardly knew there was anything fancy to want for vera that made life easy well easier she was made up and perfumed and wearing a blue silk dresseasy and cheap to do in shanghaiwhen he came to the club to get her two days later his eyes lit up as soon as he saw her that was exactly what shed had in mind wow babe you look great he said and kissed her on the cheek most of the men shed been with would have groped her just to show everyone around that they could she wondered if anybodyd kissed her on the cheek since she was ten years old offhand she didnt think so what do we do where do we go she asked in english that was the only language pete knew except for tiny bits of foul chinese well go to the vienna ballroom and we wont dance pete declared that was one of the halfdozen fanciest cabarets in shanghai it put the golden lotus to shame so did plenty of clubs a lot less fancy than the one pete named what you do win lottery vera asked she meant it she played the lottery herself ten dollars mex could win half a million odds were long but the lottery was legit people did win and did get paid when they won im not that rich but i didnt do bad had me four jacks when this other guy was mighty proud of his full house pete answered he started to reach for his wallet as if to show off how fat it was but then stopped you could land in all kinds of trouble if you flashed a roll in shanghaior in dubuque come to that the vienna ballroom sat at the corner of majestic road and bubbling well road the yellow brick building would have looked more at home in vienna than it did in the orient but that was true of most of the international settlement and the french concession hardfaced guards with leeenfield rifles stood outside the place they were probably soldiers from one army or another who hadnt felt like leaving china when their tours were up they only nodded to pete and his lady they were there to keep out the strife between chinese and japanese inside celis allstar orchestra blared away secondrate jazz with most of the tuxedoed musicians chinese and the rest from all over the world pete wouldnt have been surprised if some of the white players were exsoldiers too china got under some guys skins the way vera had got under his the maitre d sized him up a us marine in dress blues two chevrons not the best table expecting that pete slipped the guy a little something things improved less than he would have liked but enough to keep him from grousing out loud champagne sir the fellow asked you bet pete answered he winked at vera you get to drink the real stuff tonight babe she summoned up a blush he ordered steaks big enough to have come off the side of an elephant and rare enough to have still been mooing a couple of minutes earlier vera stared at hers in amazement but made it disappear as fast as petes waste not want not had been drilled into her since she was a baby when her mother and father made it to manchuria one short jump ahead of the reds when the japanese took harbin shed made it to shanghai the same way if she jumped the right way now some of the men out on the dance floor were european and american businessmen hanging on in shanghai in spite of the widening war between china and japan some were japanese businessmen and officers and some were sleek plump chinese collaborators in expensive suits whirling their partners around as if satchmo himself fronted the allstar orchestra every single oriental man danced with a white woman almost all of them with a blonde or a redhead pete tried to guess which girls were hostesses here which mistresses some danced better than others but that was his only clue the japs and chinamen all looked uncommonly smug see weve got the west by the short hairs they might have been saying a chinese man with gray at the temples came up to vera and said willst du tanzen even pete could figure out that much german shes my friend he said she doesnt work here he wasnt surprised when the chinese fellow understood english hed assumed the man would the chinese eyed him maybe wondering whether to make something out of it since pete was half his age and twice his size he decided not to one of his smartest business decisions ever he walked off muttering what probably werent compliments in chinese a few minutes later something big blew up a few blocks away the lights flickered and went out for a couple of seconds celis allstar orchestra discorded down into silence a woman squealed a man yelled merde then the power came on again the master of ceremonies a grin pasted onto his eurasian face called all part of life in shanghai folks next round on the house that made people forget their jitters in a hurry pete grinned at vera you know what babe no what she asked as she knew she should ive never had so much fun not dancing never she said innocently well never with my clothes on anyway he answered looking her up and down she managed another blush pete waved for more bubbly when three naked germans jumped into their stream in northern france turtles dove off rocks and frogs sprang away into the grass with horrified freeps theo hossbach didnt give a damn he had some violetscented soap hed liberated from an abandoned french farmhouse and he wanted to get clean he couldnt remember the last time hed had a proper bath the water was cold but not too cold you got used to it fast adalbert stoss and heinz naumann were scrubbing themselves too the panzer commander splashed stoss and pointed toward their black coveralls which all lay together on the bank you know youre out of uniform adi naumann said stoss splashed back what dyou mean were all out of uniform he had soap bubbles in his hair not like that naumann said you ought to sew a yellow star on the front of your outfit he laughed raucously oh fuck off stoss said without much rancor so i had the operation when i was a kid so what goddamn sheenies arent the only ones who do you know yeah yeah naumann didnt push it any more sergeant or not he might have had a fight on his hands if he had teasing somebody about looking like a jew was one thing acting as if you really thought he was one was something else againsomething that went way over the line theo had known adi was circumcised too you couldnt very well not know something like that not when the two of you were part of the same panzer crew he wasnt going to say anything about it though sometimesoftenthe best thing you could say was nothing that was how it looked to him anyhow if heinz thought otherwise well heinz was a sergeant sergeants got all kinds of funny ideas the other thing was theo wouldnt have wanted adi stoss pissed off at him if adi got mad he was liable to go and rupture your spleen first then feel bad about it afterwards theo wouldnt have wanted to take him on heinz naumann thought he was a tough guy hed made that plain if he thought he was tougher than his driver he needed to think again they all started splashing one another and wrestling in the stream skylarking like a bunch of schoolboys maybe by chance maybe not adi held naumann under water for a very long time no theo wasnt surprised the sergeant couldnt break stoss hold his struggles were beginning to weaken when adi finally let him go jesus naumann said gulping in air till he went from a dusky redpurple back to pink you trying to drown me asshole sorry sergeant stoss sounded so sincere he might have meant it i didnt know youd turned quite that color i thought id have to grow fins heinz said save that shit for the frenchies huh you bet adi watched naumann closely theo would have too if you beat somebody like that he was liable to try to get his own back but heinz just walked out of the stream and started putting his uniform on again whatever he was going to do he wouldnt do it right away with a shrug theo started for the bank too he didnt want his crewmates squabbling taking a panzer into battle was hard enough when everybody got along another man might have tried to get them to make up theo was too withdrawn for that he hoped they would be sensible enough to see the need without him adi seemed to have his head on pretty tight theo wasnt so sure about heinz the sergeant didnt just have his rank to worry about he also owned a touchy sense of pride more like a frenchman or an italian than your everyday german but the quarrel evaporated as soon as they got back to the encampment it reminded theo of nothing so much as an ants nest stirred with a stick people ran every which way theo watched two panzer crewmen bounce off each other as if they were in a chaplin film something had happened in the hour or so theyd spent in the stream he didnt need long to find out what the companywell never mind the company the whole damned panzer divisionwas getting pulled out of the line where it was going nobody seemed to know somewhere what the hell do they think theyre doing heinz naumann threw his hands in the air are they going to break through without panzers not fucking likely hey come on sergeantits the general staff adi said just like the last war my father used to tell stories about how the guys in the fancy shoulder straps screwed up half of what the landsers did more than half yeah my old man goes on the same way as soon as stoss agreed with him heinz stopped being angry that was good anyhow but the fuhrer was supposed to clean up that kind of shit what can you do theo said both his crewmates looked at him in surprise he didnt put his oar in the water very often what they could do was follow orders and they did along with the rest of the companys machines their panzer ii clanked back to clermont the nearest germanheld railhead adalbert stoss drove it up onto a flatcar they chained the panzer into place then boarded a jammed passenger car theo hated being surrounded by so many other people he would rather have made the train trip inside the panzer ii expecting your superiors to care about what you would rather do though was like waiting for the second coming it might happen but not any time soon they rolled back through france back through the low countries and across germany theo started to wonder if they would go all the way to breslau they didnt they went farther than that the train stopped at the polish border polish soldiers in uniforms of a dark greenish khaki and domed helmets smoother in outline than the ones german foot soldiers wore waved to the men in the passenger cars some of the germans waved back theo would have felt like an idiot so he didnt after a delay of about an hour and a half the train started moving againinto poland adi whistled softly well now we know whats up he said were going to give the russians a kick in the slats nobody tried to tell him he was wrong no wonder the poles were waving and smiling here were germans coming to do their fighting for them theo wouldnt have wanted to be a pole forever stuck between bigger meaner neighbors poland offered germany a shield hundreds of kilometers wide against the russians if the red army started biting chunks out of that shield didnt the reich have to show stalin that wasnt such a hot idea evidently and showing it with a panzer divisionor more than one for all theo knewwould make sure the reds remembered the lesson of course that could also buy the reich a much bigger war than it had now again theo wondered whether the fuhrer and the general staff knew what the hell they were up to whether they did or not he couldnt do anything about it but try to stay alive poland sure looked like perfect panzer country low and flat and mostly open every so often the train would roll through a village or town some of them were full of bearded jews many wearing side curls theo glanced over at adi stoss who happened to be spreading sausage pastepork sausage pastefrom a tinfoil ration tube onto a chunk of black bread circumcised or not he didnt look like a jew and he didnt eat like a jew either northeast to bialystokanother town packed with them southeast to grodno northeast again through lebeda to lida they detrained there the grayish sky and chilly breeze said theyd come a long long way from france the distant thump of artillery said they hadnt come very far at all german and polish officers shouted and waved at the panzer troops as they got their machines down off the flatcars the poles spoke german but not a kind that made sense to heinz or adi theo had no trouble with it living in breslau hed grown up around poles doing their best in his language where he had to he translated for his crewmates they went into bivouac outside of lida polish infantrymen stared at the panzers with fearful respect theyre glad were going up against the russians and not them adi remarked theo hadnt thought of that but it made sense as soon as he heard it sure as hell the poles were meat in a sandwich their best hopetheir only hopewas that the slices of bread hated each other worse chapter hey sergeant luc harcourt calledquietly so his voice wouldnt carry to the german line not too far away yeah sergeant demange said what dyou want he also kept his voice down and didnt show himself you never could tell when a german sniper had a bead on your foxhole the bastards in fieldgray were good at that stuff damn them whats up with the boches luc said theyre laying barbed wire like it comes out of their asses he didnt point toward the enemy either i wish it did thatd make em think twice whenever they sat down by christ demange said you want to know whats going on though theyve pulled a bunch of their tanks out thats what now the foot soldiers have to hold the ground by themselves theyre digging in the consdigging like mad in their boots so would i luc thought about it slowly he nodded he swigged pinard from his canteen the rough red wine made the world seem easier to take howd you find out whered you hear it he asked it sounded sensible but in war that proved nothing or maybe a little less i was bullshitting with a radio operator he told me demange answered said wed nicked some of their signals or something and i havent seen a tank over there for a couple of days unless theyre trying to royally screw us they really are moving their armor somewhere where i cant tell you tanks can flatten wire luc said think well send ours in and the infantry behind them ill believe it when i see it swear to god harcourt the high command still doesnt have its heart in the fight demange said disgust in his voice oh when the nazis tried to jump all over us we fought back but who wouldnt an offensive like that though in your dreams in mine too he wouldnt have talked to luc that way before the fighting started he would have told him to fuck off luc knew it he was proud of himself for earning demanges confidence and more than a little revolted at being proud again nothing in war made sense so what do we do now wait for the americans the way we did in luc inquired with a certain amount of malice aforethought screw the americans yes that was steam coming out of the sergeants ears cocksuckers were way late the last time i dont think theyre coming at all now heres hoping youre wrong luc said sureheres hoping demange answered but dont hold your breath oh and one more thing suppose we do send the tanks through the boches wire how far do you think theyll get how many mines have the fucking feldgraus planted under there that was another good question as many as they could was the answer that occurred to luc doubting the germans competence didnt pay luc knew he made a decent soldier now not least because the enemy was such a good teacher if you lived you learned supper turned out to be something the cooks might have learned from the enemy a stew of potatoes and cabbage and sausage that tasted like a mixture of stale bread and horsemeat the only thing that suggested it hadnt come from a german field kitchen was a heavy dose of onions and garlic before the shooting started luc would have sneered at it these days he knew better anything that left him with a full belly and didnt give him the runs afterwards was not to be despised after supper a private named denis boucher said talk to you corporal please he was a little roundfaced fellow maybe a year younger than luc a new conscript just out of training and in the line for the first time whats up luc asked boucher looked at him the way hed looked at sergeant demange when he was still a new fish luc still sometimes looked at demange that way to have somebody turn that kind of gaze on him to the rookie all noncoms were deities some grander and more thunderous than others no doubt but all deities just the same well corporal can we talk someplace where nobody can hear us the kid fidgeted in what looked like acute embarrassment come on out with it if we go off somewhere people will wonder if you talk to me right here theyll think youre asking about cleaning your rifle or something luc said youre so smart boucher blurted luc didnt think he was trying to butter him up that kind of thing hadnt occurred to him before i could get used to being the guy who knows stuff luc thought then the little fellow in the unfaded khaki uniform went on its about my girl im afraid shes fooling around on me while im away what can i do not even the guy who knew stuff had an automatic good answer for that one cautiously luc asked why do you think shes messing around some guys worried themselves sick over nothing and some guys didnt maries always been a flirt boucher said and we kind of had a fight before i had to go into the army that didnt sound so good luc spread his hands dont know what to tell you except this if she is messing around on you she wasnt worth having to begin with easy for you to say i love her denis boucher seemed as hot and bothered as a little roundfaced guy could get well if shes there for you when you get home everythings great and if shes not youve got the rest of your life to pick up the pieces and find somebody else luc said sergeant demange would have told the kid to shut the fuck up and soldier which was also good advice luc wasnt so hardened he also didnt point out that denis was liable not to get home or to come back so torn up that neither marie nor anyone else in skirts was likely to want anything to do with him no matter how true that was it wasnt helpful true it was the germans might not have any tanks in the neighborhood of beauvais any more but theyd left behind plenty of artillery it started working over the french lines in the middle of the night it had them ranged to the centimeter or so it seemed to luc as he cowered in his hole nothing you could do about artillery fire but pray it didnt chop you up the barrage stopped as abruptly as it started wounded poilus shrieked you could follow them by their screams as aid men took them to the rear luc grasped his rifle and stared wildly into the night waiting for the fuckers with the coalscuttle helmets to sweep down on the french trenches machine guns spat strip after strip of ammunition at the german lines to make the boches think twice maybe theyd already thought twice they didnt come out of their foxholes and trenches after a while swearing and yawning luc curled up like a tired old dog and tried to sleep no sooner had he closed his eyes or so it seemed than the artillery started up again it went on like that for the next several days random shelling at all hours of the night and day it wasnt anything like the usual methodical pattern of german fire maybe the regular german artillery commander had gone off with the tanks and left his halfwitted nephew in charge if so junior was a damn pest and denis boucher went missing one morning luc glumly reported that to sergeant demange maybe a german blew him to kingdom come he said but maybe he scooted off to see what was going on with his precious marie well if he did hes not our worry any more demange said let the military police get all hot and bothered about him and if he does make it back to the mangy bitch i hope she gives him the clap the milk of human kindness ran thin and curdled in demanges veins in lucs too at the moment he yawned till his jaw cracked like a knuckle i hope the boches artillery lets up during the day ive got to grab some sleep you get tired enough you can sleep through a barrage i did it myself back in demange said i believe you i aim to try luc said maybe the generals should have sent armor surging forward to drive the invader from la belle france luc couldnt get excited about that not right now he went back to his hole and snuggled down in it by now he was so used to sleeping on the ground hed decided mattresses were overrated exhaustion clouted him over the head with a padded blackjack an hour and a half later the german artillery started up again luc never knew it as he always did while he was atop the us conning tower julius lemp scanned the sun was going down far in the northwest at this latitude and this season it would rise again in the northeast in a very few hours it wouldnt stay dark long and it wouldnt get very dark the sun wouldnt sink far enough below the horizon for that this stretch of north atlantic between iceland and norway should have been deadly dangerous for a surfaced uboat then and it would have been had any royal navy ships been close enough to spot the u the submarine lay almost two hundred kilometers north of the faeroe islands the english had to figure no one in his right mind would care to visit this lonely stretch of sea lemp thought the english had a point you could die of boredom before you saw a freighter plowing across these waters even if you did it would be flying a danish or swedish or norwegian flag a neutral and so not a legitimate target lemp had already sunk one neutral what admiral donitz would do to him if he sank another did not bear thinking about resolutely then lemp didnt think about it or he tried not to the thought kept making him notice it like a chunk of gristle wedged between two back teeth he longed for transcendental floss to make it go away the ratings up there with him were also peering through binoculars as a wave crest pushed the u up a meter or two one of them stiffened and pointed smoke skipper he exclaimed where away lemp asked but he was already looking north following the mans index finger he needed to wait for another wave to lift the uboat before he spied the plume himself it was in the right quarter but he frowned diesels were supposed to make less smoke than turbines that hed seen this ships exhaust before the masts came up over the horizon wasnt a good sign is it ours or does it belong to the limeys asked the man whod first noted the smudge in the sky it had better be ours lemp answered by the time they got close enough to be sure it wasnt a royal navy ship would be pounding them to pieces he waited for the ship itself to come into sight then spoke to the bosun who stood behind the signal lamp give em the recognition signal matti aye aye matti altmark clacked the louvers three morse letters flashed out across the water a moment later three came back lemp breathed a sigh of relief that smoked tooeven heading into june it was cold up here you didnt want to fall into the sea youd last only minutes if you did alles gut lemp said noticing the sailors staring anxiously at him they didnt know what the answer was supposed to be lemp did thats the admiral scheer all right they grinned and gave him thumbsup he made himself smile as he returned the gesture the pocket battleship was loose in the north atlantic with any luck at all the royal navy didnt know it yet commerce raiders had kept england hopping in the last war these armored cruisers and their eleveninch guns were supposed to do even better this time around the idea was that they could outfight anything they couldnt outrun and outrun anything they couldnt outfight by all their specs they could do both those things they could get the royal navy scrambling like eggs they could disrupt commerce between the usa and england and between south america and england they could that didnt mean julius lemp thought much of them he was a uboat man from stem to stern from top to bottom couldnt submarines do the same job as big fancy surface raiders do it better and do it cheaper of course they couldif you asked a uboat man on came the admiral scheer she was a hell of a lot prettier than the cigarshaped ruststreaked u even lemp had to admit that she looked like a sword slicing through the waves but so what they didnt pay off on looks not unless you were a chorus girl his men kept staring at the pocket battleship through their field glasses everything is so clean one of them murmured everybody is so clean the submarine and its crew were anything but they wore leather jackets to hide grease stains they all smelled badyou couldnt bathe properly in this cramped steel tube face fungus sprouted on their cheeks and chins and lower lips and on lemps the only thing that distinguished him from them was the white cloth cover on his officers cap more signals flashed from the admiral scheers lamp captain will repair aboard matti said slowly i read it lemp answered tell them aye aye the uboats signal lamp clacked again the pocket battleship lowered a motor launch it chugged across to the u feeling like a man entering a strange new world lemp boarded it the petty officer in charge of the launch saluted him he had to remind himself to return the gesture there was no room for such nonsense in the submarines cramped quarters up on the bridge lemp did remember to salute captain patzig the officer commanding the admiral scheer as he should have the middleaged fourstriper wore decorations from the last war on the chest of his spotless blue tunic he eyed lemp as if wondering whether the uboat skipper would sneak off with silverware from the galley but his voice was polite enough as he said welcome aboard thank you sir you can see a long way from here cant you lemp wasnt used to being up so high patzig glanced down toward the u he smiled faintly we spot the enemy sooner yes sir that reminded lemp of something else sir you should know we saw your smoke before we spotted your masts you did patzig rumbled ominously as if warning lemp to take it back but lemp only noddedit was true the older man frowned well i shall have to speak to my engineering officers about that by the look on his face it wouldnt be a pleasant conversation what do you want with us sir lemp asked my orders say i am to cooperate with you in all regards he didnt like them but he had them were both out here for the same reason to disrupt shipping between england and the americas patzig said we would do better working together than separately sir lemp said and not another word why does this shit always land on my head he wondered bitterly but he knew the answer to that knew it all too well he got this assignment for the same reason that the u got to test a schnorkel under combat conditions the powers that be didnt love him and they had their reasons untested dangerous foolhardy well send out u if anything happens to her its no great loss captain patzig didnt seem to realize he was talking like an idiot when you commanded a behemoth like this a uboat skipper was less than the dirt beneath your feet ja he said together your torpedoes will be useful in sinking ships we capture lemp didnt explode holding himself in wasnt easy but he did it carefully he said um sir is it not so that your panzerschiff here also carries torpedoes he knew damn well it was so and he managed to embarrass captain patzig at least a little color came into the older mans cheeks which had been quite pale well yes patzig admitted but you submariners are the experts in their use after all with us they are strictly auxiliary and emergency weapons and what was that supposed to mean had the admiral scheer tried to torpedo some luckless freighter and missed it sounded that way to lemp he almost asked captain patzig had patzig come aboard his boat he would have but surfacenavy discipline stifled him here on the pocket battleships spotless bridge you can cruise at fourteen knots and keep station with us nicht wahr patzig said till we run out of fuel yes lemp answered youve got much more range than we do the other skipper waved that aside we can refuel you he said and so they couldno doubt about it the admiral scheers diesels would gulp where the u sipped and the surface vessel would carry far more fuel too patzig went on in case we encounter the royal navy your presence would also be useful there he actually made sense enemy cruisers or destroyers going after the pocket battleship wouldnt expect her to have a uboat tagging along lemp did say once you run up to full speed sir youll leave us behind we may not be able to do you any good when you need us the most patzig waved that aside we will do our best to lure the englishmen straight into your path the hunting will be good lieutenant return to your boat and prepare to conform to our movements no youre out of your goddamn mind no matter how much lemp wanted to scream in the senior mans face the words stuck in his throat he saluted stiffly zu befehl mein herr he said at your command sir and it was at patzigs command lemp wouldnt have done this on his own for every reichsmark in germanyno not for every dollar in the usa military discipline was a strange and wondrous thing full of foreboding he did a smart aboutturn and walked away it was a railroad track had hideki fujita seen it somewhere in japan or manchukuo he wouldnt have given it a second glance the sergeant shook his head no that wasnt quite true the two iron rails seemed uncommonly far apart the russians used a wider gauge than most of the rest of the world fujita had heard that was to keep invaders from the west from putting their rolling stock onto russian tracks he didnt knowor much carewhether that was true but it seemed reasonable to him but watching japanese engineers tear these tracks out of the ground and throw them into a roaring fire to bend the lengths of rail beyond repair was something else again wrecking the transsiberian railroad meant victory no more trains would get through to vladivostok and once the soviet city on the pacific was cut off and taken the rest of the russian far east would drop into japans hands like a sweet ripe persimmon the russians understood that as well as the japanese did theyd fought like demons to keep the kwantung army from coming this far two engineers picked up a russian corpse that lay on the tracks one by the feet the other by the arms they tossed the body a couple of meters off to one side the thump it made when it hit the dirt again sounded dreadfully final fujita walked over to it russian boots were very finefar more supple than japanese issue if this luckless fellow was anywhere close to his size but the dead man wasnt he was twenty centimeters taller than fujita and twentyfive kilos heavier and had feet to match his size large for a russian he would have made an enormous japanese shigata ga nai fujita mutterednothing to be done about it but it wasnt as if this fellow were the only dead russian close by oh no fujita and his countrymen had plenty of corpses to strip and there were plenty of japanese corpses to dispose of too the dead soldiers souls would go to yasukuni shrine where japan would honor them for all eternity that was a great deal but somehow it didnt seem quite enough to fujita right this minute maybe that was simple relief at coming through another fight unhurt he hoped so he wanted to give his fallen comrades all the respect they deserved but he didnt want to join them in death and the russians even though pushed away from their precious railroad hadnt given up artillery from back in the woods to the northeast started screaming in fujita stopped worrying about anyone elses boots and started worrying about getting blasted out of his he jumped into the closest foxhole a dead russian already lay in there crumpled like a broken doll he rolled himself into a ball and hoped the shelling would let up soon it did but then two or three polikarpov biplane fighters strafed the japanese at not much more than treetop height they looked oldfashioned alongside the japanese planes that fought them in the air but they got the job done one of the engineers whod chucked the body off the tracks reeled away clutching at his chest he slumped to the muddy ground fujita feared he wouldnt get up again japanese fighters showed up ten minutes after the russians had zoomed away fujita watched them buzz around like angry bees looking for someone to sting when they didnt find anybody they flew away bastards he said what were they good for if they came to the party late sooner or later the reds would run out of gas for their planes and shells for their guns that was the whole point to cutting the railroad sooner or later yes but not yet dammit not yet then japanese bombers droned past flying much higher than the fighters had fujita cocked his head listening to the distant thunder of explosions from their bombs yes those came from the general direction from which the russian guns had been firing japanese flyers would presently claim theyd silenced those guns till the artillery opened up again fujita was willing to admit the bomber pilots did try he wasnt willing to admit anything more than that he needed to get rid of the dead russian keeping company with him the poor devil was just starting to stink but that problem would get worse in a hurry grunting with effort fujita wrestled the body out of the hole he was about to drag it downwind when he noticed the dead mans boots damned if they werent about his size he wrestled one off the corpse and tried it on it fit better than the boots his own countrys quartermasters had given him and the leather really was gloveflexible he stripped off the russians other boot and put that on too as he walked around in the new pair a broad smile spread across his face he could kiss blisters goodbye the dead man didnt complain he wasnt even wearing socksjust strips of cloth wrapped around his feet like puttees fujita had seen other russians who did the same thing they were welcome to the style as far as he was concerned his sockstabiswere like mittens with a separate space for his big toe on each foot when the weather got warm he could wear sandals with them he wondered if the weather in siberia ever got that warm he wouldnt bet on it it was warm enough for mosquitoes right now siberian mosquitoes were numerous savage and large a japanese joke said one of them had landed at an airstrip and groundcrew men pumped a hundred liters of gasoline into it before they realized what it was fujita thought it was a joke you didnt notice the bites when they happened if you didnt feel the mosquito walking on your skin or see it there the damn thing would fly away happy youd feel it later thoughyoud itch for a week scratching only made things worse too back of the line japanese soldiers lit candles of camphor or citronella you couldnt do it at the front the scent wafting on the wind told the russians where you were they were like animals theyd take clues a civilized man a japanese man wouldnt even notice and theyd use them to kill you an officers whistle squealed like an angry shoat advance lieutenant hanafusa shouted we have to push their guns away from the railroad line right now fujita wondered a sergeant couldnt ask something like that out loud not unless he wanted to get busted back to privateor more likely shot for cowardice youd disgrace your whole family if you did your father wouldnt be able to hold his head up at work your mother couldnt show her face at the vegetable market any more your little sister would never find a husbandor maybe worse shed marry a latrine cleaner all that went through fujitas head in less than a heartbeat and so instead of asking questions he scrambled out of his hole shouted my squadadvance and ran forward clutching his rifle in hands whose palms were wet with fearsweat into the woods on the far side of the tracks he wasnt alone his squadand the rest of the companywent in there with him that made things a little easier he didnt know whether misery loved company but it needed company were there russians in the woods of course there were there always were their damned machine guns started yammering right away cleverly hidden soldiers would let you run past then shoot you in the back they died after that of course but they didnt seem to care they were so indifferent to death fujita wondered if they were human he got a flash of something moving bounding away from the racket of combat as fast as it could he started to bring his arisaka up to his shoulder then checked the motion his jaw dropping in awe damned if there arent he said softly arent what sergeant asked a soldier at his elbow his cheeks heated he hadnt meant to be overheard tora he answered that was a tiger over there he pointed ive seen a tiger a live tiger you should have killed it the other soldier said thatd be a hell of a souvenir a tigers skin i hope so i wish id seen it he sounded jealous and wistful but fujita shook his head it was too beautiful i couldnt hed seen too much of war here and in mongolia war was ugly the ugliest thing there was and war he was certain had nothing to do with tigers hello peggy how are you the receptionist at the us embassy in berlin greeted peggy druce with an allamerican smile and a harsh midwestern accent that would have set her teeth on edge back in the states but sounded heavenly here at the heart of the third reich hello lucinda hows your daughter these days peggy had been stuck in berlin so long she was on a firstname basis with everybody at the embassy and knew everybodys problems lucindas smile got wider shes much better thanks those new pills those waddayacallems sulfas fixed her up like magici just got a letter from her and her husband finally has a job hes riveting in an airplane factory that opened up a coupla miles from where they live that does sound good peggy said an airplane factory opening up in omahashe thought it was omaha that sounded strange maybe fdr had decided the united states did need to be ready for trouble just in case maybe hed persuaded congress that that might be a pretty decent idea having met war facetoface peggy thought you had to be a jackass not to see it was a good idea but when you were talking about congressmen lucinda continued and mr jenkins is waiting for you go right on upstairs to his office she chuckled maybe you wont come around here all the time in a while maybe youll be on your way home home it sounded like a dream to peggya receding dream one she couldnt remember so well as she wished she could she headed for the stairs trying to drum up optimism inside herself to believe she wasnt just going through the motions one more time it wasnt easy nothing had been easy since german shells started falling on marianske lazne constantine jenkinsundersecretary goldfilled romanlooking letters on a black nameplate on a door at the moment it was a closed door peggy fumed it shouldnt have been she was right on time and lucinda had said the undersecretary was ready peggyd always been one to grab the bull by the horns she knocked briskly the door opened constantine jenkins looked out at her midthirties tall thin pale almost handsome oh yes he said his voice low and wellmannered if he wasnt a queer peggyd never seen one give me five minutes please somethings come up those five minutes stretched to fifteen peggy was ready to snarl maybe to bite then the door opened again out came a short trim graying man with four gold stripes on the sleeves of his uniform the naval attache gave her a brusque nod and a murmured sorry about that then hurried down the corridor come on in jenkins said still a little irkedmaybe more than a littlepeggy went on in what was that all about she snapped business i had to take care of he answered which told her exactly nothing he held out a package of chesterfieldsthey came from the states through sweden and switzerland in diplomatic pouches cigarette oh god yes if anything could fix peggys mood in a hurry real tobacco could what you were able to buy in germany got lousier by the day she let him light the coffin nail for herhe had exquisite manners smooth flavorful smoke filled her lungs wow she said you put up with junos for a while you forget what the real stuff is like and junos are pretty good at least next to the other german brands so ive heard he said coolly with those diplomatic pouches he didnt have to pollute his lungs with german tobacco or whatever it was after he got a chesterfield of his own going he asked what can i do for you today tell me how to get to stockholm or geneva or lisbon or anywhere else thatll let me get back to america peggy answered he sighed out smoke im sorry i wish i could believe me you arent the only american who wants to be somewhere else he paused i wouldnt recommend lisbon not when you have to cross spain to get there okay the hell with lisbon how about copenhagen oslo athens even for crying out loud jesus id take belgrade right now anywhere but here peggy said jenkins spread wellmanicured hands difficult to arrange for anyone more difficult for you because you havent so much as tried to hide how you feel about the nazis wouldnt that make them want to get rid of me she demanded not when they fear what youll say once you get to a neutral country the undersecretary replied peggy took a last angry puff on the chesterfield and stubbed it out in a glass ashtray on jenkins desk german officials had told her the same thing shed made them all kinds of promises they hadnt believed her maybe they werent so dumb as she wished they were as it happens jenkins said i have two tickets for the opera tonight my ah friend has come down sick would you care to go with me she looked at him in surprise maybe he wasnt so queer as all that noshe would have bet dollars to acorns his friend was a pointer not a setter and he was at least ten years younger than she was probably fifteen he couldnt be after getting her into bed even if he was she was sure she could take care of herself thanks she said thanks very much i would like that good enough he said ill come by your hotel about six then we can get some supper before the performance its wagner surprise peggy said they both chuckled wagner was hitlers favorite of course and what point to being fuhrer if you couldnt get your favorites up on stage hitler could and he did only after peggy left the embassy did she realize the opera invitation had also let constantine jenkins get her out of his hair much faster than he would have otherwise he might be a fairy but he knew something about diplomacy she put on a blue silk gown that did nice things for her figure and played up her eyes it was the fanciest one she had with her which meant it was also the one shed worn least jenkins showed up in the lobby at a quarter to six looking dashing in black tie not even the blandness of a german dinner took the edge off things peggy drank schnapps to make sure nothing would she was pleasantly buzzed when they walked over to the staatsoper berlin lay almost as far north as edmonton alberta you didnt think about that most of the time but you did when you saw how long light lingered as spring neared summer even so it would be dark when they came out getting back in the blackout might not be much fun the tickets were for the front row of the first balcony peggy peered down into the orchestra section as nazi big wigs and their ladies took their seats jenkins handed her chromed opera glasses goebbels and goring are here he said i dont see the fuhrer tonight peggy wasnt disappointed she did wonder about security if someone up here pulled out a submachine gun instead of opera glasses but nobody did then the lights dimmed the opera was tannhauser it was early wagner it had raised a sensation when it was new but it hadnt been new for a long time it didnt beat you over the head with rocks the way the later stuff did so peggy would have said anyhow a real wagner lover might have had a different opinionas if she cared she poured down champagne during intermission that let her applaud more than she would have otherwise when the performance ended the singers aimed their bows at the party bonzen not the galleries they knew who buttered their breadnot that anybody in germany saw much butter these days so how are we going to find the hotel she asked as she and constantine jenkins walked out into pitch blackness some germans wore lapel buttons coated with phosphorescent paint so people wouldnt bump into them in the dark she wished she had one here jenkins also went without he took her hand finding it unerringly despite the lack of light stick with me ill get you home damned if he didnt maybe he was part cat to see in the dark or part bloodhound to sniff his way back getting back to the hotel so easily seemed worth celebrating with a drink in the bar one drink in the bar became two two became several when peggy went up to the room at last it seemed the most natural thing in the world that he should go up with her he was a good deal steadier on his feet than she was on hers and when she woke up the next morning with him beside her smiling she wondered what the hell shed gone and done she didnt wonder long not when all she had on was her birthday suit she sure wondered what shed do next though chapter down roared the stuka the sirens in the landinggear legs screamed french troops scattered hansulrich rudel saw them through a red haze of acceleration but see them he did his thumb came down on the firing button the forward machine gun hammered a few of the running frenchmen fell some of the poilus had nerve they stood there and fired at the ju as it roared by only a couple of hundred meters over their heads you couldnt mistake muzzle flashes for anything else most of the time they missed the stuka went mighty fast and they wouldnt lead it enough but all those bullets in the air were dangerous ground fire had brought down airplanesnot often but it had not today not this stuka it climbed again as hansulrich yanked back on the stick see any fighters he asked albert dieselhorst none of ours answered the noncom in the rearfacing seat a moment later he added none of theirs either theirs were the ones hansulrich worried about stukas were marvelous for shooting up and bombing enemy ground targets when it came to airtoair combat they were too slow to run and too clumsy to dodge a lot of good men had died before the luftwaffe decided to admit that although hansulrich had already been shot down once he didnt intend to die like that unlike plenty of other cocky cockproud pilots he didnt intend to be stabbed by a cuckolded husband either he aimed to have grandchildren and greatgrandchildren gathered around his bed so he could tell them something interesting and memorable as he went he was a ministers son all right he saw french panzers moving toward clermont he reported them by radiothat was all he could do a stuka had to score a direct hit with a bomb to harm a panzer and a direct hit on a moving target was easier imagined than done on the way back to his airstrip german flak opened up on him he was tempted to strafe the idiots whod started shooting a ju was about the most recognizable plane in the world for gods sake speaking of good men how many were dead because their own friends murdered them too damned manyhe knew that even through the speaking tube sergeant dieselhorsts voice sounded savage you ought to go back there and shoot those bastards up i thought about it rudel answered but at least they missed that just makes them incompetent bastards dieselhorst said would you rather theyd shot us down hansulrich asked dieselhorst didnt answer which was probably a good thing the landing wasnt smooth but a stuka was built to take it rudel went into colonel steinbrenners tent to report we got your news about the panzers steinbrenner said good job the ground forces are doing what they can to stop the froggies danke sir hansulrich said stuka pilots ought to be able to do more about panzers from the air were fine against softskinned vehicles but armor he spread his hands palms up as if to say it was hopeless i dont know what to tell you the wing commander replied machine guns arent heavy enough and you have to be lucky with bombs youd need to mount a cannon or something to do yourself any good by the way he said it the idea was impossible the more rudel thought the more he figured it wasnt you know sir we could do that he said excitement kindling in his voice you could mount a mm gun under each wing instead of the bomb that usually goes there youd need a magazine for the ammo instead of loading it round by round and youd want to use electrical firing not contact fuses from the ground artillery once you had those a stuka would turn into a panzerbuster like nothing anybodys ever seen youre serious steinbrenner said slowly staring across the table with folding legs that did duty as his desk damn right i am uh sir when hansulrich swore he was very serious indeed id like to talk to the engineers and the armorers see what they think of the idea what if they say no the wing commander asked hansulrich only shrugged how am i worse off colonel steinbrenner blinked then started to laugh well youve got me there go aheadtalk to them see what happens maybe theyll come up with something or maybe theyll tell you youre out of your tree who knows head full of his grand new idea rudel hurried away the first person he talked to was sergeant dieselhorst the rear gunner and radioman rubbed his chin thatd be a nice trick if they can do it he said can they i dont know hansulrich said i sure want to find out though he interrupted the armorers skat game they heard him out then looked at one another that just might work one of them said when he finished mount the breech in a sheetmetal pod so its more aerodynamic that hadnt even occurred to hansulrich wonderful he exclaimed could you fellows rig up a gun like that they looked at one another again the fellow whod spoken beforehis name was lotharsaid well sir thats not gonna be so easy were luftwaffe guys you know how do we get our hands on a couple of infantry cannon oh that hadnt occurred to hansulrich either he wondered why not probably because he was so hot for the idea he ignored problems other people didnt though he supposed that was good well most of him did every once in a while you wanted things to be easy talk to the engineers sir lothar said theyve got more pull than we do if anybody can get hold of that kind of shituh stufftheyre the guys so rudel talked to the engineers they visited forward airstrips every so often they wanted to find out how the stukas were doing in combat so they could get ideas for improving the planes the factories would turn out next month or next year a few weeks earlier hansulrich wouldnt have believed that the war could still be going on next year now however much he regretted it he realized anything was possible they heard him out when he started they listened with glazed eyes and fixed smiles the way an adult might listen to an eightyearold talking about how he intended to fly to the moon on an eagles back but he watched them come to life as he talked when he finished one of them said i will be damned we could probably do that and it sounds like itd work if we did it does another engineer said he might have been announcing miracles you dont need to sound so surprised hansulrich said sharply lieutenant we hear schemes like this wherever we go well not like this but schemes the second engineer corrected himself most of them are crap nothing else but somebody has a harebrained notion and he doesnt see its harebrained cause hes harebrained himself and so he tries to ram it down our throats and he gets pissed off when we tell him all the reasons it wont work the first engineer added i mean really pissed off a rear gunner took a swing at me when i told him we couldnt give a stuka an electronic rangefindertheyre too big and too heavy for an airplane to carry one of these days maybe but not yet an electronic rangefinder hansulrich asked intrigued in spite of himself you dont know about those the engineer said rudel shook his head the man lookedrelieved in that case forget i said anything the fewer people who do know the better hansulrich started to complain then decided not to plenty of projects were secret if the frenchmen shot up his plane the next time he went out and they made him bail out and captured him the less he could tell them the better off the reich would be the engineer was dead right about that hansulrich did say but you think my idea is practical hell with me if i dont the man answered hansulrich frowned he didnt like other peoples casual profanity the engineer didnt care what he thought the fellow went on the ammunition may get a little interesting but thats the only hitch i see we could adapt the firing mechanism from the s mm cannon his colleague said hmm maybe we could the other man said their technical colloquy made as little sense to hansulrich as if theyd suddenly started spouting hindustani but he understood the key point they thought the panzerbusting gun would work and they thought it was worth working on he wondered how long they would need to come up with a prototype and he wondered if they would let him try it out come on damn you joaquin delgadillo gestured with his rifle get moving if you were just a stinking spanish traitor by god id shoot you right here the international sitting in the dirt glared at him he wouldnt hold a rifle any time soon a bullet had smashed his right hand blood soaked into the dirty bandage covering the wound what will you do to me instead he asked some kind of thick central european accent clotted his castilian it wasnt german joaquin had heard german accents often enough to recognize them but he couldnt have told a czech from a hungarian or a pole theyll want to question you he answered to torture me you mean the red said delgadillo shrugged not my problem if you dont start walking right now i will shoot you and ill laugh at you while you die too your leaders are fooling you no matter what you think youre fighting for you wont get it if that fat slob of a sanjurjo wins the international said all youll get isuh aretyranny and misery he came very close to dying then joaquin nearly shot him the main thing that kept him from pulling the trigger was the thought that the reds smashed hand made a good start on torture by itself the interrogators could just knock it around a little and the international would sing like a little yellow bird from the canaries if the fellow hadnt got up when delgadillo jerked the rifle again he would have plugged him and that would have been that but the international did he stumbled off toward the nationalists rear joaquin close enough behind him to fire if he tried anything cute a wounded right hand so what he might be a lefty you never could tell especially with the reds a bullet cracked past a couple of meters over their heads they both bent their knees to get farther away from it so you genuflect in that church do you joaquin said not many who dont the international answered i want to live go aheadcall me a fool if you wanted to live you should have stayed away from spain joaquin said this isnt your fight freedom is everybodys fight or it ought to be the central european said if you dont have freedom what are you the jefes donkey thats what with a load on your back and somebody walking beside you beating you with a stick that scream in the air was no ordinary bullet abajo delgadillo yelled as he hit the dirt the international flattened out too he yowled like a wildcat when he banged the wounded hand but he didnt pop up again the way a lot of men would have the shellit had to be a burst less than a hundred meters away fragments whined viciously overhead the nationalists werent going to take madrid away from the republic not like this they werent in fact the republicans and their foreign friends had pushed marshal sanjurjos men out of the university at the northwestern edge of town it was embarrassing to say nothing of infuriating which only made the international luckier still that joaquin hadnt shot him out of hand sergeant carrasquel would have told him he was wasteful if he had that was another good reason to hold back no one in his right mind wanted a sergeant giving him a hard time when no more shells fell in the neighborhood joaquin cautiously rose get up he snapped what else am i going to do the red pushed himself upright using his left hand and both feet joaquin made him open the good handhe might have hidden a rock in there he might have but he hadnt a more clever man might have felt foolish at seeing that dirty palm delgadillo didnt just one more chance he hadnt taken you had to take too many any which way avoiding the ones you could made you more likely to live longer well well what have we here sweetheart that was major uribe that in fact couldnt very well have been anybody else uribe had been closer to where the went off than joaquin or his prisoner not a smudge a stain or a rumpled crease on his uniform suggested that hed dove for cover if he hadnt wouldnt he be ropa vieja right now even thinking of the stew of shredded beefliterally old clothesmade joaquins stomach growl maybe not he had to be lucky as well as brave or he would have died long since the international stared at him as if he couldnt believe his eyes chances were he couldnt what were the odds of finding not just a faggot but an obviousno a flamingfaggot among the nationalists officers marshal sanjurjos whole campaign was about running such riffraff out of spain wasnt it of course it waseverybody on both sides knew that but it was about running reds out of spain too bernardo uribe might want to stick it all kinds of places the priests didnt approve of not that the priests didnt stick it into places like that too but he really and truly hated the reds joaquin understood that having seen him in action the prisoner hadnt and didnt yeah what have we here sweetheart with that miserable ugly accent and a deep rasping voice the international couldnt coo the way major uribe did but he gave it his bestor maybe his worstshot joaquin could have told him twitting the major wasnt the smartest thing to do he could have but he never got the chance uribe didnt even blink he didnt waste a moment either ill show you what we have here darling he said and drew his pistol raising it he shot the captive in the face red mist blew out of the back of the mans head he fell over and scrabbled in the dirt uribe watched for a few seconds then set the pistol by the internationals ear and pulled the trigger again the scrabbling stopped thats what we have here asshole uribe said holstering the pistol once more madre de dios joaquin crossed himself begging your pardon sir but i was taking him back for questioning aique lastima major uribe exclaimed and it was a pityfor the international whose blood still soaked into the thirsty ground the one who questions him now already knows all the answers and when he gets through with this fellowit wont take longthe fucker will wish what i did to him was all he got but hell have worse for all eternity eryes delgadillo also believed in hell the bible talked about it so it had to be true and he believed internationals were bound to go there all the same he hadnt intended to give satan this one right then i uh thought we ought to find out what he knew senor uribe flipped his hand a gesture that magnificently mingled effeminacy and scorn ill tell you what he didnt know joaquin he didnt know how to keep a civil tongue in his head and ill tell you something else he didnt know too god forgives what you do in bed he must or he wouldnt have made it possible to do those things er joaquin said again something more seemed called for yes sir seemed safe enough so he tried that how many priests would have apoplexy if they heard major uribes doctrine all of them probably clear on up to the holy father in rome if he told uribe that he tried not to shiver he might end up lying in the dirt next to the dead international dont trouble your head about it my dear uribe said go back up and kill some more of these communist monkeys thats all you need to worry about yes sir joaquin repeated and he got out of there in a hurry hed often been more afraid of sergeant carrasquel than he was of the enemy but carrasquel would shoot him only if he tried to run away or something like that the major might do it for the fun of watching him die if that wasnt a bulge in uribes breeches joaquin had never seen one the internationals might shoot him too he knew that theyd come too close too often but it was business for them not sport killing for sport hed never been so glad to hurry to the front anything as long as it got him away from major uribe you dernen what the hell do you think youre doing arno baatz shouted just working on my foxhole corporal willi replied maybe a soft answer would turn away wrath if awful arno was on the ragand he sure sounded that waythe odds were against it though sure as hell he thought one lousy pip on each shoulder strap made him a little tin god well cut that crap out and do something useful instead he snarled go chop up some firewood willi didnt think fixing up his hole so he was less likely to get killedand so he could sleep without getting all muddywas crap saying as much would only piss corporal baatz off worse than ever if such a thing was possible they did need firewood willi happened to know that he didnt know how hed drawn the short straw for chopping it but that was just baatz moving in mysterious ways his wonders to perform right corporal willi said resignedly and scrambled out of the foxhole he had some wood in there shoring up what would be his sleeping compartment he kept his mouth shut about it for fear awful arno would tell him to rip it out the frenchies had left a lot of lumber behind when most of them cleared out of this village willi didnt particularly blame them for bailing if his own small home town had got shelled and bombed first by one side and then by the other he would have wanted to get the hell out of there too theyd also left behind a really lovely axe light well balanced sharp it almost made chopping wood seem more sport than work almost imagining that fine steel edge coming down on baatzs neck instead of blond oak livened up the job too awful arno came by after a while to check on how willi was doing he eyed the pile of firewood grunted and went away again from him that was the equivalent of awarding the knights cross with oak leaves swords and diamonds if baatz couldnt find anything to piss and moan about there was nothing to find quitting now though would only bring him back and give him the excuse he wanted to come down on willi willi knew as much he kept chopping for another twenty minutes by then the squad had enough wood for the next six months it did if you listened to him tell it afterwards anyhow he marveled that his palms werent blistered when he did set down the axe part of that was the smooth fine helve and part of it was the thick calluses hed acquired sure as the devil soldiering toughened you up it also turned you into an accomplished thief as soon as he got done he started going through the houses in the village yeah theyd already been picked over but you never could tell what youd find if you poked around a little some canned salmon a little flask of what smelled like applejack francs somebodyd forgotten when he got out of town a good scrounger could come up with all kinds of things other people had missed hed share the salmon and the firewater you didnt want to get greedy with stuff like that your buddies wouldnt stay buddies if you did the french money went into a tunic pocket you never could tell when that might come in handy he came out into the lateafternoon sunshine more than a little pleased with himself he came out into that sunshine at the exact moment a black mercedes about as long as a light cruiser rumbled into the village two enormous men in black uniforms jumped out willi had been thinking soldiering toughened you he might be tough but he wouldnt have wanted to mess with either one of these ss behemoths something in the planes and angles of their faces said they not only knew all the dirty tricks but got off on them you one of them rumbled raising a hand roughly the size of a ham and pointing at him come here what do you want willi didnt move to ask you some questions the ss man said if youre lucky we wont ask about your name or your pay number now get over here goddamn asphalt soldiers willi thought the ss looked marvelous on parade in the field that was the wehrmachts place but the bastards with the runes on their collars were hitlers fairhaired boys willi ambled over to this pair if he didnt they could make him disappear and nobody would ever know where hed gone well what is it he said you boys better watch yourselves around here you know french guns can reach this far easy the big goons traded glances but nobody was shooting at them right this minute they could seem brave even to themselves one pulled out a notebook and flipped it open do you know a certain ah wolfgang storch he asked and rattled off storchs pay number name sounds kind of familiar willi stopped right there hed see the ss men in hell before he ratted on a friend wolfgang and he had saved each others bacon more times than he could count theyd shared cigarettes and socks theyd sworn at awful arno together would these clowns understand any of that not a chance in church willi eyed them how come you want to know we dont have to tell you that said the goon with the notebook the other one tried to be subtle he wasnt very good at it have you ever heard this storch make comments that reflect unfavorably on our beloved fuhrer or the national socialist german workers party nope willi said at once everybody in the field always swore at the idiot politicians whod put them in danger of getting their heads blown off would the ss men get that again not a chance nope was safer or so willi thought till the blackshirt with the notebook said if we can show that you are lying the two of you will be judged guilty of conspiring against the reich no talk of trials or anything like that just you will be judged guilty and what would happen afterwards nothing good willi didnt need a road map or a compass to figure that out you said it yourselveseverybody loves the fuhrer willi said nobody has anything bad to say about him nobody did where somebody who might blab could hear anyway but if the ss men really believed all the party bullshit they might think willi meant it by the way their faces hardened hed laid it on too thick the one with the notebook said we have reliable reports that this storch has delivered disloyal utterances on repeated occasions he could talk that way without even realizing what a jackass he sounded like well i never heard him do it willi said they didnt believe him he could see it in their pale merciless eyes that meant his goose was cooked too then he caught a break french artillery really did open up on the village willid never dreamt he could be glad to get shelled but he was now hit the dirt he yelled and flattened out himself because the ss men were greenhorns they stayed on their feet longer than they should have when shells started bursting and fragments screeched past they got the message hail mary full of grace one of them gabbled as he got down whoeverd said there were no atheists in foxholes had a pretty good idea of what he was talking about willi didnt like getting up in the middle of a barrage but he didnt like getting hauled off to dachau either he hurried toward the last place where hed seen wolfgang a trench fifty meters or so south of where the houses petered out behind him a round turned the blackshirts mercedes into burning scrap metal he laughed out loud where are you going one of the ss men called after him to fight you wouldnt know about that would you he answered and he even meant it the froggies were liable to follow up the shelling with an attack but he also had other things on his mind to his vast relief he found wolfgang right away and jumped into the trench beside him you trying to get yourself killed storch asked no im trying not to get you killed the ss wants your ass willi said i always told you you talked too goddamn much who squealed wolfgang got right down to brass tacks they didnt say but my moneys on baatz doesnt matter now get the fuck out of here go across the line and surrender to the frenchies you can sit out the rest of the war in a pow camp theyre liable to shoot me if i do wolfgang said surrendering was always tricky if the guys on the other side didnt like your looks or couldnt be bothered with you you were dead meat youve got a chance that way willi answered what kind of chance do you have with the blackshirts storchs unhappy expression told exactly what kind of chance he had he pumped willis hand youre a good guy wish me luck he scrambled out of the trench and crawled toward the enemy positions a few hundred meters away luck willi whispered most of the french shells were long if wolfgang really got lucky theyd blow up the ss goons even as the thought crossed willis mind he feared it was too much to hope for vaclav jezek cautiously lifted his head there was less to see than hed hoped the dust and smoke the bombardment had already kicked up obscured his view of later shell hits on the naziheld village he ducked down again theyre knocking the shit out of that place he remarked and so benjamin halevy didnt sound impressed not like the german mamzrim dont have it coming a czech fighting for his governmentinexile after the nazis jumped on his country with both feet a jew fighting the regime that had been giving his people hell ever since it came to power who hated harder they could argue about it they did they both despised the enemy enough for all ordinary purposes and then some which didnt mean they didnt respect the soldiers in feldgrau fierce in attack the germans were also stubborn in defense they would have been less frightening if they werent so good at what they did vaclav popped up again this time he laid his antitank rifle on the dirt thrown up in front of the entrenchment he didnt see any panzers but the monster rifle made mincemeatsometimes literallyof foot soldiers too whats up halevy asked him goddamn german crawling this way jezek answered im gonna ventilate the asshole he took another quick look then swore the enemy soldier had disappeared behind a burntout armored car no here he came again vaclav swung the heavy rifle a hair to the right is it a real attack or only the one guy the jewish sergeant inquired he raised his head too i only see the one where you see one theres usually a dozen you dont vaclav said but he didnt pull the trigger this fucker isnt doing his best to hide is he nope maybe hes had enough of the war halevy said i know i have but hes a damn german vaclav said easier to think of the landsers as mechanical men you could break them yes but imagining them with mere human weaknesses came much harder it did for vaclav anyhow but halevy said oh theyre people they wouldnt be so scary if they werent the czech wasnt sure of that not even close no matter whether he was or not the jew stuck his head above the trench lip again and yelled in german which vaclav hadnt known he spoke throw away your rifle and get your sorry ass over here youre vultures meat if you dont when vaclav looked out too he saw that the landser had tossed aside his mauser the fellow got to his feet and trotted toward the french trenches his hands high and a shamed kickeddog grin on his face ja komm mach schnell vaclav shouted talking to an enemy soldier the way he would to a waiter in a beer gardenor to a child or an animalfelt good the german made it snappy all right im coming im coming he said as if he feared a bullet in the back maybe he didand maybe he needed to he let out what might have been a stifled sob as he jumped down into the trench to make sure he didnt do anything stupid vaclav pointed the antitank rifle at his midsection jesus the landser yipped you shoot me with that thing you can bury me in a coffee can afterwards thats the idea halevy said from behind him the jew relieved him of the bayonet and potatomasher grenades on his belt then added if youve got a holdout knife hand it over we find it on you youll never known what red cross food packages taste like slowly and carefully the guy in fieldgray pulled a slim blade from his left boot halevy took it thats all ja the german said my name is wolfgang storch im a private he rattled off his pay number thats as much as ive got to say to you right if you know anything that matters pal youll spill it vaclav made the rifle twitch it would have started twitching soon anyhow the damn thing was heavy the french dont like you bastards much better than i do storch seemed to notice the smooth lines of his domed helmet for the first time oh a czech he said then he took a longer look at benjamin halevy he didnt need long to work out what halevy was either and he stopped gulping yeah and halevy agreed grimly why dont you start by telling us what the hell youre doing here damn blackshirts were going to grab me thats what the german answered a buddy of mine tipped me off we figured maybe you guys wouldnt shoot me he licked his lips he still wasnt sure about that why would the ss want you vaclav asked storch shrugged i talk too much everybody says so i mustve said something dumb where some cocksucker heard me and squealed theres this one corporal whos the biggest asshole in the world chances are it was him his handsdirty scarred brokennailed callused just like vaclavsfolded into fists what dyou think jezek asked halevy in czech it could be the jew answered in the same tongue storchs eyes said he didnt follow it halevy went on not our worry either way we just have to deliver him and let the fellows behind the line put the pieces together fair enough vaclav went back to german all right storchwell take you back first things first though cough up your cash and your watch if youve got one i do here the landser was fumblingly eager to hand it over vaclav had seen that before new prisoners figured theyd get killed if they didnt let themselves be robbed they were usually right too storch also emptied out his wallet he thrust bills at the czech this is all the money ive got most of it was in reichsmarks which were too scratchy even to make good asswipes but he also had some francs then halevy patted him down and took another wad of bills from a tunic pocket nice try the jew said dryly iim sorry storch stammered tell me another one halevy answered if hed plugged the german for holding out vaclav wouldnt have said boo but he only gestured with his rifle get it in gear if your little friends dont shell us on the way back youre a pow vaclav slung the antitank rifle as they headed away from the front that was easier than lugging it in his armsnot easy but easier the gun could do all kinds of things an ordinary rifle couldnt but it weighed a tonne a couple of poilus eyed the procession as they zigzagged along a communications trench one of them called a question in french halevy answered in the same language the poilu snorted halevy switched to german he asked where we got you storch i said we won you in a poker game wouldnt you rather have got fifty pfennigs the landser asked he took vaclav completely by surprise the czech broke up damned if a human being didnt lurk under the beetling brow of the german stahlhelm they eventually found a couple of military policemen who were happy enough to take charge of wolfgang storch theyd be less happy when they found out vaclav and halevy had already picked the german clean but that was their hard luckand maybe storchs as well nowwe just have to do that another million times and weve won the fucking war the jew said as he and vaclav started up toward the frontline trenches again should be easy jezek answered he was damned if hed let anybody outtry him chapter airplane engines droned overhead chaim weinberg looked up warily ready to dive for cover if bombs started falling the condor legion the italians and marshal sanjurjos spanish pilots had already given madrid a big dose of what paris was catching now and what hitler no doubt wanted to visit on london as well but these were republican planes obsolescent bombers the french could pass on for use on a less challenging front chaim recognized the fascists junkers and capronis at a glance the french planes were even uglier he wouldnt have thought it possible but there you were the spaniards on the streets knew the bombers belonged to the republic too they waved and blew kisses up toward the sky though the pilots were too high up to see them kill the traitors someone called and several people clapped their hands mike carrolls smile had a sour twist hell of a thing to say isnt it he remarked in english in a civil war everybodys a traitor to somebody chaim hadnt thought of it like that he nodded but he said we arent traitors were just lousy mercenariesif you believe the nationalists mike mimed scratching his head and his armpits and the seams of his trousers im not lousy right now dont think i am anyway yeah me neither chaim said fighting in and around a big city had its advantages when you werent actually up there trying to murder the other bastards and to keep them from murdering you you could come back and clean up and get your clothes baked and sprayed so you wouldnt be verminous for a while bomb blasts thudded off to the northwest chaim and the madrilenos on the street grinned at one another knowing the other guys were catching it for a change felt mighty good do unto others as theyve been doing unto you only more so that might not make it into the bible any time soon but it was the golden rule of war im gonna buy me a beer and celebrate mike declared as if he thought chaim would try to stop him if he did he was out of his tree sounds good chaim said they didnt have to go more than half a block before they found a bar about one business in three in madrid seemed to sell something to help people forget their troubles well people around here had a lot of troubles that needed forgetting no one in the dark little dive even blinked when two foreigners in ragged uniforms with rifles on their backs walked in the skinny little guy behind the bar looked like a wall lizard with a salvador dali mustache he raised one eyebrow a couple of millimeters by way of inquiring what the new patrons wanted cerveza carroll said doing his damnedest to give it a proper castilian lisp thervaytha dos chaim added his spanish was bad but not so bad that he couldnt get himself a beer with it then the bartender said okay boys in clear americanaccented english as he poured he went on i worked in chicago for five years i came back when the war started chaim set coins on the bar mike nodded thanks chaim bought more often than not the last thing he wanted was a reputation for being a cheap jew when the bartender started to make change chaim waved for him not to bother earlier in the war the fellow probably would have given him his money and a lecture to go with it tipping was seen as a leftover of class differences and beneath a proper proletarians dignity that stern puritanismalways stronger in barcelona than madridhad eased off now the bartender nodded his thanks he gave them the beers the glasses were none too clean that would have bothered chaim back in new york city not any more considering what all hed eaten and drunk in the field this was the least of his worries he did note they were etched with the name of a german lager that wasnt what they held now nobody wanted to buy or could buy fascist beer inside republican territory fascists or not the germans brewed better than locals dreamt of doing this tasted like horse piss but it was beer chaim raised his eye to the barman salud mud in your eye the spaniard said gravely if i didnt have to eat id give em to you on the house youre doing my job for me now something in the way he said the last word made chaim look at him in a different way spent some time at the front did you uhhuh id still be there only im standing on a peg the bartender shrugged microscopically i should count my blessings im still here plenty of guys who caught ones that didnt look so bad theyre pushing daisies now mike carroll put down a couple of pesetas buy yourself one buddy thanks the bartender could smile most cynically id be on my ass if i poured down all the ones people buy me i will this time though he poured his own beer viva la republica viva chaim and carroll echoed chaim drained his glass he dug in his pocket for more coins let me have another one me too mike said he grabbed chaims money before the bartender could and gave it back to him ill buy this time thanks chaim nodded fair was fair along with the beers the barman set out olives and crackers and pork sausage the color of a new copper penny chaim eyed the sausage warily he liked the stuff what wasnt pork was garlic and peppers but it didnt like him every time he ate it it gave him the runs he stuck to the crackers and olives mike started in on the sausage as if he thought theyd outlaw it tomorrow maybe his guts were made of stronger stuff than chaims or maybe hed spend the next week being sorry you never could tell two more men walked into the bar it got quieter than it had when the americans came in that made chaim look around they werent spaniards or even fellow internationalsthey were a pair of genuine soviet officers squat and hardfaced you didnt see them very often any more the russian mission in the republic was smaller than it had been before the bigger european war broke out some of the men had gone home to the motherland while hardly anyone came out to replace them maybe getting from russia to spain was harder than getting back to russia from spain or more likely the soviet government just had things to worry about in its own back yard these fellows might have been movie actors overplaying their roles they stomped up to the bar barely favoring chaim and mike with a glance you give us whiskey one of them told the bartender as if ordering him to assault nationalist trenches and something to eat the other one added spanish with a russian accent sounded as weird as german with a spanish accent which chaim had also heard he eyed the soviets one was an obvious russian the other chaim would have bet they had more than accented spanish in common nu friend you understand me when i talk like this he asked in yiddish nu why shouldnt i the soviet said like a lot of jews chaim knew he looked clevermaybe too clever for his own good where are you from new york you minsk one of my grandmothers came from there maybe were cousins maybe the soviet officer didnt seem impressed blood might be thicker than water but ideology was thicker than blood jew or not the officer knew what mattered to him how long have you been here where have you fought mike carroll the barman and the russian were all watching the two yehudim chances were none of them could follow the yiddish hell they were liable to think it was german well too goddamn bad if they did almost two years chaim said not without pride ive been on the ebro front and lately down here he looked a challenge to the soviet officer how about you since the other jew answered that trumped chaims claim it also meant the fellow had been here through the purges back home maybe that had saved him then again who could say some of the russians had gone back to almost certain arrestbut theyd gone soviet discipline in its own way was as formidable as the prussian variety the jew went on i have fought here and in the south and on the ebro and now here again and what do you think of it all chaim asked we are still fighting the other man replied he raised his glass let us keep fighting he said it in yiddish and then in his strange spanish everybody drank one of the ss men whod come to grab wolfgang storch had taken an ugly leg wound he was in a military hospital somewhere well behind the line when he got out hed be able to wear a wound badge that would make him the envy of his deskbound friends willi dernen wondered how much hed care sometimes you paid more for things than they were really worth the one who was left was named waldemar zober he thought willi had something to do with wolfgangs disappearance he thought so yes but he couldnt prove a goddamn thing as long as willi played dumb and willi did his old man had called him a goddamn dummy plenty of times back in the day that had pissed willi off now for the first time in came in handy no i dont know what happened to him he told zober for all i know he took a direct hit and there wasnt enough of him left to bury the frenchies got kind of busy that day you know zober had the grace to look away he knew how busy the french had been all right but he still suspected willi you went running off to the trenches storch was already up there it made perfect sense to the ss man well it might have too he only had to connect the dots but he didnt know for sure he had connected them willi had no intention of telling him i ran to the trenches to shoot at the enemy in case he followed up the shelling with an attack thats what i get paid for you knowand i dont get paid real well either waldemar zober not only had rankhe had those ss runes on his collar tab they made him heinrich himmlers fairhaired boy they also meant he got more money than a wehrmacht soldier of equivalent rank would have and most of the time he never came unpleasantly close to shells or bullets life wasnt fairnot even close his lips were uncommonly red he pushed out the lower one now like a fouryearold about to throw a tantrum you could spank a spoiled little brat nobody could wallop an ss man no matter how much he deserved it interfering with an ss investigation is a crime with severe punishment attached he growled der herr jesus willi burst out ive been at the front ever since the fight in the west started the frenchies could blow my foot off any old time same as they did with your buddy they could blow my balls off for christs sake and youre going on about severe punishment give it a rest why dont you zobers eyes might have been cut from blue and white glass like the ones on an expensive mannequin you dont know what youre talking about he said and absolute assurance filled his voice you dont have the faintest idea a week in our hands and youd beg to fight at the front even in a punishment company willi licked his lips he knew about those officers and men whod disgraced themselves by running away or otherwise fucking up got handed rifles and thrown in where the fighting was hottest if they tried to run again they got shot from behind if they lived they redeemed themselves or maybe they just won the chance to put out another fire by smothering it with their bodies youre a tough guy when youre working over poor bastards who cant hit back willi thought how long would you last up here though not long i bet if the bad guys didnt get you somebody on your own side would arrange an accident no one talked about that kind of thing which didnt mean it didnt happen every once in a while you couldnt show thoughts like that not unless you wanted to find out what camps were like from the inside out even if his father had called him a dummy willi wasnt that stupid wearily he said look give it a rest why dont you i dont know what happened to wolfgang and i wish i did we were friends i miss him by the glint in zobers glassy orbs that was almost a ticket to dachau all by itself he was a criminal he was an enemy of the reich and of the fuhrer he fucking shot enemies of the reich willi answered he was a damn good soldier and one of the best scroungers ive ever known im still here answering your questions on account of him the only good thing i can say about what happened to him is he never knew what got him i should be so lucky if he did not desert to the enemy zober said implacably willi stood up i know youre in the ss sir but if you say that to the soldiers who know wolfgang somebodys gonna punch you in the snoot he walked out without waiting for leave from the blackshirt the funny thing was he was dead right yes wolfgang had deserted as far as willi knew though he was the only guy on this side of the line who knew it anybody who didnt know wouldnt believe it and anybody who heard it from a prick like waldemar zober would want to flatten his nose for him only one thing was wrong with walking out on zober it didnt get willi away from his problem arno baatz was also convinced he had something to do with wolfgangs going missing willi couldnt make awful arno feel inferior for not being a landser baatz was onemaybe not a good soldier but a soldier even so you two clowns were asshole buddies the corporal said dont waste my time telling me you werent cause i know better when the ss men told you they were looking for him what would you do but squeal like a little pink piggy i didnt do anything like that goddammit willi had told the same lie so many times by now he was starting to believe it himself he could feel himself getting angry which was pretty funny when you thought about it the anger might be ersatz but it felt the same as the real thing all i did was go to the front line when the shelling started he looked awful arno up and down i didnt see you there well i was baatz said which might have been true and might have been as big a whopper as any of the ones willi had come out with the noncom went on and sooner or later youll tell me one i believe lets go talk to captain lammers willi said either hell jug me or hell tell you to leave me the fuck alone either way ill be better off than i am listening to your bullshit all the time baatz blinked his eyes were dark and reminded willi of a mean dogs sometimes you could make a mean dog turn tail if you yelled at it and moved towards it instead of running sometimes youd get bitten though willi waited to see what would happen here you want to talk to the captain awful arno said slowly bet your ass i do if itd get you and that blackshirt out of my hair id talk to the general commanding the division willi wondered if he really meant that officers with fancy shoulder straps needed to listen to privates troubles the way they needed getting their headquarters bombed but arno baatz was also imagining coming facetoface with a general by the look plastered across his ugly mug he wasnt liking it much he tried to hide that by jeering you think the division co has time for pissants like you dont make me laugh the captain will willi said lets go find him and captain lammers would awful arno knew that as well as willi did he said something about willis mother had willi popped him they would have visited the captain on the corporals terms willi just stood there baatz glowered as fearsomely as he knew how willi didnt blink ive got my eye on you dernen awful arno snarled and he stomped away five minutes later willi heard him screaming at some other private for having a dirty rifle willi smiled if you beat up a little kid hed turn around and pound on some kid who was smaller yet to make himself feel better arno baatz worked the same way waldemar zober summoned him one more time youd better watch yourself dernen the blackshirt said if hed worn a mustache he would have twirled it like a villain in an oldtime melodrama weve got our eye on you yes sir willi said in lieu of we you and your tapeworm but right after that zober went off to inflict himself on some other wehrmacht men who were just doing their damnedest to win the war for their country arno baatz kept assigning willi latrine duty and the other nastiest fatigues he could find then the gods of army luck reached down and tapped willi on the shoulder a promotion came through all of a sudden he found himself a gefreiter the lowest of the several grades between private and corporal he got to wear a pip on his sleevenot on his shoulder straps but even so and as the ranks name implied he was freed from the fatigue duties ordinary privates got stuck with baatz fumed but he couldnt do anything about it one of these days you son of a bitch ill rank you willi thoughta new idea but a mighty tasty one see how you like it then yeahjust see sergeant demange looked determined and disgusted at the same time we are going to drive the germans back he declared thats what the officers say and so thats what were going to do he spat out the microscopic butt of his latest gitane ground it into the grass under his bootheel and lit another one the soldiers in his section listened some eagerly some impassively some apprehensively luc harcourt counted himself in the last group hed seen too much of the boches in defense and in attack he was anything but thrilled about giving the blond boys in fieldgray another chance to ventilate him he knew sergeant demange felt exactly the same way he also knew that did both of them exactly no good what if the germans are winding up to take a punch at us a soldier asked the question was very much on lucs mind too but he didnt come out of it you couldnt ask such things so easily when you were a corporal luc didnt much like the responsibility that came with his small rank but he accepted it sergeant demange folded both hands into fists and smacked them into each other thats what happens then louis he answered but the brass doesnt think itll go like that they say the germans have been shipping tanks and shit out of here they arent loading up for a punch of their own louis had seen enough to realize the brass didnt know everything there was to know what if theyre wrong sergeant well in that case we get our nuts crunched what else demange said it happened often enough the last time around a breakthrough of course the next offensive would give us one of fucking course they havent got a whole hell of a lot smarter since have they what can we do then louis askeda damn good question when they tell us to go we go thats what we can do demange answered flatly do anything else and your own side will scrag you matter of fact for you ill take care of it personally he paused his ferret face even fiercer than usual any other stupid questions no one said anything louisd asked the one thing that really needed asking only as the knot of soldiers broke up did luc say how hard are we gonna get fucked sergeant demange looked at him they wont kiss usill tell you that if they really have shipped out their tanks well shit what if they have theyll know which way were coming and theyll have an antitank gun with every one of our tanks names on it but what can you do once you put on a uniformonce they drafted you and put a uniform on youyou couldnt do a goddamn thing except what they told you you figured that out in a hurry if you had trouble if you were slow or stubborn they rubbed your nose in it luc understood what was what all right ah shit he said see youre not so fucking dumb demange reached up and thumped him on the shoulder luc had to hold himself tight to keep from jumping even such rough affection from demange was far far out of the ordinary french tanks clanked up under cover of darkness the people with fancy kepis were serious about this anyway how much that meant the only way to find out was to see how many poilus turned into catsmeat and how much ground they took doing it dawn came early these days summer would be here soon luc hoped he would be here too so he could see it when it came he waited for the balloon to go up his mouth papery dry he knew about all the barbed wire ahead you could get hung up on the stuff stuck like a fly on flypaper waiting for machinegun bullets to chew you up and leave you limp how many french soldiers had died that way in the last war how many more were about to am i one of them that was the question you never wanted to ask yourself behind him the french artillery woke up early s s s they pounded away for all they were worth the ground shook under his feet he glanced back over his shoulder all those muzzle flashes made it look as if the sun were rising in the west the germans were good damn them it couldnt have been more than a couple of minutes after hell started coming down on their positions when their artillery started hitting the french forward trenches luc huddled there trying to make himself as small as he could before long hed have to come out of the trench hed feel like an escargot without its shell and the boches had such sharp escargot forks an officers whistle shrilled the sound seemed small and lost in the middle of the thunderous artillery duel sergeant demange let out a yell that cut through the explosions like a sharp knife through soft cheese come on you old cons this is what you punched your time cards for luc would never have volunteered for thiswhich mattered not a sous worth he scrambled up the dirt steps that led out of the trench his pack weighed him down even stripped to the minimum as it was it seemed heavy as an escargots shell but it didnt give him even that much protection as he went forward at a lumbering trot he called fancy curses down on denis bouchers head maybe the little bastard was screwing his halffaithful marie right now maybe the military police had caught him even that would be better than this anything would be better than this clangwhang that factory noise was an antitank round bouncing off a tanks armored carapace if somebody inside the machine wasnt working his rosary beads he was wasting a hell of a chance yes the germans were alert when werent they damn them clang blam that factory noise was an antitank round penetrating a tanks steel hide and all the ammo inside going off at once the turret blew three meters into the air and squashed a foot soldier when it came down he didnt have time to scream he probably didnt even have time to be surprised machine guns rattled like malignant jackdaws come on keep going sergeant demange shouted they arent aimed at you one of the things luc had found out was that they didnt have to be aimed at you they put out so many bullets they could kill you any which way but he couldnt flop down and start digging himself a foxhole not when he had to mind a squad he yelled keep going too once they smashed through the german line things wouldwell mightget easier tanks really did mash down barbed wire no matter how thickly the germans laid it and if you went in right behind them they shielded you from the fire directly ahead watching ricochets spark off the tank in front of him made luc wonder how many of them would have nailed him if the tank werent there so what if its exhaust made him want to put on his gas mask he might have been a roman legionary advancing behind a big fat shield this shield had weapons of its own it stopped so did luc its cannon roaredonce twice one of the machine guns that had been filling the air with death suddenly shut up even some of the new conscripts huddled behind the tank with luc shouted happily they knew every machinegun nest that got ruined made them likelier to live the tank lurched forwardfor about another fifteen meters then it hit a mine that blew off its left track it stopped hatches popped open the crew jumped out a tank that couldnt move was a tank an antitank gun would murder any minute now the tank men carried only pistols that made them useless in an infantry fight luc didnt know what theyd do now he didnt have time to worry about it either they were coming up on the germans foxholes and trenches a boche popped up with his hands high kamerad he shouted hopefully luc gestured with his rifle the german climbed out of his hole babbling thanks for not getting killed on the spot luc gestured again the boche stumbled back toward beauvais if he was lucky no frenchman would plug him before he got there if he wasnt well too bad old man fuck me if i dont think we can do this after all sergeant demange yelled luc was starting to think the same thing he hadnt seen any german tanks yet and his own side still had plenty running he tramped on toward the east lets have one more radio check theo heinz naumann said right sergeant theo hossbach answered resignedly the radio set had worked perfectly half an hour earlier they hadnt moved since what could have gone wrong but naumann had the prejump jitters nothing to do but humor him theo hooked in with the company regimental and divisional networks the set still worked fine alles gut he reported danke naumann said wont be long now theo didnt answer the radiomans position in a panzer ii left him in a zone of no time and no place he sat behind the turret and in front of the engine compartment he couldnt see out unless he opened the hatch in the rear decking and stuck his head through it to look around you didnt want to do that unless all your other choices were worse cooking like a pork roast inside a burning panzer for instance no time and no place would do in an odd way they even suited theo some people who knew him called him selfsufficient rather more called him dreamy all he knew was most of the time the world within his head was more interesting than anything that went on outside being stuck in the bowels of all this complicated ironmongery bothered him much less than it would have troubled most other people sometimes you couldnt ignore the outside world no matter how hard you tried when hundreds of guns opened up behind you and thousands of shells crashed down in front of you the world beyond the panzers armored skin made you notice it and the company commander bawled forward into his earphones forward theo told naumann forward the panzer commander passed the word to adalbert stoss forward the driver put the panzer in gear the polish plain could hardly have made better panzer country the terrain was so smooth they might almost have been rolling across a manicured practice ground the only difference was the red army wouldnt have been waiting at the edge of a practice ground theo wondered how big that difference would turn out to be all winter long the red army had had a devil of a time beating the poles the poles were bravetheo had seen that in the couple of weeks since the panzer division traveled halfway across europe but the gear the poles had he shook his head their army might have done all right in the last war they had rifles and machine guns and field artillery they also had cavalry regiments that went into battle with lances as if the twentieth centuryto say nothing of the nineteenthhad never happened their tanks were rusty french relics and they didnt own very many panzer iis could have run rings around them and shot them up with ease and theo knew the shortcomings of his own mechanical mount all too well bang somebody might have smacked the panzer turret with a hammer or much more likely somebody might have taken a shot at heinz naumann who like any good panzer commander rode head and shoulders out of the turret whenever he could theo didnt need to see out heinz damn well did he didnt need to get killed though when people started trying to blow your head off you ducked back inside and used the vision ports they didnt show much but they were a hell of a lot better than getting shot and no sooner than naumann had pulled himself inside his casehardened steel cocoon several more bullets spanged off the turret and the right side of the panzer halt he ordered and adi stoss did heinz traversed the turret to the right then he stopped working the traversing gear and said forward again whats up stoss asked somebody else took out the foxhole before i could naumann answered those russians wont bother anybody from now on sounds good the driver goosed the panzer again they rattled on in his mind theo pictured a map poland had a horn in the far northeast that separated the ussr from lithuania it had separated russia from lithuania anyhow with the red army in wilno the soviets were going to border the little baltic state the lithuanians were both furious because they wanted wilno themselves they called it vilnius and scared shitless because the soviet union was a thousand times their size now that germany was jumping in with both feet lithuania might join the fight against stalin and if she did germany and russia might notice then heinz said halt again a moment later he added russian panzer he slewed the turret to the left for all he was worth not being able to see out didnt usually bother theo at times like this though how fast was the enemy panzers turret traversing the sweat that dripped from his armpits had nothing to do with how hot it was inside the panzer ii fear made it foul and rank would a redhot cannon round tear through the flimsy armor around him and set everything in here on fire or would it ricochet around inside and tear up the whole crew all kinds of nice things to think about and he couldnt do anything about any of them for that matter how well could heinz shoot theyd all find out right about now the turret stopped traversing theo could see naumanns left hand stab at the trigger on the elevating handwheel the mm cannon barkedonce twice three times heinz waited then fired once more you got him hes burning adi said excitedly ja heinz agreed the coaxial machine guns trigger was on the traverse handwheel to his right he squeezed off a couple of short bursts from the mg then grunted in satisfaction all rightwe dont have to worry about the crew any more forward again adi forward stoss echoed jawohl he hadnt sounded so respectful before heinz killed his first enemy panzer theo could understand that he was breathing easier too naumann squeezed off several more bursts from the machine gun he didnt tell adi to stop or even to slow down dont know if i got the damn russians or not but i sure as hell did make em duck he said and that might be good enough foot soldiers who couldnt shoot back might as well not be there and the german and polish infantry advancing with and behind the panzers would soon make sure the ivans werent there any more the red army might have seized polands northeastern horn but it was about to get taken in the flank and cut off from its homeland how would the reds like that not very much theo suspected what could they do about it though how good were they really before long the wehrmacht would find out a machinegun burst rattled off the panzers flank pebbles on a tin roof the bullets might have been they might have but they werent huge blasts from somewhere up ahead made all the racket that had gone before them seem small stukas i hope theo said to heinz youd better believe it the panzer commander answered a whole bunch of russians just went up in smoke didnt get the panzers though dammit theo didnt see how you could expect to wreck a panzer from the air only a direct hit would knock one out and what were the odds of that when they stopped for the evening heinz said theyd come better than twenty kilometers theo believed it though they might have been going round in circles for all he could prove one stretch of polish plain looked like another that burntout russian panzer hadnt been anywhere close by though theo examined the hulk curiously the more he looked the more formidable it seemed it was almost the size of a panzer iii and had a bigger gun than the iiis mm instead of going straight up and down the armor sloped to help deflect enemy fire theo glanced over at heinz naumann who was also eyeing the russian machine did you kill one of these uhhuh heinz sounded unwontedly thoughtful i wouldnt want to stop a round from that gun what dyou think fortyfive millimeters fifty fortyfive id guess theo said smash through our plate like it was tinfoil either way heinz said next question is how many of these fuckers have the ivans got well theo answered well find out chapter sometimes you got the best view of things from the air sergei yaroslavsky had always thought the soviet general staff would have done better to get up in a plane every once in a while to look at the battlefield as if it were a chessboard russian chess players amazed the world so sometimes did the red army but not in such a happy way sergei had been pleased with what he saw before in spite of help from the luftwaffe the forces belonging to marshal smiglyridzs reactionary clique werent going to be able to hang on to wilno or to the terrain that led towards it from the ussr that would have brought the soviet border right up to the edge of lithuanian territory and would have set another pack of semifascists to quivering in their polished boots the mere idea of an independent lithuania offended sergei the locals had taken advantage of the soviet unions weakness right after the revolution to break away if you thought you could get away with something like that for long you needed to think again or you had needed to think again till yesterday morning now with the wehrmacht marching side by side with the damned poles everything was as much up in the air as he was himself up in the air sergei looked down on what the neat analogy of a chessboard didnt really suggest itself what he saw lay somewhere between chaos and hell on earth pieces that had been takenno tanks and infantry units that had been smashedwerent neatly lifted from the board they lay as they had died some sideways some upside down some still sending up black stinking smoke antsmall human bodies motionless among the murdered machines anastas mouradian was seeing the same thing as sergei and liking it every bit as well doesnt look so good does it the armenian said with what struck sergei as commendable restraint well no sergei admitted what he couldnt very well deny most of the tanks wrecked or burning down there were soviet ts and bts most of the antsmall corpses lying near the tanks wore red army khaki by contrast most of the tanks still on the move were painted dark gray most of the men moving forward with themmoving forward like army ants ferocious seemingly unstoppablewore german feldgrau on the nazis flanks polish troops in dark khaki also advanced jackals fattening themselves as lions tore chunks out of beasts too big for the yapping scavengers paying too much attention to the fight on the ground wouldnt do sergei had feared german bfs before hed had good reason to fear them too now he had better reason far more of them sharked through the air they werent just helping the poles any more they were supporting their own countrymen a job they took much more seriously yaroslavsky tried to look every which way at once he wished some kindly quartermaster would have issued him eyes in the back of his head and maybe one on top as well mouradian pointed ahead towards a clump of camouflaged tents whose long morning shadows revealed them for what they were that looks like a headquarters dont you think he said regimental maybe divisional da sergei nodded shall we make the germans jump and shout he smiled at the idea of nazis in monocles and caps with upswept crowns running for cover like ordinary mortalsand maybe finding out just how mortal they were when he shouted an alert through the speaking tube to ivan kuchkov he found that the chimp also liked the idea well bomb the living shit out of the fuckers kuchkov shouted back he approved of any mayhem that didnt come down on his own head come to that so did sergei he flew straight toward the tent anastas mouradian peered through the bombsight giving minute course corrections with gestures then mouradian also shouted to kuchkov now ivan down whistled the bombs without waiting to see what theyd done sergei wrestled the sb around and got out of there at full throttle the germans wouldnt appreciate the visit hed just paid them and they had ways of making their displeasure known the wings new airstrip lay well within what had been polish territory the better to keep pounding wilno flying south against the germans instead of west hadnt been what his superiors planned for but the wing could do it when the situation required getting back sergei hadnt worried about getting back by all the signs neither had anyone else on the soviet side that only went to show that the higherups didnt know what all they should have worried about he watched two s hack an sb out of the sky no chutes came from the stricken bomber as it plunged to the ground three dead soviet airmen then he ground his teeth if they came after him next there were liable to be three more but they didnt they zoomed back to the south instead the s only weakness hed been able to find was its short range if these fighters needed to gas up again sergei wouldnt complain he knew a moments pity for his countrymen who hadnt been so lucky when he got down the airstrip was boiling like a pot of shchi forgotten over a roaring fire sergei hadnt even climbed down from the bombers wing before a groundcrew man waved for him to get back into the cockpit what he said why because were getting the fuck out of here comrade thats why the groundcrew man said why sergei asked again still not moving before the groundcrew man could answer the outside world did it for him shells burst only a few hundred meters from the edge of the airstrip thats why comrade pilot the noncom said the german sons of bitchesll have the range on us any minute now dyou want to get blown up they were nowhere near us when we took off sergei protested he looked at his watch pushing back furlined gloves and sleeves to see the face no it really hadnt been much more than an hour earlier yeah wellthe groundcrew man shruggedthe cocksuckers are fucking well near us now he sounded almost as foul as the chimp and if we dont haul ass right this minute well get to meet em in person like so quit dicking around and head for the motherland right right sergei said dully not knowing what else to do he turned aroundand almost bumped into anastas mouradian who was right behind him back in the plane stas back to byelorussia i heard mouradian said its not so good is it more shells screamed in these burst closer than the ones in the last volley had if the sb didnt take off soon it wouldnt get the chance sergei thought about fighting the nazis as an untrained infantryman he thought about trying to get back to byelorussia on footor if he was very lucky in the back of a truck much too easy to think about a german tank or maybe a stuka swooping down from above pumping machinegun bullets into the back of a truck off to byelorussia it was then and now too not so good no sergei said they returned to the cockpit and snapped their belts closed sergei had to tell ivan kuchkov what was going on happy motherfucking day kuchkov answered the stupid pricks whore supposed to be running things screwed it up royally this time didnt they it could be better sergei left it right there the engines which had barely stopped fired up again right away that was something anyhownot much but something the sb bounced down the runway and took off it felt uncommonly agile he couldnt remember the last time hed gone up without a full bomb load he had to swing back to the east and come over the airstrip again to head for soviet territory shells were dropping on the dirt runway by then any of the planes still hiding in revetments would have a devil of a time getting away sergei wondered if groundcrew men would have to set them on fire to keep the germans from grabbing them he also wondered whether any groundcrew men were hanging around to take care of such things trucks kicked up tall plumes of dust as they hightailed it toward the old border well were in it now he said to mouradian as he checked six to make sure he had no bfs on his tail no the damned germans are in it now and they arent screwing around the way they were before that isnt good either especially with japan jumping on us too the armenian replied not even slightly sergei agreed but what can we do except fight as hard as we know how anastas mouradian had no answers for him sergei wished mouradian would have because he had no answers of his own either the horizon wasnt entirely empty when julius lemp swung his binoculars around the horizon but that smoke didnt come from a freighter bound for britain nor did it rise from an enemy warship there to the north sailed the admiral scheer the pocket battleship was cruising the north atlantic at fourteen knots a pace the u had no trouble matching a swell raised the uboat giving lemp a glimpse of the admiral scheers angular profile she could do a lot of damage if she got the chance if lemp couldnt help wondering how many uboats the kriegsmarine could have built with all the steel and labor that went into the big armored cruiser and how much more trouble they could have caused the british well too late for such questions now there was the admiral scheerand there at the edge of visibility was her signal lamp flashing urgent morse lemp peered through the binoculars but shook his head in frustration cant make it out he said and then to the bosun who was up on the conning tower with him tell them we need to approach matti lets see if they can read us aye aye skipper matti said and the louvers on the subs signal lamp clacked as they went up and down lemp called down into the uboat for a change of course the boat swung north he peered toward the admiral scheer through his field glasses again with a wry snort he said they say they cant make out what were sending they want us to come closer tell em were doing it for christs sake right you are matti answered the louvers clacked some more lemp could read morse by ear as well as by eye the bosun said what needed saying as quickly and economically as anyone could want hed spent years in freighters before joining the german navy he knew his onions all right the pocket battleships lamp flashed again word by word lemp read off the message smoke to northwest several ships a convoy matti exclaimed that would be good lemp said the other possibility would be several warships the admiral scheer might fight off or escape from several british warships especially with a sub on her side all the same freighters counted for more freighters fed england warships were nothing but nuisances the dogs that kept sea wolves from feeding off the big fat slow sheep all the ratings up on the tower swung their glasses to the northwest closer to enemy shores lemp would have reproved them an airplane could come out of nowhere and start shooting you up or bombing you before you even knew it was there not out in the middle of the atlantic though nothing that flew had the range to come out here and get back to land back to land what if one of those unknown ships out there was a carrier lemp spoke to the ratings after all they resumed their usual scan he peered intently toward the northwest first with the binoculars on a strap around his neck then with the more powerful pillarmounted glasses each uboat had he soon spied the smoke trails himself he muttered to himself if they were thick and black he would have been sure they came from coalfired steamers maybe they came from oilburning freighters or maybe they poured from stacks that belonged to destroyers cruisers battlewagonsor a carrier no probably not that last the british would have seen the pocket battleships smoke by now too if they had a carrier out here in the middle of the ocean its planes would already be buzzing around the admiral scheer like so many stinging wasps one or two of them might have found time for the u as well more signals from the admiral scheer commencing firing lemp read jesus christ he added on his own that answered all his questions the panzerschiff wouldnt have opened up on freighters at long rangeshe would have closed to make her kills sure those were warships out there smoke and flame belched from the pocket battleships six mm guns their thunder reached the u several seconds later it was still loud despite the kilometers between the pocket battleship and the submarine they really mean it dont they matti said you dont play skat with guns that size lemp agreed the bosun chuckled but it was no joke and the british werent playing skat out there either incoming shells splashed into the atlantic several hundred meters short of the admiral scheer they kicked up great columns of water water dyed red so the enemy officers would know which ship of theirs had fired them a moment later another salvo made green splashes lemp thought by the size of them that they came from cruisers rather than battleships he thought so yes but he wasnt sure the admiral scheer fired again she was fighting not running that also made lemp believe she wasnt facing battleships she wouldnt have lasted long slugging toetotoe against seagoing dinosaurs more heavily armed and far better armored than she was off to the northwest lemp spied sudden heavy black smoke shes hit something he said and the ratings up on the conning tower with him cheered and pumped their fists in the saltsmelling air but the royal navy hadnt quit more shells came down around the pocket battleship around lemp ground his teeth theyd straddled her that meant they had the range sure as hell one round from the next english salvo slammed into the german ship more smoke spurted the panzerschiff kept on sailing and firing though even if she wasnt armored like a battlewagon one hitthat one hit anyhowwouldnt knock her out of action distant across a much longer stretch of seawater reports from the enemys guns also reached lemps ears and the admiral scheer sent another signal his way turning toward you the words came out one by one maddeningly slow surprise unsuspecting targets donnerwetter lemp muttered no doubt the order seemed easy to captain patzigwhich only showed he didnt know much about how uboats operated could the admiral scheer bring the enemy warships by on courses that would let the u get a decent shot at them or would the uboat turn into a harmless spectator the moment it submerged only one way to find outand an order was an order lemp nodded to the bosun send i shall conform to your movements matti i shall conform to your movements aye aye sir matti sounded much more serious than usual and well he might lemp thought the signal lamps louvers clacked yet again lemp wanted to stay on the surface as long as he could to get the best notion of what course the royal navy ships were sailing that would tell him what he could doand whether he could do anything the english skippers wouldnt notice him right awayhe hoped theyd focus all their attention on the admiral scheerwouldnt they if he turned out to be wrong about either of those hed have a thin time of it he wondered if that bothered spitandpolish captain patzig with all the gold braid on his sleeves lemp doubted it to a surface officer a uboat was as much a service vessel as an oiler no help for it here came the pocket battleship firing as she fell back from the enemy what was going through the english captains minds when they watched a stronger ship run from them contempt probably german uboat commanders had an arrogant certainty that they were the best in the world on the surface that kind of pride had filled the royal navy since the eighteenth century maybe it would come back to haunt them now their guns blazed as they pursued the admiral scheer like the panzerschiff they zigzagged over the sea to make themselves more difficult targets they were firing faster than the german ship their guns were lighter which made ammunition easier to handle and they were english damn them their ships undoubtedly had plenty of officers and sailors whod fought in the last war they had reason to be sure they were good enough reason maybe not captain patzig was doing a better job than lemp had thought he would of leading the john bulls onto the uboat matadors hidden sword we might have good shots at them after all i wouldnt have believed it but we might all lemp said out loud was lets go below men he was last off the conning tower as he dogged the hatch shut behind him he called fresh orders schnorkel depth up periscope ready forward torpedoes ready reloads his men sprang into action without any fuss yes they knew how good they were he told the officers and chiefs what was up and they passed the word to the ratings the more you knew about what you were doing and why the better youd perform that was uboat gospel anyhow in the surface navy the ideal still seemed to be turning men into blind unthinking machines it looked that way to lemp anyhow he was willing to admit he was anything but unbiased he twisted dials on the gadget that helped him plan his shots the targets would be at long range and they were steaming ungodly fast he didnt have time to wait and plan perfect shots the way he might have with a lumbering freighter he had to find something that would serve then do it and hope for the best what have we got up there sir gerhart beilharz asked the storklike engineering officer wore a stahlhelm to keep overhead fittings from knocking him for a loop as long as he kept the schnorkel behaving lemp didnt care what he wore the gadget would give the u twice the underwater speed it could get from battery powerif it worked and the boat might need every bit of that and then some in the next few minutes looks like two heavy cruisers one light lemp answered absently now shut up and get out of my hair aye aye sir beilharz said lemp hardly heard him he felt the diesels surge through the soles of his feet as the u went into her attack run he steered her himself his eyes on the the periscope the first ship was coming into range torpedo onelos torpedo twolos he shouted twin whooshes as the eels leaped free lemp forgot about them as soon as they were gone he swung the uboat to port lining her up on the other heavy cruiseror where the cruiser would be when the torpedo got there if he had her range and speed right if she didnt suddenly swerve if if if torpedo threelos he said away the eel went lemp steered to port again the light cruiser was trailing the other two warships and making more smoke than she should have battle damage from the admiral scheer lemp could hope so torpedo fourlos one more whoosh reload forward torpedo tubes that was backbreaking workeach torpedo weighed close to a tonne till it was done though the u had only the single eel in her stern tube with which to fight the lordsthe junior ratings who bunked forwardwould be happy when it was done though now theyd have more room in which to sling their hammocks nobodyd have to sleep on top of a torpedo any more an explosion shook the us hull sailors whooped lemp swung the periscope to starboard the first english heavy cruiser lay dead in the water though her guns kept firing a few seconds later another deep rumble rattled the submarines crew like peas in a shaken pod people pounded lemp on the back two skipper matti bawled way to go damned if he hadnt hit the second heavy cruiser she was still moving but down by the bow and slowing fast had he got the light cruiser too he waited for one more blast waited and waited it didnt come he swore under his breath when you did well you wanted to do better with the light cruiser still among those present he couldnt surface shed slaughter him if he did those mm guns werent much for a surface ship to carry but they made his lone mm deck gun look like a cap pistol by comparison water spouts suddenly sprang up around the less damaged english heavy cruiser the admiral scheer must have seen what the u had done now the pocket battleship was coming back to finish off her crippled foes hits brought gouts of smoke and fire from the damaged warship the english light cruiser charged the panzerschiff guns blazing doing her best to protect her wounded sisters that was braveeven heroic she scored hits too then two rounds from the admiral scheers big guns slammed into her she might have run headlong into a brick wall fire burst from her she might almost have been broken in half skipper weve got two eels in the tubes the chief torpedoman reported good job bruno lemp hadnt expected them for another five minutes we are going to approach the enemy cruiser that has stopped and we are going to sink her right bruno said theyll put a ritterkreuz around your neck when we get home too they would do no such thing and lemp knew it nobody who was in the brass doghouse would win a knights cross no point wishing for one or thinking hed earned it because he wouldnt get it any which way but he might getpartwayout of that damned doghouse stubborn as any englishmen the sailors on the halted cruiser kept firing at the admiral scheer even as the pocket battleship teed off on a stationary target then the second torpedo from the u slammed into her this one broke her back she had listed to starboard now she turned turtle and sank in a couple of minutes that left one royal navy ship still able to fightbut not for long even as lemp turned toward her a shell from the admiral scheer must have touched off her magazine she went up with a roar that dwarfed the explosions from the torpedo hits der herr gott im himmel lemp said shaken in spite of himself how many men had gone up in that blast how many more would struggle in the atlanticfor a little while the u couldnt hope to pick up survivors the boat was packed to the gills as things were would the admiral scheer a question from the bosun broke into lemps thoughts uh skipper what just happened there oh lemp remembered he was the only man in the uboat who could see out that was the last british cruiser not our ship more cheers rang through the pressure hull he only halfheard them if he commanded the pocket battleship he wouldnt stick around the royal navy would know exactly where this fight took place every warship within a couple of thousand kilometers would be hustling this way at flank speed if the admiral scheer wanted to see home again shed have to get out without wasting time and that was just what she was doing when lemp turned his periscope on her she was speeding northeast as fast as she could go he nodded to himself that was only sensible the u would have to run the royal navys gauntlet to get back to the vaterland too but it was easier for a sub still lingering here seemed the very worst of bad ideas back to the surface he ordered and then well shape course for germany nobody can say we havent done our job this cruise the sailors cheered once more one of the privates in alistair walshs section was reading the international heraldtribune with a long face the heraldtrib struck walsh as annoyingly american which didnt keep him from reading it too in france it was one of the easiest ways to get your hands on news in english if you didnt have a working wireless so you could hear the bbc it was damn near the only way to get news in english whats got you buggered up now jock walsh said something has by the look on your mug damn fritzes sank three of our ships sergeant jock answered in his broad north country accent like several other men whod joined the company at about the same time he was from yorkshire walsh understood why he sounded so affronted everyone knew the germans made good infantry theyd proved that time and again but when they took on the royal navy in what had been englands element for lifetime after lifetime that was a bit much or more than a bit jock was still reading says a fuckin uboat helped their bloody pocket battleship for a moment he seemed a little less irate the germans were good with uboats not least because they couldnt match up on the surface they hadnt in the last war and their surface fleet was smaller this time theyd had to start over from scratch once hitler took over then jock got mad again mad enough to turn pink like a lot of yorkshiremen he was big and fair which made his flush all the easier to see you ask me it aint cricket we use planes and tanks to help infantry walsh said we do when weve got em any road thats different jock insisted its not sneakylike the way a submarine is soobmahreenthe broad yorkshire vowels turned the word into something that might have been found in a barn people who talked as if they were doing their best to sound like bbc newsreaders thought walshs welsh vowels sounded pretty funny too over the years hed had to punch a couple of them in the nose if they didnt twit him too hard though he just ignored them i expect well sink the surface raider sooner or later and we dealt with the uboats in the last war we can do it again walsh said ayebut the cost all them drowned sailors jock said hundreds of men on a cruiser and not many left alive after three went down its a bastard walsh agreed it wasnt as big a bastard as jock thought it was though england had taken casualties on the first day of the battle of the somme dead for a few square miles of cratered poisoned mud that werent worth having to begin with walsh hadnt been in the army yet in if he had he probably would have been there and if hed been there he probably wouldnt be here now weve got to do something about them buggers we do jock said as if walsh would know exactly what that something was maybe jock thought he did common soldiers often seemed to think staff sergeants knew everything staff sergeants sometimes thought they knew everything too when it came to dealing with common soldiers they did or near enough when it came to setting hitlers mustache on fire im open to suggestions walsh said dryly before jock could give him any a german machine gun stuttered to hateful life things had been quiet lately that made the short professional bursts even scarier than they would have been otherwise three french machine guns started spraying the german lines a few seconds later one of the froggies was also a professional three rounds pause three rounds pause four rounds pause the other frenchmen plainly didnt care how many gun barrels they burned through walsh didnt get excited about the machine guns he and jock werent out in the open machine guns could have kept banging away till doomsday without endangering them in the least then somebody threw a french grenade maybe a poilu saw germans coming maybe he just imagined he did any which way the bursting grenade seemed to give the landsers a kick in the arse the french machine guns hadnt something came down out of the sky with a whispering whistle and blew up with a bang much bigger than a hand grenade oh bugger walsh said down jock he dove for the dirt himself when the damned boches started throwing mortars around things stopped being fun you could hide from machine guns not a thing you could do about mortars except pray one didnt land in your hole i am down jock answered so he washe was flat as a swatted fly the smell and taste of mud filled walshs mouth and nose mud was one of the characteristic smells of war along with cordite shit and rotting meat french and english mortars answered the stubby little german guns the french s behind the lines started tearing up the german trenches naturally the fritzes responded in kind both sides pounded away with everything they had fucking idiots jock said fooking idjits it came out which made it sound all the more idiotic walsh nodded without raising his head some bored german lieutenant had probably told the feldwebel heading a machinegun crew to squeeze off a couple of belts and make the fellows in the far trenches keep their heads down and the feldwebel no doubt as bored as the officer would have answered zu befehl mein herr and told the gefreiter who actually did the work to start shooting and the gefreiter would have said jawohl and done as he was told too and then till somebody got tired of it both sides would try their best to create hell on earth their best these days was much too good nobodyd used gas yet not so far as walsh knew that was the only thing from the last wars menu still missing in this one walsh peered out from behind the rubble of what had been some middleclass french familys house till a few monthsperhaps a few weeksbefore he must have looked like a helmeted submachineguncarrying khaki marmot popping out of its hole to make sure no helmeted riflecarrying fieldgray wildcats were trying to sneak up on it he didnt see any germans scrambling forward that only further convinced him the fritzes hadnt had anything special in mind when they opened up with the mg just because you werent looking for trouble didnt mean you wouldnt find any of course while he spotted no enemy soldiers he did see a skinny grayandwhite cat daintily picking its way through the wreckage where it must have lived till war turned everything inside out it paused staring at him with eyes green as verdigris it still wore a bell on a collar which couldnt have made hunting any easier mrrow it said and yawned showing off needle teeth how did you call a cat in french walsh had no idea he did what he would have done back in blighty he snapped his fingers showed the cat his open hand palmup and went puss puss puss as persuasively as he could mrrow the cat said again it might have been more suspicious if it were less hungry it trotted toward him stopping just out of reach walsh left his hand where it was the cat stepped forward sniffed considered and then rubbed against him it started to purr hed passed whatever test it set him puss puss puss walsh said again he ducked downhe didnt want to give some sniper in a coalscuttle helmet time enough to punch his ticket for him the cat jumped into the hole with him and jock walsh scratched it behind the ears and under the chin purring louder it stropped itself against his boot whatll you do with the sorry bugger asked jock he might have suddenly discovered walsh was addicted to opium or perhaps to unnatural vice ill give it something to eat it looks like it could use a bite the sergeant answered after that well who knows if it wants to stick around for a while i dont mind why have you got something against cats dont much fancy em jock said then he shrugged a superiors vagaries werent for the likes of him to question however you please though lets see what it thinks of bully beef walsh opened a tin with his bayonet and put it on the ground in front of the cat jock made a face bugger has to be fuckin starving if itll stuff itself on that damned monkey meat walsh smiled monkey meat was a straight translation of singe what the frenchies called tinned beef walsh wondered whether jock knew that he would have bet against it even english often seemed a foreign language to the yorkshireman as for the cat it didnt care what you called the meat it advanced sniffed and fell to without the slightest trace of feline fussiness as it ate it purred much louder than it had while walsh scratched it the tin held four ounces by the way the cat emptied it the beast might have disposed of four pounds of monkey meat just as eagerly it must be hungry said walsh whose opinion of bully beef was no higher than jocksor anyone elses after it had emptied the tin and got the inside shiny clean the cat licked its chops it licked its left front paw and meticulously washed its face then it cocked a hind leg in the air and started licking its privates that deep contented purr rose once more jock gasped half scandalized half giggling bugger me blind he said if i could do summat like that damned if id go wasting my money on pussy half so often you dont think youre wasting it while you spend it walsh saidit wasnt as if the same thing hadnt occurred to him too right i dont jock agreed ruefully and i think you just named the creature too the staff sergeant added i did jock blinked then he got it and started to laugh he squatted and stroked the cat which accepted the courtesy with regal condescension nice pussy jock said pussy purred chapter hansulrich rudel and albert dieselhorst both eyed their stuka then turned to each other with identical bemused smiles no not quite identical because dieselhorst could say something hansulrich couldnt the sergeant not only could he did well sir this was your idea i know hansulrich answered when hed taken it to the armorers and then to the engineers hed been convinced it was a good one so had they theyd been so convinced theyd gone ahead and given him exactly what he said he wanted now that he saw their handiwork in the flesh so to speak he wasnt so sure he wanted it any more that said something about life he also wasnt sure he wanted to know just what you know what it looks like dieselhorst said tell me rudel urged i didnt think it looked like anything oh it does sergeant dieselhorst looked at him the way a hardbitten sergeant naturally tended to look at a ministers son it looks like our planes got a hardon thats what two hardons in fact it rudel started to tell him it looked like no such thing the words clogged in his throat because the stuka did look as if it had seen a lady airplane it fancied mounted under the wings the gun pods theyd fitted had barrels that stuck out almost as far as the prop each pod came equipped with a sheetmetal chute for ejecting spent mm cartridge cases sighing hansulrich said youve got a filthy mind albert thank you sir dieselhorst replied which wasnt at all what rudel had wanted to hear since he hadnt wanted to hear it he pretended he hadnt now we get to find out how it flies with all that extra weight itll be a pig in the airyou wait and see sergeant dieselhorst nodded but rudels forebodings didnt faze him again he wasnt shy about explaining why not to worry sir a stukas already an airpig luftschwein wasnt really a german word which didnt mean hansulrich had any trouble understanding it again rudel wanted to tell him he was wrong again he couldnt because dieselhorst wasnt even the biplane czech avias had been dangerous to jus over england the stuka was nothing but a disaster hansulrich knew hed been lucky to make it back to the continent from his handful of flights against the united kingdom the luftwaffe had to pick targets carefully here in france or too many divebombers wouldnt come back for putting bombs right where you needed them the stuka couldnt be beat for reaching the target and for getting away afterwards hansulrich had managed so farexcept once and he and dieselhorst were over germanheld territory when they bailed out so that didnt countnot to him anyhow we wont be pigs well be wild boars he said if this works the way its supposed to no panzer will be safe from us he paused as a new thought struck him do you suppose we could use the cannon to shoot down enemy planes too dieselhorst gave him a crooked grin dont know sir ill tell you one thing thoughwed only have to hit em once thats for goddamn sure he was right yet again the weapons the engineers had chosen for panzerbusting were antiaircraft guns their shells were supposed to knock out planes from the ground no doubt they could knock them out from the air as well if they hit as the sergeant suggested hitting would be the tough part now that rudel had his guns he was wild to find out what they could do no one tried to hold him back had his fellow flyers liked him better they might have tried to restrain him from rushing out with untried weaponry nobody said a word he didnt even think anyone might have he didnt know how unpopular he was and wouldnt have cared if he had known he had his convictions and the courage thereof as soon as he got the redone stuka airborne he realized he would need all the courage and conviction he could find sergeant dieselhorsts prediction that the plane would be an airpig was if anything optimistic the twin cannon and their pods weighed down the ju and loused up its aerodynamics keep your eyes peeled albert rudel said through the speaking tube why asked the veteran in the rearfacing seat we arent fast enough to run away and we cant maneuver for beans either best chance weve got is if the bastards on the other side dont spot us yet again hansulrich couldnt argue even if he wished he could he flew toward paris if the froggies and englanders had massed panzers anywhere theyd done it in front of the french capital rudels right hand tightened on the stick had paris fallen the way it was supposed to the fighting might be over by now wouldnt that have knocked france out of the war and how could england go on without a continental ally his hand tightened on the stick again in a different way this time through the palm of his leather glove he felt the wire that led up to the new firing button the engineers had mounted near the one on the stick that worked the stukas forward machine gun if panzerbusting jus ever got manufactured from scratch the installation would be neater for now this would do contemplating purposebuilt panzerbusters wasnt what made him squeeze the stick though even if france went under and england made peace the war wouldnt necessarily end a thousand kilometers off to the east or however far away it was things were just starting to boil hansulrich nodded to himself russia was the real enemy all right russia and communism if only the french and english would see what lay right in front of their noses they could follow the reich in a crusade against the godless bolsheviks rudel remembered red rabblerousers from the days when he was a boy theyd spewed their poison their lies all through germany back then the fuhrerd taken care of that but good if he got half a chance hed take care of russia too in spite of the stupid western democracies first things first rudel suddenly stiffened in the cockpit there were panzers and those werent german machines even from meters the difference in lines was unmistakable im going down albert he said and i intend to come back up again too he tipped the stuka into a dive youd better sergeant dieselhorst answered fly us into the ground and ill be a long time forgiving you heh hansulrich said as acceleration shoved him against the padding and armor in the back of his seat the enemy panzers swelled before his eyes english machines not french he thought hed decided he wanted to hit them from behind if he could the armor over the engine compartment would be thinner than anywhere else if he couldnt do that hed shoot them in the side soon now it should have been sooner still configured as a panzerbuster the stuka even dove slower than it had before his forefinger found the new firing button he pushed hard that fired one round from each underwing gun shooting a pair of mm shells from a ju gave a whole new meaning to dive brakes the recoil made the plane stagger and almost seemed to stop it in midair machine guns were nothing beside it he hauled back on the stick hard to bring the stukas nose up again howd we do he asked dieselhorst who could see where theyd just been you got him the rear gunner said enthusiastically hes burning like billybedamned its easyas long as there arent any enemy fighters around anyway ja that reminded hansulrich to look around once more to make sure he had no unwelcome company he didnt see any since he didnt he gave the dive bomber more throttle and climbed up into the sky lets do it again warum denn nicht dieselhorst said rudel couldnt think of any reason why not down roared the stuka he picked his target muzzle flashes on the ground meant the tommies were shooting at him too they always did that the divebombers engine was as well armored as the cockpit smallarms fire was unlikely to hurt the plane two mm cannon on the other hand blam the stuka staggered in the air he clawed for altitude how about it albert you killed another one jesus christ sir this is fun rudel wouldnt have taken the lords name in vain well he hoped he wouldnt have hed been known to slip in combat and every now and then when he wasnt in combat too he hoped god would forgive him although his fathers stern lutheran deity was longer on retribution than forgiveness and dieselhorst proved right yet again this was not only easy it was fun the enemy panzers couldnt hide and they were even slower running away from him than he would have been trying to flee a spitfire dive blam climb dive blam climb fish in a barrel after theyd smashed half a dozen machines the rear gunner said sir maybe wed better get back if they come after us in the air mm thats not my notion of fun mine either hansulrich admitted he wanted to keep right on doing what he was doing no matter what he wanted pretty soon the tommies or the french would scramble fighters best not to stick around till that happened and he could report that the twin cannon workedworked even better than hed hoped they would in fact colonel steinbrenner would be pleased hed probably be astonished too but so what hansulrich was more than a little astonished himself no more climbs and swoops not now whistling in the cockpit he flew off toward the northeast church bells pealed in munster celebrating the admiral scheers safe return to kiel protestant catholicit made no difference to the authorities they wanted celebration what the nazis wanted they ordered what they ordered they got so it seemed to sarah goldman anyhow the maddening thing was most of the time the nazis had little more use for pious christians than they did for jews believers had loyalties outside of the allholy state and the brownshirts and their grim clever bosses hated that most protestant ministers were socalled german christians these days christians who leaned toward the reich first and only afterwards toward god catholics still looked to the pope but pius was a long way off the local gauleiter very close equally maddening was that her own family like most jews in munster and throughout germany would have celebrated the panzerschiffs return too if only the nazis had let them sarah knew her father would have in spite of everything he still insisted he was a german as well as a jew much good that did him or any other jew in the reich he wore the yellow star of david on his ever more shabby clothes when he went out to his work gang every morning he hadnt said any of the goyim in the gang gave him trouble on account of it just because he hadnt said it didnt mean it hadnt happened though sarah knew samuel goldman kept all kinds of things to himself she knew she didnt know all of them by the very nature of that kind of conundrum she couldnt could she trying not to borrow troubleshe didnt have enough alreadyshe helped her mother fix supper it wasnt exciting boiled potatoes and something the label on the package insisted was cheese if the label hadnt insisted sarah would have guessed it was halfdried library paste you could eat it sarah had many times it tasted more like paste than cheese too her mother was a good cook much better than sarah was herself even hanna goldman couldnt make the nasty ersatz appetizing i think the rations are getting worse sarah said as she cut a potato into quarters so it would boil faster how can you tell her mother asked that kind of tart comeback usually emerged from her fathers mouth when her mother said such things the rations really were going to the dogs except dogs wouldnt want to eat them either but sarah went on they really are mother not just for jews either for everybody havent you heard the hausfraus complaining in the shops her mother only sniffed some people dont know when theyre well off if that wasnt bound to be so sarah didnt know what would be her father came in then he looked exhaustedclearing bomb damage and repairing roads didnt come easy for a middleaged professor of ancient history but he also looked pleased with himself which didnt happen every day with the air of a magician pulling a coin from a spectators ear he reached under his coat and displayed a small package wrapped in stained butcher paper look what i found he said it wasnt as dramatic as tada but it would do what is it mother exclaimed she tore the paper open at first sarah thought it was a chicken then she realized it wasnt oh a rabbit her mother said rabbits werent kosher they were cute at least when they had their fur on sarah cared about none of that spit filled her mouth hassenpfeffer she said the guy who had it said it was a rabbit samuel goldman said it may meow when you stick a fork in it though how fussy are you i ate all kinds of things in the trenches and times are pretty hard now too he was still proud of his service in the kaisers army and the wound hed got and the iron cross hed won meant the goldmans had it better than most jews in munsternot much better but a little sarah didnt need long to give him an answer right now id eat it even if i thought it was a rat me too her mother said we didnt eat those father said we knew they ate us when they got the chance damned fat hateful things he shuddered it wasnt hassenpfeffer sarahs mother made she cut up the rabbit and put it into the boiling water with the potatoes the less fuel they used the less trouble they would land in the smell of cooking meat made sarah even hungrier than she already was she hadnt thought she could get hungrier which only showed how little she knew when was the last time the goldmans ate meat she couldnt remember some sausage earlier in the year she thought what did you pay for the rabbit mother asked father isnt it a nice day today sunshine all day long he answered she sent him a look but asked no more inconvenient questions she did turn to sarah saying why dont you put the shredded cheese in the icebox as long as weve got the rabbit to go with the potatoes we wont need it tonight sure sarah was glad to do that the less she had to do with the horrible cheese the happier shed be she would have liked to toss it in the trash instead of putting it in the icebox but rabbits didnt fall out of the sky every day too bad she thought if another rabbit didnt appear tomorrow they would need the cheese again wanting it was another story that was good samuel goldman said when supper was over from somewhere hed got himself a small leather tobacco pouch he rolled himself a cigarette with casual aplomb sarah wondered where the tobacco came from right after theyd made jews wear the yellow star the nazis had cut off the tobacco ration for them one more way to make life unbearable was her father reduced to scrounging butts on the sidewalk and in the gutter the idea was enough to make angry tears sting sarahs eyes father was the very image of bourgeois dignity he had to be dying inside whenever he bent to grab a dogend that evidently didnt stop him from doing it though along with the smell which she didnt like all of a sudden sarah had a new reason for being glad she didnt use tobacco when hed smoked the handmade cigarette down to a small butt he carefully unrolled it and put the few remaining shreds back into the pouch that made sarah sure he was getting his smokes from anywhere he could when he noticed her watching him he shrugged in faint embarrassment i have a habit he said as if he were talking about injecting himself with morphine i feed it as best i can all right sarah wasnt sure whether it was or not but if smoking meant so much to father that he would let goyim laugh at him for guddling in the gutter she didnt know what she could do about it no on second thought she did know she couldnt do a thing then she forgot about such trivial matters who would pound on the door right after supper fear lanced through her because that was a question with an obvious answer the gestapo would the gestapo did whatever it pleased someone out on the front porch shouted open up you stinking jews or well make you sorry happy day something to settle supper samuel goldman remarked as he got up and limped toward the front of the house he came back a moment later with three blackshirts in his wake one of them pointed a pistol at him they all leered at sarah she didnt look at them her father seemed as calm as if they were graduate students here to discuss a textual problem in plutarch wheres your murdering bastard of a son jew the one with the luger snarled i dont know father answered that was a lie but everything was fine as long as the aryans didnt know it was a lie trying to show them how much they did know he went on im sure you would have found out if we did you must be keeping track of our mail and what we say on the telephone bet your ass the gestapo man said but somebody told us he mightve gone and joined the wehrmacht just what the reich needsa lousy kike lugging a rifle he rolled his eyesblue naturallyin disgust fear made the unexpected feast churn in sarahs belly if father felt it too he didnt show it you must have heard that saul and i both tried to join up when the war started think what you please sir but we would have fought for germany i did in the last war you know that blackshirt looked as if hed found half a cockroach in his porridge ja ja you were going to capture paris all by yourself till they shot you damn shame they didnt blow your brains out anyway this isnt about that one of the other gestapo men added or we dont think it is its about after he smashed in that aryans head hes a dangerous character your kid good sarah thought fiercely she almost screamed it in the secret policemans face that wouldnt have been so good her father only shrugged you know more than i do im afraid we havent heard from saul since since it happened if we ever find out youre lying the gestapo man glowered fearsomely you wait and see what youll find out then youll wish youd blabbed and you can take that to church both his friends thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard the one who hadnt said anything was smoking a pipe to sarah it stank like smoldering garbage but it kept them from noticing the smell of samuel goldmans cigarette sarah didnt think gathering dogends was against the law for jews anything could be against the law though if the gestapo decided it was sir i am very sorry for what my son did father said if the government had let him join the wehrmacht he would have fought the reichs foreign foes as i did in the last war but you must know i do not know where he is a couple of things he didnt say hung in the air at least to sarah one was what have you done against the reichs foreign foes none of the blackshirts looked old enough to have served under the kaiser and they obviously werent at the front now and the other was if you thought i did know where saul was id be in dachau now and youd be tearing out my toenails the blackshirts got the second of those fortunately not the first yeah well we got this report and we had to check it out said the one who did most of the talking wherever you got it i think you should put it back samuel goldman said of all the places where my son might be im sure the army is the least likely so are we the gestapo man with the pipe said taking it out of his mouth for the first time he didnt notice father hadnt said saul wasnt in the wehrmachtand a good thing too he nodded to the other blackshirts weve done what we needed to do we found out what we figured we woulddiddlysquat lets blow to sarahs relief they blew her fathers shoulders slumped he let out a long deep sigh do we have any schnapps he asked mother i could use a drink ill get you one she hurried away you were terrific sarah exclaimed you before she could say anything more father shook his head and pointed to a lamp and to a picture on the wall the goldmans hadnt found any microphones in their house just because they hadnt found them didnt mean the microphones werent therethe gestapo certainly claimed they were even if they had found them what could they have done breaking the gadgets would only have convinced the secret police they had something to hide they did but convincing the gestapo of it they needed like a hole in the head mother came back with not one but three little glasses of schnapps carrying them on a brass tray she set the tray on the table in front of the sofa everybody took a glass father pointed again to places where listening devices might lurk mother nodded she raised her glass to peace she said to peace sarah choked a little on the fiery schnapps but it felt good when it got to her stomach not even a jew could get in trouble for toasting peace she hoped peggy druce had always had a knack for complicating her life she wouldnt have been in marianske lazne when the nazis invaded if she hadnt that wasnt the first time shed done exactly what she wanted to do and worried about the consequences later it wasnt the first time consequences got up on their hind legs and bit her in the ass either but shed never done anything like this before shed been married to herb since before the war to end waranother wistful hope shot to hell shed gone plenty of places on her own in those years too she liked traveling more than herb did plenty of men had tried to get her into bed with them none had had any luck none till constantine jenkins she had all kinds of excuses shed been away from home away from herb an ungodly long time shed been drunk as a skunk christ had she ever her hangover the next morning almost called for a blindfold and a cigarette not four aspirins and bad german ersatz coffee and shed been so sure the young american diplomat was queer even drunk she would have been more on guard if she werent so sure maybe he did like boys better than girls but he was at least a switch hitter as she had reason to know she muttered to herself there in her hotel room the young american diplomat her mouth twisted in rueful selfmockery he wasnt young enough to be her son not unless shed started at an age that made people crack jokes about mississippi and alabama he wasnt far from it though that had to be one more reason she hadnt had her guard up shit she said distinctly she could come up with all kinds of reasons all kinds of excuses one of these days she still expected to get back to the states when she did she expected a happy reunion with her husband she hadnt written him about what the dog did in the nighttimeand it wasnt nothing dammit she didnt intend to lots of people including several friends carried on affairs that lasted for years without the other spouses being any the wiser she wondered how they managed maybe theyd had their consciences surgically extracted the nazis probably had a medical center somewhere that did exactly that hitler would have been the first patient followed by himmler goring and goebbels everybody whod joined the ss would have followed suit real heroes could get the job done without benefit of anesthesia peggy shook her head if she wasnt punch drunk but that wasnt the problem the problem was that shed cheated on the man shed loved for almost her entire adult life and she hadnt had her conscience removed no matter how convenient it would have been hell never know shed been telling herself as much since she woke up next to con jenkins con she shook her head again even more ruefully she hadnt known someone with such a formaleven formidablename had that onesyllable nickname she hadnt known all kinds of things about him oh no but con jenkins wasnt the point even if hed given her the problem herb druce was and so was peggy herself hell never know wasnt the point she knew she couldnt forget and she couldnt forgive herself either she was going to have to deal with this dammit she also couldnt drop con like a live grenade had she done something stupid with one of the germans whod shown he was interested she could have cut him out of her life from then on that would have helped her get back her good opinion of herself but if anybody could help her go home at last constantine jenkins was the man if he got angry at her how hard would he work to send her back to philadelphia and now that shed slept with him onceand by all the signs enjoyed it in a drunken way even if she hardly remembered it nowhow the hell was she supposed to tell him she didnt want to go to bed with him any more on the other hand if she took him to bed again in the hope that that would make him move heaven and earth to get her out of berlin how was she different from the ladies of the evening who prowled the blackedout nights looking for anything in pants and looking to get the men they found out of their pants as fast as they could im classier she thought as with hell never know it wasnt enough of an answer and something else occurred to her if she kept laying the embassy undersecretary how hard would he work to send her home wouldnt he have the best reason in the worldfrom a mans point of view or at least from a stiff dicks assuming there was any differencefor wanting to keep her available im screwed if i screw him and im screwed if i dont screw him she blurted and started to laugh she could still she how ridiculous this all was anyhow if she were reading a novel shed keep turning pages like nobodys business it was still funny in real life but with a bitter edge no novel could match the telephone chose that moment to ring peggy jumped then sprawled across the bed to pick it up bitte she said hello peggy of course it was constantine jenkins who else would it be just to drive me crazy she thought um crazier he went on i know you speak german pretty well fair she said better than when i got here i know a lot more frenchand much good that does me as a matter of fact so do i he said and he really was fluent auf deutsch while peggy struggled to make herself understood and to follow what other people said to her if he did speak french better but he was after something else because he asked her how well do you write german write it peggy could hear herself squeak in surprise i dont think ive tried since i was in high school id make a horrible mess of the grammarim sure of that how come because i want you to write a letter to adolf hitler jenkins answered whatever he thought of the fuhrer it didnt show in his voice peggy had a good idea of his opinion no gestapo man tapping the phone line would though the blackshirt might wonder if hed gone round the bend of course and who could blame a hardworking blackshirt for that peggy wondered the same thing she also wondered whether her own hearing had gone south you want me to write a letter to hitler in german he doesnt read english and i dont want his secretaries to sidetrack this they may anyhow but if it comes by way of the american embassy you have a chance of getting him to look at it constantine jenkins said sometimes you have to go straight to the top here if you can do it what should i say by now peggy was beyond flabbergasted tell him what youve been telling all the other germans youre a neutral youre stuck here and youd appreciate it if hed make it possible for you to go back to the usa and to your family a couple of paragraphs should do it you really think that will work i dont know it may lots of leaders will do favors for little people because it makes them look good and doesnt cost anything much and if he says no how are you worse off peggy had no answer for that even though he couldnt see her she nodded okay conill take a shot at it ill bring it by the embassy this afternoon she thought for a moment then called the front desk a germanenglish dictionary said the clerk who answered ja we can supply one please wait a bellboy will deliver it sofort as jenkins had before him he hung up it didnt come immediately but it didnt take long enough to annoy her the bellboy was at least sixtyfive with a bushy white mustache and a limp what had he stopped in the last war she tipped him more than she would have if he were some kid danke he said gravely and brushed a forefinger against the brim of his cap she felt like cheering when she found the dictionary included a table of declensions and another one for conjugations shed still write bad german but it wouldnt be quite so bad fuhrer she beganhe wasnt mein fuhrer not to her she set out her problem and what she wanted as simply as she could as jenkins had predicted it didnt take much more than half a page i thank you very much for your help she finished and signed her name she put the letter in an envelope but didnt seal it con jenkins would want to look it over before it went out before it went to the fuhrer she laughed again would hitler see it what were the odds but as jenkins had also asked if he didnt see it or if he said no or just ignored it how was she worse off she set the dictionary on the checkin counter as she left for the embassy i hope it was useful to you the desk clerk said it was danke schon peggy answered jenkins certainly didnt treat her like a lover when she got there she had to cool her heels for half an hour before she could see him again he was closeted with the grayhaired naval attache well that fellow probably had enough on his mind and then some the whole business with the admiral scheer and the royal navy had played out right on the usas front porch so to speak lets see what youve got the undersecretary said briskly when she made it into his office at last she was just as happy to stay businesslike she handed him the letter he read it then grinned at her oh this is fine peggy much better than i expected you didnt give your german enough credit she told him how shed borrowed the dictionary he clapped his hands good for you sweetheart he didnt sound like a fairy being arch he sounded like a lover praising his lover peggy wished he would have seemed more faggoty at least he didnt say something like ill show up at your hotel tonight so you can thank me the right way peggy asked how long do you think it will take before i know hitlers staff will have the letter tonight jenkins said what they do with it what he does with itthats out of my hands okay peggy said thanks again she got out of there as fast as she could without being rude three days later the telephone in her room rang at a quarter to five in the morning at first muzzy with sleep she thought it was the airraid siren going off when she realized it was the phone she got good and pissed off what asshole would call at this ungodly hour it was getting light but even so bitte she snarled sind sie frau druce a mans voice yes im peggy druce who the devil are you adolf hitler here the voice answered and it was as soon as he said it she knew it was shed heard him on the radio too often to have any doubt you are having trouble leaving my country when hitler said it was his country he damn well meant it uh yes sir she managed the trouble will end whatever neutral nation you wish to visit you may never let it be said we keep anyone who does not wish to stay the fuhrer told her uh peggy kept saying that shed never expected a call from one of the two or three most powerful men in the world shed never expected anything to come of her letter truth to tell thank you very much sir you are welcome have you any questions he spoke slowly and clearly to make sure she could follow even over the telephone the weight of his personality made her sag uh there it was again why are you up so early she blurted he actually chuckled how many people could say theyd made hitler laugh i am not up early i am up late the enemies of the reich do not sleep and neither do i goodbye mrs druce finding a problem so easy to solve is a pleasure believe me thank you peggy finally managed not to say uh but she was talking to a dead line chapter down screamed the stuka vaclav jezek had never yet met a man whod lived through a divebomber attack and didnt hate the german warplane with a fierce and deadly passion outside of a few luckless people down in spain no one had hated the stuka like that longer than he had hed been divebombed on the very day the nazis invaded czechoslovakia and more often than he cared to remember since get down he yelled to benjamin halevy who was working his way across the field with him i am down the jewish sergeant answered so was jezek he lay flat as a flapjack the smells of grass and dirt filled his nostrils that stuka screeched like a soul tormented in hell the sirens built into the landing gear were one more piece of german schrechlichkeit vaclav sneaked a glance at it it looked funny what were those pods under its wings not bombs surely the dive bomber couldnt have been more than fifty meters off the ground when fire blasted from the ends of the gun barrels projecting from the pods that was when vaclav realized they were gun barrels till then hed hardly noticed themno great surprise not when the stuka was hurtling down at several hundred kilometers an hour as it pulled out of the dive and roared away answering fire spurted from the rear decking of a french tank the tank started to burn the crew bailed out and ran for cover bastards got big guns under there halevy exclaimed tell me about it vaclav answered what can we do to stop him shoot him down benjamin halevy said if youve got any other bright ideas id love to hear them vaclav didnt however much he wished he did he watched the stuka climb high into the sky again then dive at another french tank he and halevy both fired at the ugly predatory warplane if they hit it they didnt harm it at least one of the rounds it fired at the tank struck homethe motorized fort slewed to a stop flame and smoke rising from the engine compartment again the stuka flew off at treetop height then started to climb once more another screaming dive another stricken french tank jesus christ jezek said he can do that all day long oh i dont know halevy said sooner or later hes bound to run out of gas or ammounless we run out of tanks first happy day vaclav sent him a reproachful look you really know how to cheer me up dont you it could be worse the jew said oh yeah how vaclav demanded the nazis could have a dozen stukas armed like that not just one halevy answered looks like theyre trying this out to see if it works if it does theyll put guns on more planes well they will on account of it damn well does jezek said does it ever three smashed tanksthree tanks smashed from an unexpected directionhad shot the allied advance in this sector right behind the ear everyone was staring wildly into the sky wondering if that stuka would come back again and it did this time it had to dive through a storm of smallarms fire but a divebomber was armored against nuisance bullets the designers must have realized it would run into some letting them disable it didnt seem such a good idea so the engineers made sure they wouldnt germans vaclav thought glumly they take care of those things sure they do benjamin halevy agreed when he said that out loud they wouldnt be so dangerous if they fucked up all the time like a bunch of magyars or romanians well you didnt say like a bunch of slovaks anyway vaclav said or them halevy replied theyre so fucked up they jumped into bed with the nazis right afraid so when the germans invaded us i had this one slovak in my squad and i wasnt sure whether hed shoot at them or try to shoot me vaclav grimaced and spat remembering so what did he end up doing the jew asked in tones of clinical interest well he didnt try and plug me straight offi will say that for him jezek answered after that fuck me if i know we were right at the point of the bayonet if you know what i mean and things fell apart pretty fast maybe a stuka blew him to kingdom come or maybe he surrendered to the nazis if he did hes likely a sergeant in the slovak army by now in the slovak army by the way halevy said it it tasted bad in his mouth well it tasted bad in vaclavs mouth too czechs no more believed slovaks had a right to their own country than germans believed czechs had a right to theirs slovaks were bumpkins country cousins hillbillies who talked funny and drank too much and beat their wives only country cousins could take the hlinka guard and a fat windbag like father tiso seriously and now slovakia was a country with father tiso as its tinpot fuhrer or whatever the devil they called him the hlinka guard did its best halfassed imitation of the ss and bohemia and moravia the cradle of the czech nation since time out of mind had been bombed and shelled to kingdom come and the german occupiers treated them exactly the way locusts treated a ripe wheatfield life could be a real son of a bitch sometimes sometimes it could be a lot worse than that you know what we ought to do halevys question derailed vaclavs gloomy train of thought which might have been just as well whats that vaclav asked no he wasnt sorry to think about something else we ought to let our brass know the germans have themselves a new toy the sergeant said if those assholes can pull a stunt like that we should be able to do the same thing right right jezek said but his voice lacked conviction the germans were good at pulling new stuff out of the hat that was part of what made them germans at least in a czechs eyes how good the french and english were at the same game the war was a long way from new but the french were just now figuring out that german tank tactics beat the snot out of their own halfbright ideas benjamin halevy gave him a crooked grin cmon man weve got to try the jew said we keep our mouths shut nobody with the clout to do anything about it will find out whats going on for another month and a half you think the tankersll tell vaclav considered that but not for long tankers thought their big clattering mounts were perfect they wouldnt want to admit that the enemy had come up with a big new flyswatter sighing jezek said lets go the next problem of course was getting an officer to listen to them two noncoms one a czech the other a czech and a jew naturally the french thought of halevy as a czech even if hed been born in francehe spoke czech didnt he didnt have an easy time getting through to the fellows with fancy kepis at last though a captain said yes ive already heard about this from other soldiers and halevy said the captain looked at him he turned red and sir even vaclav with his fractured french followed that bit of byplay i will do what i can the captain said i dont know how much i can do i am not in the air force after all sergeant halevy translated that for vaclav then he went back to french to inquire sir if no one says anything at all to the air force what will happen then he also turned the question into czech rien the officer replied nothing was a word jezek followed with no trouble the frenchman went on but it could also be that the air force will do nothing just because the army is screaming at it to move those pilots dont want everybody in the army spitting at them theyd better start treating german tanks the way the nazis treated ours vaclav said sergeant halevy did the honors with the translation vaclav thought it sounded better in czech than it did in french yes yes the captain said impatiently he looked from one grubby frontline soldier to the other now men you have done your duty you have done what you thought you had to do and you have done it well you can do no more in this regardit is up to me to take it from here i will do so you had best return to your own positions before the officers set over you start wondering where you are and why go away get lost the message once halevy translated it was unmistakable and the jew and vaclav went what else could they do maybe the officer would make some progress with his superiors and the air force maybe not but two foreign or halfforeign noncoms couldnt back to the war vaclav thought gloomily and back to the war it was the spanish nationalists had always had more artillery and better artillery than the republicans up on the ebro front chaim weinberg had got resigned to that it was part of the war and something you had to deal with like the endless factional strife between communists and anarchists on the republican side since the soviet union supplied communist forces in spain while the anarchists had to scrounge whatever they could wherever they could the red flags had had a big advantage over the red and black now nobody supplied anybody in spain not in any reliable way everyone was too busy with the bigger war off to the northeast both sides had forgotten about this particular brawl between progressive and reactionary forcesexcept for the people still doing the fighting and dying here the nationalists still had the guns hitler and mussolini had lavished on marshal sanjurjo what they didnt have any more were the endless crates of highquality italian and german ammunition theyd already fired it off so if they wanted to shoot at the republicans defending madrid they had to use shells they made themselves spanish factories didnt turn out nearly so much ammo as the ones in germany and italy not only that spanish artillery rounds like spanish smallarms ammunition were junk chaim didnt know why that should be so but it was at least half the shells the nationalists threw at the republicans lines just north of university city were duds he would have liked to think the workers in the munitions plants were sabotaging their fascist masters he would have liked to but he couldnt the ammo that reached the republicans from factories in madrid and barcelona was every bit as crappy the workers on the republican side should have had every incentive to do the best work they could they did have every incentive in fact but the best work they could do wasnt very good and what do you expect mike carroll asked when chaim complained about that theyre spaniards for chrissake theyre brave theyd give you their last bullet or their last cigarette or the shirt off their back but they havent heard about the twentieth century hell they havent heard much about the eighteenth centuryand what they have heard they dont like as far as theyre concerned its still theyve cleaned out the moors and theyre waiting to see what happens when that columbus guy gets back as if to punctuate his words another dud thudded in fifty meters away and buried itself in the hard brown dirt that was too close for comfort it would have been dangerous had it gone off chaim noddedwhat mike said held some truth but only some as he pointed out so how come the republic won the election then the kind of progressive government spain hadthe kind our chunks still gotdoesnt come out of not out of either think of it as a peasant uprising carroll said spain was like russia it was one of the places where the jerks on top came down hardest on everybody under them so of course it was the place where the reaction against oppression hit hardest thats how the dialectic works man more shells came in from the nationalist gun pits off in the hills some of these burst fortunately none too close to the arguing internationals chaim peeped over the parapet to make sure sanjurjos soldiers werent trying anything under cover of the barrage he ducked down in a hurry no point letting snipers get a good look at him then he took out a pack of gitanes and lit one can i bum a butt off you mike asked eagerly im all out sure chaim answered without rancor holding out the pack mike would dohad donethe same for him plenty of times the big blond american leaned close to chaim for a light thanks carroll took a drag he made a face as he exhaled fuck me if i know how the frenchies smoke these goddamn things all the time better than nothing chaim said which wasnt disagreement he chuckled sourly see this is what it really comes down to shitty shells and shitty tobacco not the dialectic oh no mike stuck out his chin and looked stubborn oh no everything comes down to the dialectic in the end without the dialectic the world makes no sense and if the world makes no sense who gives a rats ass about shells and cigarettes if you dont how come you keep working on your bombproof there chaim retorted and who just scrounged that cigarette wasnt it some guy who looks a lot like you with the evidence still sending up a thread of smoke from the corner of carrolls mouth he couldnt very well deny the charge he did look exasperated and he had his reasons which he proceeded to spell out if a political officer hears you talking like that youll be lucky if you get off with public selfcriticism you could end up in a lot more trouble than that and you know it chaim did he didnt like it he took americanstyle freedom of speech for granted he also took the revolution of the proletariat for granted when one set of ideals ran headlong into the other like a couple of linemen on a football field he ended up with a bad case of what did the guy with the glasses and the chin beard call it at this one lecture hed gone to cognitive dissonance he said happily huh mike said he could talk about the dialectic till everything turned blue but if something wasnt in the marxistleninist lexicon he didnt know and didnt want to know chaim thought that made him narrow but more communists were made in his image than in chaims never mind weinberg said then alert as a prairie dog at a rattlesnake convention he sat up and pointed north whats that he asked his voice rising in alarm airplanes mike said lots of airplanes cigarettes and ammo might not trump the almighty dialectic but airplanes did carroll wasted no more time discussing them he dove into the bombproof chaim had been teasing him about only a few minutes earlier chaim had a bombproof too shored up with whatever bits of timber he could liberate he didnt jump into it right away he had a prairie dogs curiosity it made him stare up at the swarm of jus and hes rumbling across the sky all of them it seemed straight toward him the junkers trimotors were obsolete as bombers except in spain the heinkels still did their deadly work everywhere from england to the soviet border where were the republican fighters that would have given this air armada a hard time wherever they were they werent here and here was where they needed to be when bombs started tumbling out of the enemy planes chaim dove for his burrow like any prairie dog that wanted to live to raise a new litter air attack was even worse than artillery bombardment chaim thought so when he was being bombed anyhow when he was being shelled his opinion changed it changed again when machine guns tried chewing him to bits whatever was happening to you right now was the worst thing in the world till something else happened this was plenty bad enough dirt trickled down between his bits of planking it wasnt just that it got on the back of his neck as he huddled there if one of those bombs set all the dirt above him crashing down he would die without any direct enemy wound how good had his carpentry been one way or the other hed find out no he didnt want it to be or the other more and more bombs whistled down bombs were easy to make impact fuses explosives and sheet metal even spaniards had a tough time screwing up the combination the nationalists had it down solid enough already goddammit chaim screamed no one paid any attention to him eventually bombs started falling farther away the drone from the bombers engines faded then disappeared it was overtill the next time chaim crawled out he nodded to mike carroll who was emerging from his bombproof at the same time then he peered over the battered parapet to make sure sanjurjos men werent rushing forward to take advantage of the bombing run they werent german troops probably would have been however brave spaniards wereand both sides were above and beyond the call of dutythey werent what anyone would call efficient the landscape had been drastically rearranged except for a few saplings leaning at odd angles it might have come straight from the cratered moon seeing he wouldnt need his rifle right away chaim set it down he pulled another gitane from the pack he missed his mouth the first time he put it in and he needed three or four tries before he could light a match mike watched with knowing eyes ive been there he said give me another one will you sure chaim said if the other international had teased him he probably wouldnt have but mike had indeed been through the mill with him they smoked together little by little chaim stopped shaking cigarettes helped as much as anything except maybe brandy trouble was nothing helped much watch yourself pete herman szulc warned here come the japs i see em pete mcgill answered theyd patched things up after a fashion and on shanghais mad crowded streets missing japanese soldiers was harder than seeing them the japs were the only people who behaved as if all the chinese frantically hawking this that and the other thingand the europeans who livened up the throngswerent there at all they marched straight ahead if you didnt clear out theyd knock you down with rifle butts or just shoot you if they happened to be in a lousy mood and then walk over you you couldnt do anything about it shanghai was theirs pete got out of the way along with his marine buddies they stood out in the crowd not just because they were white but because they stood a head taller than most of the chinese around them pete met the eyes of a noncom he nodded first with respect but without fear respect would do the jap nodded back as if to say maybe some other time but not now then he shouted at his men they were already stiff as robots they got stiffer yet goddamn monkeys think theyre as good as white people szulc muttered watch it herman sergeant larry koenig snapped too many folks here savvy some english yeah yeah szulc said they werent on duty he didnt have to kowtow to koenig because the sergeant had those three stripes on his sleeve you better watch it herman pete still enjoyed sticking the needle in way you go on you figure polacks are as good as white people ah your mother szulc said if hed been drunk they might well have started banging away at each other right there but it was still morning nobodyd got potted yet another company of japanese soldiers marched by they did think they were as good as white men their faces were hard and impassive but every line of their bodies shouted their pride we beat the crap out of the russians once and now were doing it again they might have yelled and if you yankees want to fuck around with us step right up well knock your ass over teakettle too they couldnt have been more different from the chinese who scrambled away from them the chinese knew they were licked everybody knocked them around they couldnt do a damn thing about it any more than a wife stuck in a rotten marriage could when her husband beat her up for the hell of it she might hate hell she had to hate all the more when she had no hope hate or not though she was stuck she had to take it so did the chinese good thing the japs dont know you got yourself that white russian girlfriend herman szulc said with a leer theyd probably figure she was radioing everything you tell her straight to old joe stalin jesus christ herman shut the fuck up pete said you open your big dumb mouth any wider youll fall right in who you callin dumb szulc growled some dumb guys didnt have a hint that they werent the brightest bulbs in the chandelier others were uneasily aware that their candlepower left something to be desired you really pissed them off when you called them stupid because down deep they feared you knew what you were talking about szulc was one of those he folded his hands into rocklike fists knock if off herman sergeant koenig told him you got him so he got you back he called me a polack first szulc said sometimes the marine corps looked a lot like thirdgrade recess koenig only laughed yeah so what are you a sheeny like weinstein not me szulc crossed himself he aint just a yid neither hes a fuckin red if anybodys sending shit to stalin hes the guy it was a good thing max wasnt there or he would have tried to clean szulcs clock for him it wasnt that he wasnt a red but he didnt let anybody rag on him for being a jew there werent many jewish leathernecks the handful pete had known were uncommonly tough even for the corps before anything else could happen the clock in the tower of the new customs house chimed the hour pete checked his watch it was a few minutes fast so he adjusted it hurray for big ching he said it wasnt big ben but it was halfway around the world from london lottery ticket a woman screeched in the marines faces no wantchee pete said shaking his head hed picked up a bit of pidgin english since coming to shanghai it wasnt used much in peking there the locals either knew english or much more often they didnt here pidgin seemed a halfway house between english and chinese people whod been here longer than he had said it held bits of portuguese too and a mostly chinese way of putting words together my no savvy the woman said you savvy plenty good koenig told her get lost that wasnt proper pidgin but she understood it anyhow she said something in chinese that sounded like a cat getting its tail stepped on koenig only laughed good thing i dont know what that meant or id have to do something about it he said then the woman spoke two words of perfectly clear englishfuck youand accompanied them with the appropriate gesture pete wondered whether shed learned that from a leatherneck or an english marine shed got it down solid wherever shed found it and larry koenig went nuts no slantyeyed cunts gonna give me the finger he yelled and started after her with intent to maim or maybe to murder pete and herman szulc looked at each other for a split second then they both grabbed the sergeant and held on for dear life take it easy man pete said youll set all the chinks off sure enough the small goldenskinned men and women were pointing and giggling at the spectacle of two white men trying to hold back a third like i give a shit let me go goddammit koenig tried something pete had last seen from a dirtyfighting coach before he went overseas he still remembered what to do about itremembered without thinking the knowledge literally beaten into him he jerked twisted and koenig gasped in pain ill break your wrist if you try any more of that pete said and the other man had to know he meant it now calm down okay what koenig said then would have made a marine sergeant blushexcept he was one cmon mantake an even strain szulc advised also not letting go just an old chinese broad shes gone now anyway so she was the crowd had swallowed her up ill find her ill wring her scrawny neck when i do too koenig ground out he surged against the marines who held himbut he didnt try anything else cute you and mcgillve been in china too long youre both going asiatic yourself szulc opined you want to clobber this gal for nothing and hes all mushy over that golddigging taxi dancer this placell drive anybody nuts if he stays long enough if pete hadnt been hanging on to koenig for all he was worth he would have taken a swing at szulc himself then the chinese would have been treated to the spectacle of three americans each trying to beat the crap out of the other two even japanese soldiers would have laughed at that when the people who hated you fought among themselves how could you lose simple you couldnt and so pete didnt clobber herman szulc no matter how much herman deserved it and koenig did eventually calm downenough so they could let go of him anyhow and they walked on through shanghai just as if it were their town after all north the front faced north to hideki fujita that meant one thing and one thing only the kwantung army stood firmly astride the transsiberian railway if the russians wanted to do anything about it they would have to come to the japanese he didnt think they would have an easy time doing that his own countrymen had attacked the railroad in other places too japanese radio claimed all kinds of breakthroughs against the red army but fujita had seen enough to understand that not everything the radio said was exactly true you needed to impress the foreigners who were bound to be listening he did know what was happening behind him japanese engineers were systematically tearing up the railroad track and mining the ground on which it had lain the russians wouldnt have an easy time putting the transsiberian railway back together even if they did drive off the kwantung army and without the railroad vladivostok would starve bombers from japanese aircraft carriers and from bases in manchukuo already pounded the town the russians were hunkering down for a siege well theyd done the same thing at port arthur it hadnt saved them then fujita didnt think it would save them now he pictured a map in his mind would the emperor take vladivostok for japan or would he say it was territory redeemed for manchukuo it didnt really matter one way or the other japanese influence would predominate no matter which flag flew there then russian artillery opened up the reds hadnt gone away even if fujita wished they would have he cocked his head to one side gauging the flight of the shells by the way they snarled through the air he relaxed nothing aimed at himnot this time he lit an aeroplane smoke helped when you couldnt take a drink everything around you seemed a little less important while you had a cigarette going it was as if as if you were laying down a smoke screen against the outside world he liked that well enough to say it out loud shinjiro hayashi grinned and dipped his head oh very good sergeantsan he said if hayashi with his education appreciated the joke that meant it was a good one didnt it fujita wished he wouldnt have had the afterthought he remembered the days when he was a private himself any stupid joke the sergeant cracked was funny for no other reason than that he was a sergeant if you didnt laugh hed thump you like a drum of course sergeants slapped privates around that was what privates were for if you didnt keep your sergeant greased the army would get even more miserable than it already was for a private now fujita had a thin gold stripe and two stars on his red collar tabs now he was the one who expected the sorry bastards under him to laugh at whatever came out of his mouth and they did oh they did they knew where their rice came from all right but that meant he couldnt trust them they would laugh even if he said something stupidno especially if he said something stupid he remembered doing that what was sweeter than laughing at a puffedup sergeant who was playing the fool and didnt even know it nothing for a private all the more reason for a sergeant to watch himself privates were unreliable officers thought they were little tin gods you had to take care of yourself nobody would do it for you that also applied when the russians came some of the people you led wouldnt be sorry to see you dead if they got the chance to arrange that in a way that wouldnt land them in trouble they were liable to do it those were thoughts fujita wished he hadnt had when lieutenant hanafusa came up to him and said youve done well since you got here sergeant i wondered about you because you didnt have much experience fighting in forests but nobody can say you havent picked it up in a hurry thank you very much sir fujita wondered what hanafusa had in mind he also wondered if he would have done better to stay on manchukuos mongolian frontier where only sandstorms kept you from seeing for kilometers every which way and where any tree was a prodigy and so he heard the platoon commanders next words with a mournful lack of surprise we need some prisoners for interrogation take your squad forward and get me a couple try not to make too much of a fuss while youre doing it yes sir fujita saidthe only thing he could say he did ask right now sir or may we wait till after dark lieutenant hanafusa looked surprised as if the possibility had never crossed his mind it probably hadnt hed got the order from above and hadnt thought twice about it after a few seconds he said i suppose it will keep that long yes sir fujita repeated he couldnt say thank you again he would have meant it this time scooting forward at night he and his men had at least a chance of coming back in one piece it started raining before the squad set out fujita didnt know whether to take that for good luck or bad it would make finding russians harder but it would also make it harder for the reds to hear his men coming nothing he could do about it either way he just had to hope for the best stick close together he told the japanese well grab the first couple of men we catch and head on back he made it sound easy whether it would be he had a compass that glowed in the dark without it he probably would have blundered around in circles even by daylight you couldnt see very far in these woods at night in the rain he wondered what lieutenant hanafusa would say if he came back and told him the squad couldnt find any russians nothing good he was sure of that he walked right into a tree zakennayo he snarled it would have been worse if he werent wearing his helmet he would have mashed his nose instead of scratching his cheek muffledand sometimes not so muffledcurses from his men said they were having their troubles too how were you supposed to walk straight when you couldnt see where you were putting your feet only luck nobody sprained an ankle or maybe broke one and the lieutenant was back somewhere warm and dry of course he was he was an officer then somebody bumped into him before he could call his own man a clumsy idiot the other fellow growled metyeryebyets fujita didnt quite know what the endearment meant he did know it wasnt in japanese grab him boys he said happily the red army man didnt want to get grabbed fujita hit him in the side of the head with his entrenching tool the russian was wearing a helmet but it rang his bell anyhow if he hadnt had the helmet fujita might have smashed in his skull that would have been a waste of some good luck hanafusa wanted a couple of prisoners if they didnt nab somebody else maybe i can blame it on the rain fujita thought or maybe not officers looked for results if you didnt give them what they told you to get whom would they blame themselves for giving idiotic orders fat chance and than senior private hayashi whooped ive got another one by the shouts and scuffle that followed who had whom wasnt obvious the russians must have sent out their own patrol and it had blundered straight into fujitas sometimes luck counted more than skill the japanese snagged the second red army man a russian opened up with a submachine gun but none of the bullets came anywhere close to the the japanese the red was firing blind lets get out of here fujita said hed never had an order obeyed with such alacrity japanese sentries almost fired on the patrol before fujita convinced them he was on their side he hadnt come in where he thought and had to make his way back to lieutenant hanafusa all rightyou got them hanafusa said eyeing the battered unshaven miserablelooking russian captives not so bad neh if fujita used the entrenching tool on hanafusas skull theyd kill him a millimeter at a time he knew that but his hand twitched all the same he made it hold still no sir he said expressionlessly chapter photographs and posters made marshal sanjurjo look tall and stern and heroic he always wore splendid uniforms joaquin delgadillo liked that if you were somebody you should look as if you were in the flesh sanjurjo was less imposing he had a lot of fleshwere those three chins or four he was shorter and wider than the posters made him out to be he was also at least fifteen years older he looked like a village druggist just on the point of retiring he still wore a fancy uniform and whether he was a hero or not he had cojones enough to come up to the front on the northwestern outskirts of madrid if some traitorand there were always traitorshad let the republicans know he was coming they could smash up these trenches with mortar bombs and cut off the nationalist states head or a lucky sniper could take care of it the enemys trenches lay almost a kilometer off but even so sanjurjo eyed sergeant carrasquel who stood at stiff attention a slow smile spread across the marshals face he set a hand on carrasquels shoulder he knew what kind of creature he had before him so tell me sergeant how are things here tell me the truth he said digame la verdad he made the last three words a caressing invitation its fucked up sir but its always fucked up so what can you do the sergeant answered the republicans are as stubborn as we are and the internationals over yonder theyre damn good troops we need more of everything if were gonna shift em you get what we have sanjurjo said no anger in his voice yes sir but we dont have enough the sergeant said just so you know the rations suck too the look in his eye said hed noticed sanjurjo wasnt missing any meals not even carrasquel seemed ready to come out with that though you said itthings are fucked up the crude phrase sounded much more elegant in marshal sanjurjos mouth the marshal turned to delgadillo is this a good man sergeant ive got plenty worse sir carrasquel replied that was the kindest thing hed ever said about joaquin sanjurjos pouchy eyes were clever also like a village druggists how is it with you soldier he asked speak freely i didnt come here to listen to polite bullshit he used the english word with a certain sour relish delgadillo had heard it from the republicans often enough to know what it meant its war sir he said how is it supposed to be thats a fair question son sanjurjo said its supposed to be a lot like this sometimes its worse eh sergeant it can always get worse carrasquel spoke with deep conviction i was in morocco fighting against the rifs if it gets much worse than that i dont want to know about it by god that was bad sanjurjo agreed maybe the western front in the last war was worse so much slaughter and for nothing but maybe it wasnt worse too when you fought the rifs you knew they really meant it sergeant carrasquel nodded oh are you ever right there sir all delgadillo knew about the rifs was that they were savages and the spanish army had beaten them hed been a little kid when that fight ended so carrasquel had been in morocco then had he he didnt look old enough maybe vipers aged slower than ordinary human beings i hoped our friends would go on supplying us after the european war started butsanjurjo spread his plump palmsasi es la vida the republicans have the same worries we can still beat them we will still beat them eh absolutamente your excellency delgadillo said quickly was he going to tell the marshal the nationalists would lose not likely sergeant carrasquel might be convinced he was a dope but he wasnt that big a dope bueno sanjurjo said and stumped down the trench a gaggle of aides in almost equally gaudy uniforms followed him they ignored joaquin but edged away from sergeant carrasquel they knew a dangerous man when they saw one well kid you can tell your grandchildren you talked with a big shot once upon a time carrasquel said gruffly yeah how about that joaquin said the caudillo it wasnt quite so strong a title as fuhrer or duce but it was plenty strong enough carrasquel glanced after sanjurjos henchmen when he decided theyd got out of earshot he went on you know what else you can tell your grandkids what sergeant delgadillo asked as he was obviously meant to do tell em sanjurjos shit stinks just like yours the older man growled joaquin blinked hed expected something different he looked around too to make sure no one could overhear satisfied he spoke in a low voice if you feel that way how come your arent fighting for the republic chinga the republic carrasquel spat those assholes think workers shit doesnt stink just on account of theyre workers everybodys shit stinks god damn it to hell everybodys you get down to the bottom of it its all shit if hed been on the other side of the line when the fighting started would he be cussing out the nationalists now delgadillo couldnt ask hed said too much already but he wouldnt have been surprised carrasquel needed to fight somebody who probably didnt matter much and after some of the things joaquin had seen he had a devil of a time thinking the sergeant was wrong shit and rotten meat and maggots things did end up like that all right what you did before then mattered though didnt it if it does what am i doing here what was joaquin doing here theyd drafted him theyd made sure he couldnt run away and theyd beaten the stuffing out of a couple of luckless lugs who tried theyd shoot him if he deserted at the front and they wouldnt even waste a cigarette on him before they did in spite of everything theyd made a soldier out of him turning into a soldier gave him the best chance to live a republic machine gun growled to malign life one of marshal sanjurjos aides a tall gangly man whose head must have stuck up above the rim of the trench let out a choking moan and crumpled clutching at himself medics rushed over to him delgadillo wondered how long he would have had to lie there if hed got hit a hell of a lot longer than that he was sourly sure the medics carried the groaning officer past him on a stretcher how bad carrasquel asked in tones of professional interest scalp wound hes bleeding like a pig but he ought to make it a medic answered a few centimeters lower and he shook his head madonna it hurts the officer said i gave you morphine senor the medic told him itll make you easier soon he and his comrades lugged the man away it could have been the caudillo joaquin said not unless he really was as big as his pictures make him out to be carrasquel said so delgadillo wasnt the only one whod had that thought the rest of sanjurjos aides plainly thought theyd seen as much of the front as they wanted to and more besides sanjurjo himself took the wounding and the firing that went on afterwards in stride his attitude declared hed known worse he had nervethat much of what they said about him to make him look good was true anyhow major uribes shrill voice rang out come on my dears we have to let them know they cant get away with being so rude joaquin fired a few shots toward the republican lines he saw no good targets but fired anyway a bullet might do something the one that creased the aides head sure had beside him sergeant carrasquel was doing the same thing so were nationalist soldiers all along the line one of their machine guns opened up and then another another republican murder mill responded it was getting dangerous out whichever side you were on as joaquin delgadillo put a fresh clip on his rifle he glanced toward sanjurjo what did the marshal make of his maricon battalion commander by his smile he already knew about bernardo uribe if you were a good enough soldier you could get away with almost anything that didnt hurt the way you fought uribe was and then some how many times had joaquin yelled maricon at the republicans and now he had a fairy giving him orders war was a crazy business all right he shouldered the reloaded piece and squeezed off another shot at the enemy moscow speaking the newsreaders familiar voice came out of the radio at the byelorussian airstrip sergei yaroslavsky drank from a glass of strong sweet tea as he listened to the morning report another pilot walked over to the battered samovar bubbling in a corner of the tent and poured a glass for himself he already had a papiros sticking up at a jaunty angle from the corner of his mouth as if he were franklin d roosevelt tobacco and teahow could you run a war without them on vodka thats how sergei thought the russians had run on vodka long before theyd ever heard of tea or cigarettes and on beer and mead and wine before they knew about vodka that was all very well for a foot soldier he thought about flying his sb smashed out of his skull he grimaced no not a pretty picture comrade stalin reports heavy fighting on the frontier between the peaceloving soviet union and the regime of hitlers jackal marshal smiglyridz the newsreader said that was code of sorts if you knew how to read between the lines fierce fighting and stubborn fighting werent so bad when they started talking about heavy fighting the devils grandmother had spilled the pisspot into the borscht well that was nothing he didnt already know if things were going well would he have had to get out of poland while german shells cratered the runway from which hed been flying across the table from him anastas mouradian raised one dark eyebrow a few millimeters the armenian had no trouble understanding news reports either sergei sometimes thought armenians and jews and people like that were born reading between the lines he wondered why russians werent some russians didnt even seem to know there were lines to read between despite the red armys displays of heroism the campaign in the area illegally occupied by the polish junta has not necessarily gone to the soviet unions advantage in all respects due to the nazis treacherous intervention in a fight where they had no true interest the radio newsreader paused portentously accordingly comrade stalin finds that the situation has changed he paused again making sure he had everyones attention he didall the officers waking up in the tent stared toward the radio curls of smoke rose from papirosi being smoked or held between index and middle fingers changed in the middle of a war there were few more ominous words changed how the newsreader had the answer straight from the general secretarys lips up till this time our dispute with the vile polish clique has concerned only the border region they unjustly occupied but now that the jackals have invited the deadly german viper into their filthy burrow they make it only too clear that they are a danger to all lovers of peace this being so we are no longer concerned with the border region alone we shall punish the smiglyridz regime as it deserves its very existence is a product of our unfortunate weakness during the civil wars following the glorious soviet revolution we shall make polandall of polandpay for its brazen effrontery he went on to talk about the war in the far east he also described the fighting there as heavy which wasnt good news but sergei listened with only half an ear he and stas mouradian werent the only men who exchanged glances of what looked much too much like consternation no one said anything people naive or stupid enough to do that had been weeded out by a process of brutal darwinian selection even expressions could endanger though somebody in here was bound to report to the nkvd then again maybe the local chekist whoever he was also wore a look of consternation who wouldnt if what the newsreader said meant what it sounded like the ussr intended to attack or more likely was attacking poland up and down their long frontier the red army was much bigger than its polish opposite number if it was much better it hadnt shown it yet and that was only half the problemthe smaller half at that so far hitler had been fighting a limited war against the soviet union if stalin widened that war wouldnt the fuhrer do the same the red army was bigger than the wehrmacht too better anybody who said so probably spewed out propaganda for the radio and the newspapers widening the war would have been adventurous enough without the fight in the far east with it sergei was reminded of a dinosaur like brontosaurus if it was looking forward when something bit it at the end of the tail how long would it take to notice the trouble back there he shook his head as he lit a papiros of his own and stuck the end of the paper holder into his mouth he had to watch himself the ussr was a progressive statethe most progressive state in the world as a matter of fact youd better not think of it as a dinosaur if you did you were liable to say something like that out loud and if you did open your big mouth it would be a camp or a bullet in the back of the head for you darwinian selection all right the news ended music as syrupysweet as crimean champagne poured out of the radio no one turned it off even so if you didnt want to listen to what the state wanted you to hear werent you subtly antisoviet somebody was liable to think you were anyhow and that would be all it took but you didnt have to pay attention to the music the way you did with the news well well someone ventured how about that someone else added we can whip the poles sergei said that was only a kopek out of his ruble of thought but it was the kopek he could spend in public sure we can three or four men said the same thing at the same time they all sounded relieved to be able to come out with something safe well sergei was relieved to come out with something safe himself i wish hitler didnt have panzers in poland anastas mouradian remarked no one responded to that not for a little while stas liked to sail close to the wind and everybody knew it who in the tent didnt wish there were no germans in poland the poles were easier to beat mouradian hadnt criticized anyone still even mentioning those panzers seemed faintly indecent well maybe it wont be so bad sergei said you couldnt get in trouble for optimism though he did wish he could have that maybe back maybe the nazis will see were serious about this polish business and clear out another flyer put in theyve got their own troubles on their other frontier we dont of course mouradian said dryly he was no brontosaurus he could contemplate wounded head and wounded tail at the same time not like theirs the other flyer insisted he wasnt wrong how much did being right matter though they only fought for four years on two fronts last time mouradian said this wasnt the first time hed brought up that inconvenient truth they lost sergei said his crewmate sent him an et tu brute look before mouradian could say anything the other pilot ran to the conversational ball and booted it far down the pitch thats right and theyll lose this time too the historical dialectic makes it inevitable the dialectic heavy artillery you could blow anybody out of the water when you trotted out the dialectic but anastas mouradian didnt stay there to be blown to rhetorical smithereens he nodded politely no doubt comrade but how far will the cause of socialism be set back by the conflict how many farms and cities and little children will go up in smoke a fine question for the fellow who aims the bombs to ask the pilot sneered i serve the soviet union mouradian said i do try to serve the soviet union intelligently there was another one nobody wanted to touch sergei was far from sure serving the soviet union intelligently was what the apparatchiks who ran the country wanted you got a command you carried it out you had no business wondering about it that wasnt your responsibility but were you a man or were you a sheep which way were you more valuable to the state if you were a man werent you safer pretending to grow wool sergei knew damn well you were how much baaing had he already done how much more would he have to do the power to bind the power to loose st peter had it if you took jesus seriously whether you took jesus seriously or not adolf hitler had itinside the borders of the third reich anyhow peggy druce found that out in a hurry once the fuhrer said she could leave germany the mountains that had stood in her way for so long all at once turned into molehills konrad hoppe came to her hotel room and affixed an exit visa to her passport as exactingly as if he were working with gold leaf the scrawny foreign ministry official had met with her once before to explain why she couldnt get out because we dont want you to thats why was what it boiled down to peggy couldnt resist saying nice of you to change your mind hoppe didnt notice the sarcasmor if he did he was armored against it like a battleship my superiors have given me my orders frau druce i follow them theyd given him different orders not so long before hed followed those too what did jerome k jerome call the german attitude toward civic responsibility peggy smiled remembering blind obedience to everything in buttonsthat was it and the englishman writing at the very end of the nineteenth century had gone on to say hitherto the german has had the blessed fortune to be exceptionally well governed if this continues it will go well with him when his troubles will begin will be when by any chance something goes wrong with the governing machine had jerome k jerome had a crystal ball or maybe one of hg wells time machines to look into the future and see just what would happen next if he could see it why couldnt everybody else hell why couldnt anybody else why couldnt the germans see it themselves blind obedience to everything in buttons dammit she realized shed missed some pearl of wisdom falling from herr hoppes lips im sorry i saidhe rolled his eyes at anglosaxon lightmindednessthe train to copenhagen departs each afternoon at half past three shall i secure you a pullman berth on todays train now they couldnt get rid of her fast enough yes please she said and even unbent enough to add thank you very much then she decided to press her luck a little can you send me a cab so i can bring my suitcase along easier she would have gone without itlord she would have gone naked if she had tobut why not see what she could get away with konrad hoppe didnt even blink aber naturlich the cab will be here at half past two precisely taxis in wartime fuelstarved berlin were almost as scarce as nazi big shots with jewish wives but the fuhrer had ordered the machinery to give peggy what she wanted and hoppe was one of those smoothly turning gears he did say please remember to be punctual jawohl peggy said mussolini boasted that he made the trains in italy run on time but he lied everything in germany ran on time as far as peggy could see nobody had to make it do that it just did half past two wouldnt mean or it would be on the dot and she would be in the lobby waiting very well then hoppe clicked his heels if you will excuse me dear lady with a nod that was almost a bow he made his getaway ill make mine too peggy thought almost delirious with glee but she had to attend to one more thing no matter how little she wanted to she picked up the telephone in her room when the hotel operator asked whom she wanted to call she sighed and said the american embassy please one moment the german woman said primly it took more than a moment but peggy had known it would like every other part of civilian life the telephone system was neglected these days well all except one part of it somebody from the gestapo or the sd would be listening to her conversation she was as sure of that as she was of her own name what could you do though the embassy operator came on the line the hotel operator put peggy through she gave her name and asked to speak to constantine jenkins one moment the embassy operator said only in english not german he may be in a meeting if he was peggy could get out of berlin with a clear conscience she laughed a sour internal laugh would she ever have a clear conscience again it seemed painfully improbable but she would have done her best here no it wasnt the same thing goddammit the operator came back on the line i can connect you to him thank you peggy said not without wincing shed been connected to the undersecretary all right hadnt she just hello mrs druce jenkins sounded properly formal no doubt he also knew the nazis would be tapping the telephone lines hi i just wanted to let you know theyve got a place for me on the train to copenhagen this afternoon peggy said and i wanted to thank you for all your help it was my pleasure believe me jenkins answered did he sound all male and knowing there for a moment or was that only peggy reading between the lines she couldnt very well ask him if you hadnt suggested that i write to the fuhrer with my problem i dont know if it ever would have got fixed peggy said not only was that true but it reminded the lurking listeners hitler was on her side cant hurt she thought nothing else was working i figured you should go straight to the top and try your luck there he said peggy found herself nodding blind obedience to everything in buttons sure as hell jenkins spoke again on a different note this time and i hope everything else is all right oh yes peggy said quickly shed got her periodand what the germans used for pads these days was a shame and a disgrace wouldnt that have been fun she couldnt have brought a visible sign of her shame home to herb but how she could have found a discreet german doctor without opening herself up to gestapo blackmail forever was beyond her one thing she didnt need to worry about anyhow those things made a dismayingly short list these days well thats good jenkins said believe me we like to do everything we can for americans in germany too often its less than wed want i hope everything goes very well for you and i hope to see you again one day after everything settles down if it ever does thanks again peggy said so long she hung up i hope to see you again if that didnt mean i hope to lay you again what did it mean she was damned if shed ever get drunk with a diplomat again she lugged her suitcase down the hall to the elevator at ten after two it was heavy and clumsy why didnt it have wheels and a handle with more reach but that was a side issue she wouldnt be late here not for nothin the elevator operator was a woman a grayhaired man had had the job but somethingwar work conscription trouble with the gestapohad pulled him away from it the war was biting more and more people these days peggy checked out and settled down to wait she watched traffic go by on the street outside there wasnt much to watch buses military vehicles a doctors car a placard taped to the door proclaimed what that one was right at a taxi pulled up in front of the hotel peggy hauled her suitcase out onto the sidewalk let me take that for you the driver said his left hand was artificial but his right arm was plenty strong into the trunk the suitcase went the train station yes yes peggy said he opened the door for her then got in himself he used his right hand to clamp the thumb and fingers of the left onto the wheel that left the good hand free to shift gears and to help the other as needed maybe he saw peggys eye on him for he said its clumsy but it works and ive had plenty of practice since the last war only one accident in all that time and it wasnt my fault the police court said so good for you peggy said she gave him a big tip when they got to the station he took her suitcase out of the trunk as easily as hed put it in but she didnt let him carry it to the ticket counter enough was enough she could manage and she did her ticket was waiting shed had paranoid fantasies that it wouldnt be that the nazis were still playing catandmouse games with her but no here it was in her hands the conductor gravely examined it when she walked up to the train i am required to ask you to show me an exit visa he said here you go peggy was proud to show it off sehr gut danke schon he said touching the brim of his cap all is in order you may board you may board if those werent the three most beautiful words in the german language peggy didnt know what could top them she found her berth it had to be the best one on the train the germans were laying it on thick all right about time too peggy settled in with a sigh of pleasure at not not the train jerked into motion yippee peggy said no one heard her it wouldnt have mattered if someone had you couldnt translate yippee into german but she was on her way home at last hansulrich rudel always wondered what would happen when colonel steinbrenner summoned him to the tent that did duty as squadron hq showing you were worried was only likely to make things worse though reporting as ordered sir he said drawing himself up to stiff attention at ease steinbrenner said youre not in trouble this time oberleutnant rudel oberleutnant hansulrich squeaked in surprised hed just got promoted thank you very much sir youre welcome you earned it steinbrenner opened a box that sat on the card table serving as a desk you earned this too he took out a large iron cross on a redwhiteandblack ribbon a ritterkreuz rudel said all breath and no voicehe was beyond even squeaking now thats right youve got the first knights cross in the squadron not the last i hope but the first congratulations medal in hand colonel steinbrenner stood up he came up and handed it to hansulrich you wear it around your neck yes sir i know hansulrich said dazedly too much was happening too fast he managed to put it on without dropping it if you had to have a shield for your adams apple where could you find a better one ive got the gold pips for your shoulder straps and the new collar patches with two chickens on them too steinbrenner said i figured youd rather put the ritterkreuz on first though uh yes sir rudel managed something besides the medal sat in the box too a piece of paper unfolding it steinbrenner read in recognition of lieutenant rudels cleverness in suggesting the installation of antipanzer cannon on the ju and in recognition of his gallantry in personally testing the new weapons system against the enemy thats not a bad citation no not half bad he stuck out his hand hansulrich shook it i never expected any of this he muttered well youve got it enjoy it steinbrenners eyes twinkled and you get to buy everybody drinks twiceonce for the promotion and once for the knights cross oh joy now hansulrichs voice sounded distinctly hollow that was an honor he could have done without hed be the only sober guy at a partyno two partiesfull of rowdy drunks theyd get rowdy on his reichsmarks too and it wasnt as if he were rolling in them you could even unbend a little yourself the squadron commander said its not as if you havent got a good excuse i dont care to do that sir thank you rudel stayed within military discipline he also stayed stubborn well have it your way youve earned the right this time colonel steinbrenner for once didnt feel like arguing or teasing hansulrich could be stubborn about several things at the same time a renaissance man of sorts you need to give albert something too he said if wed got hit hed be roast meat just like me steinbrenner tapped another box on the table with the nail of his index finger iron cross first class does that suit you your excellency sarcasm went over rudels head as often as not this time his ears burned yes sir he mumbled well good now get out of here so i can pin it on him hes due insteinbrenner glanced at his watchsix minutes thus encouraged hansulrich got sergeant dieselhorst wasnt coming yet which was good if he saw the knights cross hed figure he was in line for a medal too this way it would be a surpriseand the nice kind of surprise at that several groundcrew men walked out of a revetment where theyd been working on a damaged stuka as usual their chatter was two parts technical jargon one part filth one of them waved to hansulrich not much spit and polish on a working air base the wave came to a jerky stop when he saw the new medal at rudels throat heilige scheisse he said thats a ritterkreuz the noncoms in greasy coveralls swarmed over hansulrich pumping his hand and pounding him on the back then before he could do more than squawk they hoisted him onto their shoulder and carried him back to the airstrip look one of them yelled hes flying the others thought that was so funny they almost dropped him pilots came out of their tents to see what the fuss was about they started yelling and beating on hansulrich too youve got balls you little squirt one of them saidhe was twentyfive a whole two years older than rudel now if you only had some brains hey he thought up those antipanzer guns another flyer said maybe hes not as dumb as he looks maybe hes not as homely as he looks either but i wouldnt bet on it the first man said they all laughed like lunatics hansulrich didnt think he was particularly homely but nobody cared what he thought the first flyer went on we ought to find out what the french girls think everybody cheeredeverybody but rudel several of the local girls could be friendly for a price being friendly with them came with a price too several flyers had come down with drippy faucets the medics had some brandnew pills that could actually cure the clap but colonel steinbrenner wasnt amused any which way as for hansulrich he said spare me please the other germans laughed some of them not so goodnaturedly now what kind of pilot was he if he didnt want to drink or to screw it wasnt that he didnt have animal urges of his own either he diddid he ever but he didnt feel like wasting them on french popsies who probably smelled like garlic we werent asking what you thought of the girls rudel the twentyfiveyearold said we want to know what theyll think of you i dont care hansulrich started to kick in earnest and put me down for heavens sake they did none too gently he was just working his way through the luftwaffe pack when sergeant dieselhorst came back from steinbrenners headquarters tent his new decoration prominent on the left breast of his tunic that took some of the heat off hansulrich because people had to congratulateand to thumpdieselhorst too eventually the two men from the stuka crew managed to shake hands with each other well sir heres another fine mess you got me into dieselhorst said sounding like a laurel and hardy film as long as we keep getting out of them rudel answered ill drink to that dieselhorst said and everybody cheerednot least because everybody knew hansulrich wouldnt the sergeant went on the old man told me you got promoted too you can watch us get plowed on your cashtwice that put the focus back on rudel thanks a lot albert he thought the flyers and groundcrew men bayed like wolves anticipating their sprees they teased hansulrich about not joining in if youre wasted too you wont give a rats ass about what it costs someone said half a dozen men roared agreement not then rudel said why worry about afterwards another pilot asked afterwards the enemys liable to smoke us dont you want something fun to remember while youre going down in flames rudel didnt answer and a lot of the good cheer drained out of the gathering some questions cut too close to the bone chapter theo hossbach heinz naumann and adalbert stoss sat at the northeasternmost corner of poland a scrawny chicken roasted above a fire naumann reached out to turn the stick on which the bird was spitted well were here the panzer commander said morosely we did what they brought us to poland to do hot damn he gave the chicken another turn hot damn stoss echoed theo as usual kept his mouth shut it wasnt that he disagreed with his crewmates he just didnt feel like talking with some help from the poles the german panzers had smashed through the red army and cut a hell of a lot of russians in this invaded chunk of poland off from their homeland now german and polish troops were methodically mopping them up that was all very well it would have been better than all very well if only the russians hadnt just poured across the rest of the polish border how hard could the poles fight if the russians cut a couple of railroad lines theo glanced over at their panzer ii an angular shadow in the long slowly deepening northern twilight in spite of the surprising soviet panzers it had come a long way and done a lot of hard fighting without taking much damage in return but it ran on gasoline if the gasoline couldnt get through the machine was nothing but nine tonnes of scrap metal a dead turtle a shell without legs and in that case theo and heinz and adi were nothing but three foot soldiers the only problem with that was they didnt have rifles and they didnt have helmets well if you were going to piss and moan about every little thing so whats going through your thick head now theo naumann asked like ludwig rothe before him he recognized theo wouldnt say much on his own unlike the late ludwig he kept trying to get answers anyway gasoline theo doled out a word now why would you worry about something like that adalbert stoss said its not like we need it or anything heh naumann said sounding as laconic as theo usually did the panzer commander looked around there wasnt much to see nor would there have been on a sunny noon a burntout farmhouse and a barn that was where the chicken must have come from some crops growing out in the fields and a couple of dead russians just starting to bloat and stink a hundred meters or so past the barn heinz shook his head if the world ever needed an enema youd plug it in right here by god somewhere a couple of kilometers away a machine gun opened up all three panzer men leaned toward the noise russian piece stoss said we might have captured it naumann said and so the germans might have you used anything you could get your hands on theo had seen that in france if it could hurt the other guy you grabbed it turned it around and started shooting it at him another machine gun spoke up to answer an unmistakable german mg they might have captured it adi stoss said grinning heinz didnt grin back he made a sour face instead theo didnt like that the rivalry between driver and panzer commander hadnt gone away after adi ducked heinz in that french creek naumann had the rank and maybe the meanness but while he was no weakling he wasnt in stoss league for muscle theo hoped trouble wouldnt come of it he wished he could do something but had no idea what to do working with artillery fuses was nothing next to this well sleep in shifts tonight naumann decreed we all sack out at once were liable to wake up with our throats cut he glared a challenge at adi stoss adi only nodded back what the sergeant said made obvious sense heinz muttered to himself yes he wanted an excuse to come down on the driver if he didnt find one chances were hed go and invent one theo drew the first watch the panzer crew had long since doused the fire blankets would do on a mild summer night and why advertise where you were theo held on to his pistol if some russian sneaked inside of thirty meters before trying to pot him with a mosinnagant he could defend himself with some hope of hitting back otherwise well the weight in his hand was comforting anyhow the moon swelling toward full spilled pale light from low in the south moonshadows stretched long they looked black as the inside of whatever satan used in place of a soul anything could hide in them anything at all not that the russians needed such advantages they could hide in places where most people wouldnt even find places then theyd wait till you went by and shoot you in the back they carried next to no foodonly ammo and grenades and sometimes vodka if they wanted to eat they had to scavenge from the countryside and they did theos stomach growled reminding him of the chunk of chicken in there but the reds were the prize chicken thieves here and there off in the distance rifle shots and occasional bursts of machinegun fire marred the nights stillness the russians were supposed to have been cleared out of this stretch of poland no matter what was going on farther south some of them hadnt got the word though they didnt fight with a great deal of skill but they had no quit in them in due course theo woke adi stoss he jumped back in a hurry because adi came awake with a trench knife in his hand oh its you the driver said then and made the knife disappear me theo agreed adi yawned and sat up anything going on nothing close thats all that matters stoss said ja theo hesitated he thought he had a better chance talking to the driver than to the panzer commander and naumann lay a few meters away snoring like a sawmill you ought to take it easy on heinz he doesnt like it when you give him grief you think i have fun when he rides me stoss returned hes a sergeant theo said as if that explained everything if youd been in the army for even a little while it damn well did i dont care if hes a fucking field marshal adi answered nobodys going to call me a kike so that still rankled did it theo didnt suppose he should have been surprised he didnt mean anything by it he said ha one syllable carried a tonnes weight of disbelief theo gave it up he didnt know what else he could do just be careful he said ja mutti adi answered indulgently yes mommy chased theo under his blanket as stoss had no doubt intended it to do dawn came early black bread spread with butter from a tinfoil tube and ersatz coffee made a breakfast of sorts heinz naumann whod had the last watch turned to theo and said see if weve got any new orders or are they just going to have us sit here with our thumbs up our asses ill find out theo said climbing back into the panzer felt good so did putting on the earphones and hooking into the radio net like anyone else theo enjoyed doing things he was good at and wehrmacht training made damn sure he was damn good at using the panzers radio set when he stuck his head out of the hatch in front of the engine compartment heinz barked well were ordered to motor back to the railhead at molodetschna theo reported further orders when we get there himmeldonnerwetter naumann burst out whyd we come all the way up here then a round trip to fucking nowhere with the chance of getting shot or blown up thrown in for a bonus gasoline at the railhead stoss put in weve got enough to get therei think so anyhowbut not much more than that wunderbar heinz said sourly what do we do if we run dry hoof it see if we can get a tow if were close adi answered if we cant well dyou want to stick around here christ no heinz said theo felt the same way there were stories about what the reds did to germans they caught theo didnt know if those stories were true and he didnt want to find out either he slid back into the panzer ii the other crewmen also came aboard the reliable little maybach engine fired up right away off they went back in the direction theyd come from the french lieutenant eyed vaclav jezek with what might have been sympathy he gargled something in his own language vaclav looked back blankly he didnt understand a word even if he had he wouldnt have let on benjamin halevy turned french into czech he wants your antitank rifle theyre obsolete he says they dont penetrate the armor of the latest german tanks tell him no vaclav said at once the heavy weight on his right shoulder the recoil bruises that never got a chance to heal up had become a part of him more french from the lieutenant he couldnt just demand vaclav was a foreign ally not somebody under his direct command he wants to know why youre so enamored of an outmoded weapon why im so what vaclav scratched his head why you like it so much why didnt you say so in the first place tell him the germans still have plenty of old tanks and armored cars and my beastll do for them tell him ive got a decent chance of killing a man from a kilometer and a half away with this baby too sergeant halevy spoke in french so did the french officer halevy translated he says it wasnt intended as a snipers rifle i dont give a fuck what it was intended for it works vaclav declared he and the lieutenant stared at each other in perfect mutual incomprehension to the logical frenchman that antitank rifle was made to destroy tanks if it couldnt do the job for which it was made it was useless vaclav had found it could do other things better than the ordinary rifle hed carried till he took the big piece from a casualty it will be your responsibility the lieutenant sounded grave even when vaclav couldnt understand him after halevy translated the french officer seemed more like pilate washing his hands thats fine vaclav said at once what was wrong with these people he had less trouble understanding germans he hated their guts but at least he could see what made them tick something else occurred to him he rudely pointed at the young lieutenant youre discontinuing these rifles right oui the frenchman couldnt have been haughtier that is what i am trying to explain to you yeah yeah that means youre going to shitcan all the rounds that go with it too arent you sergeant halevy raised a gingery eyebrow hey boy i see where youre going he translated for the lieutenant yet again mais certainement the french officer replied again to him if the rounds couldnt kill tanks they couldnt do anything vaclav had a different idea dont throw em out give em to me ill be thewaddayacallitthe official obsolete rifletoter and ill get the guys in my squad to lug what i cant they know what this baby can do even if you dont asshole he affectionately patted the antitank rifles padded stock with a bit of luck he wouldnt have to quarrel with stuckup french quartermaster sergeants any more with a bit of luck how much would the nasty little gods in charge of war dole out have to wait and see this is most irregular the french officer said after the jew translated one more time fine its irregular vaclav said but if its officially irregular maybe that would get through to the lieutenant the fellow eyed him you go out of your way to be difficult nestce pas to the nazis sure not to anybody else vaclav lied without hesitation he was difficult with anybody who got in his way the jerks on your own side would screw you over worse than the enemy if you gave em half a chance after more backandforth between halevy and the frenchman the lieutenant threw his hands in the air and strode off he says have it your own way halevy reported hell see that you get the ammo hell probably see that you end up assdeep in ithes not real happy with you id rather have too much than not enough jezek said he wondered if he meant that when he got two truckloads of wooden crates full of the thumbsized cartridges the antitank rifle fire no he couldnt very well burden the czechs in his squad with that load each mans share would have squashed him flat that meant dealing with a quartermaster sergeant after all fortunately this wasnt the guy hed almost murdered a few months earlier benjamin halevy sweetened up the french noncom and the fellow seemed amazingly willing to hang on to most of the ammo and issue it as needed what did you say to him vaclav asked i asked him how hed like to be the officialhalevy bore down on the wordkeeper of whats left of the antitankrifle ammunition he jumped at the chance vaclav laughed swell you know more about dealing with these people than i do thats for sure he sent the quartermaster sergeant a suspicious stare now will he turn loose of the stuff when i need it or will he decide he has to keep it because its too important to fire off halevy spoke more french the supply sergeant raised his right hand as if taking an oath he says hell be good the jew reported vaclav decided hed have to take thatit was as good as hed get and if the frenchman turned out to be lying threatening to blow a hole in him with the antitank rifle ought to get his attention now that vaclav had enough ammunition for months if not years he found that he had little to do with it the germans had pulled most of their armor out of this sector they were digging in for all they were worth it might have been over again the french kept promising offensives then stopping in their tracks whenever the boys in fieldgray shot back at them without tanks and armored cars to shoot at he started doing just what hed told the snooty young french lieutenant hed do he sniped at the germans from long range behind their lines the wehrmacht men moved around pretty freely they didnt think anyone could hit them from the allies positions one careful round at a time vaclav taught them they were wrong congratulations benjamin halevy told him one day how come jezek asked prisoners say the nazis really want the son of a bitch with the elephant gun dead halevy answered it was a compliment of sorts but it was one vaclav could have lived without he hoped he could go on living with it he was a careful sniper he never fired from the same place twice in a row he didnt move from one favorite spot to another as often as not he didnt know whether hed shift to the left or right till he tossed a coin to tell him if he couldnt guess the germans wouldnt be able to either he made sure nothing on his ratty uniform shone or sparkled that was easy enough he fastened leafy branches to his helmet with a strip of rubber cut from an inner tube to break up its outline german bullets started cracking past him more often than they should have even so regretfully he decided the prisoners had known what they were talking about when one of those bullets knocked a sprig off his helmet camouflage he realized the germans had to have a sniper of their own hunting him that made for a new kind of game one he wasnt even slightly sure he liked it wasnt army against army any more the germans didnt think of him as one more interchangeable part in an enormous military machine they wanted him dead him in particular this was personal he could have done without the honor when he complained sergeant halevy said all you have to do is put down the antitank rifle and go back to being an ordinary soldier im killing a lot more germans than the ordinary soldiers are vaclav said then youd better figure theyll do their goddamnedest to kill you halevy replied vaclav started hunting the german sniper he found a brass telescope in an abandoned farmhouse it wasnt as if the officers on his side would give him field glassesperish the thought and painted it a muddy brown so it wouldnt betray him he also had to be careful not to let the sun flash off the objective lens and give him away the german was good jezek might have known he would be well he wasnt so bad himself that he still prowled and hunted proved it he took shots at other nazis as he got the chance somewhere over there a german with some kind of fancy rifle of his own was waiting for a mistake if vaclav made one he wouldnt have to worry about making twoor about anything else ever again julius lemp studied his orders he turned to his executive officer well klaus what do you think of these klaus hammerstein blinked hed served on the u with lemp since before the war started but as a lowly leutnant zur see till the previous exec got tapped for a command of his own now newly promoted to oberleutnant zur see and to second in the chain of command hammerstein had to deal with his skipper in a whole new way theyre interesting thats for sure he ventured interesting ja there was barely room for two people in lemps curtainedoff little excuse for a cabin you worked with what you had on the boat and with the crew what do these orders make you wonder lemp pressed if klaus didnt have what it took to swing it as the executive officer they both needed to find out right away the kid studied them again how many other boats are getting orders just like these right now he said after a pause only a little longer than it should have been and lemp nodded pleased there you go thats exactly what id like to find out naval high command wouldnt tell him of course anything he didnt urgently need to know was something he shouldnt know what he didnt know he couldnt spill if things went wrong and he got captured i could ask around klaus said dont lemp told him not without regret anybody who told you would be breaking security better not to tempt somebodyand better not to give the gestapo an excuse to come down on us oh hammerstein said and then right lemps head went up and down once more crisply this time things went better when you didnt need to worry about looking over your own shoulder quite so much anyhow two days later the u chugged out into the north sea the men ate like pigs you had to get rid of the fresh food first because it wouldnt keep theyd go back to sausage and tinned sauerkraut and hardbaked bread soon enoughtoo soon really boiled beef stewed chicken fresh cabbage even some peaches lemp gobbled down his share he might have eaten a little more than his share he was the skipper after all but his pants still fit all right so he couldnt have been too much of a greedyguts gerhart beilharz put the schnorkel through its paces lemp was less nervous about the gadget than he had been when it first got installed it hadnt misbehaved too badly and it did come in handy every now and then lemp still would have liked it better if the brass had given it to him as a reward rather than a punishment the tall engineer said its working the way its supposed to skipper all right lemp hoped it was he was also more willing to believe beilharz than he had been when the beanpole came aboard with the schnorkel beilharz had to be two meters if he was a centimeter he needed his stahlhelm all right uboats werent built with people his size in mind this was a different kind of patrol instead of telling him to go out into the atlantic to torpedo freighters traveling between the americas and england the orders over which he and klaus had puzzled instructed him to stay in the north sea and patrol north and south between two fixed parallels of latitude he was to sink anything he saw and to be especially alert for royal navy warships that codicil kept him scratching his chin the royal navy wasnt in the habit of pushing into the north sea as long as it could keep german surface vessels bottled upwhich it hadnt managed with the admiral scheerit kept its distance leery not only of uboats but also of landbased airplanes so why did his orders talk about enemy warships as if expecting them to rush into the path of his patrol it made for a nice strategic question one that gave both officers and ratings something to chew on lemp had his own opinionor rather his own suspicion he didnt voice it even on a uboat people were often reluctant to contradict the skipper he was amused to discover he wasnt the only one to arrive at that suspicion amused yes but not surprised if you could read a map and thought a little about how and where the war was going it was one of the things that seemed likely likely of course didnt have to mean true it might prove nothing but so much moonshine lemp knew how much he didnt know the ratings sounded much more confident than he did they didnt worry about what they didnt know from his days in school lemp remembered socrates going on about such things socrates had got sunk for his trouble lemp intended to be on the other end of the bargain at the moment though it looked like no bargain at all no royal navy battleships or carriers destroyers or corvetteshell no royal navy tugs or garbage scowsshowed themselves in his patrol zone from what the radio operator could pick up things were also quiet elsewhere no freighters bound from norway to england or the other way lumbered past either petrels skimmed by the u one landed on the radio aerial atop the conning tower it seemed surprised to find an island in the middle of the sea after a minute or two it flew off one of the ratings on watch up there let his binoculars down onto his chest and grinned at lemp do we sink the sea birds skipper he asked theyre the only things in the neighborhood bad luck another sailor said and everybody else nodded you didnt hurt petrels not for anything i was only kidding the first man protested dont worry about it erich lemp said we know you didnt mean anything by it by their expressions not all the ratings agreed but they let it liefor now lemp wondered if erich would get himself a set of lumps after he went below he hoped the others wouldnt rack the sailor up to the point where he couldnt carry out his duties a uboat needed every man it carried he was also willing to bet that as long as erich was still able to walk he wouldnt let out a peep about what had happened to him officers didnt need to knowand certainly didnt need to noticeeverything that went on aboard a warship or maybe the rating escaped his expected fate because the very next day a sailor fishing from the conning tower caught an enormous cod if that wasnt good luck lemp didnt know what would be the sailors gutted the big fish and threw the offal overboard now what do we do with it somebody wondered i know how to make codfish balls another sailor said a wit piped up what do we do with the rest funny michael lemp said amidst groans you should take it on the stageor anywhere else a long way from here but for lack of other suggestions they let the volunteer have his way and the codfish balls eked out with flour proved surprisingly good lemp put a commendation in the log it might earn the amateur cook a promotion when the u came home in the meantime they patrolled they saw ocean and more ocean and more ocean still they saw petrels some were gray some were black some were gray and black a birdwatcher probably would have gone into ecstasies about them lemp took them for granted as long as no one talked about doing them in still no freighters no royal navy ships either only long days and short light nights twilight never quite left the northern sky and the dimmer stars remained unseen the weather was goodas good as it ever got in the north sea anyhow it might almost have been a pleasure jaunt if only the accommodations were fancier lemp thought the strength through joy cruises do a better job it didnt take long for the patrolling to get to be first routine then dull routine lemp fought that as best he could taking things for granted was one of the easiest ways to get yourself killed no ships no planes no suspicious smoke smudges on the horizon no stalking a quarry no crash dives when someone came stalking you either back and forth back and forth again nothing lots of nothing lemp got bored too he worked all the harder on account of it he made sure the crew did too the u didnt travel very far it could stay at sea as long as it had fuel and food no orders to do anything else came over the radio back and forth one more time and then one more time after that arno baatz glowered at willi dernen ive got my eye on you the corporal warned you may have fooled that ss fellow but i know damn well you had something to do with storch lighting out for the tall timber awful arno was right so was a stopped clock twice a day most days that put it two up on baatz i dont know what happened to wolfgang willi said for what had to be the hundredth time maybe he did light out but he was always a good soldier till people started giving him grief or maybe a shell came down right on top of him we were catching hell from the frenchies that day remember sometimes theres nothing left to bury you know he eyed his squad leader it could have happened to you and you would have been happy if it did you said that i didnt i dont mean it either willi didnt aim to let awful arno pin an insubordination rap on him he also didnt particularly hope baatz would get blown to nothingness on the instant that would be too quick too easy if the sniper with the monster rifle nailed awful arno right in the knee though a german sniper prowled the lines these days too hunting the frenchman or czech or whatever he was a rifle made for knocking out panzers did horrid things to flesh and bone sometimes a hit on the arm or leg would kill just from the shock of the impact the sooner the expert with the scopesighted riflehe was an oberfeldwebel named helmut fegelein a grizzled veteran of the last wardisposed of the bastard with the big rifle the happier everybody would be everybody except the enemy sniper of course but willi wasted no sympathy on him every so often that big distinctive boom would echo from the trenches off in the distance and then as often as not some german whod been careless or naive would fall over screamingor sometimes just twitching fuckers good fegelein allowed spooning up a stew of cabbage and sausage and potatoes from his mess tin ive got a couple of shots at him but hes still in business how come you missed awful arno asked fegelein looked through him the senior noncom didnt have to put up with baatzs bullshit the way willi did you try it sonny boy he said you got a split second at extreme long range and maybe you hit and maybe you dont he stays well back toothat antipanzer rifles got more reach reach than a mauser willi smiled at his corporal sonny boy was it he liked that and liked it all the better because awful arno obviously didnt you ought to get closer thenthats all ive got to say baatz remarked if thats all youve got to say keep your big fat dumb mouth shut fegelein answered i didnt come here to get my head blown off either this guy hasnt been doing it for long or i never would have got a shot at him at all but hes sharp he keeps learning i havent got a glimpse of him for a day and a half if i were talking to most people id tell em to keep their heads down till i nail him but not me baatz reddened with anger why not because you dont have enough brains in there to worry about getting em blown out the sniper answered if he shoots you in the ass though youre liable to end up with a concussion somebody behind awful arno guffawed willi would have if he were sitting where baatz couldnt see him doing it and baatz couldnt even round on the miscreant not with fegeleins cold gray gaze pinning him down people talked about snipers eyes willi hadnt seen any examples of that unfailing scary watchfulness before but the oberfeldwebel had it in spades were you a sniper in too willi asked him as they washed out their tins side by side nein fegelein shook his head and lit a small stinky cigar i was an assault trooper i carried a machine pistol and a big sack of grenades i started this business in one of the freikorps after the war id had it up to here with fighting the other guys at twenty meters they dont have to be good to kill you at that rangejust lucky i figured id give myself better odds i got into the reichswehr in was it or anyway ive been doing this ever since makes sense to me willi said the farther away the enemy stays the better i like it that chilly stare appraised him for a moment sure as hell willi felt as if he were in the crosshairs then fegelein gave him a smilea thin smile but a smile yeah ive heard a lot of guys go on like that the sniper said half the time its right before they do something that gets em a ritterkreuz i dont want one willi said with great sincerity helmut fegelein only shrugged sometimes you want the medal sometimes the medal wants you when the time comes youll know what needs doing that piece of crap youve got for a corporal now willi laughed out loud you mean awful arno sure as hell fegelein was a keen judge of character the veteran chuckled is that what you call him belatedly willi realized he might have stuck his foot in it an oberfeldwebel could land a gefreiter in all kinds of trouble for badmouthing another noncom senior to him well willi said reluctantly thats what you call him when you dont think anybodyll gig you for it fegelein said which was perfectly true the sniper reached into his pocket and pulled out the stogies again he offered willi one here you go i dont blab i remember what i called the jerks who ordered me around next morning the son of a bitch with the antipanzer rifle potted a captainknocked him off a motorcycle in fact and that evening as darkness descended fegelein did go out into the nomansland between the lines about time arno baatz saidbut not where the oberfeldwebel could hear him willi didnt see awful arno volunteering to go out there he couldnt say that but thought it very loudly baatz strutted off to do some of the important things corporals did one of those things was to make sure willi stood sentry in the middle of the night and broke up his sleep as always willi appreciated it come morning he saw no sign of helmut fegelein the sniper was out there somewhere sprawled in a shell hole or under one piece of wreckage or another he had his rifle and he had a hunters patience somewhere farther off the enemy sniper had the same patience and an even nastier weapon the antipanzer rifle thundered its report distinctive even though it came from a long way northwest of the trench in which willi waited fegeleins piece stayed silent either he didnt spot the enemy or he had no chance to hit him from wherever he hid fegelein came in after dark he slipped past the german pickets which was bound to raise officers blood pressure if all the frenchmen out there were as good as he was they could do it too and if cows pissed gasoline the reich wouldnt have to worry about running low on fuel some time in the middle of the night the sniper vanished again maybe he was going back to the same hideyhole or maybe he changed his lair daily like a hunted wolf willi thought he would have if he were doing that job he thanked heaven he wasnt no sign of the oberfeldwebel when the sun came up hed be waitingor for all willi knew hed be sound asleep right now who was going to tell him he couldnt do that if he felt like it sweat ran down willis face summer was coming in all right when he pushed his way through the ardennes in the middle of winter hed thought the war would be over by now shows what i knew he muttered then the antipanzer rifle spoke again seemingly right in front of him a split second later a mauser in nomansland answered willis ears told him about where the shot came from but he still couldnt spot fegelein he couldnt but the enemy sniper could that goddamn elephant gun fired once more as soon as it could have after the man using it worked the bolt silence returned punctuated only by the skrawks of frightened crows helmut fegelein didnt come back for supper after sundown willi guessed he wasnt hungry any more and never would be again chapter pussy didnt like tanks not even a little bit alistair walsh wasnt surprised the cat had come to take gunfire for granted animals sometimes got used to things more easily than people did pussy couldnt know what bullets and shell fragments did to soft vulnerable flesh she didnt know how lucky she was to be ignorant either tanks were a whole different business though she didnt just hear them rattle and clank she could see them move here was something bigger than an elephant that couldand might want tosquash her flat tanks smelled funny too no wonder the cat disappeared into the smallest hole she could find regardless of pussys opinion walsh liked tanks in the neighborhood fine these mark i cruisers seemed a vast improvement over the poor matildas that had tried to hold off german panzers the winter before the matildas mounted nothing more than a machine gun and a running man could easily keep up with them they did have thick armor and they needed it these cruisers were a different business their turrets packed a twopounder cannon and a machine gun while they mounted two more mgs in the front of the hull one on each side of the drivers position it was probably crowded as all getout up there but enemy infantry in front of them would be very unhappy and they could move they were as fast as anything the germans had more than once during the retreat from the low countries english tankers had had to bail out of matildas set them on fire and go back on foot or in a lorry when enemy thrusts outflanked and overran them if they hadnt they would have been cut off and killed or captured in fact walsh had seen a matilda or two in german service with a prominent cross painted on either side he suspected he would have seen more if the nazis liked the clunky little machines better jocks reaction to the mark i cruisers was more like pussys ah wish the bloody thingsd go somewhere else the yorkshireman grumbled whys that walsh asked now that theyre here we can give the fritzes one right in the slats thats why jock said morosely long as we sit tight here were safe enough oh not safe christ knows but safe enough with them buggers around though theyll tell us to go forward again damn their black hearts bad things happen when you go forward by god half a lifetime ago walsh had been eager to go over the toponce living through that first assault cured him of eagerness forevermore he was much happier staying in the trenches and letting the germans come to him after that bad things did happen when you went forward there you were out in the open with nothing to protect you but a lousy tin hat that wouldnt keep bullets out anyhow all these years later his leg wound still bothered him which meant nothing when the brass hats told you to advance the fritzes might rack you up you own side assuredly would if you didnt follow orders he was part of that machinery himself if you didnt go forward because you were battlewild youd damn well go forward because bad things would happen to you if you stayed behind no help for it jock he said not without sympathy no he wasnt eager either jock nodded oh ah know whatll we do about pussy though cant take her alongshe wouldnt fancy riding in your pack or on your shoulder like a bloody pirates parrot walsh chuckled chances are she wouldnt he agreed somebody else will take care of her once we push on though or shell shift for herself cats are good at that you know plenty of birds plenty of bugs plenty of mice too with no one setting out traps to keep them down maybe jock still looked gloomyhe often did she was mighty peaked when we first started feeding her though mighty peaked we cant bring her along you said so yourself walsh pointed out ah knows sergeant dont mean ah like it jock said more and more mark is came in had walsh been running the show he would have kept them hidden till the attack went in surprise counted the high foreheads actually in charge of things sent a few of the cruisers forward to see how they did against the german positions most of a mile away and the high foreheads learned some things they hadnt known before matildas couldnt get out of their own way and sadly lacked firepower but they laughed at antitank rifles the mark is werent laughing those big bullets pierced their armor with the greatest of ease not only in the hull sides but even in the turret which was supposed to have more metal than any other part of the tank the fritzes had some mm antitank guns in their defensive positions too a matilda might even live through a hit from one of those the cruisers looked far more modern they had better engines and more firepower but they burned so easily the english soldiers started calling them ronsons one shot and they lit what bloody fool designed em jock demanded watching two of the hopeful machines send up black columns of smoke from the fields ahead the way he said bloody it had the same long oo as fool it sounded even more accusing that way they wont hold out anything tougher than a rifle round doesnt look that way does it walsh said glumly were supposed to go forward with tanks eh jock said how do we do that if all the tanks blow up afore they get to the fritzes trenches good question the sergeant answered in the last war the order to advance would have gone out anyway tanks not up to snuff too bad the infantry would handle things that was what it was there for wasnt it things were supposed to be different this time around no one wanted another catastrophe like the somme with brilliant plans like that no wonder people started calling generals the donkeys but just because things were supposed to be different that didnt mean they would be driving the germans farther away from paris was high on everybodys list the french had had an even closer call this time than in the more frantic they got about dealing with that the more frantic they made their allies across the channel walsh did wonder how enthusiastic neville chamberlain was about the war hed done everything he could to hold it off even flying to germany to try to talk hitler out of jumping all over czechoslovakia he might have pulled it off too if that czech maniac hadnt gunned down konrad henlein the sudeten germans vestpocket fuhrer then again it was hard to tell how enthusiastic chamberlain was about anything he looked like a constipated stork and he didnt sound much different winston churchill might be a voice crying in the wilderness of party disfavor but he was a voice crying in impassioned exciting sentences walsh thought that kind of thing went a long way in wartime as if anyone gave a damn what a staff sergeant thought the order to storm forward got pushed back fortyeight hours to celebrate jock fed pussy a whole tin of steakandkidney pie the best ration england issued in alistair walshs biased opinion it was better than anything the froggies or the fritzes made too pussy daintily fed then washed up the sides of her face with a welllicked paw she even goes behind her ears jock said when was the last time you did walsh asked beats me the soldier said walsh couldnt remember the last time hed washed behind the ears either out in the field you stopped worrying about dirt what difference did it make he patted the cat she rewarded him with a purr when he stopped she twisted her head and started licking the manscent off her fur how can i catch mice she seemed to say if i smell like a gamy old sergeant before the two days were up the order to advance got postponed indefinitely no one said it had anything to do with the mark i cruisers deficiencies but no one had trouble reading between the lines jock shared some milksmooth cognac with walsh to celebrate heres to stayin put the yorkshireman said heres to walsh agreed he wasnt sorry not to leave this ruined village it wasnt home but it also wasnt badno not half pussy ambled up willing to be stroked and begging for a treat his hand caressed the cats warm soft fur pussy purred little by little sarah goldman got used to wearing the yellow star whenever she went outside she hardly noticed hardly anyone else in munster seemed to notice either the nazis might have wanted to turn jews into a spectacle but they hadnt done it aryans were entitled to cut in front of jews in a queue at any shop shopkeepers were supposed to serve aryans ahead of jews which was doubly unfair because jews had limited hours in which they could go out the yellow star was designed among other things to make that easier it didnt happen not right away german women took their places behind sarah when they got into line after she did no shopkeeper followed the rules to the letter that surprised her she knew how orderly the folk of whom shed once thought herself a part were it must have surprised the nazis too a flood of new edicts came from berlin no one was to extend jews any courtesies no matter what these people are the enemies of the reich and must not be treated softly newspapers thundered always rememberthe jews are our misfortune what did we ever do to them sarah complained over a miserable supper that night what theyve done to us but what did we do to them nothing her mother said we dont do anything to anybody all we try to do is stay alive they dont even like that and a choleriyeh on them you havent done anything to them father said he was weary but contrived to look amused even so i havent done enoughnowhere near so much as i wish i had but einstein and freud and schoenberg theyve done plenty theyve tried to drag germany kicking and screaming into the twentieth century jewish physics jewish psychology jewish music he did his best to sound like a nazi plugugly bellowing on the radio his best was alarmingly good he didnt have a red face and a roll of fat at the back of his neck but you would never have guessed as much from his voice but what if einsteins right even though hes jewish sarah said then germany will miss out on on whatever he was talking about she knew more about the theory of relativity than she did about zulu but not much more thats the chance they take samuel goldman said not without relish i dont pretend to understand einstein but id think twice before i bet against him sarah always thought of her father as knowing everything so hearing him admit ignorance always came as a surprise of course socrates hadnt just admitted ignorancehed professed it being a scholar of ancient historys daughter she knew such things herself but that was different socrates had beenwhat did the cardplayers call it hed been sandbagging that was the word when father said he didnt understand einstein sarah thought he meant it jewish physics what can jewish physics do that german physics cant sarah picked the wildest thing she could think of blow up the world that would serve the nazis right wouldnt it it would father sighed i dont think things are quite so simple though it would be nice if they were but he spread his hands his palms werent blistered the way they had been when he first joined the labor gang now ridges of hard yellow callus crossed them he was in better physical shape than sarah remembered his beingbut he slept whenever he wasnt working or eating how long before he started to break down and what would happen then she didnt want to think about that father anchored the world without him everything would be adrift topsyturvy which she had to admit didnt mean such a thing couldnt happen in the third reich anything could happen to jews anything at all if you didnt understand that you didnt understand anything one of the things that could happen to jews could also happen to aryans a little past midnight airraid sirens began to wail berlin and other places in the east were safe from bombs during short summer nights the bombers that had to deliver them would still be flying and vulnerable when light came back to the sky not munster it lay too close to the french border to enjoy such protection not fair sarah groaned as she hurried downstairs to huddle under the heavy diningroom table she wasnt thinking only of geography father would have to go out to the labor gang tomorrow morning even if hed had his sleep shattered well plenty of others would be in the same boat that a bomb might land on top of the house never crossed her mind shed been in plenty of raids before and no bombs had hit here yet that had to mean none could the logic was perfect at least till she met a counterexample her parents joined her under there a moment later her mother was grumbling because shed stubbed a toe on the stairs miserable air pirates father said hed lifted the phrase straight from the nazi papers sarah wondered if he realized what had just come out of his mouth before she could ask him bombs began whistling down even when you knewor thought you knewone wouldnt hit here the sound was scary then the bombs started going off the noise was horrendous feeling the ground shake under you was worse sarah had never been in an earthquake but now she had a notion of what they were like antiaircraft guns added their own crashes to the racket through it all father said i think those must be french planes the engines sound different from the ones the raf uses sarah hadnt noticed even when it was pointed out to her she couldnt hear any difference she wouldnt have cared if she could she just wanted this to be over then several bombs burst much closer than any had before she screamed she couldnt help herself the house shook like a rat in a terriers jaws for a second she thought everything would come down on top of the table windows blew in with a tinkle of glass all of a sudden she could smell cool moist outside airand the smoke it carried the raid seemed to last forever they often felt that way while they were going on at last the enemy planes flew off to england or france or wherever theyd come from not long afterwards the allclear sounded father said id better see if the neighbors are all right would they do the same for us sarah asked sourly some of them would he answered and she supposed that was so he went on even my bathrobe has a yellow star so i wont get into trouble on account of that oh joy sarah and her mother said at the same time they both started to laugh why not what other choice did you have but pounding your head against a table leg fathers voice joined the shouting outside sarah didnt hear anyone screaming that had to be good the nazi government was tormenting jews she should have hoped the raf or the french would knock it flat but bombs didnt fall on a government bombs fell on people and even though a lot of those people must have voted for the nazis back before elections turned into farces most of them were just people they werent so bad after a while father came back in his slippers scraped on broken glass what would they do about that worry about it after dawn that was what all right here he reported those big ones came down a couple of blocks away thank god bells and sirens told of fire engines and ambulances rushing where they were needed most you may as well go back to bed mother said nothing else to do now after the first couple of air strikes against munster sarah would have laughed at that now she nodded as life since the nazis took over showed you could get used to anything if you were still tired after the bombs stopped falling you grabbed some more sleep she heard father yawn hed need every minute he could get come morning hed be even more overworked than usual hed just trudged out the door when someone started pounding on it sarah and her mother exchanged looks of alarm that sounded like the ss what could the blackshirts want so early all sorts of evil possibilities crossed her mind would they claim the goldmans were showing lights to guide the enemy bombers that was ridiculousor would be if the ss werent saying it feet dragging sarah went to the door and reluctantly opened it her jaw dropped isidor she blurted what are you doing here i rode over to make sure you folks were safe isidor bruck answered sure enough a beatup bicycle stood behind the bakers son he managed a shy smile im glad you are yes were fine sarah managed she didnt know what else to say obviously isidor hadnt ridden across town to check on her mother and father what were they to him but customers shed thought she was something more till this moment she hadnt realized she might be a lot more she took a deep breath and without thinking about it ran a hand through her hair are your kin all right he nodded nothing came down real close to us but i heard this part of town got hit hard so i thought id better check thanks thanks very much that was sweet of you sarah said which made isidor turn red she added its nice to know somebodyanybodycares isidor nodded again i know what you mean he said we have to take care of ourselves these days nobody else will do it for usthats for sure to us maybe but not for us as his mouth tightened he suddenly looked fifteen years older he touched the brim of his cloth cap well id better get back the work doesnt go away im sure sarah said come again though he bobbed his head and rode away surely it was only her imagination that the bicycle tires floated several centimeters above the sidewalk chaim weinberg looked around the battered streets of madrid you know whats missing here he asked mike carroll also considered the vista damn near everything he answered after due contemplation what have you got in mind they were both speaking english madrilenos walking by grinned at them even more than their ragged uniforms the foreign language showed they were internationals internationals were still heroes in madridat least to the majority that didnt secretly favor the fascists and most of the locals didnt speak english which gave at least the hope of privacy ill tell you whats missing here chaim said a shuls missing thats what in case you didnt notice its a catholic country mike said as if to an idiot child and in case you hadnt noticed the republic isnt proreligion its not supposed to be either by that he meant the republic does things the same way as the soviet union and so it did both had broken the priesthoods longentrenched power in their respective countries even so chaim said theres a difference between spain and russia oh yeah like what carroll didnt quite say tell me another one but he might as well have even so chaim had an answer for him two answers in fact for one thing the opposition in russians been broken you cant very well say that here his wave swept over the ruins all created by the eversocatholic nationalists and for another spain discriminates against jews you cant say the soviet union does not when so many of the old bolsheviks are yehudim yeah well this time mike paused in faint embarrassment and after a couple of seconds chaim understood why a whole great swarm of the old bolsheviks convicted in moscows show trials were jews too its still discrimination discriminations still wrong chaim said stubbornly before the republic it was fucking illegal to be a jew in spain it still is in nationalist country if thats not why were fighting what are we doing here stopping hitler and mussolini and sanjurjo mike suggested stopping them from doing what screwing over people they dont happen to like thats what weinberg answered his own question mike carroll looked at him when was the last time you were in awhat did you call ita shul its been a while chaim admitted his folks had made him get barmitzvahed hed quit going right after that as far as he was concerned action counted for more than prayer but the right to prayer was a different story he stuck out his chin as far as it would go which wasnt as far as he would have wished all the more reason to have one now how do you figure that because its been a hell of a lot longer since any of the spaniards have been because the ones whore still jews have to pretend theyre catholics when anybodys looking because thats wrong dammit chaim said let me buy you a drink or two okay mike said you need something to wind you downthats for goddamn sure chaim looked around he blinked in surprise trust you to go on about buying drinks when theres not a cantina in sight for miles well find one come on carroll turned to a madrileno donde esta una cantina he got elaborate voluble directions complete with gestures the spanish was much too fast to follow though the local soon saw as much he grabbed mike with one hand and chaim with the other and took them where they needed to go yes spaniards would give you the shirt off their back the problem was not enough of them had shirts to give and were they proud mike tried to buy this fellow a drink but the local wouldnt let him he hadnt brought them here for a reward but because he was grateful to the international brigades that was what chaim thought he was saying anyhow the madrileno saluted and bowed and left mike did buy chaim a drink and then another one chaim bought a couple of rounds too jews had their own kind of pride after four shots of rotgut chaim wobbled when he walked he was no less determined than he had been sober though if anything he was more so youll get in trouble matt said blearily chaims laugh was raucous enough to make heads swing his way yeah whatll they do to me send me back to the front theyll throw you in a spanish jail thats what theyll do carroll answered those joints are worse than the front you ask me he had a point chaim was too stubborn and too plastered to acknowledge it im going to talk to brigadier kossuth he declared on your head be it mike said and it will be kossuth wasnt the brigadiers real name chaim had heard that once but couldnt come within miles of pronouncing it it sounded like a horse sneezing but the real kossuth had also been a hungarian rebel against the status quo the modern one had glassy black eyes and a tongue he flicked in and out like a lizard he spoke several languages and sounded like bela lugosi doing dracula in every damn one of them english though wasnt one of those several he understood chaims yiddish and chaim could mostly follow his throaty german a shul kossuth said one of his elegantly combed eyebrows climbed well theres something out of the ordinary anyhow plainly he didnt mean that as a compliment why not chaim said its part of the freedom were fighting for right flick flick chaim wondered whether kossuth caught flies with that tongue more likely comrade its part of the trouble you enjoy causing me if weinberg were as innocent as he sounded he never would have heard of the facts of life let alone practiced them as assiduously as he could brigadier kossuth ignored the melodramatics you his voice was hard and flat americans are an undisciplined lotand you weinberg are undisciplined for an american your reputation precedes you so im not a prussian so sue me chaim said that made kossuth show his yellow teeth prussian discipline was anathema in the international brigades they had their own kind which was at least as harsh but which theymostlyaccepted of their own free will i am a jew cant i act like one once in a while you want to offend the spaniards kossuth probably didnt catch flies with his tonguethere sure werent any on him but chaim had an answer for him and when did chaim not have an answer the ones who favor the republics ideals wont be offended oh of course they will they dont like jews any better than anyone else here does do you know what a narigon is kossuth said literally the spanish word meant somebody with a big nose but that wasnt what kossuth had in mind a kike chaim said he wasnt surprised when the magyar did know that bit of english kossuth nodded just so the brigadier said and you want to draw extra attention to yourself here its not about extra attention chaim said which held some truth its about rights and freedoms why am i in spain if not for those i dont know why are you in spain because you can raise more hell here than back home i suspect kossuth drummed his fingers on the tabletop in front of him his nails chaim noticed were elegantly manicured even if you do found this shul how much would you care to wager that you will not attend services for longer than a monthsix weeks at the outside that might well have held more than some truth all the same chaim said to his surprise brigadier kossuths chuckle didnt emit puffs of dust well go on then kossuth said i doubt you can lose our struggle against the forces of reaction all by yourselfthough not i am sure for lack of effort now get out thus encouraged if that was the word chaim got luc harcourt eyed the three replacements whod just joined his squad with a distinctly jaundiced eye look boys try to keep your heads down till you start figuring things out eh he said you dont keep them down the bochesll blow em offand you wont learn much after that by god right right corporal they chorused one was louis one was marc and the other poor devil was napoleon at least he didnt stick his hand between two of the buttons on his tunic he wasnt especially short either or especially brighthe said but we want to kill germans corporal youll get your chance luc promised dont forget thoughthey have a chance at you too thats not so much fun bet your ass its not he stood back from himself as it were listening to what came out of his mouth damned if he didnt sound like a slightly smoother copy of sergeant demange he hadnt been sanding his throat with gitanes as long or as enthusiastically as demange had but the attitude was there he didnt like demangehe didnt think anyone could like demange or that the sergeant would acknowledge it if anyone did but hed learned how to take charge of other men from him the method wasnt pretty but it worked off in the distancefar off in the distance a couple of kilometers away at leasta machine gun stuttered louis and marc and even the bellicose napoleon suddenly looked apprehensive yes things could go wrong up here this wasnt basic training any more luc grinned at them a sneering acrid grin also modeled on sergeant demanges that was one of ours my dears he said that wont kill you except by accident of course the grin got nastier yet he cocked his head to one side listening and waiting sure as hell the germans didnt let the french burst go unanswered an mg fired back luc raised an index finger there thats one of theirs but they both sound the same marc protested youd better learn the difference pretty goddamn quick thats all ive got to tell you luc said make a mistake there and you wont get a chance to make a whole lot more what is the difference louis askedhe couldnt hear it either theirs fires faster luc answered they can change belts faster than we can change strips too it sounds like youre saying their guns are better than ours napoleon sounded as scandalized as a society matron at an indecent proposal damn straight they are luc said look the boche is a bastard he does all kinds of horrible shit and he does it in france but youll only get killed for nothing if you think hes a stupid bastard he knows what hes doing in the field and his engineers know their business just as well the new fish gaped at him as if theyd caught an archbishop celebrating a black mass buttheyre the enemy louis sputtered very good nothing gets by you does it luc sure did sound like sergeant demange and he didnt have to step away from himself to hear it now but theyre not the stupid buffoons the papers make them out to be they wouldnt be so fucking dangerous if they were you get that sonny i think so corporal the raw private answered youd better all of you had better otherwise somebody in the ministry of war will send your family a wire no one wants to get and you youll be a blackbordered photo gathering dust on the mantel and youll never suck on your girlfriends titties any more or try to talk her into jerking you off do you get that louis nodded so did marc and napoleon their eyes were big and round as gumdrops they looked as if hed hit them where they lived he hoped he had he wanted them to live he also wanted them to learn the ropes as fast as they could troops new to the front did stupid things that could get them killed in a hurry and it could bring trouble down on the more experienced men who had to keep company with them luc didnt want to get killed for no better reason than that marc say was an idiot come to that he didnt want to get killed at all he gave the new men a last onceover as withering as he could make it louis flinched so he didnt do too bad sergeant demange would have had every one of them trembling in his clodhoppers well theyd meet the sergeant soon enoughtoo soon to suit them luc was sure lets go you lugs he said keep your heads down dont let the germans see you moving theyve got mortars and artillery zeroed in about every ten meters if they start shooting at you they can hit you they can hit me too he wished he could have the last handful of words back he didnt want them to realize he could get jumpy himself they heard the words but they didnt hear the tone that informed them they probably thought hed give them all a kick in the slats if he got wounded they didnt know a wounded man just lay there and thrashed and screamed and bled well theyd find out luc led them through trenches to the ruins of a village digging like moles damming like beavers the frenchmen had done a lot to improve the ruins unless you were very tall you could move around freely without worrying about sniper fire there were underground galleries where you could eat and sleep and shelter from artillery fire it wasnt the maginot line but luc had been in plenty of worse places half a kilometer to the east the german lines boasted about as many comforts if you werent advancing or retreating you settled down and made yourself at home the new fish exclaimed at what the soldiers dug in here had done luc enjoyed eating well and sleeping soft too unlike napoleon and louis and marc he knew too well that these good times wouldnt last the nazis had almost knocked france out of the war with their winter onslaught theyd grabbed more of the country this time than they did in and made it harder for england to send help across the channel and unlike germany france hadnt had its heart in the war from the beginning it did now getting your whole northeast occupied would do that to you and the germans were fighting russia now a lot of frenchmen with red leanings had seen the whole war as a struggle between two sets of oppressive imperialists as none of their business in other words but if hitler threatened the soviet union the font of world revolution obviously he was a monster who needed suppressing the communists were singing the popular front song again as loud as they could so eventually there would be big pushes forward theyd leave this place behind the people who lived here would come back and try to put the pieces together again none of the offensives yet had been the real thing but it was coming and all the horrors that went with a war of movement would come with it sweet suffering jesus harcourt why didnt you wipe your ass before you came back here look at the dingleberries you brought with you sergeant demange eyed the replacements as if hed never seen anything so disgusting in his life the twitching gitane in the corner of his mouth only amplified his scorn this is sergeant demange men luc said he commands the section youd better listen to him or or ill fucking well whale the shit out of you demange broke in well you syphilitic scuts what do they call you one by one the new men hesitantly named themselves demange clapped a hand to his forehead napoleon merde alors well i wont forget thatunless you get killed quick go round up canteens and fill em at the well go onmove you never want me to have to tell you something more than once believe it punk you dont thus encouraged napoleon moved marc and louis gaped till demange found fatigues for them too luc smiled hed been on the other end of those growls not so long ago this was better oh yes much much better chapter pete mcgill had never figured he would walk into a shop that sold carved jade and other jewels then again hed never figured he would fall in love with a white russian taxi dancer life was full of surprises he was enjoying this one a hell of a lot more than say getting stomped by half a dozen japanese soldiers with hobnailed boots all the same hed come to the jade tree maker out on yates road by himself if hed had any of his buddies along they would have told him he was pussywhipped they might even have been right but that would have made him more likely to try to punch them out not less a eurasian man in a sharp silk suit stood behind the counter good day he said in smooth english the way he dipped his head was almost a bow how may i help you today sir right now im only looking pete said of course the proprietor or clerk or whatever he was pretended the american marine didnt exist he was good at it a white man would have kept sneaking glances petes way this fellow didnt he had the oriental knack for not seeing what lay right under his nose you needed that knack if you were going to live in the crowded warrens of peking or shanghai without going nuts if pete tried to heist something now the man in the suit would turn out to have been watching all along understanding as much pete kept his hands to himself as he examined the merchandise jade trees sure enough they came in all sizes from three inches to three feet tall all qualities of jadejadeite was a much more brilliant green than the cheaper nephriteand all degrees of elaboration in the carving prices started at a few dollars mex and went straight up like a mortar bomb he thoughthe hopedvera would like a jade tree he had cash in his pocket a corporals pay was nothing back in the states in shanghai it made him welloff he had nothing to spend his money on but cigarettes and boozeboth cheapand his lady love spend he would he picked up a jade tree not a very big one but full of detailwork in the carving of branches and leaves and of peasants and cattle on the base when he took it over to the counter the eurasian man dipped his head again you are a man of taste he said which meant the dicker would be harder how much do you want for it he asked the price is on the tag here the man in the silk suit tapped it with his forefinger one hundred twentyfive dollars mex that was about forty bucks usa months pay more or less the exchange rate went up and down often wildly pete didnt get mad or storm out hed played these games before i know thats what the price tag says he said patiently but how much do you really want for it you are an american the eurasian said youve got lots of cash why do you care about getting gouged everybody in shanghai thought that way and with some reason but only some even vera thought that way pete might be head over heels but he wasnt blind he didnt think so anyhow he stayed patient now im not an american generalim an american corporal a hundred and a quarter mex is too steep for me what a pity the man behind the counter murmured for a moment pete thought thered be no haggle after all but then the fellows narrow shoulders shifted as he sighed perhaps from an american corporal i might take a hundred and ten pete ended up getting it for seventyfive dollars mex hed hoped to beat the eurasian down to half the price on the tag but this wasnt bad the man swaddled the jade tree in cotton batting and wrapped it in newspapers full of incomprehensible chinese hentracks much obliged pete said it wouldnt look like anything special as he carried it down the street in a town where thievery was as much a sport as a crime that mattered not at all sir a pleasure matching wits with such a good bargainer the eurasian replied of course hed still made a profit at the price pete paidhe wasnt in business for the fun of it how much had he made was that a polite you sucker his face gave away nothing pete was glad not to have to face him across a poker table bauble in hand he walked down yates road he knew where he was going next and was on the other side of the street from crossing meant risking his life but he made it ken keeembroidery and underwear the sign over the door said with a picture of a lofty pagoda next to the words and some chinese above them pete drew himself up straight before going in as if advancing on an enemy trench if you wanted something fancy in the way of lingerie hed heard this was the place that had it the shopgirl who greeted him with a bright smile could have made a mint dancing in any of shanghais fancy clubs she was tiny and gorgeous yes sir she said her voice ringing like silver bells just looking pete mumbled again this was harder than going up against a trench full of japs they just scared you they didnt embarrass you hed never bought lingerie before hed never dreamt he might want to buy lingerie but when you found yourself with a gorgeous girlfriend didnt you want to make her even gorgeouser the english teachers whod rapped his knuckles at every mistake and helped encourage him to drop out of high school and join the marines would have flinched but not a goddamn one of them was within miles of shanghai he nervously eyed a gown hed also never dreamt even silk could be so transparent you could see the more substantial blue thing behind it right through the fabric he wanted to touch it but didnt dare it looked as if it would tear if you breathed on it when he thought about seeing vera through that fabric he had to turn away from the salesgirl till his hardon went down when he swung toward her again he coughed a couple of times and asked umhow much for uh this one he pointed let me see sir she walked over and looked at the tag a hundred dollars mex even ouch pete exclaimed thats more than i can afford its very fine quality she didnt add and your girlfriend had better be if shes going to put it on but he could hear it in her chiming voice she cocked her head to one said studying him well what can you afford no matter what the tags said there werent many fixed prices in shanghai i was thinking oh fifty pete answered coming back with half the asking price was a standard opening movea conservative one but the place intimidated him too much to let him go any lower she nodded and came down a little pete moved up he felt less confident than he had haggling with the eurasian who sold jade trees thinking about jade trees didnt make him horny thinking about this gown he almost had to turn away from the shopgirl again he ended up paying eighty dollars mex more than the carved tree had cost so much cash for something that was hardly there well that was the point wasnt it when the girl wrapped up the gown it seemed to take up no space at all it didnt weigh anything either maybe it wasnt silk after all maybe some clever chinaman had figured out how to curdle air just a little pete got out of ken kees as if the place had caught fire behind him the salesgirl didnt laugh at his retreat but he could feel her amused eyes on his back how many guys had she seen sneaking out of there it wasnt as if he were buying dirty pictures dammit he paused out on the sidewalk on yates road dirty pictures only promised this nightgown would deliver boy would it ever but he wasnt completely stupid the next time he saw vera he gave her the jade tree first got something for you babe he said as casually as he could chto that meant what when you caught her by surprise she still sometimes came out with russian without thinking hed got some real wrapping paper from a clerk at the consulate so the tree looked nicer now than it had when he took it out of the shop veras quick clever fingers stripped off the paper and the cotton wool ahh she said it is very pretty pete chances were she could guess to the penny what hed paid for it too by the warmth of the kiss she gave him she approved we go out now they went out he was throwing away money like a drunken sailorlike a drunken marinebut he didnt care not while he was with vera he didnt anyhow they ate they drank they danced they drank by the time they went back to her little chamber he was a drunken marine not too drunk though he hoped with an air of suddenly remembering he pulled the smaller package from an inside pocket this is for you too he said if she didnt like it would dying on the spot or wishing he were dead be worse she wasnt quite so deft unwrapping this one shed also been knocking them back ahh she said once more this time on a different note she unfolded the gown and held it up it still might as well have not been there she gave him a slow sidelong smile for myself darling i would not buy this i would not wear this for you do you want me to jesus do i he said hoarsely do you gotta ask asking was part of the game vera understood that even if pete didnt she also understood enough to walk behind him and say not to turn around until i am telling you a pause faint rustlings okay now he turned she looked even better than hed imagined and he hadnt thought such a thing possible he took her in his arms somehow the silk also made her feel more like a woman than she ever had before and shed always felt about as much like a woman as a woman could feel and he wasnt too drunk oh no that turned out to be better than ever too one more time he hadnt dreamt it could sergeant carrasquel glowered in the direction of downtown madrid only a few kilometers away but as unreachable as the bottom of the sea or the mountains of the moon stupid bastards he snarled at no one in particular they brought us here to take the capital away from the republic but were farther away than we were right after we came up from gibraltar its those damned internationals sergeant joaquin delgadillo knew he had to soften up the underofficer before carrasquel started throwing around extra duty or dangerous assignments if they hadnt got between us and the city we might be in there by now thats what she said carrasquel retorted just shows the brass has its head up its ass thats all you didnt say things like that when marshal sanjurjo came up to look things over joaquin said slyly i said plenty what good would more have done carrasquel replied he is a marshal he talked nice to me but to the likes of him a sergeant isnt even a squashed turd on the sole of his boot he looked around i wont go on about taking things up the ass where major uribe can hear me either hed think it was a good idea joaquin giggled deliciously scandalized hes got cojones he said in what might or might not have been reproof sure he does the sergeant agreed and hed like em to be slapping the backside of some pretty little boyor hed like some big manly fellows cojones slapping his backside or maybe both both the straitlaced private hadnt thought of that could you both do and be done by he supposed you could but madre de dios she hasnt got any cojones im sure of that hell she didnt even get josephs carrasquel said this time delgadillo didnt answer right away he was scandalized all over again and not so deliciously this time at last stiffly he said if youre going to make filthy jokes about the virgin you really should fight for the republic everybody knew the people on the other side hated godand he hated them too god understands me carrasquel said if a snotnosed private doesnt i wont lose sleep over it major uribe had said that god forgave his love life everybody seemed to think god would be soft on him in particular even if all the other sinners running around loose would roast on satans grill forever with demons sticking pitchforks into them every so often to turn them and make sure they cooked evenly on all sides joaquin didnt think god worked that way it wasnt as if god had told him he didntgod didnt waste time talking to a snotnosed private but that was how it looked to him go liberate some firewood sergeant carrasquel talked to him all right if youve got the time to jaw with me youve got the time to do some real work with a martyred sigh joaquin started scrounging hed tried to keep carrasquel sweettempered and look what he got for it nobody else would sympathize either the rest of the guys would just be glad he was busting his butt and they werent to add injury to insult major uribe chose him to join a raiding party that night we need some prisoners sweethearts uribe lisped we always need prisoners have to keep track of what the dirty reds are up to theyre going straight to hell and you can count on it he crossed himself so did delgadillo he also started working the beads on his rosary how many prayers would he need to stay safe in a trench raid the probable number struck him as unpleasantly large he worked the beads harder hail mary full of grace dont listen to the foulmouthed sergeant that wasnt your standard ave maria but it came from the bottom of his heart after he got done with the rosary joaquin fixed the bayonet on his riflesomething he hardly ever didand sharpened one edge of the blade on his entrenching tool trench raiding was closequarters fighting at its nastiest a couple of the men in the raiding party carried machine pistols to fill the air around them with lead major uribe had a swordnot an officers ceremonial sword but a shorter fatter blade almost a pirates cutlass christ only knew where hed found it by the way he made it wheep through the air as he limbered up in the nationalist trenches he knew what to do with it and it went without saying that he would lead the party himself no matter how queer he was he never sent men where he wouldnt go himself no moon tonight that was good light wouldnt betray the raiders as they crawled toward the republican lines a few hundred meters away some of the other soldiers in the nationalist trenches started shooting at the enemy as major uribe had hoped the republicans fired back with luck the racket would cover any little noises the raiding party made with luck what beautiful words those were joaquin had thought about that before usually when artillery dropped too close it crossed his mind again as he scrambled out of the trench and slithered forward somewhere not far away a cricket chirped it fell silent as the nationalist soldiers went by mierda joaquin muttered under his breath an alert republican sentry might wonder why the bug suddenly shut up he couldnt do anything about that all he could do was go on the republicans had barbed wire in front of their positions damn them most wiring in spain was halfhearted a few strands easy to cut through and to get through not here the internationals took war seriously damn them too in spades no worries major uribe said he had wire cutters the lengths twanged as they parted one by one the noise seemed very loud to joaquin but the enemy didnt start shooting maybe the mother of god was watching over him the major hissed in the darkness come along lambs all clear now on they went mostly on their bellies there was the parapet in grab out it would be easy it could be easy at my count of three we rush uribe whispered uno dos he never got to tres all hell broke loose internationals popped up along the parapet and started blasting away with everything they had the nationalists shrieked in despair major uribe ran forward sword drawn starlight glittered on the bladefor a moment then a bullet caught him he groaned and fell the sword flew from his hand another bullet grazed joaquins shoulder aii he howled and then clapped both hands to his mouth the more noise he made the easier the target he gave the enemy well a slug had found him anyhow blood dripped warm down his arm the firing eased for a moment from the trench someone called out in accented spanish surrender come in now well take prisoners if you do if you dont youre dead first chance last chance only chance now how many meters back to his own lines too many joaquin was sure of that maybe they would take prisoners his side had wanted some after all im coming he said two or three other men also gave up the others he decided would never move again not in this life he slid down into the trench an international frisked him in the dark the fellow took everything that would have done him any good in a fight and his wallet too that was a jokehe had all of seven pesetas in there he didnt say anything the foreigner would find out this wasnt even chicken feed get moving the guy said in bad spanish not to do anything stupid or i shoot you in the backcomprende si joaquin said miserably and then where are you from estados unidos nueva iorque the international answered as they started toward madrid why did you come here if joaquin kept the guy talking maybe he wouldnt shoot him for the fun of it maybe for freedom the american said why do you want to fight for a puto like marshal sanjurjo for my country joaquin replied the americanwas he a jew wasnt everybody from new york a jew joaquin had never talked with a jew beforelaughed at him he would have laughed at the other fellows socalled freedom if only he were the one holding the rifle but he wasnt head down he shambled off into captivity night in the siberian woods hideki fujita sat in a foxhole slapping at mosquitoes daytime nighttime the mosquitoes didnt care they bit whenever they found bare skin fujita had itchy welts all over the damn mosquitoes had bitten him right through his puttees he wouldnt have believed they could do that till he got here but he did now hayashi he called what is it sergeantsan the superior private asked whats the name of that bloodsucking demon in the american movie ah hes called dracula sergeantsan shinjiro hayashi answered fujita could hear the relief in his voice hed figured fujita wanted something harder something more dangerous whatever a sergeant wanted a private had to give it to him hai dracula fujita said and slapped again the night tonight is full of draculas you hear them buzzing neh thats right hayashi said not even a private with an education would ever tell a sergeant he was wrong if he did hed get an education of a brandnew kind but not one hed want fujita wanted a cigarette he didnt light up who could guess where a russian sniper might be lurking like any other hairy animals the russians were at home among the trees a bullet might fly out of nowhere if he struck a match or even the smell of burning tobacco might guide a sniper toward him who could say how russians knew what they knew they didnt know how to give up though the kwantung army had cut the transsiberian railroad red army counterattacks showed that the enemy would keep trying to restore the lifeline to vladivostok a buzz in the air fujita paused with his hand raised to swat at something this was no mosquito this was a deeper sound almost a rumble japanese bombers flew by at night to pound russian positions farther north and sometimes the russians returned the favor these sounded like russian machines sure as hell their note was different from those of japanese airplanes to fujita it seemed more guttural like the incomprehensible russian language compared to his own bombers someone yelled in perfectly comprehensible japanese just before the bombs started whistling down fujita did stick a cigarette in his mouth and light it why not it would make him feel a tiny bit betterand if there were russian snipers in the neighborhood theyd be scared out of their wits too those planes were dropping by dead reckoning dropping blind bombers as fujita had found were none too accurate even when they could see their targets when they couldnt any russian snipers faced at least as much danger as the japanese on whom they preyed the first crashing explosions came from a couple of kilometers behind the trench line fujita breathed easier let the quartermasters and cooks and the rest of the useless people get a taste of what war was like for a change how would they like it not very much not if he was any judge then he said uhoh that didnt seem enough zakennayo he added the bombs were coming closer hed seen that happen before after the lead plane dropped the others would use his bursts as an aiming point but they wouldnt want to stick around any longer than they had to theyd drop too soon and the ones behind them sooner still and and hideki fujita cowered in his hole as the explosions crept nearer and nearer mother someone wailed oh mother that wasnt a wounded mans screamit was just terror fujita had a hard time condemning the frightened soldier he was about to shit himself too he almost tore down his trousers so as not to foul them only one thing stopped him the thought that the mosquitoes would feast on his bare backside if he did he hadnt got bitten too badly there he clamped down as hard as he could and hoped for the best crump that one was close crump that one was closermuch closer the ground shook as if in a big earthquake fujita knew more about earthquakes than hed ever wanted to learn to their sorrow most japanese did but earthquakes didnt throw razorsharp redhot shards of steel through the air several of them wheeped and snarled by above fujitas head dirt kicked up by the explosions arced down on him blast tore at his ears and his lungs he breathed out as hard as he could it might not do much good but he didnt think it could hurt then the bombs started going off farther away some of them had to be landing on red army positions instead of exultation fujita felt a kind of exhausted pity for the russians huddling in their trenches it wasnt as if his own side hadnt also tried to kill him did blasts murder mosquitoes he hoped so but was inclined to doubt it nothing else did much good against the droning pests he couldnt hear them now someone was shouting something he had trouble making that out too yes the near miss had messed up his ears it wasnt the first time he wondered how long they would need to come back to normal time would tell the shout came again more urgent but no more understandable nan desuka fujita shouted back what is it he heard a little something the next time but not enough to make sense of what the yelling soldier was saying what about lieutenant hanafusa he demanded hes dead this time the key word came through very clearly the other man added something else fujita caught the last part of it left but his boots the sergeants stomach did a slow lurch he knew what happened to men who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time lieutenant hanafusas spirit would join the rest of japans heroic dead at yasukuni shrine in tokyo his body his body was probably splashed over half a square kilometer somebody out there in the night said something else something with sergeant fujitas name in it im here fujita called what was that so sorry but my ears are ringing like a bell ringing or not he got the answer very clearly youre in command of the platoon till we get a new officer sergeant jojima got his hand blown off and sergeant iwamuras hurt too so youre the senior noncom what do we need to do now fujita asked but the other soldier couldnt tell him that only an officer could and if any officers were left in the neighborhood he wouldnt find himself in charge of the platoon so he had to figure it out for himself one thing looked blindingly obvious if he ordered the men to retreat somebody would hang him hold tight he yelled as loud as he could if the russians come drive them back that sounded bravebraver than it was probably with any luck the roundeyed barbarians would no more be able to attack than the japanese were to defend so it proved the rest of the night passed with hardly a shot fired by either side when morning came fujita could see what a mess the bombs had made of the platoons position and order his men to start setting things to rights he didnt need to be an officer to see that that needed doing how much did you need to be an officer to see not for the first time he suspected it was less than officers claimed if copenhagen wasnt a miracle peggy druce couldnt imagine what one would look like the lights were on cars ran through the streets amidst the swarms of danes on bicycles somehow nobody seemed to get clobbered no one looked shabby no one seemed to have even heard of rationing let alone suffered under it you could buy all the gas you wanted and all the clothes you wanted too and the food my god the food peggy gorged on white bread and butter on fine danish ham on pickled herringon everything she wanted she poured down good carlsberg beer the only things with which she didnt stuff herself were potatoes turnips and cabbage shed had enough of those in germany to last her about three lifetimes she did her best not to think of constantine jenkins she was back in touch with herb all the cable lines between america and europe passed through england and the english allowed no traffic with the continental enemy but denmark was a neutral just like the usa she and her husband could catch up on what had happened since last october on most of it anyhow of course peggy wouldnt put anything about the embassy undersecretary in a wire or even a letter she didnt think shed ever be able even to talk about what happened with him i was drunk she told herself over and over and she had been but shed been horny too or she wouldnt have gone to bed with him no matter how drunk she was that wasnt the worst of it either would herb have got horny too there across the atlantic sure he would herb was one of the most reliably horny guys shed ever known what would he have done about it with her away for so long what wasnt he putting into his telegrams and letters what wouldnt he want to talk about after she got home every time that crossed her mind she muttered to herself it wasnt that shed mindtoo muchif hed laid some roundheeled popsy but not being able to talk about things with him that wasnt good that was about as bad as it could get in fact theyd always been able to talk about everything if they had to put up walls against each other something precious would have gone out of their marriagepart of the whole point of being married in fact before long shed have the chance to find out about all that travel between denmark and the uk was more complicated than it had been before the war because of mines and uboats few ships cared to cross the north sea airplanes flew between one country and the other but they carried far fewer passengers peggy couldnt book a flight to london any sooner than three weeks after she got to copenhagen in the meantime in the meantime she made like a tourist she rented a bicycle herself relying on the polite danish drivers not to run her down she shopped you could buy things in copenhagen the shop windows werent mocking lies the way they were in berlin if you saw it on display you could lay down your money and the shopkeeper would hand it to you hed even giftwrap it for you if you asked him to quite a few danes knew enough english to get by a lot of the ones who didnt could manage in german peggy wasnt fond of the language but she could use it too danish radios picked up not only dr goebbels rants but also the bbc the international heraldtribune reported both sides war bulletins after so long with only the german point of view dinning in her ears that seemed almost unnatural to peggy she presumed danish papers did the same thing but she couldnt read those the danes might publish both sides war news but they didnt seem the least bit military themselves she saw very few soldiers like so many other things that reminded her she wasnt in berlin any more at the heart of the third reich more men wore uniforms than civilian clothes and she had trouble imagining german soldiers pedaling along on bicycles waving to pretty girls as they passed german soldiers always looked as if they meant business the danes seemed more like playacting kids in uniform at amalienborg off bredgade the royal guard changed every day at noon the soldiers there looked a little more serious but only a little the cut of their tunics and trousers and the funny flare of their helmets still kept them from being as intimidating as their german counterparts or maybe that was because peggy had seen wehrmacht men in action while only the oldest of old men remembered the last time denmark fought a war between two and half past five every afternoon young people promenaded from frederiksberggade past the best shops to kongens nytorv near the palace peggy found the parade oddly charming it was something she would have expected in madrid before spain went to hell anyhow or lisbon not scandinavia days slid off the calendar one by one getting her exit visa from denmark and an entry visa cost some money but not a speck of stomach lining examining the czechoslovak and german stamps the minor official at the british embassy who issued the entry visa remarked seems as though youve had a bit of a lively time what if that wasnt a prime bit of british understatement peggy had never heard one oh you might say so she answereddamned if shed let the american side down she wondered if the functionary would ask her about what things were like in the enemy nation but he didnt he took her money plied his rubber stamp with might and main and used mucilage to affix the visa in her passport safe journey he told her much obliged peggy said the phrase was a polite commonplace suddenly though she felt the words true meaning i am much obliged to youeverybody whos finally helping me get home i am here to assist travelers maam the official said a trifle stiffly yes i know thats why im obliged to you peggy replied he didnt get it he was an englishman but maybe the war and all the accompanying madness seemed no more real to him than they did to the danes how long had he worked here well it didnt matter all that mattered was that she had the documents she needed nothing would keep her off that airplane nothing she sent a wire to herb everything set first england then usa whoopee love peggy the clerk at the telegraph office had to ask her how to spell whoopee she was happy to tell him herbs answer was waiting at the hotel when she finished spending money for the day whoopee is right babe see you soon love me she smiled he always signed telegrams to her like that and like her hed stayed under the tenword minimumrate limit they were nowhere near poor when youd been through the depression though you watched every penny from habit when you werent shopping of course well sometimes even then but not always she ate another splendid danish breakfast the next morning one day to go she was all packed the only thing shed have to do tomorrow would be to put the clothes she had on now into her suitcase what shed wear then was already draped over a chair in her room she intended to go to the airport very very early she didnt care how bored shed get waiting for the plane as with the train out of germany she wasnt going to miss it she wasnt she wasnt she wasnt she had lunch at the yacht pavilion a guidebook called it delightful and she agreed she could see the statue of the little mermaid staring out into the sound the smorrebrod was good the aquavit even better men started getting off a couple of freighters in the harbor and forming up in long columns on the piers peggys eye passed over them then snapped back no she whispered but yes shed never mistake the color those men were wearing she grabbed a passing waiter by the arm and pointed across the almost waveless water those are german soldiers youre being invaded he looked at her at the troops in feldgrau and beetling stahlhelms back to her again laughing he shook his head no it cannot be someone is making a film thats all briskly the german soldiers marched off the piers and into copenhagen they looked as if they were heading straight for the royal palace well where else would they be going a few rifle shots rang out then a sharp burst of machinegun fire faint in the distance peggy heard screams blood drained from the waiters face leaving him pale as vanilla ice cream all over the yacht pavilion people started exclaiming but it cahnt be someone said in clear british english more gunfire more screams it could be all right and it damn well was that plane wouldnt fly to england tomorrow or anywhere else peggy burst into tears chapter julius lemp felt happier about the world or at least about how his little part of it worked now the uboat skipper understood his orders and he was pleased with himself because hed had a pretty good notion of what they were about even before the balloon went up if the reich had decided to forestall the western democracies by occupying denmark and norway before they could of course france and especially england would try to do something about it and one of the things they would try to do would be to rush as many warships as they could to scandinavian waters if they did that theyd likely storm right through lemps patrol zone no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than one of the ratings on watch sang out smoke to the southwest skipper ha lemp swung his own binoculars in that direction now the game starts he peered and studied looks like three plumes i think so too the sailor said and then after a moment theyve got wings on their feet dont they ja lemp nodded destroyers they have to be nothing else will go that fast by now england had to know germany was using her warships to move troops into southern norway and fight the coastal forts destroyers could get to the battle in a hurry and their crews were practiced with both guns and torpedoes they were also quick and cheap to build which made them more readily expendable than bigger slower ships can we get to them another rating asked were going to try lemp answered they couldnt make a surface approach not unless they wanted to get blown out of the water long before their could loose their own eels go below he added well see how much help the schnorkel can give us he followed the men off the conning tower as he slammed the hatch behind him and dogged it he called dive schnorkel depth change course tohe calculated in his headto diving to schnorkel depth changing course to the helmsman said nothing flustered peter that was one of the reasons he was at the helm lieutenant beilharz appeared the matteblack paint on his helmet had a fresh shiny scratch he really needed the protection to keep his skull from being gashed lemp pointed at him just the man im looking for by god if we go allout with your infernal device how fast can we manage underwater they say thirteen knots skipper the schnorkel expert answered everything shakes and rattles like its coming to pieces though well try it anyway lemp declared three destroyers are heading east as fast as they can go without the snort we dont have a prayer of getting into firing range before theyre past us with it well weve got a prayer i think well give it our best shot any which way you keep the damned gadget working the way its supposed to you hear jawohl beilharz said lemp had to hope he could deliver the device was still experimental and experimental devices had a way of going haywire just when you needed them most all he could do was try he spoke into the voice tube to the engine room give me thirteen knots thirteen skipper the brassy response didnt come right out and ask are you out of your bloody mind but it might as well have thirteen lemp repeated firmly if thats more than we can take well back it down but our targets are making better than twice that if we want to meet them we have to give it everything weve got thirteen he said it one more time aye aye skipper the men who minded the diesels would do what you told them to what happened afterwards wasnt their worry unless of course it turned out to be everybodys worry theyd done eight knots submerged plenty of times ten or eleven often enough above that beilharz had been reluctant to go war sometimes forced you to do what youd be reluctant to try in peacetime though if the u could knock out one of those destroyers how many soldiers lives might that save hundreds thousands no telling for sure the diesels surged they had to work hard to push the uboat through the resisting water lemp felt the power through the soles of his feet as he looked through the periscope without taking his eyes off the destroyers the optics displayed he said you there klaus sure am skipper klaus hammerstein answered lemp hadnt expected anything else hammerstein might be a pup but he was a welltrained pup the execs place in an attack run was at the captains elbow hed have to do most of the calculating if they could get close enough to the destroyers for it to matter lemp fed him speed and range he had to shout to make himself heard as beilharz had warned everything inside the u rattled as if it were getting massaged by an electric cake mixer lemp hoped his fillings wouldnt fall out and that was no idle worry every uboat sailor dreaded a pharmacist mates amateur dentistry skipper theres no good solution if the numbers you fed me are anywhere close to right hammerstein said theyre going to get past us before we close within three kilometers scheisse lemp exclaimed are you sure here hed done everything but tear his boat to pieces and it hadnt done him a goddamn bit of good that wasnt fair that wasnt how life was supposed to work but sometimes life worked that way anyhow the destroyers were making better than thirty knots as hammerstein had said they raced past the u before the sub could approach near enough to launch with any hope of success you wanted to get inside of a kilometer if you could even the execs three seemed optimistic scheisse lemp said again resignedly this time he spoke to the engine room again you did all you could but we cant catch them bring us back down to six knots six knots aye aye even through the long metal tube the skipper could hear the relief in the answer all the same the schnorkel had paid its dues without it he wouldnt even have tried the attack run it would have been obviously hopeless what do we do now hammerstein asked his voice falling as the boat stopped trying to come to bits around him we stay submerged till those royal navy ships get farther awayi dont want them turning around and coming after us lemp said then we surface and radio their position and speed to the vaterland we arent the only uboat in the sea and the kriegsmarine and the luftwaffe will have planes flying out of germanyout of denmark too by now i suppose someone may pay them a call all right the exec still sounded unhappy and explained why a moment later i still wish we could have done the job ourselves so do i if we could have made twenty knots submerged we would have got them but you can imagine what the boat would have been like at twenty knots i dont think ive got the nerve to try thirteen again lemp said he went into his tiny cabin to prepare the encoded message he would send when the boat surfaced the machine that filled most of his safe gave him the groups he needed experts assured him the code the machine generated was unbreakable as long as the other side didnt get its hands on one of these machines his orders were to sacrifice anything including his own life before he let that happen he hopedhe prayedhe never had to make the choice he carefully scanned the whole horizon through the periscope before surfacing as soon as he could he sent off his carefully composed code groups then he ordered the boat down to schnorkel depth again however little hed wanted to at first hed come to rely on the long ugly stovepipe it did what the dutchmen whod invented it said it would do you couldnt ask for more or could you a uboat that would make twenty knots submerged that would be a weapon the likes of which the world had never known with uboats like that running around how long could a surface navy survive daysweeks at most but how would you get such a weapon better streamlining came to mind right away the u wasnt made for highspeed underwater travel the engineers whod designed the boat had assumed such a thing was impossible and it waswhen theyd designed the boat was it now with the schnorkel and whatever other clever notions the boys with thick glasses could come up with not even slightly lemp murmured no not even he retreated to his cabin again once he got there he started sketching and making notes after a few minutes he shut the curtain that gave him more privacy than anyone else on the boat enjoyed he didnt want his men to think hed gone round the bend a train hauled alistair walsh and god only knew how many other english soldiers towards a port on the atlantic or the western side of the english channel he didnt know exactly where he was going he did wonder whether the officers whod dragged him and his comrades away from the line in front of paris knew where they were sending them inside a cat carrier improvised from a ladys fancy hatbox pussy meowed hush there walsh said and fed the cat a bit of bully beef pussy loved the stuff which to walshs way of thinking only proved the little beast didnt have the brains god gave a flatiron or a general staff colonel rank had its privileges had jock or alonzo tried to bring a cat along when they got transferred to somewhere some officious corporal would have made sure it never got on the train but a staff sergeant was allowed his little eccentricities and pussy entertained the rest of the smelly dirty khakiclad men shoehorned into the compartment with him they vied with one another at finding little delicacies for her and their weary badly shaved faces softened when they stroked her she wasnt a woman but she was warm and softthe next best thing you might say they laughed when she chased a bit of string over their forest of knees and hardly swore at all if she slipped and dug claws into a leg to keep from falling they didnt know where they were going either some guessed russia more plumped for norway me ah dont much care jock said put a goddamn fritz in front of me and ahll shoot the bugger when he came out with that the rest of the men solemnly nodded how could you sum things up better one fellow kept insisting they wouldnt see any more fritzestheyd done their bit he insisted and were going back to blighty for good the other soldiers humored him as they would have humored any harmless maniac like them walsh would have loved to believe it like them he couldnt once the army got hold of you it didnt turn you loose till the war endedwhich didnt look like happening any time soonor till it used you up in brest which turned out to be their destination they filed aboard what was called a troopship by the way it smelled it had hauled more cattle or maybe sheep than soldiers pussy found the symphony of stinks fascinating walsh lit a navy cut to blunt what it did to his nostrils on that ship he would have lit a gitane and he thought they smelled like smoldering asphalt they made it back to england without meeting a uboat he heartily approved of that they came into port just after sunup and got served huge helpings of bangers and mash and properly brewed tea after british army rations french army rations and a lot of whatever he could scavenge he approved of that too you see said the chap who was convinced they were going to be discharged they wouldnt feed us like this if they meant to keep us on for the first time walsh began to wonder that did fit in with the way the army mind worked whether it did or not it turned out not to be true a captain with a really splendid red mustache stood up on a barrel and addressed the soldiers just returned to their native soil well lads well be entraining you soon then its scotland and then another little pleasure cruise his wry grin said he knew what the troopship had been like maybe hed been on it though an officer would have had better accommodations than other ranks he went on after that its norway if adolf thinks well just sit by whilst he gobbles it up hed best think again what norway that astonished dismayed bleat came from the luckless private whod been so sure he would soon be set at liberty norway the captain repeated the norwegians are tough fightersthere just arent enough of them to hold back the fritzes on their own his smile suddenly went broad and lickerish and the girls there are mighty pretty and theyll be mighty glad to see the blokes whore helping to keep em free that might turn out to be true and it might not most likely it would be part truth part stretcher some frenchwomen enjoyed spitting in an english soldiers eye while others were complaisant as could be lorries growled up to take the troops from the dockside to the train station had the germans sneaked a few bombers across the channel they could have worked a fearful slaughter but everything went off smoothly no one seemed to give a damn about pussy walsh was probably breaking all kinds of laws by bringing her into the country but he didnt care the train proved less crowded than the one in france that had hauled him away from the fighting there tinned rations were passed out he sighed theyd keep him full which didnt mean he loved them as the train rattled through the north of england jock nudged him and asked you wont mind if me and my mates op it here will you sergeant the yorkshiremans grin said he didnt expect to be taken seriously oh right walsh answered desertion in wartimetheyll pin a medal on you for that they will he glanced over to make sure the private understood exactly what officialdom would do if he and his mates took off the twinkle in jocks eyes showed he did walsh gave him a cigarette and fired up one of his own they smoked in companionable silence scotland walsh had expected edinburgh but the train pounded on north and east aberdeen guessed someone whose clotted accent said he knew the local geography pretty well it made sense norway was pretty far north and they wouldnt be sailing toward the part the germans had already grabbed walsh hoped like blazes they wouldnt anyhow aberdeen seemed to come out of nowhere it was a gray granite city as if the bones of the countryside were carved into churches and shops and houses and blocks of flats the north sea lay beyond walsh hadnt seen it before it looked colder and generally grimmer than the channel who would have imagined anything could more khaki lorries waited at the station as the soldiers got off their trains some of the drivers smoked one or two nipped from flasks unlikely to hold water a raw wind blew down out of the north summer gray aberdeen scoffed at summer what would norway be like walsh half wished he hadnt thought to wonder he clumped up the gangplank onto a freighter that had seen better days but didnt reek of livestock pussy still in her hatbox as soon as he found his assigned place he let her scurry around for a while the cat had been very good about staying cooped upshed slept most of the way north but she needed to get out while she could she rewarded him by dropping a dead mouse on his bunk arent you proud of me the green eyes asked isnt it a lovely present will you eat it right now or save it for later walsh took it by the tail and tossed it in a dustbin he made much of pussy afterwards and chucked her under the chin but he could tell she was disappointed a small convoy pulled out of the harbor troopships escorted by a destroyer and a pair of smaller warships frigates corvettes walsh was no sailor he didnt know their right names he did know he was glad to have them along a name began to drift through the freighter trondheim it was somewhere up the norwegian coast just where walsh couldnt have said how far away from the place were the germans somebody in the convoy probably knew walsh hoped so nobody admitted anything about it where he could hear though he did notice that abandonship drills came more often and were more thorough than any hed seen before he didnt take that for a good sign daylight lingered long and got longer as the ships zigzagged northeast walsh didnt take that for a good sign either uboats and enemy airplanes had most of the clocks face in which to prowl a sailor told him the last run in to trondheim was planned for the brief hours of darkness he hoped that would be long enough to shield them from prying eyes past hoping he couldnt do anything about it but worry as twilight neared an angular biplane with floats under the wings buzzed toward the convoy from the east the warships opened up on it right away it flew past them and dropped a small bomb that just missed one of the lumbering freighters then it sprayed that troopship with machinegun bullets and went back the way it had come two more german biplanes attacked the convoy an hour later gathering darkness or dumb luck kept them from doing much harm all the ships made it to trondheim as he had before walsh filed off the freighter pussy meowed inside her makeshift carrier off in the distance artillery rumbled that answered one thing the germans werent very far away after all everyone on his side had told joaquin delgadillo he would march into madrid in triumph well here he was but not the way hed had in mind hed heard the republicans shot prisoners that didnt seem to be true he was still breathing maybe they thought he was too insignificant to be worth a bullet if they did he didnt want to change their minds for them he wasnt even in a proper jail they housed him and their other prisoners in a barbedwire enclosure in a park they gave the captives tents of such surpassing rattiness that he would have thought it a deliberate insult had he not known they used equally ratty ones themselves so did his side they fed him beans and cabbage and occasional choppedup potatoes it wasnt very good and he always craved more than he got but he wouldnt starve on these rationsnot soon anyhow hed been hungry often enoughtoo oftenin the field to get excited about this most of the republican guards were men recovering from wounds they couldnt move fast but they carried submachine guns if anyone tried to escape they could send a hell of a lot of bullets after him joaquin wasnt going anywhere not right away he was just glad to say alive after the disastrous raid on the internationals he was even more relieved to find himself untortured after being taken prisoner little by little he started to realize not everything his superiors had told him about the republicans was the gospel truth he didnt do anything about the realization not yet for one thing it was still a newly sprouted seed pushing up through dead leaves and chunks of bark toward the light for another he was in no position to do anything about anything he ate he slept he mooched around the camp taking care not to get too close to the wire coming too closeor anything else out of the ordinarywould have made the guards open up on him without warning when flights of bombers droned over his foxhole to drop their deadly cargo on madrid hed cheered how not those bombs were falling on the enemys heads well so they were one thing that hadnt occurred to him before he got captured was that those bombs were also liable to come down on the heads of prisoners of war the only spades the republicans allowed inside the wire perimeter were the ones the captives used to lengthen their latrine trenches and shovel lime into them to fight the stink the guards counted the spades before they doled them out and made sure they got them all back every time joaquin had no trouble seeing why they didnt want the prisoners tunneling under the barbed wire but it meant the captured nationalists had nothing but a few mugs and tin mess kits to dig scrapes in which to shelter when the bombers came by joaquin had borne up when republican planes bombed his positions hed always consoled himself by thinking his side had more planes with which to punish the godless foe and hed been right the nationalists did have more bombers and they concentrated them against madrid hed always thought of bombing as a pinpoint business that wasnt how marshal sanjurjos flyers went about it madrid belonged to the republicans as far as the nationalists were concerned they could put their bombs anywhere and still hurt their opponents they couldand they did maybe they didnt aim as well as joaquin thought they could or maybe they just didnt care with antiaircraft guns shooting at them from the ground with republican fighters sometimes tearing into them the pilots and bombardiers wanted nothing more than to get back to their airstrips in one piece either they didnt know the camp for their comrades lay right in the middle of the city they were flattening or they didnt care joaquin would have bet on the latter you could watch the bombs fall from the planes bellies you could watch them swell as they grew nearer you could listen to the rising whistle as they clove the air on their way down you could watch fire and smoke and dust leap up and out as they burst you could yesif you were stupid enough you could get smashed or chopped by flying fragments and rubble too artillery fire and those earlier bombings from the republicans had rammed one lesson into joaquin when things started blowing up you got as low and as flat as you could even that might not be enough but it gave you your best chance most of the prisoners knew as much they lay down in whatever tiny dips in the ground they could find those who had anything to dig with scraped at the hard dry dirt as fiercely as they could some of those who didnt broke fingernails and tore fingertips in the animal urge to burrow joaquin screamed when bombs went off nearby that was as much instinct as the prisoners frantic scrabbling at the dirt odds were the thunderous explosions kept other men from hearing his cries and odds were his werent the only shrieks rising up to the uncaring sky were the guards on the other side of the wire screaming too of course they were terror conquered nationalists and republicans with equal ease and if some of the republicans werent calling out to their mothers or to god joaquin would have been amazed you could tear the cassock off a priest or torch a church but tearing the beliefs you grew up with out of your heart wasnt so easy then two bombs smashed down inside the perimeter and joaquin stopped caring about anything but staying alive longer than the next few seconds he got picked up and slammed down as if by a wrestler the size of a building blood dribbled from his nose iron and salt filled his mouth he spat praying the blast hadnt shredded his lungs were his ears also bleeding he wouldnt have been surprised more bombs burstmercifully farther away as if from a long way off he heard screams full of anguish not fear he knew the difference hed heard both kinds too often whoever was making noises like that wouldnt keep making them very longnot if god showed even a little kindness he wouldnt if the bombs had blown a hole in the barbed wire the camp might empty like a cracked basin then again it might not the thought flickered through joaquin and then blew out he was too stunned to do anything but lie there with his sleeve pressed to his face to try to stanch the flood from his nose how many others in here would be in much better shape the guards wouldnt either that thought also flickered and blew out to try to escape joaquin would have needed more resolution than he owned right this minute he imagined running this way and that trying to find a gap in the perimeter imagining was easy doing wouldnt be even telling his rosary beads took as much as he had in him guards came into the prisoners enclosure to take away men whod been killed or wounded they didnt seem to treat the injured nationalists any worse than stretcherbearers and medics who fought for marshal sanjurjo would have seeing that joaquin decided the republicans werent just fattening him for the slaughter so to speak he got another surprise a few days later the international whod captured him came to see how he was doing he wouldnt have known the man by sight not when the illfated raid came off in the middle of the night but the fellows slow bad spanish and the timbre of his voice were familiar here i am joaquin called from his side of the wire bueno the internationalthe american the jew hed said he wasnodded back they treat you all right joaquin considered not too bad could be worse lord knew that was true they might have decided to see how many small chunks they could tear off him before he died hed feared they would do exactly that and they still might if he annoyed them enough here catch the international tossed an almostfull pack of gitanes over the barbed wire joaquin grabbed it eagerly he could smoke some of the harsh cigarettes and trade the rest for well for anything you could get here on this side of the wire cigarettes were as good as pesetas maybe better muchas gracias he said you didnt have to do this you must be a gentleman to his amazement he saw hed flustered the fellow from the other side the jew was ordinary or a little homelier than that short kind of pudgy with a big nose and not a whole lot of chin i dont want to be a gentleman he said i dont want anybody to be a gentleman everybody ought to be equal si then how does anyone decide what needs doing joaquin asked once he does decide how does he get them to go along ah the international leaned forward till he almost pricked that formidable nose on the barbed wires fangs heres how like an airplane climbing from a runway the talk took off from there mike carroll eyed chaim weinberg in mingled amusement and scorn you came here to fight the fucking fascists man you didnt come here to convert em bite me chaim answered the more of those guys we win over the better you know what mencken said about that kind of shit mike persisted he quoted with relish i detest converts almost as much as i do missionaries chaim didnt want to listen especially since mike hardly ever read anything that didnt follow the party line why now who cares what a reactionary says he may be a reactionary but hes a damn fine writer the other american sounded a little defensive or more than a little for an enemy of the people chaim trotted out the heavy artillery mike breathed heavily through his nose okay fine have it your way but if youre back at that camp blabbing about dialectical materialism when youre supposed to be up here fighting brigadier kossuthll skin you alive hell call it desertion not conversion he was right which didnt make chaim any happier with him if anything chaim only got angrier hey you know better than that when did i ever miss action that time just after you got here over near the ebro oh give me a break i was down with dysentery for cryin out loud you never got a case of the galloping shits not to where i couldnt grab my rifle terrific chaim said grab it and shove it up your assbayonet first he was ready for a brawl mike was bigger than he was and looked to have more muscles but all that mattered only so much land a guy one in the pit of the stomach or in the nuts and all the muscles in the world wouldnt do him a goddamn bit of good but instead of pissing off the other american chaim made him laugh all right already carroll said as if he were a landsman himself but watch yourself okay you really are making like this one nationalist is more important than the rest of the struggle nah chaim said even if mike was right or nearly right again hed come to see the effort to reeducate joaquin as a representation of the larger fight against fascism he realized that just because he saw it that way other people wouldnt necessarily do the same thing some of those other people were officers who could tell him what to do and land him in hot water if he didnt do it or if he wasnt around to do it what do you see in the guy anyhow mike pressed hes nothing but a dumb kid off the farm if he came from the states hed be a hayseed from arkansas or oklahoma or somewhere like that hed be a hardshell baptist too instead of a catholic chaims knowledge of arkansas and oklahoma was purely theoretical so was his knowledge of the differences between one brand of christianity and another catholics went to fancier churches and their bishops dressed the way rabbis would if rabbis were crazy faggots what more did you need to know thinking of rabbis reminded him of his brief fling with starting a shul just as kossuth had predicted he hadnt stuck with it now he had this new cause instead always something but never the same thing for very long besides he was sick of soldiering hed seen enough done enough lived through enough to have its measure if the internationals needed someone with a rifle to get up on a firing step and shoot at sanjurjos men the republican equivalent of a fellow like joaquin delgadillo would do chaim had discovered the joys of well of preaching if it was a smaller moment than the one st paul had on the road to damascus the difference was of degree not of kind he might have preached better with more fluent spanish but he might not have he had to keep his ideas simple and direct because he couldnt say anything fancy or highfalutin even staying simple he fumbled for words and verb endings joaquinand soon other nationalist prisoners whod started listening to him for no better reason than to pass the time of daythrew him a line whenever he needed one if anything that made him more effective his audience was and felt itself to be part of the show and changing mindswinning convertsturned out not to be that hard no matter how little h l mencken might have cared for the process chaim had a solid grounding in the doctrines of marx and lenin the men to whom he preached seemed to have no ideology at all well why did you keep fighting for sanjurjo then he asked a spaniard who wore a patch over his right eye socket he knew the fellow would have fought with desperate courage too the nationalists might serve a vile cause but they served it bravely why senor a spanish shrug was less comic more resigned than its french equivalent i was in the army we had an enemy what else was there to do but fight you were oppressed in other words thats why you fought chaim said no matter how lousy his spanish as a whole was he knew words like oppressed how do you get rid of oppression he answered his own question you have to struggle against it not for it but how senor the soldier asked if we didnt do what our officers told us they would have shot us and if we tried to come across the line chances are you republicans would have shot us it is a bad bargain it was a bad bargain the natives on the two sides hated each other too much for it to be anything else their higherups did anyhow ordinary soldiers sometimes had a more sympathetic understanding for the poor sorry bastards who filled out the ranks on the other side sometimes officers who oppress can have accidents chaim said officers who oppress ought to have accidents they deserve them the nationalists listened to him without surprise things like that had happened in every army since the egyptians went to war against the assyrians anybody who made his own men despise him needed eyes in the back of his head even those werent always enough to save him your real problem was you never wondered if sanjurjos officers had the right to give you orders chaim said who set them over you god he smiled crookedly they want you to think so who makes officers for the republicans joaquin asked mostly the men choose them we do in the abraham lincoln battalion chaim answered just about all the spanish republican units do the same thing he told the truthfor the most part sometimes the party wanted certain men in certain slots but the will of the party was the will of the people wasnt it the nationalist prisoners muttered among themselves finally one of them asked but what if these men make bad leaders then we get new ones chaim replied what if your officers make bad leaders none of the prisoners tried to give him an answer he and they all knew what the answer was if a nationalist officer made a bad leader his men were stuck with him most armies worked that way chaim pressed the advantage you see how much better the republican way is they didnt say no they werent in an ideal position to say no but chaim didnt let that worry him neither did his own superiors as mike had prophesied he got a summons from brigadier kossuth the magyar eyed him impassively so he said now you are a propagandist instead of a soldier no and a soldier chaim said wondering how much trouble he was in kossuths lizardy tongue flicked in and out soldiers we can always find he observed propagandists are harder to come by do you want to go on reeducating the nationalist prisoners that might be useful by which he could only mean youd better want to go on reeducating them since chaim did he answered if that would help the republic sure ill do it good we understand each other kossuth was dry as usual chaim wondered what would have happened to him had he said hed rather stay at the front nothing he would have enjoyed he was sure of that the brigadier seemed surprised to find him still standing there dismissed he said and chaim beat it moscow or barcelona might replace kossuth but an ordinary lug could only obey him maybe chaim wasnt so different from the nationalists who needed reeducating after all chapter moscow speaking the radio said importantly sergei yaroslavsky yawned as he listened he was drinking a glass of strong sweet tea and smoking a cigarette but it was still six in the morning had he had any choice he would have stayed rolled in his blanket a thick slab of roast pork glistening with fat at the edges sat on the tin plate in front of him had he had any choice he wouldnt have picked something like that for breakfast it would fill him up better than black bread he couldnt deny that but it would also make him want to go back to sleep wouldnt it he sawed away with knife and fork methodically he chewed and swallowed as soon as he got up in the air he wouldnt be sleepy any more he was sure of that sleep and terror blended like vodka and castor oil several flyers were fortifying their tea with healthy shots of vodka the ration was a hundred grams a day others were swigging the vodka and ignoring the tea sergei preferred not to do that you might be bolder in the cockpit once youd got outside with some antifreeze but youd surely be slower against german fighter planes against skilled sober german pilots slower wasnt a good idea the liberation of poland from the clutches of the semifascist smiglyridz clique and their nazi henchmen continues to gather momentum the newscaster declared advances on a broad front accelerate polish soldiers surrender in growing numbers recognizing the hopelessness of their cause and the justice behind the red armys struggle against the lawless hyenas who have led them to destruction he doesnt say anything about the fucking germans surrendering remarked a pilot who was knocking back vodka as if afraid it would be outlawed tomorrownot likely not in the harddrinking soviet union hush three people said at the same time the only good thing about fighting germans was that there werent many of them in poland as sergei had seen in czechoslovakia the wehrmacht and luftwaffe were dauntingly good at what they did the brief byplay made him miss the newsmans latest recital of towns taken and towns bombed from the air the voice on the radio might have been broadcasting a football match if he was he was definitely the home teams announcer if you listened to him you had to believe the red army and air force could do no wrong then he switched to a match in a different league the fascist occupation of denmark appears to be all but unchallenged the danes have chosen not even to fight if they hope for mercy from the nazi jackals they are doomed to disappointment combat does continue in norway england and france claim to be flooding men into the country to help the norwegians resist the hitlerite jackals oslo and the south however seem already to be in german hands whether counterattacks can be effective remains to be seen the fascists claim to have inflicted heavy losses on the royal navy he talked about the fighting in france there wasnt much then at last with the air of a prim matron discussing the facts of life he talked about the war in the far east he kept going on about how heavy the fighting there was across the table from sergei anastas mouradian raised an eyebrow yaroslavsky nodded back they didnt mean to speak speaking would have endangered them but heavy fighting was never good news sure enough the broadcaster went on highranking officers in the combat zone are no longer completely certain that vladivostoks resistance against the japanese brigands can continue indefinitely vladivostok would fall that was what he meant he didnt want to come right out and say soand who could blame him with the transsiberian railway cut the japanese were nipping off the ussrs main window on the pacific the only word for that was disaster not everybody would be able to understand exactly what the newsreader meant most people very likely would think vladivostok could still hold out for a long time even if not forever but why mention that it might fall if you werent getting ready to admit that it would fall or even that it had fallen he wanted to sigh with relief when the announcer shifted to the overfulfillment of the steel quota and then gave forth with the gory details of a train collision down in the ukraine one of the engineers is suspected of being drunk on the job the newsreader said portentously the general secretary of the communist party of the ussr finds this most unfortunate the fellow said no more about that nor did he need to if stalin didnt like it well anything could happen after that sergei had thought a program of prohibition impossible in his homeland the tsars had tried one during the last war and it failed miserablyrussians drank like swine but if stalin wanted to do the same thing who would stop him nobody the pilots whod already started drinking drank faster than ever maybe the stuff really would be outlawed tomorrow maybe but sergei still wouldnt believe it till he saw it molodetschna colonel borisov said we hit molodetschna again we have to keep the nazis from getting through and getting away anastas mouradian raised a hand frowning the squadron commander nodded his way comrade colonel is it not likely that as many germans as could get through the miserable place have already done it the armenian asked it was more than likely it was as near certain as made no difference theyd been pounding molodetschna since the war widened too many sbs had gone down in flames to bfs and the heavy concentration of antiaircraft guns around the place theyd watched panzers and infantry units entrain and head elsewhere colonel borisov had flown over molodetschna he knew what was and wasnt going on there tooor he should have but he also knew something else i have my orders mouradian he said heavily we have our orders we will carry them out is that clear i serve the soviet union mouradian said that was always the right answer ivan kuchkov also knew about the new orders maybe hed had a separate briefing from someone less exalted than the squadron leader or maybe being a sergeant hed found out about them before borisov or any of the other officers he wasnt worried about coming out with what he thought of things either only way the cunts dont fucking murder us is if they dont care about the place any more sergei set a hand on his shoulder its nice the way you try to cheer us up he said the squat muscular bombardier eyed him suspiciously the chimp was a stranger to irony and a hostile stranger at that the sb lumbered into the air sergei remembered how proud of his fighting bomber hed been while serving as a volunteer in czechoslovakia against the biplane fighters theyd seen in spain sbs were fine against the deadly german messerschmitts well they lumbered through the engines din mouradian said what if the red armys already taken molodetschna are we supposed to bomb our own men there was an interesting question it all but defined damned if you do and damned if you dont you could get shot for dropping bombs on your own side but you could also get shotyou could very easily get shotfor not following orders lets see what it looks like sergei said and left it there if he didnt have to make up his mind right now he wouldnt when he saw black puffs of smoke ahead he nodded to himself the germans still held the town soviet flak wouldnt have been anywhere near so intense yaroslavsky was a good patriot but he knew what his own people could and couldnt do nowwhere was the train station he had a devil of a time spotting it either red army artillery had set molodetschna ablaze or the nazis had fired the town on purpose to give themselves a smoke screen if he thought of it they could too and they were more than ruthless enough to do it once they thought of it there he pointed through the grayblack billows see it stas da mouradian said straight and slow if you please he shouted into the speaking tube to the bomb bay ready ivan ready the answer came back at once a burst too close for comfort jolted the plane sergei flew straight and slow all the same now mouradian yelled bombs whistled down sergei wrestled the sb around and started flying back to the motherland at full throttle he hadnt seen any german fighters this time he didnt miss them either and it wasnt as if he wouldnt see them againall too likely much sooner than he wanted to a french captain came up to vaclav jezek and started shouting and waving his arms whatever he had to say he was excited about it the czech with the antitank rifle understood not a word why the fellow started bothering him when he was trying to spoon up some mutton stew he looked around for sergeant halevy no sign of the jew though sorry but i dont speak your language vaclav said in what he hoped was french the captain went right on yelling and carrying on vaclav didnt know why he was all excited he also didnt care he just wanted the frenchman to leave him alone with a sudden evil grin he decided he knew exactly how to get what he wanted spreading his hands in apology he said entschuldigen sie mich herr hauptmann abe ich spreche franzosisch nicht sprechen sie deutsch vielleicht hed had to speak german to get a pole to understand him after the nazis overran his country he figured a frenchman would sooner cough up a lung than admit to knowing the enemys language which only went to show you never could tell the captain answered ach sie sprechen deutsch wunderbar ich kann es auch sprechen aber nicht so gut vaclav didnt care whether the frenchman couldnt speak german very well now that they had a language in common he had to pay attention to the son of a bitch resignedly he said what do you want with me sir to show just how interested he was he shoveled in another big spoonful of stew and made a point of chewing with his mouth open he didnt faze the captain the fellows patched faded uniform said hed seen some real action he wasnt a staff officer coming up to the front to make trouble he said you have been shooting german soldiers sharpshooting sniping on the third try he found the word he wanted jawohl herr hauptmann vaclav made his voice as sarcastic as he could the last i looked there was a war on yes yes the french captain said impatiently but the damned nazis have imported a sniper of their own i know that i potted the stinking pigdog by god now jezek sounded proud of himself and well he might have the german could have killed him too the bastard had been too goddamn good at what he did another one the frenchman said vaclav hadnt thought of that when youd gone and killed the dragon you could live happily ever after couldnt you at least for a little while maybe not evidently notthe captain went on another one without a doubt he put one through colonel laplaces head more than half a kilometer behind the line did he vaclav said tonelessly that was a good shot all right a very good shot if he was using a mauser it was a good riflea very good infantry rifle as far as accuracy went but it was only an infantry rifle not an elephant gun like the one vaclav lugged around he did the captain said in the how dare you question me tone french officers were so good at using and he bagged a captain and two lieutenants as well these past three days he likes officers you see he raised an eyebrow at vaclav i daresay he would like you too i believe he is here because you have annoyed the boches to such a degree boches stuck out in the middle of his slow pausefilled german but vaclav couldnt very well pretend he didnt get it the captains eyebrow lifted again since you have caused the problem so to speak it is up to you to solve it danke sehr herr hauptmann thanks a bunch bitte schon youre very welcome god scorch him black as a potato forgotten in the oven the captain could be sarcastic too i expect you to deal with the problem one way or another what that meant was unmistakable too if vaclav punctured the new nazi sniper that would be all right and if the german put one through his head at better than half a kilometer the shitheel would likely be satisfied and go torment some different stretch of the front for a while that would also content the captain and the people who were telling him what to do if it was hard luck for one vaclav jezek well who cared about a lousy czech corporal who insisted on hanging on to an obsolete rifle with a last nod the captain loped away benjamin halevy chose that moment to show up vaclav unleashed a torrent of the nastiest czech he knew halevy heard him out later vaclav wondered whether he would have shown so much patience for the jew when he finally ran down halevy said be careful if they did send a second man after you hell be better than the first one was yes i worked that out for myself thanks vaclav said bitterly i could do without the honor you know i didnt do it halevy said i didnt even ask the frenchman if he spoke german oh fuck off vaclav snarled how was i supposed to know the cocksucker really would chance you take the jewish noncom said maybe he was going to be a scientist or a historian before the army got him the trade vaclav proposed for the captain would not have required any knowledge of german benjamin halevy only laughed vaclav started hunting again he didnt poke his head up at any place hed used lately he didnt know just when this new german hotshot had got here if the german had any brains he would have scouted the area before he started sniping and while germans had all kinds of noxious deficiencies youd regret it in a hurry if you figured them for stupid he carried an ordinary piece when he did his scouting not the antitank rifle he also wore a french adrian helmet instead of his czech model the czech helmet was of better thicker steel but neither mark would keep out a bullet and not looking like a czech sniper counted in case the nazi with the scopesighted mauser happened to notice him the nazi was doing his job the french captain came back complaining in uvular german about two more officers struck down why have you not shot him the captain demanded because i havent seen him yet vaclav made as if to thrust the antitank rifle at the frenchman if you are so hot to kill him herr hauptmann here is the weapon to do it with you are the specialist it is for you to take care of the captain walked away he might have been an apartment dweller complaining that a plumber hadnt made his sink quit backing up vaclav said something in czech the captain assuredly wouldnt understand he was a military plumber dammit unless the germans swarmed forward again with tanks which didnt look likely he had to find some other use for his big ugly gun can i do something to help benjamin halevy asked sure put on a french majors uniform and walk around where the asshole can see you vaclav answered only trouble is you wont be able to keep at it very long he knows what hes doing damn him hes a german halevy said morosely well if you get any bright ideas let me know all right brightest idea ive got is to shack up with a french broad with big jugs and about ten liters of cognac vaclav said the jew snorted after a moment so did vaclav well you asked he pointed out tell you what halevy said nail that german and ill see that the frenchmen give you a free one at an officers brothel and all you can drink hows that better than anything else im likely to get jezek answered halevy snorted again and clapped him on the back the next morning still wearing the adrian helmet vaclav put his czech pot on the end of a stick and held it up above the edge of the trench he was traveling a shot rang out from the german lines the helmet rang and spun two neat mm holes pierced it six or eight centimeters from the top holy jesus vaclav said hed wear the crested french helmet from now on nowexactly where had that shot come from and was the german sniper enough of a creature of habit to visit that place again the last fellow had been and it cost him this guy time would tell vaclav resolved not to check from right here though one other question crossed his mind if hed get himself a throw with a fancy whore and all he could drink for punching the enemy snipers ticket what did the nazi bastard stand to win by eliminating him heinz naumann grunted in what might as easily have been satisfaction or annoyance his bare arms were greasy to the elbow theo hossbach would have rolled up the sleeves on his coveralls to mess around inside the engine compartment too the panzer commander held up a wrench in triumph there he said goddamn carb wont give us any more trouble till the next time adi stoss put in naumann glared oh lord theyre going to bite pieces off each other again theo thought sure as hell naumann said yeah well i didnt see you fix it herr doktor professor mechanical genius its a piece of crap stoss answered nobodys going to fix it so it stays fixed we just have to keep the valves clean and to clean em out when they clog up in spite of us he was right which made naumann no happier theo wished he could get between them and stop them from rubbing on each other so roughly but that wasnt his way when people locked horns he didnt try to separate them he backed away and watched them in something not far from horror well anyway the old beast will keep running a while longer heinz said to theos relief adi seemed willing to leave that alone other panzer crews also tinkered with their machines if you didnt tinker with your panzer whenever you could it would break down when you needed it most more often than not you wouldnt get the chance to tinker with it after that somebody would plant you where youd fallen with a fence picket to mark the grave you wouldnt even get a helmet on top of the picket the way a dead infantryman would a hooded crow black and gray hopped up to theo looking for a handout the birds were beggars but they werent so thieving as their smaller jackdaw cousins theo tore off a bit of black bread and tossed it to the crow the bird seized the prize in its strong bill and flew off toward the closest tree to eat it now youll have twenty of them scrounging from you heinz said lousy things are as bad as the packs of jew beggars we get around here they even dress like em he laughed at his own wit he wasnt so far wrong either the jews who filled a lot of villages in these parts did mostly wear black with lighter shirts and blouses for relief laughing again naumann added bills are about the same too theo also laughed nervously the way things were these days you took a chance if you didnt laugh when somebody made fun of jews he got paid to take chances against the reichs enemies nobody gave him a pfennig to take chances against his own side adi stoss chuckled too where i come from the crows are black all over he said they dont have the gray hoods they grow here so theyre niggers instead of kikes huh heinz said only matters to the lady crows i guess one of these days sergeant youll open your mouth so wide youll fall right in stoss said whats that supposed to mean naumann tossed the wrench in the air and caught it in his callused hand you want to make something of it that went too far for even theo to takethe more so since he was sure adi wouldnt back down enough both of you the radioman said naumann and stoss both looked at him in surprise as they did whenever he spoke up he went on havent we got enough to worry about with the ivans neither crewmate answered that what could you say off in the distance a russian machine gun stammered out death another gun replied a moment later theo cocked his head listening that one sounded french which meant it had to belong to the poles they made some of their own stuff but scrounged the rest from whoever was selling on any given tuesday our allies heinz said scornfully so hed also figured out to whom the second machine gun belonged would you rather fight them along with the russians stoss asked what id rather private is that you keep your big mouth shut naumann snapped so try it hey stoss didnt say another word but if that wasnt murder in his eyes theo had never seen it a panzer crew was supposed to work together theory was wonderful this particular crew had as many clogs and hitches as the muchmaligned carburetor the company commander was a bright young first lieutenant named schmidt the captain who had been in charge went up in flames with his panzer ii there wasnt enough of him left to bury with or without a helmet over his grave schmidt was trying his best to do a good job he came around every evening as the captain had before him alles gut he asked jawohl herr oberleutnant heinz answered carb is working the way its supposed to again he said nothing about whether the crew was working the way it was supposed to maybe he didnt even worry about it from his perspective from a commanders perspective adi might have been no more than a bit of grit in the works he might have been but theo didnt believe it for a minute well all right schmidt said the push southwest goes on tomorrow if everything works the way its supposed to well link up with more wehrmacht units in the afternoon they arent far away thats good sir heinz said theo found himself nodding he saw adalbert stoss doing the same thing theyd wedged their way through the swarming russians this long maybe they wouldnt have to do it any more maybe thered be a real front again soon the red army wasnt as good at blitzkrieg as the wehrmacht all the same being on the wrong end of it wasnt much fun all right lieutenant schmidt repeated we move at dawnthe sooner we give the reds one in the teeth the better for us he ambled off to talk to the next panzers crew dawn came later than it would have a month before summer was going autumn on the way what would winter be like around here worse than the last one in the low countries and francetheo was sure of that he ducked down into the back of the panzer with relief on the move the crew would talk about business and that would be that the radio net was full of traffic some of it was in unintelligible polish and russian but most came from the germans moving south to cut off the russians whod moved west to cut off the germans moving north to cut off the earlier wave of russians moving west war could get complicated down in what was now independent slovakia more german divisions were on the move these heading north into poland had they been attacking the poles the country would have fallen in a couple of weeks but the poles were germanys friends for the moment the first hint theo had that things werent going perfectly was the machinegun bullets slamming into the panzer iis armored side panzer halt heinz shouted adi hit the brakes heinz traversed the turret and fired a long burst from the machine gun and several rounds from the mm cannon thatll shift the red arselicks he said go on now the panzer clanked forward again despite the earphones theo heard more gunfire outside a rifle round smacked the panzer theo tensed anything bigger than a rifle round would punch right through hed bailed out of one burning machine that was why he had nine and a half fingers now he didnt want to find out what hed be missing if he had to do it again naumann stuck his head and shoulders out of the turret without a decent cupola you needed to do that every so often if you wanted to know what was going on french turrets had proper cupolas so did panzer iiis for that matter so did the very latest panzer iis but not this one naumann let out a sound halfway between grunt and groan he slumped back into the turret theo needed no more than a heartbeat to realize he was dead the twin stinks of blood and shit told the story even before the radioman saw the redgray ruin that had been the side of the panzer commanders head he ripped off the earphones and tried to get naumanns corpse out of the way so he could serve the cannon and machine gun himself like it or not he had to command the panzer now heinz caught one he shouted into the speaking tube up to the drivers compartment scheisse adalbert stoss said bad dead theo answered succinctly well youre it then adi said tell me what to do just keep going for now theo said before long hed have to stick his head out of the blooddripping hatch that was part of what a panzer commander did heinz was still bleeding onto the floor of the fighting compartment that had nothing to do with anything either absently he wondered what the new commander would be like he also wondered whether theyd ever be able to wash out the inside of the panzer ii then he wondered if hed live long enough to find out about either of the other two doing his job was the best way to make the answer to that yes the best way surebut no guarantee hansulrich rudel soon discovered wearing the ritterkreuz at his throat changed his life very little oh some jackass reporters from the propaganda ministry talked with him about panzerbusting with a stuka a photographer snapped his picture with the knights cross but that was about it the reporters and photographer couldnt very well fly with him and when he was airborne he had only two concerns finishing the mission and getting home in one piece we could take em along under the wings sergeant dieselhorst suggested we drop em on the frogs or the tommies theyll make bigger booms than a thousandkilo bomb in spite of himself rudel laughed they would wouldnt they theyre nothing but a bunch of blowhards so of course theyll be blowuphards damn straight dieselhorst said what i wonder is how come they arent in real uniforms instead of their fancy ones theyve got to have connections otherwise theyd need to work for a living like honest people theyll go back to berlin and drink like fish and screw like theres no tomorrowyou wait and youll stay here and drink like a fish and screw like theres no tomorrow hansulrich saidwith he hoped not too much reproof in his voice he didnt take his fun that way but he didnt want to come down on his rear gunner dieselhorst was much more inclined to worry about this world than his hope of the next one the sergeant grinned more fun than anything else i can think of you ought to try it yourself once so you know what youre missing the rest of the time no thanks hansulrich said ill leave you alone if you do the same for me yes sir dieselhorst said but then he clucked in mock reproof if countries behaved like that we wouldnt have any wars any more and then where would the likes of us wind up flying for a carnival i suppose or else lufthansa rudel answered once i got up into the air i knew nobodyd be able to keep me on the ground any more how about you i worked in a radio studio thats what i told them when i joined up which is why i look backwards all the time now dieselhorst chuckled as he lit a cigarette i didnt tell em i just swept up they probably would have dropped me on the frenchies if i had i wont squeal hansulrich promised solemnly the sergeant blew out a cloud of smoke doesnt matter any more i actually know what im doing by this time they went up again the next morning hansulrich wrenched back hard on the stick to yank the stuka into the air lugging those twin mm guns under the wings it really was a lumbering beast well it wasnt supposed to dogfight spitfires and a good thing too it was supposed to smash up enemy panzers it could do that if nobody shot it down on the way rudel peered from the cockpit looking for concentrations of french or british armor when he was diving he had a fine view in level flight trying to peer around the long junkers jumo engine was a pain in the posterior sergeant dieselhorst could see a lot more than he could but dieselhorst had other things besides enemy panzers to worry about a yell of alarm came out of the speaking tube fucking fighter on our tail the rearfacing machine gun chattered fiery tracers spat past the stuka hansulrich mashed the throttle he might be flying a spavined old cart horse but hed give it all he had anyway the fighter zoomed past him all the same and pulled up for another run it wasnt a particularly modern plane a french d it was a monoplane yes but it had fixed landing gear like the stuka and an open cockpit which the stuka didnt it carried two machine guns and a mm cannon firing through the hollow propeller hub without his own heavy armament slowing him down he could have outrun the dewoitine had he had a choice he would have with the panzerbusting guns he not only didnt have a choice he didnt have a prayer hed have to fight it out up here unless he could scare that frenchman off and the fellow wouldnt have become a fighter pilot if he scared easily sure as the devil here he came straight down the stukas throat his machine guns winked a couple of bullets clanged into the ju the beast could take a beating it kept flying as well as ever anyhow the cannon fired its big round missed hansulrich thanked heavennobody could take many hits from anything heavier than a riflecaliber gun that thought was part of what made him fire both mm cannon at the d scaring the enemy off was the other part if you saw those big blasts of fire from the underwing guns when you werent expecting them if a couple of great honking shells roared past you you wouldnt need to be very cowardly to have sudden second thoughts and if one of those great honking shells tore off half your right wing youd go into a flat spin and spiral down toward the ground without a prayer of getting out of your plane even if you didnt have to wrestle with a cockpit canopy hansulrich didnt see a parachute canopy open he did see a column of black smoke jet up from where the d went in he yelled so loud sergeant dieselhorst asked you all right if a certain anxiety rode his voice who could blame him he had no controls back there and he couldnt have seen where he was going even if he did if one of those french bullets had nailed his pilot his only hope was to hit the silk right now im fine rudel answered do you know what i just did dieselhorst was quick on the uptake but still sounded disbelieving as he said dont tell me you shot that motherfucker down i did hansulrich sounded surprised even to himself well why not he was surprised not to put too fine a point on it he was astonished now where are those panzers whatll you do if we run into more fighters dieselhorst asked get away if i can hansulrich said which seemed to satisfy the sergeant for he asked no more questions a column of french machines crawling up the road toward the front sent him stooping on them like a hawk on a column of mice he blasted the lead panzer first then climbed again to dive on the others they went off the road to try to get away but he still killed two more before the rest got under some trees now we go back he told dieselhorst sounds good to me sir the rear gunner said i radioed what you did to the french fighter by the way the clowns carried on you mightve got yourself a knights cross for that if you didnt already have one shooting down a fighters not worth a ritterkreuz hansulrich exclaimed it is if you do it in a stuka dieselhorst replied these things are made to get shot down not to do the shooting theyre made to hit things on the ground theyre made to get hit and keep flying hansulrich knocked the side of his head in lieu of wood the engine sounded fine none of the dials showed him losing fuel or oil or water the ugly bird could take it all right he flew back toward the airstrip chapter a newsboy hawked papers on a corner sarah goldman got a look at the big headline as he waved a copy germany rescues poland from russian hordes paper get your paper the kid shrilled then he saw the yellow star on her blouse his lip curled oh like youd care she wanted to kick the little monster only the certainty that it wouldnt do any good and would get her into more trouble than she was likely to be able to get out of made her walk on and what really infuriated her was that the little prick was wrong wrong wrong for all she knew her brother was in the middle of the fighting there if saul wasnt he was in france or maybe scandinavia wherever he was sarah hoped he was all right the goldmans had got that one letter from himactually the neighbors across the street had got it and had the sense and kindness to know for whom it was really intended then not another word saul wasnt a thinker like their father but he had the sense to realize anything connecting him to his family was dangerous to him and to them she wondered how the poles felt about being rescued by germany better than they would have if the russians had overrun them she supposed otherwise marshal smiglyridz never would have asked the fuhrer to pull his chestnuts out of the fire for him and just because troops marched in as rescuers that didnt necessarily mean theyd march out again so readily poland was almost as offensive to the german sense of how the map of europe ought to look as czechoslovakia was or rather had been hitler was doing everything he could to get the map to look the way he wanted it to her mouth twisted hitler was doing everything he could to get everything to look the way he wanted it to why else would she be wearing the star that said jew in big hebraiclooking letters because she wanted to not likely no more than she wanted to go out shopping just before the stores closed when most of them were sold outif theyd had anything to begin with but the nazis did as they pleased with and to germanys jews plenty of germans were decent even kindas individuals did they protest the governments laws and policies sarahs mouth twisted again anyone rash enough to try found out for himself what dachau was like a tram rattled past not so long ago shed ridden it when she needed to get around munster no more it was verboten for jews if you had to walk home with a heavy sack weighing you down that was your hard luck for picking the wrong grandparents sarah snorted softly even converts people as christian as their aryan neighbors got it in the neck as far as the nazis were concerned people like that remained jews even if they went to church a lot of them had converted to escape such harassment well much good that did them she walked on a car went by the man driving it wore a black suit and a homburg so he was probably a doctor doctors were about the only civilians who could still get gasoline the authorities had harvested the tires and batteries from most cars she didnt know where those batteries and that rubber had gone but straight into the military was a pretty good guess a crew of men in the uniforms of the organization todt were going through the ruins of a building mashed by a british bomb one of them pulled out a copper pot and a length of lead pipe his comrades pounded his back as if hed just taken a pillbox on the western front scrap metal was precious these days how are we supposed to fight a war if we have to scrounge like this sarah wondered then she wondered why she still thought of germany and germans as we they didnt think of her like that if they had she would have been worrying about her father at the front along with her brother well samuel goldman had been a genuine german patriot hed proved as much with his blood during the last war and that helped him now maybe a little more than converting to catholicism had helped the christians of jewish ancestry the discrimination laws didnt come down quite so hard on the families of wounded and decorated veterans as they did on the rest of jewry that sarah had heard was one of hindenburgs last protests after hitler became chancellor here was the grocery she checked her handbag to make sure she had the ration coupons theyd tightened up on everything since the twofront war got serious even potatoes and turnips were on the list these days when germany ran short of potatoes she was fighting a twofront war the stories older people told about what things were like at home from to made her glad she hadnt lived through those times herself the grocery store had garbage it didnt have much garbage either aryan shoppers had already picked over whatever was there earlier sarah only sighed it wasnt as if shed expected anything different this was what life for jews was like in the third reich she filled her stringbag with what she could then waited for the grocer to finish with a couple of customers who didnt wear the yellow star another german woman came in while she was shopping this one saw her star and pushed ahead as the law said aryans were entitled to do sarah said nothing if she fumed she tried not to let it show some germans could be personally kind to jews not all though there wouldnt have been laws like these if all germans felt kindly toward jews she parted with reichsmarks and ration coupons then went across the street to the bakers isidor bruck stood behind the counter the bakery being a jewishowned enterprise had even less than the grocers shop but isidors smile lit up the bare little room sarah he said how are you still here she answered she wanted to tell him that all the nazis and at least half the german people could go straight to the devil she wanted to but she didnt even though theyd gone walking together he might sell her down the river to the gestapo if she left herself open like that she didnt care for thinking such thoughts about someone who she was sure liked her care for it or not think them she did that was one of the reichs worst evils as far as she was concerned it made you suspect everyone because that was the only chance you had to keep yourself safe which only made her feel the more ashamed when he reached under the counter and took out a fine loaf of war bread it was still black but it was nice and plump i saved this for you he said i was hoping youd come in today you shouldnt have isidor she exclaimed meaning not a word of it i only wish i didnt have to take coupons for it but he spread his hands as if to say what can you do you know how things are they watch us double close because were jews if the flour we use doesnt match up with the ration coupons we take in well he spread his hands again wider this time it wouldnt be so good thats all i bet it wouldnt sarah said but couldnt you tell them you burned some loaves and couldnt sell them theyd say we had to unload them anyhow isidor answered after all we just sell to jews why should jews care if their bread tastes like charcoal they should thank god they have any bread at all he trusted her enough to speak his mind of course someone trying to lure her into an indiscretion might do the same thing if he was the gestapos creature hed have a long leash he might be hoping shed say something about saul and sink her whole family or he might be a bakers son who was sweet on her and trusted her further than she trusted him if he was that only made her more ashamed of her caution than she would have been otherwise she paid for the fine fat loaf she handed over the necessary coupons isidor solemnly wrote her a receipt then he asked shall we go walking at the zoo again one day before too long sure sarah answered how could she say no when hed set aside the bread like that but she would have said yes even without such considerations he might be a bakers son but he was nice enough or more than nice enough she would have turned up her nose at him in easier times because of what his father did well times werent easy and so she was getting to know him after all now if he could be trusted if anyone she hadnt known her whole life could be trusted she snatched up the bread and fled the bakery isidor probably wondered if she was losing her mind or maybe he understood all too well and wouldnt that be the worst thing of all harcourt that malignant rasp could come from only one smokecured throat yes sergeant luc might be a corporal but in front of sergeant demange he suddenly felt like a recruit fresh out of training againand a recruit who feared hed face a courtmartial in the next few minutes demange paused to stamp out a small butt and light a fresh gitane which took the place of the one hed just extinguished howd you like to do something different if my girlfriend said that i might be interested luc answered which won him a snort from the sergeant but he had to say more than that no matter how little he wanted to what have you got in mind howd you like to head up a machinegun crew demange asked bordagaray came down venereal the stupid slob maybe he knows your girlfriend too or your mother luc suggested which got him another snort then he paused thoughtfully it was a better choice than demange was in the habit of offering him you know that might not be so bad but wholl take my squad any jackass can run a squad i mean you do for christs sake demange said luc grinned crookedly the sergeant loved to praise with faint damn or sometimes not so faint demange took a deep drag coughed and went on so do you want it its yours if you do sure ill take it luc said the army rule was not to volunteer but this was different he hoped so anyhow you could kill a lot of boches with a machine gun of course they also got especially interested in killing you if they overran your position you wouldnt have much chance to surrender but they hadnt been interested in advancing lately so that wouldnt come into play he hoped bordagarays gun you said thats right sergeant demange nodded joinville and villehardouin are waiting for you like youre the second coming id like a second coming right now or even a first one luc said demange gave him an obscene gesture to speed him on his way he walked down the trench to the sandbagged revetment that held the machine gun the other two crewmen eyed him with the apprehensive curiosity veterans gave any newcomer joinville was a short dark gascon like the disgraced bordagaray villehardouin by contrast came from brittany he was big and blond and understood french better than he spoke the national language unless he thought about it ahead of time breton came out of his mouth more often than not luc hadnt had much to do with machine guns since training but he remembered how to use one it wasnt heart surgery you aimed it you fired it you tapped the side of the gun to traverse it and you tried to use short bursts his instructorwho would have reminded him of demange if the fellow hadnt been half again as bighad had some eloquent things to say about that it was a hotchkiss a serious machine gun not the lighter chatellerault one man could carry a chatellerault and move forward with an attack one man could serve it too though a twoman crew worked better the hotchkiss gun had soldiered all the way through the last war and looked to be good for this one and maybe the next one as well the thick doughnutshaped iron fins on the heavy barrel dissipated heatsometimes they glowed red when the work got roughand let you keep laying down death as long as you needed to there was a story about a hotchkiss section at verdun in a place far worse than any dante imaginedthat fired rounds at the boches with nothing worse than a few minor jams somebody must have lived through it to let the story spread hundreds of thousands in old french horizonblue and german fieldgray hadnt how are we fixed for ammunition luc asked joinvillehis christian name was pierrenudged a couple of wooden crates with his foot both full he said he had a funny accent himself though nowhere near so bad as villehardouins and his voice held a certain measured approval luc knew the right question to ask first he nodded now cest bon he agreed and good it was you fed an aluminum strip full of cartridges into the gun chambered the first round fired till the strip ran dry then put in another one no nothing to it except that you were liable to get killed doing your job of course but once they made you put on the uniform that could happen to you all kinds of ways luc took the canteen off his belt and tossed it to joinville have a knock of this he said then pass it to tiny the gascon sipped the nonregulation brandy he whistled respectfully thats highoctane all right he said and gave villehardouin the canteen the burly blondtagged as soldiers often were on the system of oppositesalso drank he said something that wasnt french but definitely was admiring when he handed the canteen back to luc it felt lighter than it had before he turned it loose cost of doing business luc thought not much put out you wanted the guys you worked with to like you you especially wanted them to like you when they could help keep you alive pierre might have thought hed get to command the hotchkiss gun himself now that bordagaray was on the shelf if he tried to undercut luc he might be able to pull it off yet anything i need to know about this particular gun luc asked if you ever get the chance you ought to boresight it joinville said till you can dont trust the sights too far if you do youll end up missing to the right got you thanks luc said the sights were less important than they were on a rifle because the hotchkiss gave you so many more chances still that was worth knowing another relevant question german snipers give you much trouble the boches knew what was what theyd knock off machinegun crews in preference to ordinary rifleman who wouldnt were still here joinville answered he said something incomprehensible to tiny the breton nodded vigorously luc scratched his head had pierre picked up some of the big peasants language that was interesting most frenchmen luc among them put breton only a short step above the barking of dogs and the mooing of cows well he could wonder about it some other time for now he peered out through a gap between sandbags at the german lines a few hundred meters not much to see sure as hell the germans did know their business they werent dumb enough to show themselves when they didnt have to hed been worrying about boche snipers the boys in feldgrau would worry about men peering through scopesighted rifles from under the brims of adrian helmets i wouldnt mind if it stays quiet luc remarked joinville eyed him you may turn out all right he said i was afraid youd want to shoot at every sparrow you saw some new guys are like that and it just brings shit down on our heads i may be a new guy on a machine gun but ive been in since before the fighting started luc said if i havent figured out the price of eggs by now im pretty fucked up eh you never can tell joinvilles grin took most of the sting from the words and tiny villehardouin brightened hed heard a french word he understood fuck your mother he said cheerfully yeah well same to you buddy luc replied he didnt think tiny would try to murder him for that when he turned out to be right he breathed a small sigh of relief you didnt want to fight a guy that size without a lot of friends at your back tiny threw back his head and laughed luc glanced over at pierre joinville the gascon gave back a small discreet nod as if to say villehardouin was like that all the time luc shrugged with he hoped equal discretion then something else occurred to him he asked villehardouin you know the commands right ah oui tiny said shoulder tripod carry gun advance lower weapon he looked proud of his linguistic prowess luc glanced at pierre joinville again this time joinville looked elaborately innocent the gun weighed twentyfive kilos the tripod had to be a couple of kilos heavier yet tiny was anything but still to burden one man with both seemed excessive thats how corporal bordagaray did it joinville said me i lugged cartridges which meant the former gun commander hadnt carried anything heavy rank did have its privileges did it have so many well i dont think were going anywhere any time soon luc said well see how we handle things when we do tiny didnt follow a word of that joinvilles nod said he figured luc would do things the way bordagaray always had luc wouldnt have to work hard if he did well see luc thought again movie theaters in shanghai were well different was the first word that came to pete mcgills mind you could watch a flick in english or french or german or russian or chinese or japanese pete had no interest in films in anything except english but he noticed the other places the way a man happy with his woman which the marine sure was at the moment will notice others he doesnt intend to do anything about them but theyre there all right the ones that catered to japanese soldiers in and around shanghai or on leave in town amused him most he couldnt read word one of the squiggles the japs wrote with but the posters at those joints always seemed more hysterical than any of the others the colors were brighter the action more fervid the actors and actresses faces more melodramatically contorted from across the street he nodded towards one of them he wasnt showy about it he didnt want the tough little men in yellowish khaki who were buying tickets to notice him but his buddies got the message id almost like to see what that ones about it looks exciting yeah well how come you dont walk over and put down your ten cents mex herman szulc said you can sit with all the lousy slanteyed sonsabitches boy i bet youd see all kinds of stuff you never saw before pooch puccinelli laughed starting with stars then youd see their boots when they stomped the living shit out of you cut me some slack okay pete said irritably i said almost didnt i you couldnt pay me enough to sit down with a bunch of japs szulc said i had my druthers only way id ever look at em was over the sights of a springfield you can sing that in church pooch agreed day is coming too soon as those mothers finish off the reds theyll jump on our asses next one guy might get away with it pete said theyd think he was crazy or something and leave him alone or theyd figure their own brass knew he was there and theyd get in dutch if they worked out on him my ass szulc said succinctly i wouldnt go over there for a hundred bucks me neither puccinelli said that put things in a different light pete had drunk a couple of beers but he wasnt remotely bombed he didnt think so anyhow but what came out of his mouth was i wouldif you clowns got a hundred apiece i come out in one piece you pay up yeah what happens if you dont szulc said what do we tell the officers then tell em i died for my country the words sounded grand then pete realized he might have meant them literally killedfor a movie nah he thought for two hundred bucks maybe hed get lucky maybe szulc and puccinelli wouldnt have a hundred apiece or two hundred between them they put their heads together pooch laughed it wasnt what youd call a pleasant sound he stuck out his hand so did herman szulc youre on charlie the big polack said if pete didnt cross the street now hed never be able to hold up his head again he shook hands with the other two leathernecks vera would think he was nuts too if this went wrong hed never find out what vera thought about it or anything else hed never feel her nipple stiffen under his lips or her tongue teasing the bottom of his he stepped out into the street to keep from thinking about stuff like that brakes screeched a furious horn blared a taxi driver shook his fist a car could mash you even better than the japs well faster pete advanced again he made it to the other side without getting run over was that good news or bad hed find out pretty damn quick the japanese soldiers gaped at him as he took a place in their queue he towered over most of them though they did have a few guys large even by american standards one of them said something he didnt get it had to mean what the hell are you doing here though pete spread his hands and smiled and bowed they liked it when you bowed take it easy pal he said in english i just want to watch the movie he pointed to himself then to one of the lurid posters something astonished burst from the jap if that wasnt oh yeah pete had never heard anything that was he nodded and bowed again doing his best to show he didnt want any trouble if the foreign soldiers decided they wanted to theyd mop the floor with him and that would be that boy would it ever they batted it back and forth among themselves the way he and herman and pooch had on the far side of the street the other americans stood there watching if the japs jumped on him right now theyd both run over here to try and help and theyd get creamed too if any of them lived theyd really thank him for that but then the japs started to laugh one of them thumped him on the back another grabbed his hand and shook it they led him up to the ticketseller a chunky guy who looked like a sergeant laid a coin on the counter for himthey wouldnt even let him pay all he could do was bow his thanks that got him pounded some more but in a friendly way once he got inside somebody bought him a snacktea without sugar and some salty little crackers that werent too bad even if they did have a funny aftertaste they escorted him to the best seat in the movie house good show said one who knew a little english good showyou see thanks hope so pete figured his best chance was to act like a happy moron theyd think he was squirrely or at least harmless he grinned till the top half of his head threatened to fall off down went the lights the projector whirred as in american theaters a newsreel came first japanese soldiers escorted russian prisoners through pine woods the men around pete howled cheers the camera focused on a downed bomber a big soviet star on the crumpled tail more cheers the narration was just gibberish to pete but it had to mean something like were knocking the snot out of the reds the scene shifted now japanese soldiers and little tanks moved across an obviously chinese landscape an aerial shot showed bombs dropping from a plane onto a chinese city more excited narrationwere kicking the crap out of the chinks too the soldiers in the theater ate it up one of them lit a cigarette and handed it to him after the newsreel the feature everybody wore samurai clothes the haircuts and the armor looked ridiculous to pete he understood no more of the dialogue than he had of the newsreel narration after about fifteen minutes he realized it didnt matter one goddamn bit give them tengallon hats and sixshooters instead of helmets and swords and it would have been a western back home at the bijou there was the villain a fat middleaged guy with a mustache who wanted to run thingsa fourflushing ham he had the hots for the heroine by now pete had seen enough oriental women to know she was plenty cute if hed had any doubts the japs reactions to her would have straightened him out in a hurry but she had eyes only for the hero the young sheriffum samuraiwho rode in to clean up the place he did too the climactic swordfight was more exciting than a gun battle would have been the villain lost his head at the end even if you didnt see it bounce from his shoulders and boy and girl would would live happily ever after what more could you want from a movie everybody looked at pete when the lights came up good show he said with a big nodand damned if he didnt mean it too real good show the jap who knew scraps of english translated for his buddies they all clapped the biggest trouble he had was getting away from them they wanted to take him drinking but he pointed to herman and pooch when they got outside the other marines were still waiting all right he would have been astonished if they hadnt been he made the japanese soldiers understand he had to get back to his buddies they reluctantly let him go he was more careful crossing the street than he had been when he headed for the theater for one thing hed had a couple of hours to sober up for another szulc and puccinelli owed him a cnote apiece of course you watched yourself better when you knew you had some cash coming in russian bombers didnt come over the japanese positions astride the transsiberian railroad so often any more hideki fujita didnt miss them a bit but the reds hadnt quit even if newsreel cameras made things here look easy russian artillery remained a force to reckon with fujita had seen in mongolia that the red army had more guns bigger guns and longerrange guns than his own side used hed hoped things in siberia would be different the difference between what you hoped for and what you got was life or if you werent so lucky death japanese bombers kept going after the red army artillery but the only thing the russians were better at than building big guns was hiding them the russians were masters of every kind of camouflage there was they were hairy like animals so of course they were good at hiding like animals that was what japanese soldiers said it sure made sense to fujita every so often higherups who lived safely distant from the front sent raiding parties through the russian lines to try to do what the bombers couldnt the big russian guns went right on tormenting the japanese if any of the raiders made it back to their own lines fujita hadnt heard about it that might not prove anything on the other hand it might russian gunners had come up with a deadly new trick too theyd started fusing some of their shells with maximum sensitivity as soon as a shell brushed a tree brancheven a twigit went off and rained deadly fragments on the japanese soldiers huddled below fujita wanted to kill the bastard whod had that bright idea too many japanese were dead or maimed on account of him like a lot of other soldiers fujita had dug a recess into the front wall of his foxhole he balled himself up to huddle in it that wasnt very heroic but hed seen enough fighting to know heroism was overrated what good was a dead hero as much as any other sixty kilos of rotting meat and not a gram more staying out and exposing yourself to artillery fragments wasnt heroic either not so far as he could see it was just stupid but spending too much time in that recess was stupid too the russians sometimes followed up those tree bursts with infantry attacks of their own a red army man who came upon you when you were all rolled up like a sowbug would probably laugh his ass off while he shot you but shoot you he would japanese soldiers grumbled about the way things were going their bombers couldnt find the russian guns and their own cannon didnt have the range to respond to them let alone knock them out we have to be careful not to complain too loudly superior private hayashi said in the middle of one gripe session what why corporal masanori kawakami was always looking for excuses to put hayashi down that was what superiors in the army did withdid towhenever they could and kawakami was also bound to fear hayashi could fill his place better than he could himself not only that he was liable to be right please excuse me corporalsan hayashi said sounding lowly as a worm he knew what was wrong with kawakami all right but if the officers hear us saying how much trouble the russian guns are what will they do send us out to silence them neh corporal kawakami grunted that seemed much too likely the corporal stabbed out a blunt forefinger you afraid to die for your country no corporalsan hayashi shook his head fujita believed himhed proved he made a good enough soldier after a moment he went on id rather give my life where it means something though not throw it away like a scrap of waste paper what chance have we got of sneaking ten or fifteen kilometers behind the front knocking out the guns and coming back in one piece kawakami grunted again if he said they had a good chance all of his underlings would have known he was a liar so would sergeant fujita whod already started having nightmares about that kind of raid officers might order it some of them might even go along that didnt mean theyor the enlisted men they ledwould see their foxholes again the only trouble was officers could get ideas even without enlisted men giving them away the officers at the front enjoyed those tree bursts no more than did the soldiers they led a captain in a battalion a few hundred meters away lost his manhood to a shell fragment like anybody else fujita knew such disasters could happen men spoke of them only in whispers though even thinking about that one made fujita want to cup his hands in front of his crotch but how much good would that do if your number was up wouldnt you just lose some fingers along with your cock a whole platoonfujita only thanked heaven it wasnt hiswent forth to infiltrate the soviet positions and do something about those damned guns none of the japanese soldiers came back the russian guns kept flaying the men in the forward positions worst of all nobody seemed much surprised after it became obvious that the platoon was sacrificed on the altar of a god who didnt care superior private hayashi came up to fujita and said may i please speak with you sergeantsan by the way he kept his voice down and looked around after he spoke he wanted no one overhearing him nan desuka fujita asked his own voice carefully neutral ill tell you what it is sergeantsan before telling him hayashi took a deep breath and licked his lips then he charged ahead why do we have donkeys commanding us sergeantsan they must have known a platoons worth of infantry couldnt get near those guns much less take them out but they sent them across the line anyhow so it would look like they were doing something another deep breath another charge forward its murder sergeantsannothing else but no wonder he shivered when he finished hed just put his life in the palm of sergeant fujitas hand if fujita wanted to squeeze it out all he had to do was report this conversation to any officer that would be the end of the clever young superior private corporal kawakami would have extinguished him in a heartbeat kawakami knew where his rice bowl came from fujita only sighed before you go on about how theyre big jackasses tell me what youd do if you were in charge keep bombing them at least that has a chance of doing some good hayashi said at once he must have been brooding about this for a long time well who could blame him taking courage because fujita wasnt calling him a traitor or simply beating the devil out of him for saying the wrong thing as was a sergeants privilege hayashi hurried on and we ought to fortify this line the way the french did with the maginot line we dont have to go any farther all we have to do is keep the russians from opening the railroad to vladivostok again why do we need to waste men the way weve been doing he waited sergeant fujita opened his mouth then closed it again he sighed again bugger me with a pine cone if i know hayashi you want to ask questions like that you should ask an officer who can give you a proper answer please excuse me sergeantsan but no thank you i dont think that would be a good idea hayashi shuddered to show how very much he didnt think that would be a good idea they would give me to the kempeitai and that would be that to them anyone who thinks theyre stupid has to be bad thinking about the kempeitai was plenty to make sergeant fujita shudder too the secret military police were like mean dogs all bared teeth and growls and they would also bite down theyd bite down hard they existed to chew up and spit outor swallowanyone judged to be a danger to japan and the emperor foreigner japanese they cared not a sens worth and now because fujita had listened to hayashi without immediately bawling for his arrest he too was complicit if the kempeitai came for hayashi theyd come for him as well maybe not right away but they would and once they got their hands on him in spite of the disgrace he would almost rather the russians caught him get out of here he said roughly shigata ga nai neh you cant do anything at all about itexcept make sure your foxhole has as much top cover as you can put on it and still be able to fight go on kid scram hayashi went away all the answerless questions hed asked lingered in fujitas mind like the snow in a long siberian winter chapter another hotshot on this stretch of the line willi dernen saw the need the son of a bitch with the monster rifle on the other side was still killing people at ranges that stretched to almost two kilometers hed sure put paid to the last fellow the wehrmacht sent against him willi was one of the men whod brought in sergeant fegeleins body under cover of darkness the late sergeant had very little head left north of the bridge of the nose willid seen a lot of dreadful wounds he was damn glad he hadnt seen this one by daylight oberfeldwebel marcus puttkamer was younger than his late lightly lamented predecessor had been he took the guy on the other side seriously well willi took anybody who carried an antipanzer rifle seriously using that thing to kill people was like using a uboats torpedo to sink a canoe which didnt mean it wouldnt work oh no it worked fine puttkamer set about slaughtering any officers and men he could reach with his own mauser it bore about the same relation to willis rifle as a thoroughbred did to a cart horse still how come you dont use one of those big mothers too willi asked a lot of senior noncoms thought they were gods so did some junior noncomsarno baatz for instance but puttkamer seemed like a human being as fegelein had before him he drank beer or wine when he came off duty he played skatnot too well either he laughed at dirty jokes and told some of his own now he said i like the piece ive got he may have a little more range but ive got more accuracy this babys made to special tolerances its tighter than a fivehundredmark whores pussy ive got special ammo too if i can see it i can hit ityoud best believe i can im not arguing willi answered puttkamer had a sharpshooters arrogance all right well if you werent selfconfident you had no business going into his line of work willi wondered how wolfgang storch was doing in a french pow camp he hoped his buddyd made it into a camp that the froggies hadnt just knocked him over the head either way though he was bound to be better off than if the ss bastards started gnawing at his liver matter of fact the oberfeldwebel went on i hit the fucker square in the helmet only thing wrong was he didnt have his head in it he had it on a stickin the scope i watched it spin oh hes cute all right but not cute enough does he think you think hes dead willi inquired i hope so but i dont believe it hes no dope puttkamer replied fegelein had said the same thing the current sniper went on i kind of wish i hadnt rung his bell too he was wearing a czech helmet and there arent that many of them over there now hes bound to have an adrian so hell look like every other froggy who isnt a tadpole any more would he get another czech job to fool you willi asked hmm the sniper eyed him unlike the other sharpshooter marcus puttkamer was dark and not especially big youre pretty cute yourself arent you im glad you think so sweetie willi batted his own eyes puttkamer laughed and made as if to punch him ah you got me there yeah he might be that cute never can tell one more thing to worry about danke schon glad to help willi said are you puttkamers gaze sharpened all at once willi felt as if a goose were walking over his grave the oberfeldwebel had snipers eyes after all even if they were dark feel like being my number two i could use somebody with his head on straight your decoy you mean how many have you gone through are any of them still breathing willi tried to keep his tone light but he was kidding on the square he knew some of what a snipers number two did drew the enemy snipers fire so the fellow with the scopesighted rifle could find his target that was an honor willi could do without he remembered fegeleins ruined head and wished he hadnt you wouldnt stop a round from an antipanzer rifle anything made to punch through a couple of centimeters of hardened steel would punch right on through flesh and blood too im not asking you to stick your head up puttkamer said reading his mindbut not answering his question you can hold a stahlhelm up on a stick same as that czech mother did with his pot wheres the risk in that oh im sure its there somewhere willi said dryly a few months of combat were plenty to convince him there was risk in anything that had anything to do with the enemy marcus puttkamer laughed again on a different note this time you do have to put some chips in the game if you expect to take any out i dont want to cash in my chips willi retorted you get up to the front that can happen any old place the sniper said come on man do you want to keep taking orders fromwhat do you call the assholefrom awful arno thats it and he is too if anything could pump willi up about the prospect of serving as a snipers assistant getting out from under corporal baatzs thumb did the trick where do i sign up he asked suddenly champing at the bit one more laugh from puttkamer leave it to me ill talk the guy into it he sounded altogether matteroffact willi suspected he would have sounded the same way had he said ill plug the guy if he gives me any grief and if awful arno did give him any grief puttkamer might threaten to plug him too he also might follow through and awful arno would have to be a real jerk not to understand as much of course he was awful arno the corporal came up to willi the next morning the sniper says he wants you for his number two thats right willi nodded you want to do it if willi seemed too eager baatz would tell him no on general principles long acquaintance made willi sure of it so he only shrugged and said i dont mind its something different anyhow good way to get yourself blown up you mean awful arno had also heard the stories about what happened to a snipers helper puttkamer had seemed sympathetic baatz sounded as if he looked forward to willis untimely demise chances were he did why not if willi caught one with his face it wouldnt hurt arno a bit willi shrugged again can happen to anybody those ss guys were just visiting the village french guns didnt knowor care they chewed that one fellow up regardless baatzs fleshy face hardened or maybe congealed was the better word i still say you had something to do with storch going missing when the ss wanted him you can say whatever you want talk is cheap funny man awful arno made as if to spit go on hang with puttkamerfor as long as you last wont be long i bet but dont come crying to me after you get your balls blown off im glad to be rid of you well were even then willi flipped baatz an ironic salute and ambled off to find his new master looking at it that way made him feel like a hound that had just been sold could any hound be as glad to get a new master as he was he didnt believe it baatz hopes youll get killed puttkamer remarked what did you do to make him love you so much oh this and that maybe even some of the other thing too willi didnt trust the sniper far enough to tell him more than that if puttkamer wanted chapter and verse he could get them from awful arno or maybe he already had if you think i love the blackshirts dernen youd better think twice sure willi said what was he going to say bullshit not likely lets go get that czech huh hes what weve got to worry about now right right puttkamer said and then well come on you can see how i do this shit and you know your stretch of line better than i do maybe youll show me some stuff i didnt already spot they went up and down the line willi saw it in ways he never had before he knew there were places where you had to keep your head down if you wanted to keep it on your shoulders but he hadnt worried about the spots from which you could peer across to the enemys position and see what the french and the czechs and the rest of that rabble were up to you dont want to do your observing from the same spot twice in a row puttkamer said like a teacher explaining how to multiply fractions somebodyll be watching for you to be stupid no patterns never any patterns flip a coin and follow it if you have to to keep from giving them a handle on you if you dont know ahead of time what youll do next the other boys cant either that makes sense willi said what will you want me to do draw the czechs fire right sounds like a good way for my folks to get a wire they dont want the idea is to get him to shoot at you not to get him to shoot you theres a difference you know the sniper answered youll do the kind of things the czech did with meshow your helmet without leaving your head in it keep an eye peeled for the sun shining off a telescope or binocular lenses for gods sake let me know if you see anything funny maybe well get you a snipers rifle too instead of the worthless piece of shit youre lugging around now hows that sound all right i guess willis grin was twisted besides im yours for now awful arnos washed his hands of me thats good luck not bad puttkamer said willi had to hope he was right sergeant halevy set a hand on vaclav jezeks shoulder youre not the hunted the jew said youre the hunter thats how youve got to look at it im the hunter uhhuh sure if vaclav sounded distinctly unenthusiastic the way he sounded reflected the way he felt and he had his reasons he picked up the helmet the german sniper had ventilated if im the hunter how come he did this to me and i havent done a goddamn thing to him you werent wearing it halevy looked on the bright side of things he could afford tothe nazi wasnt trying to spill his brains out on the bottom of a trench no shit vaclav said after a little while wearing a french model brain bucket hed got his hands on another czech pot this one didnt fit as well as the older helmet had but it didnt have those two neat mm holes in it either he did like it better than the adrian which protected less of his head of course nothing protected you from a direct hit by a rifle round youd need a helmet as thick as the side of a tank to do that and youd need a rhinos neck muscles to wear it he did think the czech model was better than the adrian for keeping shell fragments from needling through his skull halevy made a small production out of lighting a cigarette arent you happy though he said after a couple of puffs now the french officers are glad you carry that antitank rifle they arent trying to get you to turn it in any more terrific jezek said thats on account of the fritz is punching their tickets for them and they want me to make him quit even french officers think theyre entitled to live benjamin halevy spread his hands as if to say what can you do poor bastards dont know any better vaclav opened his mouth then closed it again without saying anything he had to work that through before he answered after a moment he tried again only a jew would come out with something that knottedup why thank you halevy said without any irony vaclav could hear maybe i should wave my circumcised cock at the german then hed want to kill me as much as he wants to get you i wish i could work out how he thinks jezek said fretfully the other nazi was easier he figured hed get you because he was a german and you werent this guy is better than that anyway halevy said hes a lot better than that dammit vaclav said half the time i dont even think he knows where hell shoot from next how could he not shit for all i know he rolls dice or something one he goes here three he goes there six he goes somewhere else wherever he goes he nails people youre doing the same thing to his side halevy said i know but i havent got a glimpse of him vaclav hardly heard his own reply rolling dice hed only been running his mouth when he said that but it sure made sense now that it was out how could you stalk a man if he had no pattern you could find you couldnt vaclav had a couple of yellowish ivories in his own pocket hed made a little money with themlost a little too maybe they had uses he hadnt thought of before he had his favorite places from which to observe the german line and from which to fire at the fritzes when he found the chance now knowing the nazi sniper was on the prowl behind the barbed wire and shell holes separating the two sides he gave up on those familiar places he had the feeling that if he put an eye up to one of his loopholes a mauser bullet would greet him an instant later maybe he was only being jumpy but he didnt believe in taking chances of course he was also taking chances in finding new spots from which to watch the enemy one of the reasons his favorite places were favorites was that they were good places he could watch the germans and shoot at the careless ones with little risk to himself when he went somewhere else the nazis had a better chance to spot him and knock him over buthe hopedthe sniper wouldnt be looking for him in these new spots he had a dirty green cloth he draped over his telescope so the german wouldnt notice it and to keep the lens from flashing in the sun plenty of wehrmacht men passed through his field of view he wished he could kill them all and more besides he didnt shoot at all of them though or even at very many by the nature of things a sniper had to pick and choose he wouldnt last long if he got greedy some of the germans had taken to twisting their shoulder straps so they covered up the pips and embroidery that marked higher ranks sometimes vaclav noticed that when he did he tried to hit the men whod got cute how often he didnt notice of course he couldnt begin to guess every so often he saw germans scrutinizing the lines the czechs and french held against them one of them was simply too brazen for belief the way he stood head and shoulders above the parados binoculars in hand infuriated vaclav did the son of a bitch think nobody would punch his ticket for him he might as well have mailed out engraved invitations with shoot me on them vaclav took care of that for him the antitank rifle thundered and slammed hard against his right shoulder as soon as he fired he ducked a habit hed acquired not long after he started sniping you could see what you did later and from somewhere else after youd taken your shot you couldnt change anything anyway a split second after he lowered his head a bullet cracked through the space where it had been hello he said and didnt come up again the way he might have otherwise somebodys laying for you benjamin halevy remarked thanks a bunch i never would have guessed without you vaclav said the jew laughed vaclav didnt god damn it to hell that bastard was just standing there asking for it i know i got him not even the nazis would waste a man of their own for the sake of killing me would they he heard the doubt in his own voice who could guess exactly how ruthless the germans were ill have a look halevy did cautiously from ten meters down the trench i dont find him now i wonder who he was he acted like an officer and a dumb officer to boot vaclav said you wouldnt see an enlisted man standing there giving that kind of target the guys who really fight know better maybe he was from the general staff sergeant halevy said if half of what you hear about them is true the nazis with red stripes on their pants dont know shit about the real world easy to say that jezek answered theyre here in france theyre in poland theyre all over czechoslovakia fuck em up the ass i dont see anybody elses soldiers in germany do you well no halevy admitted but before he could say anything more german artillery came to thunderous life he and vaclav both dove for cover were the fritzes shelling like that to avenge the dummkopf vaclav had knocked over they did things like that if the dummkopf was an important dummkopf the czech had accomplished something worth doing he consoled himself with thatand hoped the nazis vengeance wouldnt come down on him now willi dernen examined what was left of the head from the departmentstore dummy oberfeldwebel puttkamer had kitted out in german helmet and tunic even less was left of the dummys noggin than of the other snipers head willi let out a low respectful whistle that piece packs a fuck of a wallop he said what makes you think so sherlock holmes puttkamer enquired willis ears felt incandescent the senior noncom went on he knows the tricks damn him he was down again before i could fire im sure of it too bad willi said youd better believe it marcus puttkamer said hes still out there hes still learning hes still got his goddamn peashooter too i slip up even a little hes gonna smash my skull just like the shitass dummys he considered willi the way an entomologist considered a beetle before sticking a pin through it or maybe yours thanks a lot feld willi said hed thought about that possibility before agreeing to become the snipers number two but not too much getting out from under awful arno counted for more well hed done that but everything you got in this world came with a price tag attached part of the price here was drawing the notice of a sharpshooter who carried a gun that could kill you out to a couple of thousand meters next to that even awful arno seemed not quite so awful anyhow willi glanced toward the enemys linesbut made sure he didnt raise his head above the parapet to do it what do we try now puttkamer lit a gitane like willi he liked french tobacco better than the hayandhorseshit smokes the reich cranked out these days after a moments pause the oberfeldwebel offered willi the pack with a nod of thanks willi took a smoke from it and leaned toward puttkamer for a light the first drag made him want to cough yeah this was the real stuff all rightno ersatz here i dont know what to try right this minute puttkamer answered snorting smoke out his nostrils like a puzzled dragon hes good sure as hell oh and youre rightscrew me if he wasnt wearing a czech helmet again his stubbled cheeks hollowed as he inhaled wunderbar willi muttered how about that the oberfeldwebel said with an acid chuckle what ive got to do is ive got to get him to make a mistake if im there when he does it hell never make another one sounds great but didnt you just say he was good willi returned so how do you think you can make him screw up best idea ive had so far is to keep murdering as many french officers as i can as far back from the trench as my rifle reaches puttkamer answered matteroffactly that wont put his wind uptoo much to hope for but if all his superiors start screaming at him to get rid of the horrible nazi gunslinger they might make him move too fast and get careless or they might not naturlich but i think its worth a try if youve got a better notion sing out believe me ill listen dernen did believe him puttkamer wasnt like awful arno always sure he was right no matter what he said or did yeah there were advantages to getting away from baatz sure as hell what can i do to help willi asked he felt like an assistant at a chess tournament but they wouldnt take pieces off the board no theyd take at least one body you can help kill them thats what lets go get you a proper rifle one with a scope on it puttkamer said that piece of yours well the factories turn out worse but they sure as hell turn out better too having seen what the sniper could do with his special mauser willi didnt argue he was used to his own weapon but he felt no forsakingallothers attachment to it and even if he had he couldnt just mount a telescope on it and start picking off french officers a kilometer and a half away snipers mausers had a special downturned bolt the telescope interfered with the travel of an ordinary one the quartermaster sergeant was as snotty as quartermaster sergeants usually were you want one for him the fellow exclaimed as if willi had a girlfriend prettier than the one a proper quartermaster would have issued him thats right marcus puttkamer left it there not only was he an oberfeldwebel himself he was also a sniper who wanted to argue with him nobody with any sense not even a quartermaster sergeant and so willi got his rifle bolt will take some getting used to he said i reach for the wrong place i did too you wont take as long to get it as you think the sniper said but do you feel how smooth the action is sniper rifles are made the way theyre supposed to be now youd better take care of it you dont keep it clean you dont keep it greased ill mount a bayonet on it and then ill shove it up your ass get me jawohl feld willi answered every sergeant hed ever served under growled about keeping your weapon clean willi was as good about it as anyone better than most he could see why it would be especially important for a sniper i want you to spend the rest of the day practicing with the scope puttkamer said dont look toward the french lines theyll see you and somebody will stop your career before it gets going look at our trenches instead if theres somebody you wouldnt mind seeing dead find out what he looks like with crosshairs on him but youre such a sweet guy you dont have anybody like that right oh sure willi said innocently puttkamer chuckled the other thing is you have to be able to wait the better you are at holding still the more targets youll service and thats the idea right right willi said the veteran didnt care to talk about killing people he did it but he didnt like to talk about it straight on that was interesting in its own way practice the veteran sniper repeated when i think youre ready well go out to a hide at night and you can start potting froggies pick ones well back of the line if you can theyre more apt to be careless back there anyhow and if you do that theyll think it was me and theyll go buggier than they would if you showed a different style i understand but what i do if i spot the czech asshole with the antipanzer rifle willi asked dispose of him puttkamer said at once you think ill be mad you think ill be jealous not a chance kid ill get you promoted ill get you a medal ill get you so fucking drunk youll still have a katzenjammer three days later thats our number one piece of business right nowdealing with that son of a bitch you hear i hear willi not only heard he believed awful arno would have tried his hardest to grab the credit if willi did anything worth noticing if oberfeldwebel puttkamer wasnt like that more power to him baatz watched and sneered and made rude comments as willi got used to his new weapon willi ignored him for a while then as if by accident he did get the corporal in the crosshairs he didnt have a round chambered his finger was nowhere near the trigger awful arno found something else to do in a hurry even so after a few days puttkamer said well kid lets find out how you do after dark he led willi out to a shell hole that had a shattered door splayed half across it get under there whatever you do dont move where they can see you till tomorrow nightand they wont see you then either wait when you get a target service it need to know anything else dont think so willi answered puttkamer set a hand on his shoulder then silently crawled away willi slithered under the scarred door and went to sleep when he woke up the sun had risen behind him hidden by shadows he ate black bread with liver paste on it he looked through his binoculars it was getting on toward noon when he spotted a frenchman in a kepi striding along importantly half a kilometer behind the enemy line slowly slowly he moved the mauser into position and picked up the frenchman in the telescopic sight he made sure nothing was out in the sunlight to give him away pierre or gaston or whoever he was seemed not to have a care in the world willi took a deep breath he let it out he pulled the triggergently as if with a lovers caress the mauser kicked not too hard since it was pressed tight against his shoulder the magnified frenchman in the sight took another step then he fell over willi didnt move he didnt shout or whoop or even light a cigarette all the same he knew hed just joined the club that night two men brought what was left of marcus puttkamer back in a shelter half from the neck up he pretty much wasnt there the bullet that killed him must have caught him right under the chin and blown off most of his head he looked worse than sergeant fegelein had which wasnt easy willi realized his new club had higher dues than he wanted to pay a stuka screamed down out of the hazy grayblue sky staff sergeant alistair walsh fired a couple of shots at it he knew that was long odds but he did it anyhow what did he have to lose bombs fell from the divebomber it leveled off only a couple of hundred yards above the machinegun nest it was attacking then roared away sandbags the gun and tripod and bodies and pieces of bodies arced through the air hell walsh muttered bloody fucking hell this is where i came in when the german blow fell in the west the winter before the luftwaffe had had things all its own way for a while in france it didnt any more the raf and the french were making the fritzes pay for everything they got there but that was france here in norway the deck still seemed stacked in the nazis favor before the germans jumped them the norwegians hadnt had much of an air force of their own they flew italian caproni bombers dutch fokker monoplane fighters and english gloster gladiators biplanes outdated by both hurricanes and spitfires they didnt fly very many of any of them the luftwaffe could reach this part of norway from newly occupied denmark and from airfields captured farther south in the country oslo was firmly in german hands more stukas dove their sirens wailing like damned souls more british strongpoints in front of trondheim went up in smoke and fire the stukas flew away theyd bomb up again maybe refuel and pretty soon theyd come back to blow up more of the defenses around the town somewhere out to sea there was supposed to be a royal navy carrier the planes that took off from its flight deck might help till england and france could bring in landbased fighters then again they might not walsh had seen a stuka outrun an english skua the lumbering german dive bombers couldnt get out of their own way what did that say about the poor miserable skua nothing good surely jock pointed south are those bloody fucking german tanks the yorkshireman asked walsh looked too safe enough no german foot soldiers close yet how long would that last though not long enough plainly afraid they are chum the nco said well what do we do about them jock pressed the ideal answer would have been turn our own tanks loose on them walsh saw no english french or norwegian tanks he wasnt sure there were any norwegian tanks to see there were a few brengun carriers tankettes some people called them they carried two men and a machine gun and were well enough armored to keep out rifle bullets if the other side had no tanks at all tankettes were worldbeaters if on the other hand they ran up against real armor they were doomed and those were real tanks coming not firstrate real tanks maybe panzer iis or perhaps captured czech models anything that mounted a cannon was plenty to put paid to a brengun carrier thrushes chirped among the tussocks fieldfares wheatears birds of the far north one of them plucked a worm from the newly turned dirt in a bomb crater and swallowed it walsh laughed in spite of himself sure as hell it was an ill wind that blew no one any good an officer had some field glasses after staring through them he said those are czech ts wonderful walsh thought always good to know whats about to do you in before long he saw that the young lieutenant was right the czech machines were bigger than panzer iis their road wheels were much bigger and they carried bigger cannon mm against the german tanks mm guns the men in the brengun carriers had guts they rattled out ahead of the position the tommies poilus and squareheads were manning they would stop the german tanks if they could trouble was walsh knew too damn well they couldnt he also knew they knew they couldnt somewhere along the line there were said to be a couple of antitank cannon walsh had no idea where they were they werent anywhere close by so they were unlikely to make any difference in the upcoming fight his hand shook when he lit a navy cut nothing was likely to make any difference in the upcoming fight jocks thoughts were running on a similarly gloomy track we need the bloody fucking cavalry riding in to chase off the bloody fucking indians is what we need he said too right we do walsh agreed this isnt what they call a hollywood ending wrong bloody side is winning for some little while he paid no attention to the rising buzz in the air if he noticed it at all he assumed it came from more luftwaffe aircraft but it didnt damned if those werent skuas winging in from off the ocean they could carry bombs as well as chasing planes faster than they were whatever bad things you could say about the blackburn skuaand you could say plentyit was by god faster than a tank walsh pointed into the sky its the bloody fucking cavalry jock stared a grin as big as all outdoors slowly plastered itself across his face well up me arse if it aint sarge doing their best impression of stukas the english fighterbombers dove on the advancing tanks they dropped their bombs then they climbed and dove again their machine guns chattered as they shot up the fritzes moving forward with the tanks thatll scramble em jock said exultantly it will walsh said that kind of treatment had scrambled english and french troops often enoughno too bloody often but the germans unlike their allied counterparts didnt stay scrambled long with what might have passed for majestic deliberation the skuas climbed and dove yet again and then one more time still that last pass proved one too many majestic deliberation turned out to be only a synonym for too goddamn slow messerschmitts roaring up from the south tore into the skuas the english planes streaked back toward the carrier that had launched them it was unfortunately a slow streak at least by the standards the s were used to wolves killing sheep could have had no easier time than the german fighters one skua after another tumbled out of the sky in smoking flaming ruin a couple of parachutes opened but only a couple walsh reminded himself that each english plane carried not one but two highly trained young men quietly jock said thats murder is what that is walsh nodded nothing else but whoever expected them to be able to fight in those sorry machines ought to come up on charges they havent got a chance like brengun carriers against proper tanks aint it jock said its just like that by god walsh answered how the bleeding hell are we supposed to fight a war if the equipment they give us is ten years behind what the nazis have isnt that what they call muddling through thats what they call fucking up walsh said savagely in the last war the germans had said their english counterparts were lions commanded by donkeys some things didnt change from one generation to the next more german planes appeared overhead broadwinged hes and the skinny dos that englishmen and germans both called flying pencils the level bombers ignored the troops outside of trondheim they started pounding the docks thick black clouds of smoke rose walsh wondered what was burning the town or the ships that kept the defenders supplied which would be worse the ships walsh judged you couldnt keep fighting without munitions or for that matter without food maybe you could live off the land in summertime but summer in this part of norway was only a hiccup in the cold the fritzes could bring things up from the south the defenders had to do it by sea if they could a heinkel spun toward the ground flame licking across its left wing it blew up with a hell of a bang it hadnt got rid of its bombs several tommies cheered walsh wasnt sorry to watch the bugger crash eithernot halfbut how much difference would it make any at all chapter why this is hell nor am i out of it what the devil was that from for the life of her peggy druce couldnt remember shed studied way too much literature in college but how much good did it do her she could remember the quote but not the source her professors would have frowned severely well tough shit she thought even if she couldnt remember whod written the line it fit her all too well the nazis had even extended their hell to keep her in it shed thought getting into denmark meant escaping sadly just because you thought something didnt make it so no more flights from copenhagen to london no more ships plying the north sea from denmark to england either the nazis were acting as mildly as anybody could after invading and overrunning the country next door they loudly proclaimed that denmark was still independent if you listened to them they were only protecting the danes from invasion by england or france if had any danes invited them to protect the country not fucking likely peggy said out loud when she first thought to wonder she was having lunch in a seaside cafe at the moment her waiter did a double take worthy of groucho peggys cheeks heated shed already seen that a lot of danes spoke english quite a few of them spoke it better than your average american in fact she couldnt just let fly without scandalizing somebody she left the waiter a fat tip and got out of there in a hurry moments later she wished she hadnt a couple of dozen danish fascists were parading down the street behind a danish flagwhite cross on redwith the words frikorps danmark in gold where the stars would be on an american flag she wasnt the only person staring at the collaborators every country had its fascist fringe but now the danish loonies enjoyed hitlers potent backing slowly and deliberately a tall blonde woman turned her back on the homegrown fascists one by one the rest of the people on the street followed her example peggy was slower than most she got a good look at the danish wouldbe nazis by their expressions they might have bitten into big juicy lemons from behind them somebody called out something in danish peggy didnt understand it but the local traitors did their faces got even more sour she hadnt dreamt they could more and more people took up the call whatever it was as the fascists rounded a corner and disappeared a helpful dane who must have noticed peggys blank look spoke a few words of english it means shamewhat we shouted good for you she said if shed known the word she would have yelled at the goons herself the worst of it was she had to deal with the germans again her disappointment seemed all the crueler because shed thought shed escaped both nazis and wehrmacht forever no such luck no luck at all as a matter of fact the germans might say denmark was still independent but the free danes had no control over travel between their country and neighboring sweden the occupiers damn well did knowing nazi arrogance peggy would have expected the wehrmacht to take over the royal palace and to run denmark from it but general kaupitsch or his aide had better sense than that king christian x went right on reigning even his danish bodyguard remained intact the germans administered their new conquest from a drab modern office building three blocks away if that was where they were that was where peggy had to go she wished hitler had issued her a letter instead of calling her on the phone to let her know she could go from germany to denmark and had he been laughing up his sleeve when he gave her that permission sure he had he must have known his own army would be only a few days behind her no big swastika flag flew over or in front of the german headquarters the wehrmacht wasnt going out of its way to be hated unless you counted invading denmark to begin with of course peggy would have bet the germans didnt she had no doubt whatsoever that the danes damn well did and always would she displayed her american passport and told one of the sentries i want to see general kaupitsch sofort bitte sofort sounded a lot more immediate than immediately why one of the germans asked under the beetling brow of his helmet his features were blank because the fuhrer said i could come to denmark so i could go on to the states and this invasion has screwed things up thats why peggy answered do you understand that or shall i bounce a rock off your goddamn stahlhelm and wise you up both sentries eyes widened one set was blue the other brown youre a crappy aryan kid peggy thought feeling how far out on the ragged edge she was please wait the one with the blue eyes said he disappeared into the office building if he didnt come out pretty damn quick peggy was going to lay into his buddy with both barrels but he did he conferred with brown eyes who spoke up i will take you to major von rehfeld oh yeah how come not to the general i am ordered to take you to major von rehfeld for a german nothing else needed saying you will please come with me peggy please came with him major von rehfeld proved to be a tall handsome man of about thirtyfive who was missing the lower half of his left ear that and a wound badge said hed seen real fighting somewhere so you are the notorious mrs druce he said in excellent english thats right buster who in blazes are you peggy snapped among other things i am the man assigned to get you to stockholm the german officer answered believe me we do respect the fuhrers order to give you all the help we can once you reach sweden you are on your own however i do not know how soon you will be able to travel from there to england and on to the united states it is a pity but norway remains a war zone and whose fault is that peggy said the major shrugged i would say it is the fault of france and england but i am sure you would call me a lying nazi if i did so i will not say anything about that never mind whose fault it is it is a war zone nothing travels through it without grave risk of being attacked by both the two sides is this so or is it not so it was so of that peggy had no doubt whatever nobody in her right mind could how long do you think ill have to stay in stockholm she asked this i cannot say the major spread his hands doing his best to look and sound as reasonable as he could it is not up to the reich alone you know the enemy has also something to say about it i can tell you that we are making much better progress in norway than we were only a few days ago we prove that air power is stronger than sea power the royal navy is sorry to learn this but learn it they do maybe that was so too or maybe he was parroting goebbels propaganda line as if it were polly wants a cracker peggy couldnt tell since she couldnt she asked how do i get to stockholm the usual ferry is sailing again tickets are easy to come by you will have no trouble with an exit visai promise you that major von rehfeld replied will you have german soldiers on the ferry the way you did on the ships in copenhagen harbor peggy gibed to her astonishment the major blushed scarlet we saved needless bloodshed he said but he sounded none too proud of it a moment later he added it was a legitimate ruse of war but that didnt seem to convince him either if he meant what he said about getting her to stockholm peggy wasnt inclined to be fussy how soon can i go she asked as soon as you have your ticket come back i will provide you with an exit visa no one will stand in your way von rehfeld said you arent planning to uh protect sweden as soon as i get there are you why would we with denmark and norway safe from english interference iron ore can travel from sweden to the reich without risk of interruption had the major claimed that germany would never do such a wicked thing peggy wouldnt have believed him for a minute when he talked about national selfinterest he was much more persuasive that didnt mean he was telling the truth it also didnt mean peggy would be able to get out of sweden once she got in but she was willing to try it what can go wrong now she asked herself but the question had a simple obvious answer damn near anything could sergeant hermann witt made a panzer commander very different from heinz naumann theo hossbach noted the differences with nothing but relief most important witt could laugh at himself he didnt have to feel he was better and tougher than everyone else in the panzer to give orders he didnt go out of his way to give people a hard time to show he was tougher than they were if that came as a relief to theo it had to be something close to heaven for adalbert stoss witt hadnt taken long to realize the driver was missing something most german men had imagining three men living closer together than they did in a panzer ii was next to impossible theo sure didnt want to think about it anyhow only bedbugs and lice lived closer to him than his crewmates did naumann hadnt been able to quit riding adi stoss about his circumcision no wonder they hadnt got along theo wouldnt have wanted anybody razzing him about his dick either a couple of days after taking charge of the panzer witt looked up from the skinny little chicken he was roasting and said ask you something adi sure sarge whats up stoss answeredabout how theo would have responded to a casual question when they drafted you they didnt sarge i volunteered did you well all right good for you when you did you filled out about a million forms right witt said adi nodded and made a face sure pain in the ass but youve got to do it yeah you do you gave all the right answers on the one about your ancestors didnt you the new panzer commander said stoss didnt even try not to understand him you bet i didin spite of the operation if you know what i mean i expect i do sergeant witt replied thats what i needed to know he turned the chickens carcass on the branch that did duty for a spit and i think this birds about ready to eat white meat or dark as theo gnawed the meat off a drumstick and thigh he belatedly realized witt hadnt asked adi if he was a jew hed only asked if the driver had given the right answers on the military paperwork of course adi had they wouldnt have let him into the wehrmacht if he hadnt but the question covered the sergeants ass if by some chance stoss did turn out to be jewish witt could say the driver had denied it theod wondered himself yes some gentiles did have a medical need to part with their foreskin but if you ran into somebody without his what would you think first youd think the guy was a jew that was what the idea made theo want to giggle a jew in the wehrmacht was like a chameleon on a green rug you wouldnt look for one on the rug to begin with so of course you wouldnt notice it if it happened to be there theo wouldnt have said anything about his wonderings even if the gestapo decided to interrogate him he never said much about anything and he had his reasons not to when you didnt love the regime under which you lived keeping your mouth shut was the smartest thing you could do besides if adi really was jewish wasnt that about the richest joke anyone could play on the nazis theo might have thought otherwise if stoss were a bad soldier or a gutless one he wasnt he did fine as long as he made a good kamerad who gave a rats ass about the other crap with sizable help from the polish infantrywhich seemed to view retreat as a worse affront than treasonit looked as if theyd be able to hold the red army outside of warsaw the poles had managed that after the last war too if they hadnt germany and russia might not be quarreling on polish soil right now theyd be at each others throats the way they had been in quite a few polish foot soldiers were obviously jews what did they think of fighting on the same side as the german national socialists theo was tempted to ask some of them a german who put some effort into it could make sense of yiddish in the end though the radioman kept his mouth shut that was what he usually did so it wasnt hard for him and his sense of selfpreservation warned him his fellow soldiers would give him funny looks if he all of a sudden started chatting up jews some of the villages they went through were full of them men in beards widebrimmed hats and black clothes straight out of the eighteenth century one of the guys from another panzer in the company said boy you can sure see why the fuhrer wants to clean out the kikes cant you theyre like something from mars shame we cant wipe these places up any which way poles wouldnt like it another crewman said my ass the first fellow replied they dont like jews any bettern we doless maybe i bet theyd cheer us on maybe the other man said but then all the kikes would go over to the reds we need that like a hole in the head i guess the first man said unwillingly their days coming though its gotta be i mean theyre like niggers or chinamen or something only they dont even live a long piss away from us theo glanced over at adi the panzer driver kept his head down and shoveled stew into his face from his mess tin that meant exactly nothing most of the germans in black coveralls were doing exactly the same thing a sergeant with the ribbon for an iron cross second class and a wound badge said the less people who want to shoot me or plant mines or pour sugar in my gas tank the better i like it no one seemed eager to quarrel with that theo knew damn well he wasnt he hadnt liked it when the french shot at him his own wound badgeand the half a finger he could still feel sometimes even if it wasnt there any moresaid he had good reason not to argue the czechs could have done the same to him or even worse the russians might yet they got another chance the next morning a polish cavalryman rode back to warn the crew that enemy panzers lay ahead the poles called them pancers pronouncing it the same way german did to the russians they were tanks theyd borrowed the word from english instead big pancers the horseman warned the poles used cavalry as if theyd never heard of machine guns their riders had more balls than they knew what to do with to an outside observer that often made them nutty as so many fruitcakes germans whod been in poland longer than theo talked about horsemen in the squaretopped caps called czapkas charging russian panzers with lances maybe that was true maybe not that theo could wonder spoke volumes about what polish cavalry might be capable of well lets see how big they are hermann witt said forward adi take it slow till we find out what were up against will do stoss said and he did back in his own armored space theo might not find out how big the enemy panzers were till a shell hit the panzer ii and either did or didnt smash the softskinned people inside and set the machine on fire he wondered if getting surprised by death was worse than seeing someone take dead aim at you before you got it pretty bad both ways as a matter of fact ha sergeant witt said and then those damned fast panzers theo report em to division theo did his gut clenched no way in hell the panzer iis armor could hold out a mm round but this machine had teeth too witt fired several short bursts from the mm gun his shouts and whoops and curses said he was doing some good adis voice came through the speaking tube theyre running away a couple of other german panzers had come forward with theirs all the same theo wasnt sorry to hear witt say i think im just going to let them go you borrow trouble half the time youre sorry later on more than half heinz naumann would have charged after the reds theo was sure of that he was also sure heinz was dead they still hadnt scrubbed all the former commanders blood off the floor of the fighting compartment it clung in cracks and crevices neither theo nor adi had said anything about that to sergeant witt theo knew he didnt intend to he didnt know whether adi stoss had equal discretion no he didnt know but he thought so inshore waters julius lemp didnt like them for beans he didnt need his zeiss glasses to see the corrugated norwegian coastline the ocean deepened swiftly as you moved away from the outlets to the fjords but not fast enough to suit him if you had to dive in waters like these you couldnt dive deep enough to have good odds of staying safeand you were liable to dive straight to the bottom that wouldnt be good which was putting it mildly but this was where the fighting was so this was where he had to be the royal navy had nerve well that was nothing he didnt already know the english were ready to take on the kriegsmarine and the luftwaffe both if that meant they could screw the german troops in norway to the wall and the limeys were knocking the snot out of the kriegsmarines surface ships too theyd sunk nearly a dozen german destroyers and a couple of cruisers too they had lost a carrieroverwhelmed and sunk by german battlewagons before she could get away and theyd lost some destroyers of their own but mostly to air attack ship against ship the damned englishmen were better on the surface when it came to uboats that was a different story it had better be lemp thought like any uboat skipper he felt proprietary about these boats the kaisers reich had come that close to bringing england to her knees a generation earlier this time the fuhrers reich would do what didnt quite come off in the last war lemp scanned the fjords mouth smoke rose from the far end of the inlet that was trondheim catching hell from the air and the ground the town wouldnt couldnt stay in enemy hands much longer the english the french and the norwegians would have to retreat farther north if they wanted to stay in the fight raf bombers didnt have the range to cross the north sea and hit back at the germans in norway and so the english were using warships to take up the slack even destroyers mounted guns usefully bigger than any a panzer carried those shells could mash a submarine lemp didnt suppose foot soldiers enjoyed getting hit with them either but if you put a warship where its guns could strike ground targets you also sent it into danger british warships these days were painted in crazy stripes the way zebras would have been were god drunk when he made them it did a good job of breaking up their outlines especially when seen from the sea against a background of shore nothing broke up the outline of muzzle flashes though before the sound of the guns reached the u lemp said well go below the ratings on the conning tower tumbled down into the uboats fetid bowels the skipper followed periscope depth he called as he dogged the hatch with any luck at all it would be an easy stalk the destroyers crew would be paying attention to their targets theyd be watching out for air attack the luftwaffe had hit the royal navy hard in these waters how much attention would the limeys pay to submarines with luck not much yeswith lemp had no intention of leaving things to luck he swung the periscope in wide arcs to the right and left he hadnt seen any frigates or corvettes shepherding the destroyer but that didnt mean they werent there some clever young english officer might be stalking him the way he was stalking the destroyer that english officer might be but the periscope gave no sign of it without taking his eyes away from the periscope lemp asked you there gerhart yes im here the schnorkel expert answered what do you need skipper nothing im just glad weve got the snort thats all lemp wouldnt have believed hed ever say anything like that when the technicians first saddled his boat with the gadget but we can make our approach a lot faster than we could on batteries when i write up the action report ill log it ive said so all along gerhart beilharz sounded ready to pop his buttons with pride people say all kinds of things lemp answered dryly sometimes theyre true and sometimes theyre crap you have to find out its a good thing we didnt have to find out the hard way eh eryes that took some of the toploftiness out of the tall engineer torpedoes ready lemp called into the speaking tube that led to the bow the boat had an electrically powered intercom but nothing could go wrong with the tube yes skipper four eels loaded and ready to swim the answer came back by the same route it sounded brassy but perfectly comprehensible all right wont be long lemp fed speeds and angles to klaus hammerstein the exec turned them into a firing solution the camouflaged destroyer swelled in the periscopes reticulated field of view she went right on shelling whatever shore target had raised her ire no sudden evasive moves no sign she had the faintest idea death and ruin were slipping up on her things were supposed to work that way they seldom did every once in a while though he got within a kilometer he could have have fired at her without hammersteins calculations but he was glad he had them the englishmen went right on with their shore bombardment lemp turned the periscope all about walking in a circle there under the conning tower no no one was sneaking up on him fire one he barked fire two wham wham the eels shot out of the tubes running time to the destroyer was a little more than a minute lemp watched the wakes both torpedoes ran straight and true that didnt happen every time either now how long before the englishmen saw what was coming at them would they have time enough for evasive action as the seconds ticked off that became less and less likely the destroyer showed sudden urgent smoke bare seconds before the first eel slammed into her just abaft the beam the second hit a moment later up near the bow over and through the deep rumbles of the explosions the crew whooped and cheered destroyers werent armored they depended on speed to keep them out of harms way when speed failed they were hideously vulnerable the first hit would have been plenty to sink that ship backs broken lemp reported watching the enemys death agonies through the periscope she wont stay afloat long shes not far from shore some of her crew may make it lieutenant hammerstein said our boys on land can scoop them up when they take trondheim lemp didnt answer even in summer the north sea was bloody cold he wouldnt want to have to swim ashore with or without a life ring he didnt think the destroyer would be able to launch her boats those might have given the limey sailors a fighting chance to live if the exec wanted to imagine he hadnt just helped kill a couple of hundred men he could lemp knew better he spoke to the helmsman give me course peter we dont want to stick around do we folks up top might not be real happy with us if we do the petty officer agreed course it is he swung the uboat around to the north and west away from the norwegian coast break out the beer somebody yelled they kept some on board to celebrate sinkings and other notable events it wouldnt be coldthe uboat had no refrigeratorbut no one would complain lemp swung the periscope around through degrees again no hunters only ocean and the ever more distant shore he nodded to himself we got away with it he said and the sailors cheered some more and england and france wont get away with trying to take norway away from us or with stopping the swedes from shipping their iron ore to us through norwegian ports the crew didnt cheer about that they werent grand strategists neither was lemp but he had some notion of how important the iron ore was the baltic froze in the winter the north sea didnt if the swedes were going to keep shipping the stuff when the weather got cold theyd have to do it through norwegian ports through ports the enemy couldnt interfere with well the reich was taking care of that sure enough one more check no no other royal navy ships in the neighborhood yes he said break out the beer even inside a cramped stinking steel tube life was good our mission colonel borisov announced is to bomb warsaw most of the pilots and copilots in the squadron just sat there and listened some of them nodded as if in wisdom sergei yaroslavsky sat tight like the rest the less you showed the less they could blame you for any questions before we carry out the mission the squadron commander asked excuse me comrade colonel but i have one of course that was anastas mouradian hed never fully mastered the fine art of keeping his mouth shut well what is it borisov growled he never wanted questions warsaw is the capital of poland it is a large city are we supposed to bomb some special part of it or do we let the explosives come down all over mouradian asked borisov glared at him yaroslavsky wondered whyit was a perfectly good question maybe that was why the orders transmitted to me say warsaw the colonel answered they give no more detail we shall bomb warsawwith your gracious permission of course comrade lieutenant oh its all right with me sir mouradian answered ignoring colonel borisovs heavyhanded sarcasm i just wanted to make sure of what was required of us what is required of you is to do as you are told borisov said now you have been told go do it all of you the meeting broke up immediately after that there didnt seem to be anything left to say well well mouradian remarked as he and sergei strode toward their sb the chimp was already watching the armorers as they bombed up the plane warsaw how about that he sounded bright and cheerful maybe that was maskirovka camouflage then again maybe hed gone out of his mind as many antiaircraft guns as the poles can beg borrow or steal yaroslavsky said all the fighter planes theyve got that still fly as many messerschmitts as the germans can spare now sergei how many times have i told youif youre going to piss and moan about every little thing youll never get anywhere the armenian reached over and patted him on his stubbled cheek as if he were a little boy fretting about hobgoblins under the bed sergei spluttered what else could he do ivan kuchkov had already got the word even if he wasnt at borisovs meeting warsaw huh he said cheerfully about fucking time if you want to know what i think time to start hitting those polish cocksuckers where they live then theyll know better than to dick around with us what would he do without mat he probably wouldnt be able to talk at all sergei waited till the armorers had finished their work then climbed into the cockpit he and anastas ran through the preflight checklists the engines fired up right away he eyed the gauges things looked better than usual they would he thought darkly he waited his turn to take off the sb seemed eager to fly would it be so eager to come back to the motherland he could only hope one thing mouradian said consolingly as they took their place in the formation its a big target borisov cant very well gig us for missing well sergei said no he can gig us for getting killed though we wont have to listen to him if he does anastas seemed to think that was good news he was welcome to his opinion the poles and germans were still holding the red army east of warsaw the line wasnt too different from the one marshal pilsudskis forces had held in the fighting after the revolution the stakes were higher now though the soviet union had already punished poland then poland hadnt threatened the peasants and workers paradise any more smiglyridzs poland and hitlers germany now that was a different story hitlers germany threatened everything it could reach and its arms seemed to stretch like octopus tentacles antiaircraft guns fired at them as they crossed the front a couple of near misses made the bomber bounce in the air some of those guns are ours sergei said angrily it happened every time if it was up in the air a lot of russians assumed it had to be hostile id like to bomb the morons screwing around down there do you think their replacements would be any smarter mouradian asked sergei considered and reluctantly shook his head the supply of damn fools was always more than equal to the demand then anastas said what do you want to bet the fritzes shoot at their own flyers too huh sergei said in surprise to russians germans were alarmingly capable that was what made them so dangerous it wasnt so easy to imagine them screwing up like ordinary human beings but if they were so wonderful why could you drop germany into russia and hardly notice where it hit they flew on poland was a big place in its own righttoo big at any rate to have antiaircraft guns everywhere once they got beyond the front things grew quiet again all the same sergei wished for eyes that could see above below and behind the sb as well as aheadand all at the same time it wasnt the first time hed made that wish you never knew where trouble would come from next well one thing well know when we get to warsaw mouradian said all the buildings and things underneath us you mean sergei asked mm those too anastas said but i was thinking thats when theyll start shooting at us again oh after a moment sergei nodded yeah they will the bastards with a wry chuckle mouradian said we need to get the chimp up here hed call them something thatd set em on fire from four thousand meters up he would wouldnt he sergei agreed but dont let him hear you call him that hell throw you through a door headfirst and he wont care that youre an officer or about what theyll do to him afterwards i said it to you not to him and in fact mouradians hand had been over the mouthpiece of his speaking tube in meditative tones he went on i wonder what ivans service jacket looks like how many times have they busted him down to private for doing things like that how many times has he made it back to sergeant because hes brave and strong and even kind of clever when he isnt breaking heads if only he didnt look like a chimp in that case hed get another nicknamefoxface or whatever suited the way he did look sergei answered some people just naturally draw them and hes one yes i think so too interesting that you should notice stas eyed him as if wondering what to make of such unexpected perceptiveness sergei didnt know whether to feel proud or nervous under that dark southern scrutiny then he stopped worrying about it he had bigger things to worry about theyd reached warsaws outskirts and sure as hell the poles were shooting at them from the ground the formation loosened as all the pilots started jinking they sped up they slowed down they swung left they swung right they climbed a little they descended the more trouble the polesthe germanshad aiming at them the more likely theyd make it back to base jinking or not if your number was up it was up a direct hit tore off half an sbs right wing the stricken bomber tumbled toward the ground sergei flew past it before he could see whether any parachutes blossomed that could have been me he thought and shuddered there lay the vistula shining in the sun everything built up on the other side was warsaw proper ready ivan sergei called bet your stinking pussy kuchkov answered now sergei said if they had no orders to aim at anything in particular he wasnt about to make a fancy straight bombing run why let the gunners get a good shot at him as soon as the bombs fell away he hauled the sbs nose around and gunned it back to the east a few more shell bursts made the plane buck in the air but he heardand feltno fragments biting and if enemy fighters were in the air they were going after other red air force formations one more under our belts anastas mouradian said da sergei nodded along with rubber and oil and gasoline he could smell his own fearand maybe mouradians with it how could you go on doing this day after day month after month but what theyd do to you if you tried to refuse yes not flying missions was even scarier than flying them chapter fog shrouded the airstrip in northeastern france nobody was going anywhere this morning chances were nobody was going anywhere all day the idled luftwaffe flyers did what idled flyers had been doing since the first biplanes took off with pilots carrying pistols and hand grenades they sat around and shot the shit and passed flasks of applejack and cognac hansulrich rudel was happy enough to join the bull session when one of the flasks came to him he passed it on without drinking danke schon said the pilot to his left more for the rest of us nobody got out any milk for him another flyer said everybody in the battered farmhouse that did duty for an officers club laughed but the laughter sounded different from the way it would have not too long before then it would have been aimed at him deadly as the bullets from a hurricanes machine guns now he was an oberleutnant with the ritterkreuz at his throat his comrades might not love him but hed earned their respect coffee will do he said mildly and got another laugh coffees harder to come by than booze these days coffee worth drinking is anyhow said the pilot next to him the footwash they issue with our rations the other flyer made a horrible face frenchies dont have much of the good stuff left these days either another pilot complained or if they do theyre hiding it better than they used to i dont think theyve got it a third flyer said weve been in france since last year and here it is just about autumn come round again you can only scrounge so much after that theres nothing left to scrounge thered be plenty if wed got into paris the way we thought we would someone else said rudel couldnt see who it was the farmhouse was twistier than a fighter pilots mind he wouldnt have been surprised if the french family whod lived in it before fleeing in the early days of the war had unrolled balls of thread of different colors to guide them as they navigated from one room to another what was left of the upstairs seemed even worse a long silence followed the flyers remark anything that touched on politics was dangerous these days yes the squadron was a band of brothers but brothers could turn on one another toolook what happened to joseph some people feared that the gestapo got word of any even possibly disloyal remarks othershansulrich among themhoped the security service did he didnt want to inform on anyone else himself but he also didnt want to fly alongside people whose hearts werent in the fight well get there yet he said sure we will said another voice he couldnt easily match with a face but when and what will it cost will we get to moscow first someone else whistled softly hansulrich knew the twofront war wasnt popular with his comrades maybe it was even less popular than hed thought again no one seemed to care to take that particular bull by the horns at last the pilot sitting next to rudel said id rather have the poles on our side than against us they arent on our side to hansulrichs dismay that was colonel steinbrenner the squadron commander went on right this minute stalin scares them worse than the fuhrer does theres a difference youd better believe there is my friends jawohl herr oberst rudel said but it makes an army of a million men march against the bolsheviks side by side with us we ought to get the french and the english to do the same thinga crusade to rid the world of something that never should have been born a different kind of silence descended on the farmhouse one rather like the aftermath of a thousandkilogram bomb at last the fellow next to hansulrich said youve always been an optimist havent you when it comes to germany of course i have he answered proudly were all optimists about the vaterland colonel steinbrenner spoke as if challenging anyone there to argue with him when nobody did he continued but there is also a difference between optimism and blind optimism are you saying thats what i show sir rudel asked no no youre a good german patriot steinbrenner replied rudel would have thought hard about reporting him had he said anything else after all hed been brought in here to replace an officer in whom the fires of zeal didnt burn bright enoughor so the gestapo had concluded at any rate more highoctane liquor made the rounds several separate conversations started in place of the general one that was safer nobody could hear everything at once lickerish laughter said some of the flyers were talking about womena topic more dangerous than politics but in different ways hansulrich might be a teetotaler but he didnt stay away from the french girls his father wouldnt have approved but he didnt worry about that when he was with a girl he didnt worry about anything more precious than rubies the bible said and as usual it knew what it was talking about the biblical context might be different from the one hansulrich had in mind but he didnt worry about that either if we didnt fuck up this stupid goddamn war rudel heard the words through all the other chatter as one might hear a radio station through waves of static and competing signals his ears pricked up treason would do that you could say some things in some ways but there were limits this shot right past them he thought so anyhow he wondered how sergeant dieselhorst would feel about it dieselhorst was an older man and a veteran noncom both factors generated a broader view of mankinds foibles than a young officer who was also a ministers son was likely to have rudel suspected as much but only in a vague way he would not have been himself were he mentally equipped to grasp the full difference between how he thought and how albert dieselhorst did he didnt enjoy being the only sober man in the middle of a drunken bash who in his right mind would but this was nothing he hadnt been through before theyd think him a wet blanket if he stayed theyd think him an even worse wet blanket if he got up and walked out theyd think he thought he was better than they were he did too but hed learned that showing it only made things worse somebody not far away was going on about the vastness of russia and about how a war against a country like that could have no sure ending sober or not hansulrich got angry once we smash the reds well run the country for ourselves he said russia is our lebensraum england and france have colonies all over the world well get ours the way the americans did by grabbing the lands right next door yes but the americans only had to worry about red indians weve got red ivans and theyre tougher beasts the other flyer chuckled in not quite sober amusement at his wordplay ignoring it hansulrich said we can beat them we will beat them or do you think the fuhrers wrong the other fellows mouth twisted he couldnt say yes to a blunt question like that and he plainly didnt want to say no what he did say was we all hope the fuhrers not wrong that was probably safe rudel would have had to push to make something out of it he didnt want to push he wanted his comrades to like him the easiest way to do that would have been to act like them he couldnt bring himself to do it showing he was brave and skillful in combat was the next best thing the others didnt despise him any more anyhow progress he could throw it away in a flash if he got too strident about politics or about the way he thought the war ought to be going he said wherever we run into the enemy well whip him thats all thats what the kaisers general staff told him too the other flyer remarked we beat the enemy hansulrich said it was the traitors inside germany who made us lose hed been two years old when the last war ended he was parroting mein kampf not speaking from experience the other flyer was probably younger than he was thats not what my old man says he replied he was a lieutenant on the western front the last year and a half of the war they had swarms of panzers by the end of and most of ours were retreads we captured from the tommies he says we got whupped whats he doing now rudel asked hes a lieutenant colonel in poland why never mind if the complainer was fighting rudel couldnt call him a defeatist not out loud he couldnt what he thought he kept to himself little by little he was learning chaim weinbergs spanish was still lousy it would never be great but it was a hell of a lot better than it had been especially when he talked about the class struggle or dialectical materialism he hadnt liked the political agitators who indoctrinated the internationals so they would fight more ferociously if they needed that kind of indoctrination they wouldnt have come to spain to begin with or it looked that way to him the leaders of the international brigades and the soviet officers and apparatchiks who stood beside them held a different opinion theirs was the one that counted indoctrinating prisoners with the ideals of the republicand of the ussrwas different chaim told himself it was at any rate the hapless campesinos the nationalists had dragooned into their army needed to understand that everything theyd believed in before they were taken prisoner was a big steaming pile of mierda they exploited you he told the tough skinny ragged men who came to the edge of the barbed wire to listen to him he didnt fool himself into thinking he was all that fascinating time hung heavy for the pows anything out of the ordinary seemed uncommonly interesting they were shameless the way they exploited you sinverguenzahe loved the spanish word for shameless one of the captured nationalists raised a hand chaim pointed to him excuse me senor the fellow said apologetically but what does this word exploited mean chaim blinked hed known these peasants were ignorant but this took the cake they literally had to learn a whole new language before they could understand what he was talking about before he answered the prisoner he asked a question of his own how many others dont know what exploited means two or three other grimy hands went up after some hesitation a couple of more followed them how many other nationalists were holding back some unless he missed his guess bueno he said if you dont know ask how can you understand if you dont ask when the priests and the landlords exploit you they take advantage of you you do the hard work they have the money and the fancy houses and the fine clothes and the pretty girls who like those things they take your crops and they make most of the money from themes verdad o no the pows slowly nodded that was how things worked in spainhow they had worked before the republic and how they still worked where marshal sanjurjo and his lackeys governed joaquin delgadillo raised his hand chaim nodded to him he had a proprietary interest in joaquin what you say is true senor delgadillo had learned to slow down a little to give chaim a better chance to stay with him but how can things be different how can anyone do anything about it land reform chaim answered at once there are no landlords in the republic there were no live landlords in the republic not any more peasants own their lands sometimes they form collectives but no one makes them do that plenty of republican enthusiasts wanted to impose collective farms as stalin had in the ussr oddly soviet officials discouraged it they didnt want to scare the middle classes in the cities and towns but what about the holy padres another prisoner asked havent terrible things happened to them they sided with the reactionaries or most of them did they wanted to go on living well without working chaim said progressive priests follow the republic there were some there werent very many he didnt go into detail his job here was to persuade after all the priests say god is on marshal sanjurjos side they say the republic is the devils spawn the prisoner said y asi chaim asked and so what do you think they will say no one says god fights for his enemies but satan is with him no one would be that stupid but do you believe everything the padres tell you theyre holy men the spaniard said doubtfully he wasnt used to questioning assumptions he probably hadnt imagined assumptions could be questioned till he started listening to chaim exploited indoctrinated was it any wonder that when the people of spain found out they could overthrow the system that had been giving it to them in the neck for so long they often threw out the baby with the bath water how do you know theyre so holy chaim asked are they poor do they share what they have with people who are even poorer or do they suck up to the landlords and piss on the poor some of them are good men the captured nationalist answered perfection is for the lord he crossed himself as long as their grandfathers had put up with it before them a lot of spaniards would put up with anything they would be proud of putting up with it in fact because their grandfathers had before them well eastern european jews had put up with pogroms for generation after generation too chaims grandfather hadand no doubt his grandfather before him but chaims father had got the hell out of there and hightailed it for the states and here stood chaim in a bombscarred park in madrid not screwing around with the talmud but preaching the doctrine of marx and lenin and stalin some are good eh he said si senor the prisoner replied with dignity people here had immense dignityoften more than they knew what to do with okay chaim said and then remembering which language he was supposed to be speaking bueno he tried a different approach isnt it true that most of the priests you call good favor the republic that made the prisoner stop and think it made all the prisoners listening to him stop and think in fact they argued among themselves in low voices one man threw his hands in the air and walked away in disgust when the argument didnt seem to be going the way he wanted the rest patiently went on hashing it out they had plenty of time and they werent going anywhere chaim squatted on his heels and smoked a cigarette he wasnt going anywhere either not right away he owned more patience than hed had before coming to spain too if army life and army life in the land of manana at that wouldnt help you acquire some nothing would hed given the little cigarette butt to joaquin and lit another smokeand got almost all the way through that onebefore the pows came to some sort of consensus the fellow whod called priests holy men came up to the edge of the wire it could be senor that you have reason he said gravely many of these men the ones who did most for the poor did favor the republic some got into trouble for it some ran away to keep from getting into trouble and what does this mean do you think chaim inquired instead of yielding as hed hoped the nationalist prisoner only shrugged a slow shrug quien sabe senor he said who can be sure what anything means very often life is not so simple in spite of himself chaim started to laugh only in spain would a prisoner answer a political question with philosophy muy bien the american from the international brigades said what does this mean then italy and germany cant help marshal sanjurjo any more england and france can help the republic who is likely to do better now quien sabe the nationalist repeated we were winning before you are doing better at this moment but who can say anything about manana several long strongly carved faces showed somber agreement the response only made chaim laugh harder the prisoners gave him fishy stares wondering if he was mocking them he wasnt or not for that this is spain the land of manana i was just thinking about that if you cant talk about it here where can you senor they had to talk that over too before they decided how to feel about it it was almost as if they had their own little soviet here chaim didnt tell them that it would have scandalized them slowly one at a time they started to smile we did not think men from the republic could joke one of them said who says i was joking chaim answered deadpan the pows thought he was joking again and their smiles got broader he knew damn well he wasnt he grinned back at them all the same the brown bear in the cage stared out at sarah goldman and isidor bruck through the bars he looked plump and happy people in germany might have to shell out ration coupons for everything they ate but the zoo animals remained well fed germans were uncommonly kind to animals everyone said so when sarah remarked on that isidor looked around no aryans stood close enough to overhear him if he kept his voice down so he did they think jews are animals so why dont they treat us better sarah stared at him in something not far from amazement she would have expected a crack like that from her father not from somebody her own age but she didnt need long to figure out why the bakers son would come out with it if being a jew in national socialist germany didnt bring out gallows humor in people what the devil would isidor took a chunk of war bread out of his jacket pocket he tossed it into the bears cage the animal ambled over to it sarah wondered if hed turn up his nose at ithe probably got better himself animals were harder to fool than people but he ate the treat and ran his bloodpink tongue across his nose a guard bustled up he wore an impressive militarylooking uniform do not feed the animals it is forbidden he said importantly then he saw the yellow stars on their clothes he rolled his eyes aryan gray not brown and therefore of questionable breed you should be in cages yourselves obey or things will go even worse for you sarah was afraid he would grab the billy club on his belt but he turned on his heel and stomped off if we were in cages do you suppose anyone would feed us she asked bitterly some people wouldif they came by when nobody could see them do it and if they were sure the guard was somewhere else isidor said yes that sounds about right sarah remembered the germans whod sympathized with her after she had to start wearing the star she also remembered that no one had told the nazis they shouldnt make jews wear stars to begin with they wouldnt keep us out of cages though not a chance you bet isidor looked around i wish we could do something to the people whore putting the screws to us all i ever wanted to be was a german and look what ive got he brushed his hand across the yellow star samuel goldman could also have said that could her father had many times sarah didnt find it surprising shed said the same kind of thing herself too she almost told isidor about her brother but no what he didnt know he couldnt blurt out sauls life rode on secrecy and sauls fate rode on the tracks of a panzer he was bound to have aryan crewmates he was also bound to be fighting as hard as he could to help the nazis win their war how perverse was that as perverse as anything sarah had ever imagined perverse enough to let isidor notice the look on her face what is it he said are you all right its everything sarah answered at once im a jew in munster how can i be all right well it all depends on the company isidor said and then he turned a flaming red as if he were standing in front of one of his fathers back ovens with the door wide open and the heat blasting into his face he was sweeter on sarah than she was on him he was earnest and niceno two ways about that it wasnt even that she felt no spark when he took her hand but she thought she ought to feel a bigger one if something serious was going to happen or maybe she was crazy what kind of prospects did a jewish girl in munsteror anywhere in the reichhave these days if somebody not too bad liked you shouldnt you grab as hard as you could before he went into the wehrmacht a young professor whod studied under her father and done what little he could for him had been interested in her but he hadnt been interested enough to risk courting her she couldnt even blame him if she were an aryan she wouldnt risk courting a jew either life gave you plenty of tsuris at the best of times you didnt need to look for more she and isidor walked on a lion slept in the corner of his cage his head was twisted to one side as if he were an enormous tabby cat he seemed to sleep most of the time at least sarah hadnt seen him awake in several visits to the zoo lately well what else did he have to do shut away behind bars as if picking that thought from her mind isidor said i know just how the lion feels me too she exclaimed liking him better for that a giraffe stripped leaves from branches set on a bracket high up in its tall enclosure its jaws worked from side to side as it chewed a camel stared at the humans with ugly disdain then spat in their direction see isidor said even the camel knows were jews nah sarah shook her head it would have got us for sure if it did they both laughed sometimes you couldnt help it people walked by carrying steins a fat man his saggy skin suggested he once might have been fatter yet with a big white mustache sold beer from a handcart he pushed along in front of him want one isidor asked ive love one sarah said but she didnt go on or need to he doesnt have i dont serve jews plastered all over everything like a lot of the pigdogs isidor said lets try it whats the worst he can do tell us no right he hurried over to the beerseller sarah followed briskly as if isidor werent wearing a yellow star he told the man two please sorry kid the fellow said id like to honest to god i would my mothers father he was one of your people sometimes the clowns at city hall they give me a hard time about itbut only sometimes on account of i just got the one grandfather but if they was to think i wanted to be one myself he turned a thumb toward the ground as if he were shouting for blood in a roman amphitheater so sarah thought about it but her father taught or had taught ancient history isidor might have seen things differently but he also couldnt miss the beersellers meaning the bakers son sighed theyll come for you anyway you know they may come later but theyll come oh sure the old man whuffled air out through his mustache but when youve got as many kilometers on you as i do i figure its about even money i crap out on my own before the bastards get around to it he dipped his head to sarah sorry for the way i talk miss its all right she set her hand on isidors arm it might have beenshe thought it wasthe first time shed reached out to touch him even innocently like that instead of the other way around see i said he wouldnt yeah you did isidor touched the brim of his ratty cap in a mournful salute to the beerseller good luck you too with a grunt the fellow lifted the handcarts handles the iron tires rattled on the slates as he shoved it down the path between the cages did you notice something sarah said after he got out of earshot i noticed he was a jerk isidor said probably in lieu of something stronger what else was there to notice he wouldnt say jew sarah answered his grandfather was one of you people he had just the one grandfather he didnt want to be one he knew what he didnt want to be but he wouldnt say it ever since hitler took over i bet hes been going oh no not me i aint one of them isidor said by now he may even believe it whether he does or not he sure wants to he scowled after the man and hes right dammit he may not last till they decide to land on him with both feet we arent so lucky theyve only landed on us with one foot so far sarah said and maybe that was the worst thing of all she knew or imagined she knew how much worse things could get wind whistled through the pines it came out of the northwest and it carried the chill of the ice with it when winds brought blizzards to japan in the winter people said they came straight from siberia it wasnt winter yetit was barely fallbut you could already feel how much worse things were going to get here sergeant hideki fujita was in siberia as he had in mongolia farther west he discovered that the winds just used this place to take a running start before they roared over the ocean and slammed into the home islands they were already frigid by the time they got here when will the snow start he asked another noncom a fellow whod served in northeastern manchukuo for a long time tomorrow the day after next week maybe next month but thats pushing things the other sergeant said dont worry about it when the snow does start youll know all right hai hai hai fujita said impatiently he looked north miserable russiansll cause even more trouble than they did when the weather was goodor as good as it gets around here i mean theyre animals the other sergeant replied with conviction where they come from they live with winters like this all the time its no wonder theyre so hairy their beards help keep their faces from freezing off i believe it fujita said i wanted to let my own whiskers grow when we were in mongolia to try and keep my chin warm but the company co wouldnt let us do it he said we had to stay neat and clean and represent the real japan officers are like that the other fellow agreed shigata ga nai neh we grew beards along the ussuri ill tell you we tried anyhow most of us couldnt raise good ones it just looked like fungus on our faces but this one guyhe had a pelt we called him the ainu because he was so hairy did he come from hokkaido fujita asked with interest the natives the japanese had largely supplanted lived on the northern island though theyd once inhabited northern honshu as well no that was the funny thing about it sakata came from kyushu way down in the south the other noncom lit a cigarette then offered fujita the pack arigato fujita took one and leaned close for a light once he had the smoke going he continued maybe he had a gaijin in the woodpile then isnt nagasaki where the portuguese and the dutch used to come to trade i think so he didnt look it though he wasnt pale like a fish belly the way white men are and he didnt have a big nose or anything he was just hairier than anybody else ive seenanybody japanese i mean i understood you fujita said foreigners were bignosed and hairy and paleor even blackwhich marked them off from the finer sort of people who lived in japan oh there were foreigners who didnt look too funny koreans and chinese for instance but their habits set them apart from the japanese koreans slathered garlic on anything that didnt move chinese were opiumsmoking degenerates who were too stubborn to see that they needed japanese rulers to bring sense and order to their immense ramshackle country the wind blew harder a few crows scudded south on its stream high above them a raven sported crows were businesslike birds flying from here to there straight as airplanes ravens performed gliding and diving and looping fujita liked crows better but they were leaving getting out while the getting was good he wished he could do the same if some kami touched him and gave him wings hed fly straight home unless a kindly kami touched him he was stuck here when do you think vladivostok will fall the other sergeant asked not quite out of the blue it should be soon fujita answered all the news reports say the russians cant hold out much longer and were sitting on their lifeline if not for the transsiberian railway this would have been the most worthless country anywhere the news reports have been saying soon for a long time now when does soon stop being soon itll work out fujita said confidently the last time we fought the russians port arthur took a long time to fall but it finally did well thats true the other noncom admitted id rather be here than trying to break into vladivostok too theyre fighting there like they fought in front of port arthurwith charges and trenches and machine guns everywhere how do you know fujita asked it wasnt that he disbelieved itit sounded only too probable but he hadnt heard it before and nothing like it had been in the news ive got a cousin down there i hope hes all right casualties are pretty high the other man answered and i hope like anything they dont decide to ship us down there eee fujita made an unhappy noise they were liable to do that if they ran low on menor if they decided they didnt need so many here to keep the russians from opening the railroad line again russian snipers firing from high in the trees were bad fujita thought about russian machine guns sweeping the ground in front of vladivostok he thought about rushing from a japanese trench to a russian one and running into a stream of russian machinegun bullets halfway across the broken landscape makes my asshole pucker and my balls crawl into my belly the other sergeant laughedunhappily i wouldnt have come out with it like that but it does the same thing to me you stay in this game for a while you get a feel for whats bad and whats even worse thats right fujita said you do if youre a noncom anyway im not so sure officers can tell he never would have said that where an officer could hear him of course but he was confident a fellow sergeant wouldnt betray him and the other man nodded youre lucky if your officers know enough to grab it with both hands now each had something slanderous on the other they both grinned not long before fujita had been thinking about russian snipers in the trees a mosinnagant rifle cracked a couple of hundred meters off to the left the report was deeper and louder than the ones that came from japanese arisakas yells and commotion from the japanese lines said the sharpshooter had hit somebody a moment later another shot rang out that raised a bigger uproar zakennayo fujita exclaimed what do you want to bet they showed themselves getting the wounded man to cover so the sniper hit somebody else youre bound to be right the other sergeant answered the russians like to play those games you have to be stupid to fall for them stupid or careless but sometimes people are we wouldnt be people if we werent fujita said or werent you sweet on some girl or other before you got sucked into the army oh sure but when youre talking about girls at least you get to have fun being stupid there is that fujita allowed just for a moment loneliness knifed him in the heart fun hed almost forgotten about fun the most fun you could have in war was not getting shot that negative made for cold comfort of course with this wind there was no warm comfort for heaven only knew how many kilometers vladivostok of their own accord fujitas eyes slid south he didnt want to stay where he was but he sure didnt want to go down there either as far as he was concerned they could starve the stinking russians into submission if it took a while so what it wasnt as if japan needed to use vladivostok right away all she needed was to keep the russians from using it and she was already doing that the people who ran things would see it differently fujita had no doubts on that score he wished he did but he didnt they would worry about things like prestige the sooner japan took the russian city the better shed look they wouldnt care about how many soldiers turned into ravens meat in the doing fujita did he didnt want to be one of those soldiers the only trouble was he could do exactly nothing about it if they ordered his regiment to storm the works in front of vladivostok it would damn well storm themor die trying that was what worried him chapter luc harcourt looked around more and more poilus kept coming into the line more and more tanks and other armored contraptions sheltered in groves or under camouflage netting not far behind it i think they really mean it this time the other members of his machinegun crew shrugged in a unison that looked staged all the more so as pierre joinville was small and swarthy while fair tiny villehardouin was anything but tiny said something incomprehensible presumably in breton joinville said something perfectly comprehensible in southernaccented french the cons have meant it before that doesnt matter for shit what matters is whether they can do it right for a change tiny nodded so either that was what he meant or it was something else he might have said you never could tell with him but he was strong as an ox and hed go forward when he got the order so who cared you didnt know what he was talking about big deal as often as not you didnt want to know what a private was saying that was one of lucs discoveries since becoming a corporal weve got a chance this time i think he said damn boches dont have their peckers up the way they did before they started fighting in poland too it could be joinville said as much as a private was likely to give a corporal luc remembered that from his days with no rank at all oh yes the gascon went on other question is do we have our peckers up now that was the question all right its answer would also go a long way towards answering the other question the one from the english play to be or not to be luc glanced down at his hands they were battered and scarred and filthy the nails short and ragged but they opened and closed at his command they could yank the cork from a bottle of cognac or cup a girls soft warm breast or knock down half a dozen germans at five hundred meters with the hotchkiss gun they were marvelous things marvelous hanging around in the trenches was pretty safe oh you might be unlucky but your odds were decent but if the french advanced there hed be out in the open just waiting for a shell fragment or a machinegun bullet to do something dreadful and how much would his clever hands help then they could slap on a wound bandage they could give him a shot of morphine so he didnt hurt so much it seemed inadequate he hunted up sergeant demange if anybody was likely to know what was going on demange was the man he greeted luc with his customary warmth what the fuck do you want love you too sarge luc said demange grunted and waited he wouldnt wait long hed start snarlingor worse luc hurried ahead are we really going to give the feldgraus one in the teeth sure as hell looks that way demange answered any other questions no then piss off why dont you instead of pissing off luc asked how bad will it be all things considered id sooner get a blowjob the sergeant said and lit a fresh gitane merci beaucoup luc left behind him demange didnt even bother laughing and yet hed found out what he needed to know the attack was coming and the sergeant wasnt looking forward to it demange had done his attacking in the dose hed got then cured him of eagerness forever after luc gauged the temper of the new fish instead when the war first broke outgood god was it really a year ago nowhe and his buddies had tiptoed into germany then tiptoed right back out again theyd been waiting to get kicked in the teeth as soon as the boches were ready theyd got what they were waiting for too the new guys werent intimidated by the germans or by the idea of advancing against them the way luc and his buddies had been or maybe their officers werent intimidated the way the fellows with the fancy kepis had been a year earlier they thought they could go forward and win that was half the battle right there if you werent licked before you even set out you had a chance october the day the hour luc had his machinegun team ready villehardouin and joinville were pretty much selfwinding they tolerated luc not least because he didnt try to pretend they couldnt do it without him they knew damn well they could so did he it was chilly and drizzly in the wee small hours but nowhere near enough rain came down to bog the tanks that had rattled forward under cover of darkness at right on schedule the french artillery roared to life see how you like that cocksuckers luc yelled through highexplosive thunder german artillery started shooting back inside of five minutes some of the boches shells went after the french batteries others pounded the front line the germans knew their onions a big barrage meant the french were going to follow it up the worse the germans could hurt them the better if you were a german at whistles shrilled in the french trenches forward officers shouted tanks growled toward the german lines cannon blasting and machine guns braying joinville and villehardouin lugged the machine gun and its tripod ahead a pair of glum new fish carried crates full of ammunition strips luc had his rifle and an infantrymans usual equipment for the moment nothing morerank did have its privileges but he would turn into a beast of burden in a hurry if one of his crew went down a machine gun was important in the grand scheme of things a corporals dignity much less so the french guns increased their range so they didnt land shells on the advancing poilus the german guns shortened range so they did a round from a came down right on top of a tank fire fountained from the stricken machine a black column of smoke mounted to the sky machinegun ammo cooked off with cheerful little popping noises poor buggers joinville said wouldnt even be that much left of us if the shell hit here luc answered the gascon grunted and nodded a german mg the bombardment hadnt silenced started spitting death across the field luc envied the boches their weapon it was lighter than a hotchkiss gun and it fired faster too you could carry it and fire it from the hip if you had to he tried to imagine firing the twentyodd kilos of the hotchkiss from the hip the picture wouldnt form and for good reason tracers from the german machine gun sparked closer to the hotchkiss crew down luc yelled he followed his own order diving into a shell hole we set up joinville asked anything that gave luc an excuse not to stand again sounded good right then yeah lets he said joinville and villehardouin got the heavy hotchkiss onto the even heavier tripod one of the new guys fed a strip into the weapon staying as low as he could luc peered over the forward lip of the shell hole the mgs bullets had gone past it now they cracked by again maybe a meter and a half above the ground chesthigh on an upright man those shapes in the misty rainy morning twilight were germans germans trying to get away from oncoming frenchmen having been a frenchman trying to get away from more oncoming germans than he cared to remember luc relished the sight of fieldgray backs he fired a couple of bursts at them maybe hed knock some of them down hed sure as hell make the ones he didnt hit run faster a french tank shelled the mg into silence come on luc said lets get moving again his crew hid their enthusiasm very well but they obeyed luc didnt want to hit his own countrymen in front of the gun tanks smashed paths through the german wire here and there fritzes still stayed and fought in their battered holes one by one they died or gave up a landser with a scared whippeddog grin on his face showed himself hands high ami he said cmere friend luc said and relieved him of his watch and wallet some of these germans carried fat wads of francson their side of the line french money wasnt worth much luc gestured with his rifle go on back danke uhmerci the new prisoner said hands still over his head to show hed surrendered he stumbled off into captivity he didnt have to worry about the war any more luc did lets go he said they pushed on through the shattered german defenses it couldnt be this easy could it it had never been this easy beforehe was goddamn sure of that he had no idea how long it would stay easy either as long as it did hed go along with it of course the republicans set up a radio outside the pow camp in the park in madrid and of course they always tuned it to their own stations joaquin delgadillo hadnt listened to those when he fought in marshal sanjurjos army it wasnt that the nationalists jammed them though they did and the republicans jammed nationalist radio sometimes the whole dial sounded like waterfalls and sizzling lard but this was radio madrid and they were right next to the sender it overpowered the jamming with ease the republican announcer might have been standing right there reading from a script and now the news he said french and english armies have gone over to the offensive against the german invaders gains of several kilometers are reported so are rumors that german commanders in france have been sacked because their troops retreated sacked im surprised they didnt shoot them someone behind joaquin said he found himself nodding both sides in spain had executed officers who went back when their superiors thought they should go forward as for common soldiers that went without saying common soldiers always got it in the neckor the back of the head depending in poland the forces of the workers and peasants the glorious soldiers of the red army continue to press forward against the fascists and their sympathizers the newsreader went on many germans and poles willingly surrender to join the socialist cause nationalist radio continually reported german and italian triumphs somebody had to be lying before joaquin was captured he would have been certain it was the republicans he wasnt so sure any more these days he wasnt sure of anything maybe both sides were lying as hard as they could that wouldnt have surprised himoh no not even a little bit american president roosevelt has proposed an end to the war on the basis of all sides returning to their positions before the fighting began the announcer said in rejecting this hitler likened it to unscrambling an egg he said czechoslovakia would never be independent again and that germany would fight on to ultimate victory the man let out a dry chuckle how germany can gain ultimate victory while retreating in both east and west hitler did not explain joaquin didnt know what to make of that every time he saw the germans in action here in spain they made things go forward the italians who came to help marshal sanjurjo didnt care about the fight one way or the other but germans germans made things happen he made the mistake of saying that to chaim weinberg the republic agitator from the united states turned the color of a sunset fuck em all he said fuck their mothers too up the ass you hate them so much because theyre fascists delgadillo said because theyre fascists si weinberg answered and because they hate jews a light dawned weinberg was a jew himself he might have put that reason second but he meant it first spaniards hate jews too joaquin said do you hate spaniards why did you come here if you hate spaniards its different here the american mumbled really different how joaquin asked honestly puzzled hate is hate isnt it with you spaniards hating jews is only aa tradition like weinberg said you dont go out of your way to do it how can we joaquin laughed out loud youre the first jew i ever saw in my life we threw ours out hundreds of years ago maybe thats it weinberg said you people just know you used to hate jews there are still plenty in germany and the nazis go to town on them that had to be an english idiom translated literally joaquin had heard weinberg do such things before the american made himself understood but you never doubted you were listening to a foreigner after working out what he had to mean delgadillo said what about the estados unidos is your country a jews paradise weinberg snorted not hardly but it could be worse some people there do hate jews yes but more of them hate negroes worse they treat negroes the way europeans treat jews but you would sooner change how spain does things than how your own country does them eh joaquin said shrewdly the americanthe jewstarted to say something then he closed his mouth with a snap when he opened it again he let out a sheepish chuckle well you may be right he said which surprised joaquin he hadnt thought weinberg would admit any such thing weinberg went on other americans are trying to make things better for negroes i thought fighting against the nazis was more important how many of the americans working for your negroes are jews delgadillo asked quite a few why now joaquin found himself surprised again in a different way i would have guessed your jews would let your negroes go hang as long as other americans have negroes to hate most of them leave jews alone isnt that what you said yes i said that but it doesnt mean what you said it means on the far side the free side of the barbed wire weinberg paused to figure out whether that meant what he wanted it to mean he must have decided it did because he went on injustice to anyone anywhere is injustice to everyone everywhere you have to fight it wherever you find it you must enjoy tilting at windmills joaquin had never read don quixote hed read very little but cervantes phrases filled the mouths of spaniards whether they could read or not fighting against fascism isnt tilting at windmills weinberg said fascism is the real enemy on the other side of the line they think the same thing about communism joaquin said on the other side of the line theyre wrong weinberg sounded as sure of himself as a priest quoting from the bible delgadillo didnt think that would be a good thing to tell him the jew went on communism wants to treat every man and every woman the same way badlythey would say over there joaquin still more than half believed it himself he couldnt insist on it too strongly though not when he depended on good will from these people if he wanted to keep breathing how well did they treat you over there the jew asked you were a peasant and then you were a private do you want your son to live the way you used to live through most of spains history the only possible answer to that would have been well how else is he going to live things changed only slowly here when they changed at all but joaquin had seen that there were other possibilities he didnt like all of themhe liked few of them in factbut he knew they were there stalling for time he said i have no son weinberg snorted impatiently you know what i mean and joaquin did well senor i mean no disrespect when i say thisplease believe me for it is truebut i am sure i do not want my son to grow up a red why weinberg challenged whats so bad about equality making everyone equal by pushing the bottom up would not be so bad joaquin said slowly making everyone equal by pulling the top down that is not so good or i dont think so and it seems to me that is what the republic aims to do he waited for the top to fall down on him hed probably said more than he should have but the american had asked dammit on the other side of the wire weinberg paused thoughtfully you really are smarter than you look he said at last the only thing ill say to that is sometimes you have to tear down before you can build up well senor it could be delgadillo replied by which he meant he didnt believe it for a minute weinberg wagged a finger at him what are we going to do about you it is your choice you caught me maybe i should have shot you when i did maybe you should have i thought you would better to reeducate you the jew said joaquin wondered if he was right pete mcgill enjoyed talking with officers no better than any other marine corporal in his right mind officers to him were at best necessary evils at worst unnecessary ones sometimes though you had no choice like st peter officers had the power to bind and to loose captain ralph longstreet had never said he was related to the confederate general of the same last name then again hed never said he wasnt he did have a drawl thick enough to slice a hell of a lot of marinesand even more marine officers it seemedwere southern men looking up from his paperwork he said well mcgill what can i do for you today sir you may have heard ive uh got friendly with a lady here in shanghai mcgill answered his own new york accent was about as far from what longstreet spoke as it could be while remaining american english the captain capped his fountain pen and set it on his battleship of a desk a dancer named vera kuznetsova he said vera smith that would be in english uh yes sir pete hadnt known what veras last name meant he hadnt cared either and still didnt but he knew exactly what longstreets tone meant its not like shes chinese or anything sir shes as white as you or me white russian to be exact longstreet said what nationality does she have on her passport he had to know the answer before he asked the question sir her folks got out of siberia a length ahead of the reds she got out of harbin a length ahead of the japs they had papers from the tsar i guess she did too when she was a baby now he shook his head officially shes stateless then captain longstreet made it sound like a death sentence for a lot of people it had been the wrong papers or no papers at all could be a disease deadlier than cholera well sir pete took a deep breath she wouldnt be sir not any more not after she married me longstreet had been about to light up an old gold he paused just before striking the match why dont you shut the door son and sit your ass down he said gulping pete obeyed he didnt think longstreet sounded friendly all of a suddenthe tone was more like the warden asking a condemned prisoner what he wanted for his last meal petes anxiety only grew when longstreet offered him a cigarette it made him think of firing squads not knowing what else to do he took the coffin nail anyhow longstreet waited till hed got halfway down the smoke before continuing youve got it bad dont you sir im in love pete said she loves me too honest to god she does well its possible i reckon stranger things have happened longstreet said he was a captain pete couldnt bust him in the face marrying vera while he was stuck in the brig would be hard to say the least longstreet went on but do you figure she hasnt got you tabbed for a meal ticket too all of petes buddies said the same goddamn thing he was sick of hearing it well what if she does sir she couldve picked other guys to play games with but she didnt she does love me and i he stopped his tongue clogging up his mouth talking about what he felt for veraeven trying to talk about itwas far and away the hardest thing hed ever done charging a jap machinegun nest would have been nothing next to it the japs could only kill him had longstreet yelled at him or worse laughed at him he would have sat there and taken it but something inside him would have died he expected one or the other looking for sympathy from an officer was a losing game but the captain said well your sentiments do you credit and you arent going into this with your eyes shut tight anyhow thats something how do you mean sir pete asked if you reckon youre the first marine to fall head over heels for a russian dancing girl or a chinese singsong girl i have to tell you youre mistaken longstreet said a lot of em think their sweethearts were virgins till they charmed the girls off their feet and into bed you seem to know better than that eryes sir petes ears heated hed wished he might have been veras first but he hadnt been able to imagine he really was he mumbled she never tried to pretend anything different one for her then the captain said youve got it bad but you could have it worse all i want to do is make it legal she does too im sure she does longstreets voice was dry as dust the advantages for her are obvious im sure the advantages for you are obvious too but they arent the kind thats got anything to do with whats legal and what isnt petes ears caught fire again well sir what the dickens am i gonna do its not a simple question first theres the issue of whether you ought to marry the mm the young lady captain longstreet raised a hand i know you think so now but whether you will a year from now may be a different story like i said you arent the first marine ive seen in this boat yes sir pete muttered as far as he was concerned whatever longstreet knew about love hed got out of books you could read about bar brawls too but reading about them wouldnt tell you what getting into one was like and i hate to have to remind you of it but you are a marine on active duty longstreet added you cant just go marrying somebody the way you could if you were a couple of civilians back in the states i understand that sir thats how come i came to see you okay now we get down to the really hard part its not easy for a marine on active duty to get married hes supposed to be a marine first not a husband first the country does expect that of him longstreet sighed and if you reckon its hard for a marine to get hitched in a regular way its at least five times as hard for him to tie the knot with a stateless person at least he spoke with a certain somber satisfaction tell me what ive got to do whatever it is ill do it pete declared to his surprise the captain smiled it was a wintry smile but it was a smile even so you sound like a marine all right longstreet said sir i am a marine sir pete sprang to his feet and came to rigor mortislike attention at ease son longstreet told him at ease sit down relax take an even strain this may happen i wont tell you its impossible but it wont be easy and it wont be quick if you think it will youll burn out your bearings and you wont get anything for it but heartache tell me what to do pete repeated youve done the first thing you needed to do youve brought it to my attention now im going to have to talk to the judge advocate hell tell me where the mines are and how you can go about sweeping them longstreet must have had a lot of sea duty to think of mines in the water instead of mines buried under the ground well he wasnt old enough to have gone over there in when will you talk with him sir when will he figure out what needs doing pete was all eagerness it was his life of course it was only ralph longstreets job and a small annoying part of his job at that i see herb every day of course he answered ill fill him in on whats troubling you and after that its in his hands he may have to talk with some other people too pete had thoughthad hopedthis might be a matter of days now he saw all too plainly that it would be weeks or months if not the threatened year his shoulders lost the iron brace theyd kept even while he sat in the hard wooden chair in front of longstreets desk well thanks for starting things anyway sir you did that the officer said and if youre still as ready to go through with it by the time were all done as you are now id say your chances with this girl will be a lot better than they are today he picked up the fountain pen anything else on your mind as long as youre here uh no sir okay dismissed longstreet went back to work pete stood up saluted and left the captains office he wondered if hed done himself and vera more harm than good willi dernen didnt know where the hell he was somewhere in francesomewhere between where he had been and the border with the low countries he couldnt smell paris couldnt taste victory any more all he smelled was trouble he shivered under his summerweight tunic it was cold as a witchs tit if the winter was as bad as it gave signs of being itd freeze his balls off his breath smoked that was bad an alert enemy soldier could spot the fog puffs rising into the chilly air and lie in wait to pot the poor bastard who was making them but he didnt know what he could do about it stop breathing no thanks a grayhaired french peasant watching sheep in a meadow stared at him with no expression at all chances were the fellowd gone through the mill in the last war would he sneak off to tell the poilus where the germans were he might the froggies had been polite even friendly while the wehrmacht had the bit between its teeth and why not theyd figured they would stay german a long time the way they had after now they were wondering that would mean more trouble down the line sure as hell it would something else moved willis scopesighted rifle swung that way as if it had a life of its own but it wasnt a poilu it was corporal baatz coming out of the bushes reluctantly willi lowered the rifles muzzle tempting as it was he couldnt go and plug awful arno he didnt suppose he could anyhow the unloved corporal was his lord and master again hed been reattached to his old unit within hours after oberfeldwebel puttkamer got his head blown off he was still surprised they hadnt made him turn in the fancy mauser somebodyd slipped up there baatz saw him too and waved he didnt raise his hand too high you never could tell what would draw a snipers eye willi wondered what had happened to the goddamn czech with the antipanzer rifle he was probably still busy nailing germans puttkamer wasnt around to quarrel with him any more that was for sure wie gehts awful arno asked willi shrugged im still here if i get hungry ill shoot me a sheep he paused considering hell with it he thought and went on wars pretty goddamn fucked up though isnt it he might have known baatz wouldnt admit what was as plain as the nose on his piggy face you cant talk like that the noncom insisted why the hell not willi said its true isnt it its disloyal thats what it is baatz answered i knew the gestapo guys knew what they were doing when they started sniffing around you and your asshole buddy storch and they had too all the same willi said oh fuck off man if you cant tell we screwed the pooch youre too dumb to go on living awful arno turned red watch your big mouth before you open it so wide you fall in and disappear you keep going on like that ill report youso help me god i will go ahead willi said wearily maybe youll get me yanked out of the line if you do ill be better off than you are that only made baatz madder you dont know what the devil youre talking about wait till they chuck you into dachau youll wish you only had machine guns to worry about the blackshirts had said the same thing willi wasnt about to take it from awful arno give me a break if telling the truth is disloyal then i guess i am jesus christ the war is screwed up even a blind man can see it even you should be able to youre not just talking about the war baatz said youre talking about how were fighting it and if you say thats gone wrong youre saying the fuhrers leadership isnt everything it ought to be yeah and so hes the fuhrer hes not god for crying out loud when he takes a crap angels dont fall out of his asshole willi said awful arnos eyes widened he looked like an uncommonly sheltered child hearing about the facts of life for the first time hes the fuhrer he said on a note as different from willi as could be ja ja and the grofaz too willi said the cynical contraction of the german for greatest military leader of all time but if hes so goddamn great how come were retreating how come paris is way the hell over there he pointed west before baatz could answer a mortar bomb burst a hundred meters behind them they both threw themselves flat more bombs came down some of them closer fragments whined and snarled overhead willi looked around without raising his head sure as hell that frenchman had bailed out and a couple of sheep were down and kicking spit filled his mouth mutton chops arno baatz shielded his face with his arm as if that would do any good so dachau is worse than this is it willi said the corporal nodded without raising his head youd better believe it is and everybody who doubts the fuhrer will end up in a place like that conviction filled his voice scheisse willi said if he messed up the warand he damn well didsomebody needs to doubt him dont you think i hope to god im not the only one or germanys even more screwed up than i figured hes the fuhrer if we live through this dernen i will report you go ahead willi said wondering if he would have to make sure awful arno damn well didnt live through it he would if he had to but he didnt want to killing someone on his own side in cold blood wasnt what hed signed up for he went on ill call you a motherfucking liar and say you always had it in for meand thats the truth too you think the officers dont know what kind of asshole you are baatz yeah report me its your word against mine i bet they believe me not you and you end up in the concentration camp you dont get it do you baatz sounded almost pitying this is security were talking about of course theyll believe me theyd believe somebody with a working brain maybe but not a fuckup like you willi retorted like i said they know better go ahead report me cuntface youll find out maybe he was right maybe he was wrong maybe nobodyd take any chances and theyd both wind up in dachau if they did he was willing to bet hed last longer than awful arno and maybe they wouldnt live through this and it would all be moot willi lifted his head a few centimeters something that wasnt a sheep moved atop the next little swell of ground to the west willi brought his rifle to his shoulder and snapped a shot at it it disappeared down the back side of the hillock what was that baatz asked well it might have been a hippo escaped from the zoo or it might have been a frenchman willi chambered a fresh round odds were it was a frenchy so if you want to live long enough to rat on me get your empty ostrich head out of the sand and start acting like a soldier hed never had the chance to tell off a noncom like this it was fun it might almost be worth getting shot almost if baatz got shot too two french soldiers came over that hillock they were more cautious than the first fellow had beenthey knew there were landsers on this side which he hadnt willi fired at one of them then he rolled away from baatz and into the bushes once the shooting started you wanted as much cover as you could find awful arno fired at the poilus too he was a decent combat soldier even willi whod despised him for a year now would have admitted as much he headed for something that might be cover too off to the left a german mg started sawing away a small smile crossed willis face he loved machine gunshis own sides machine guns anyhow they were the best guarantee a poor ordinary ground pounder had that hed go on pounding ground a while longer the mg didnt just knock over enemy soldiers it made them concentrate on it so they forgot all about willi and baatz he got a clean shot at a fellow crawling along in a khaki greatcoat the fancy mauser thumped his shoulder the poilu doubled up sorry buddy willi thought but you would have done the same thing to me they held the french in place till the late afternoon by then willi had a wellpositioned wellprotected foxholebut no sheep carcass to keep him company dammit even so he was ready to stay a while but a runner came up to order the line back half a kilometer the germans withdrew under cover of darkness willi and arno baatz almost tripped over each other they exchanged glares grofaz willi said again defiantly if the fuhrer was so fucking smart how come they were going backwards pretty soon even awful arno would start wondering about things like that wouldnt he chapter sailors threw lines from the u to the men waiting on the pier the other ratings caught the ropes and made the uboat fast all engines stop julius lemp called through the speaking tube all engines stopped the reply came back and the diesels throb died into silence lemp sighed especially since the schnorkel had come to let the diesels run almost all the time that throb had soaked into his bones doing without it felt strange unnatural wrong he sighed again wilhelmshaven he said to no one in particular home port sounds good to me gerhart beilharz declared well sure it does lemp said you wont have to wear your iron pot all the time no and ill probably clonk myself a couple of times when i dont have it on the tall engineering officer answered too goddamn many doorways arent made for people my size and sometimes i forget to duck that is a bad habit for a uboat officer lemp said with mock severity ill try to unlearn it beilharz stretched the space right under the conning toward was the only one in the boat where he could do that without clouting somebody be good to get my feet on dry land again even if itll feel like its rolling under me for a little while theyll probably pin an iron cross first class on you for the snort lemp told him it did us some good no two ways about it im glad you think so skipper i know you had your doubts when the technicians installed it that was putting things mildly lemp didnt feel like rehashing it though all he said was weve earned some time ashore as the sailors trooped off the uboat a commander nodded to lemp and said admiral donitzs compliments and he would like to speak with you at your convenience if you would care to come with me at your convenience plainly meant right this minute and if lemp didnt care to go with the commander he damn well would anyway two unsmiling sailors with rifles and helmets behind the officer made that obvious i am at the admirals service of course lemp replied which meant just what it said donitz sat behind a broad desk piled high with papers he had a broad face that tapered to a narrow pointed chin but for a thin beak of a nose his features were rather flat well how do you like the schnorkel he asked without preamble sir its more useful than i thought it would be lemp answered its given less trouble than i expected from an experimental gadget too and beilharz does a fine job of keeping it healthy hes a good officer he didnt fracture his skull inside the boat donitz inquired with a smile lemp blinked did the admiral keep every junior lieutenant in his mental card file maybe he did by god a couple of flesh wounds nothing worse lemp said after a beat thats good and its good you sank a royal navy destroyer were going to win the scandinavian campaign even if england and france havent quite figured that out yet the admiral in charge of uboats said im glad to hear it sir i know weve hurt the royal navy badly yes mostly with uboats and landbased aircraft though the big ships did get that one carrier donitz said theyve hurt our surface forces too and we have less to spare than they do but we dominate the waters in the eastern north sea and thats the point his telephone rang excuse me he picked it up donitz here someone gabbled excitedly in his ear lemp was astonished to see his jaw drop donitz was for the most part an imperturbable man not today what he barked are you sure what is the situation in berlin are you sure of that well youd better be call me the minute you have more information he slammed the handset into its cradle whats up sir lemp asked anything i need to know about donitz took a deep breath hes going to tell me to get lost lemp thought what the devil was going on but the admiral didnt do thatnot quite maybe you and your men should stick close to barracks for the next couple of days he said sir we just got in after a cruise lemp protested the boys deserve the chance to blow off some steam its not as if he broke off as if youd sunk the athenia again donitz finished for him lemp gave back a miserable nod that was what had been in his mind all right admiral donitz went on no this isnt your fault but they should do it anyhow for their own safety things may get ugly he seemed to pick the word with malice aforethought can you tell me whats going on lemp asked only that its political donitz replied listen to the radio youll probably piece things togetheras well as anyone can right now oh and dont be surprised if you find the barracks under guard that raised more questions than it answered lemp chose the one that looked most important political sir what do you mean political what i said donitz seemed to lose patience with him all at once you are dismissed lemp saluted and got out he hadnt closed the door before the admiral grabbed for the telephone again the commander was waiting in donitzs anteroom whats up he asked when he got a look at lemps face ask your boss sir lemp said the commander looked impatient as best he could lemp recounted what had gone on after the phone rang der herr jesus the other officer said after hed finished somethings gone into the shitter all right youd better do what the admiral suggested things are liable to get nasty in a hurry if he didnt know what was going on he had his suspicions what do you mean lemp inquired just sit tight i hope im wrong the commander said which only frustrated lemp more instead of giving him any answers he could actually use the other officer hurried into donitzs sanctum why dont you do what commander tannenwald says sir one of the armed ratings said now lemp had a name to go with the face the fellow with the stahlhelm and the mauser should have had no business giving him orders his muscle and his friends and their weapons were very persuasive the two of them escorted lemp back to his crew a few minutes after he got to the barracks rifle shots and a short burst from a machine gun rang out not nearly far enough away what the hell is going on peter demanded no one answered no one couldno one else knew either the helmsman turned on the radio in the barracks hall syrupy music poured out of it that was no help when the tune ended the announcer said remain obedient to duly constituted authority then he played another record whats that supposed to mean lemp asked he got no more answer than peter had more gunfire came from the edge of the naval base the lights outside the barracks hall suddenly went out one of the guards stuck in his head and said the watchword is heil hitler remember it he shut the door before anybody could ask him any questions lemp wasnt sure what to ask anyway and if people were running around with guns the wrong question was liable to have a permanent answer lieutenant beilharz took him aside and spoke in a low voice skipper i think some kind of coup is going on what do we do the same unwelcome thought had crossed lemps mind what can we do go back to the u and start shooting things up with the deck gun we dont even know which side is which best thing is to sit tight and wait to see what happens or have you got a better idea well what wasnt beilharz saying what were his politics what did he think lemps were terrible for a fighting man to need to worry about things like that the engineering officer sighed and nodded ja thats probably best what else is there nothing that wont put us in worse hot water lemp answered and they were in plenty a bullet shattered a window and buried itself in the opposite wall douse the lights get down peter sang out somebody hit the switch the hall plunged into blackness thumps and shuffling noises said quite a few men were hitting the deck anyhow lemp only wished he knew who was shooting at whom and why wish for the moon while youre at it he thought as he flattened out himself wherever peggy druce went in stockholm she kept looking over her shoulder would nazi soldiers suddenly come out of the woodwork like fieldgray cockroaches the way they had in copenhagen germany loudly insisted she had no aggressive designs on sweden of course shed said the same thing about denmark and norway if she did end up invading she would swear on a stack of bibles that shed been provoked an oath like that was worth its weight in gold if you listened to the magazines and radio reports coming out of occupied denmark all the danes were happy as could be with their aryan brothers from deutschland if you listened to the people whod got out of denmark just ahead of the gestapo you heard a different story you could hear both sides in sweden you could pick up both radio berlin and the bbc papers printed reports from the nazis and from the western allies mostly in swedish translation which did peggy no good but even so you could buy the international heraldtribune and signal the germans slick new propaganda magazine the swedes took such liberty for granted well so had the danes sweden didnt know how well off it was or so it seemed to peggy still stockholm wasnt too bad london or paris or brest or bordeaux would have been even better peggy soon discovered though that the german major in copenhagen had been right she couldnt get there from here planes werent flying ships werent sailing the germans were driving english french and norwegian forces up the long skinny nation to the west but scandinavia and the north sea did indeed remain a war zone she was so desperate to get out of europe she even visited the soviet embassy to see if she could reverse columbus and get to the west by heading east none of the russians at the embassy would admit to following english but several spoke french or german peggy preferred french for all kinds of reasons once they saw she understood it so did the russians yes mrs druce we can arrange an entry visa for you one of their diplomatic secretaries said we can arrange passage to moscow there should be no difficulty in that once in moscow you may travel on the transsiberian railway as far east as i believe lake baikal we would gladly ticket you through to vladivostok you understand but the japanese have a different view of the situation aw shit peggy said in english just so the russian official wouldnt feel left out she added merde alors sure as hell columbus had got it right the world was round and a skirmish on the far side of the immense eurasian land mass could screw up her travel hopes just as thoroughly as the one right next door it not only couldit had you have my sympathy for whatever it may be worth to you the russian said thanks peggy answered and left his sympathy was worth just as much as the germans nonaggression pledge and not a nickel more if you had to get stuck somewhere plenty of places were worse than stockholm the weather was getting chilly but peggy didnt worry about any winter this side of moscows there was plenty of food as there had been in copenhagen till the nazis marched in plenty to drink tooshe needed that the town was extraordinarily clean and more than pretty enough a lot of the buildings were centuries older than any she could have seen in america for contrast the town hall was an amazing modern building the locals couldnt have been prouder of it the south tower leaped feet into the sky and was topped by the three crowns the swedes also used as the emblem on their warplanes plenty of those flew over stockholm maybe the swedes were sending germany a message if you jump us well fight harder than the norwegians or maybe they were whistling in the dark they certainly seemed serious men in rather oldfashioned uniforms and odd helmets positioned antiaircraft guns on top of buildings and in parks and anywhere else that offered a wide field of fire peggy figured out the placement for herself she needed no one to explain it to her and when she realized what was going on she went out and got drunk shed seen too goddamn much of war she was starting to understand how it worked the way she could follow a baseball game back in the states she woke the next morning with a small dropforging plant pounding away behind her eyes aspirins and coffeereal coffee not horrible german ersatzdulled the ache without killing it instead of going out and acting touristy she went back to her room and holed up with the heraldtrib the war news in the paper was often several days old it had to clear god knew how many censors get to paris get printed and get to stockholm before she read it she turned on the massive radio that sat in a corner of the room she wanted fresher stories if things in norway calmed downno matter who wonshe was six hours by air from london and if pigs had wings bbc first she said the english sometimes stretched the truth in their broadcasts they didnt jump up and down and dance on it the way berlin did or she hadnt caught them at it anyhow which might not be the same thing it was a few minutes before the top of the hour she put up with the music till the news came on the nazis who hated jazz wouldnt broadcast it the english thought they could play it themselves and insisted on trying most of the results argued against them then the music went away so she could stop sneering at the poor sap who imagined he could make a sax wail without preamble the announcer said reports of a coup detat against adolf hitler continue to trickle out of germany jesus h christ peggy exploded military leaders dissatisfied with the course the war has taken are said to have attempted to overthrow the fuhrer the suave oxfordinflected voice continued whether the coup has succeeded is unknown outside the reich as are hitlers whereabouts and fate nor does anyone but the disaffected generals as yet have the faintest notion of how or whether they will continue the war in the event they do succeed in overthrowing the german dictator son of a bitch peggy added in case her first exclamation hadnt been heartfelt enough in the meanwhile the fight continues the bbc man continued anglofrench forces have made new gains against the wehrmacht north of paris while french sources indicate that their armies also continue their drive to the northeast that began east of the capital city in the fighting in poland the two sides claims and counterclaims appear irreconcilable the situation there accordingly remains in doubt peggy knew what that meant the russians were lying just as hard as the germans and the poles and they said it couldnt be done she said she was mad at the reds for losing their grip on vladivostok one more thing that conspired against her going home as if reading her thoughts the newsreader went on fighting in the far east is similarly confused the only things that can be stated with certainty are that the transsiberian railway remains cut in eastern siberia and that vladivostok is still in soviet hands his majestys government has offered to mediate in this conflict but the empire of japan unfortunately declined of course england wanted to mediate if the russians werent fighting japan they could throw their full weight against germany but london couldnt insist how long would hong kong and malaya last if japan went to war against england people said singapore was the greatest fortress in the world but people said all kinds of things that turned out not to be true then there were the dutch east indies which had to be upside down and inside out now that germany had occupied holland and how much attention could france give to indochina with a war right in her lap england had excellent reasons for not wanting to antagonize the japs the only question was would japan head south regardless of what england did if japan chose to jump that way what would america do there were the philippines way the hell out in the western pacific could us forces there make life difficult for the little yellow men peggy thought so what was the point of holding on to land like that if you werent going to use it in british news prime minister chamberlain has named winston churchill the new minister of war the broadcaster said the pm praised churchills dedication and steadfastness churchill himself said let the hun do his worst we shall do our best and god defend the right wow peggy said chamberlain didnt talk like thathe talked like a greengrocer with too much education if england had had somebody who talked like that from the minute hitler started getting cute maybe the war never would have got off the ground she hoped it would go better now cabbage potatoes turnips a little sour cheese a jewish supper in munster no damn good and not enough either sarah goldman was ashamed of the way she gobbled up her portion she knew how bad it was but that didnt seem to matter her body demanded fuel if poor fuel was all it could get shed make the most of that her father got more than she did he worked harder than she did too there wasnt much between his skin and his bones these days but what there was was all gristle and tough stringy muscle he was somewhere between the best shape of his life and starvation he inhaled his supper afterwards he rolled a cigarette from the tobacco in his pouch it was tobacco scavenged from fag ends picked up on the street before the war only poor people would have scrounged like that now the ones who did were mostly jews because the nazis had cut off their tobacco rations samuel goldman didnt seem to mind after a couple of puffs he remarked my gang was fixing a bomb crater just fifty meters or so down the street from wehrkreis headquarters this afternoon and sarah asked he wouldnt have used a gambit like that for no reasonhe had a story to tell and part of me was wishing the bomb would have come down on the headquarters he said the recruiters there wouldnt let him and saul join the wehrmacht theyd been embarrassed to refuse but theyd done it all right no wonder he despised the place only part hanna goldman said sarahs father nodded to her mother yes only part some of the fellows there theyre not so bad they have to do what their bosses tell them or else they get it themselves the armys not as nasty as the partynowhere near well all right sarah said so what happened while you were filling in this crater not long before she would have been humiliated beyond words at her fathers doing such menial work so would hehe was an academic to the tips of his toes he took hard labor for granted these days as with gravedigging in hamlet familiarity lent it a quality of easiness wed just about got things fixed when we heard motors coming up the street towards usand toward wehrkreis headquarters samuel answered that was enough to make sarah sit up and take notice horses and donkeysand sweating menhauled goods through munsters streets these days gasoline and motor oil went straight to the front except for ambulances doctors cars and fire engines the city might have fallen back into the nineteenth century all of germany might have what were they mother asked as she was surely meant to do was it connected to to the trouble on the radio there was a safer way to talk about things than sarah could have come up with any time the announcer told you to follow duly constituted authority you started wondering what duly constituted authority was and why you should follow it that was the opposite of what the announcer had in mindbut that was his worry not yours father nodded impressively youd best believe it was there were four trucks and shepherding them along fore and aft were brand new halftracked armored personnel carriers very nasty machines to be on the wrong end of he spoke with a veterans trained judgment what did they do by the way mother looked at her sarah got the question out first by no more than a split second what did they do ill tell you what father said they stopped right in front of the recruiting headquarters and ss men started jumping out of them and running inside the gestapo mothers voice quavered you didnt have to be a jew in germany to quaver at the thought of the secret policealthough it sure didnt hurt but this time samuel goldman shook his head no these fellows belonged to the waffenssthe fighting part hitlers personal bodyguards i guess you could call them much as i hate to say it they were very impressive men again he delivered the verdict with the air of a man who knew what he was talking about there were regular soldiers at the headquarters right what did they do did they shoot these waffenss men sarah hoped the answer would be yes she thought shooting was too good for the ss but it would do in a pinch her father shook his head again though no the ss took them by surprise the regular soldiers never had a chance to fight they dont keep many weapons at the headquarters anyhow the ss men stormed in with rifles and machine pistols they came out again a few minutes later colonel zieglerthe head of the wehrkreiscame out with them with his hands high they seized a couple of his aides too they threw all of them into one of the personnel carriers and then they drove away what will they do with them to them mother asked nothing good father had smoked the handrolled cigarette down to a tiny butt he stubbed it out and put the little bit of leftover tobacco back into the leather pouch it wouldnt go to waste once hed finished he looked up again no nothing good he repeated you dont grab someone that way to pin the ritterkreuz on him ziegler must have been involved in the plot against the fuhreror the ss must have thought he was it doesnt seemed to have worked does it sarah said her father pointed to corners of the room for a second that meant nothing to her then she remembered the house still might have hidden microphones if she talked about hitlers overthrow she shouldnt sound disappointed because it hadnt happened she fluttered her fingers to show she got it when samuel goldman said i dont think so we would have heard by now if it had he sounded glad the fuhrer remained in power whether he was might be a different story but he sounded that way mother found a different questionor rather the same one shed asked before but on a larger scale what will the party do to the officers who violated their oath to strike at the fuhrer it wont be pretty again father spoke with what seemed like grim satisfaction to do such a thing in wartime he shook his head like a judge passing sentence that really might have affronted him his desire to be german sometimes showed in peculiar ways would the officers have tried to make peace sarah wondered her fathers chuckle was desertdry you might have done better to ask colonel ziegler i have no idea whether those people wanted to end the war or to fight it better than the fuhrer was doing it isnt likely to matter now what did the other men in your labor gang think ofof what you saw mother asked most of them were all for it theyre loyal germans after all yes father was speaking for the benefit of the microphones that might not be there after a small pause he went on but there were a couple who wanted to take their shovels and clout the ss men they were behind me so i couldnt see who they were that last sentence surely was also for the benefit of the hypothetical microphones sarah would have bet father knew just whod hooted the waffenss she also would have bet more than a couple of laborers wanted to go after the men in black with their shovels backing the nazis was easy when hitler led the reich from one triumph to another but when he took the country into a war that wasnt going so well wouldnt the sieg heils start to ring hollow she also wondered whether father was smart to mention the carpers at all if the gestapo was listening its minions were also liable to decide he knew more than he was letting on that wouldnt be goodfor him or for any of the goldmans sarah wasnt used to worrying that her father might have missed a trick he didnt miss many and she was sure she hadnt noticed most of the ones he had missed but shed noticed this one realizing your parents could make mistakesrealizing they were as human as anybody elsewas part of growing up all the same it was a part she could have done without right now she didnt get a choice not on things like that any jew in germany after the nazis took over young or old could have given chapter and verse on not getting choices you had to go on and to hope you could go on going on vaclav jezek had forgotten just how heavy his antitank rifle was on the march the damn thing was ponderous as hell it wasnt as if he werent lugging another tonne and a half of soldierly equipment in the trenches where the front wasnt moving and where he could set the piece down whenever he felt like it it wasnt so bad with the allied armies advancing he couldnt do that but he was advancing that made the antitank rifle seem lighterwhen he wasnt too tired anyway advancing against the wehrmacht ever since the nazis invaded czechoslovakia hed dreamt of the moment when he could do that now it was here it was here and he was scared the trenches were pretty safe as far as war went he was out in the open vulnerable to bullets and fragments and potatomasher grenades and all the other tools german ingenuity had crafted for maiming other human beings and if his luck went bad french ingenuity could do him in too he didnt hurry everything he was carrying made sure he couldnt very well hurry but he wouldnt have even if he could the germans might be falling back they hadnt given up they rarely did they skirmished yielded a few hundred meters set up their mortars and machine guns and skirmished some more vaclav had no doubt that they dealt out more casualties than they took whenever one of their mgs started firing he hit the dirt he might have been a dog salivating at the sound of a bell but he wasnt the only one who did the germans who manned those vicious machine guns might have thought they worked even more slaughter than they did in truth they didnt even have to point their weapon at a man to get him to fall over but if they didnt he was liable to get up again and go on trying to kill them yes you just cant trust us can you sergeant halevy said when vaclav remarked on that as they sprawled in a shell hole we do keep fighting every now and then when we can vaclav remembered his dreary weeks in the polish internment camp if hed stayed there he would have ended up a german prisoner of war after marshal smiglyridz jumped into bed with hitler enough to make the german generals sick of us halevy said thats how it looks to me anyhow too bad they didnt do what they set out to do vaclav answered trust a german to do things right most of the time and fuck it up when it really matters true no nazis in paris the jew agreed i didnt mean that i know its still true though a french tank clattered past them several soldiers trotted behind it almost in indian file using its steel bulk to shield them from the slings and arrows of outrageous mgs as machine gunners often did the one in front of them concentrated on the tank bullets spanged off the armor one after another they chipped its camouflage paint but did it no other harm thats a fool halevy said thereyou see the germans can screw up the ordinary stuff too i only wish the cocksuckers would do it more often jezek answered no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a mm armorpiercing round from an antitank gun slammed into the french machine that made the mm slugs vaclav fired seemed doorknockers by comparison the tank slewed to a stop smoke and fire spurting from every hatch inside the doomed machine ammunition started cooking off nobody got out that left the men whod followed the tank in a horrible spot if they pushed on the machinegun bullets that had hit armor plate would go after their soft flesh instead if they stayed where they were they might as well have been out of the fight they were no more thrilled about taking chances than vaclav would have been they started digging foxholes behind the burning tank carcass some sergeant will come along in a while and make them get moving poor saps benjamin halevy said youre a sergeant what about you vaclav asked nah halevy shook his head i saw why theyre holing up and i know that goddamn gun is waiting for them to show themselves some other sergeant who comes along in a couple of hours wont care and by that time the machine gunners will be thinking about something else so these guys should be able to go forward again huh vaclav said you better be careful or people will start thinking youre a human being or something dont be dumber than you can help jezek im a sergeant and im a jew how can i be a human being with all that shit piled on my shoulders sergeants a problem yeah i didnt say anything about you being a jew vaclav answered uncomfortably no but you were thinking it halevy said without rancor putting a finger on why the czech felt uncomfortable if it werent for the fucking nazis you wouldnt want anything to do with me of course i wouldnt you are a sergeant vaclav said which made benjamin halevy laugh but it wasnt as if the jew were lying back before vaclav got drafted hed had little use for jews czechs didnt despise them as thoroughly as say poles did but all the same even after he got drafted hed preferred jews to slovaks or ruthenians only because they were more likely to stay loyal to prague and fight the germans well youre a corporal yourself halevy said a czech corporal in france thats worth a lot jezek returned he still couldnt get a rise out of the jew if czechoslovakia hadnt gone to pieces youd be a sergeant for sure they arent exactly equipped to promote people here if i hadnt got out id be a dead man by now or else wounded or sitting in a pow camp somewherei was just thinking about that a minute ago vaclav said and those all sound better than being a goddamn sergeant what do you think of that i felt the same way till they promoted me halevy answered easily now i see that sergeants are the salt of the earth its the officers whore silly clots shows what you know vaclav dug a grubby pack of cigarettes out of his pocket benjamin halevy looked hopeful the czech gave him one it wasnt as if he hadnt bummed butts from the jew after a while vaclav cautiously peered over the lip of the shell hole there in the distance between a couple of tree trunks was that the painted shield on the germans antitank gun somethingno somebodymoved behind it yes the son of a bitch wore feldgrau grunting vaclav heaved his heavy piece up onto the dirt lip he flipped off the safety and stared down the sights the nazi had crouched down again maybe vaclav could put a round through the shield it wasnt made to stop anything more than ordinary ammo but he might get a better target if he waited and he did the german stood up and looked out through field glasses to try to spot the trouble heading his way the worst troubles though were the ones you didnt see vaclav exhaled slowly to steady himself he pulled the trigger the antitank rifle slammed his shoulder the german threw his hands in the air and fell over vaclav worked the bolt as fast as he could chambering a fresh round as hed guessed another german jumped up to find out what had happened to his buddy vaclav fired again the second fritzs head exploded into red mist two halevy asked two vaclav agreed one dead for sure the other i dont know about any hit from the antitank rifle might kill rubbing he added they ought to requisition me a new shoulder too talk to the french quartermasters the jew said fuck em jezek replied with great sincerity maybe the germans have a supply dump in laon if we can chase em out of there ill go through it and see if we can chase them out of laon we really are doing something halevy said they took it early on maybe we can push on up to the coast and cut them off maybe well get out of this shell hole in a while vaclav said one goddamn thing at a time halevy nodded and scrounged another smoke chapter theo hossbach hadnt had much to do with lieutenant colonel koch a radio operator who was happiest by himself didnt hobnob with a regimental commander theo wouldnt have hobnobbed with his crewmates if he could have helped it but hed never heard anything bad about koch the officer was supposed to be brave he didnt punish his troops because he enjoyed punishing people men who knew about such things said he had a good tactical sense theo hadnt seen anything to make him disbelieve it none of that did koch any good now he stood blindfolded tied to a post in front of a stone wall in a polish town along with quite a few other panzer crews theo and adi stoss and hermann witt had been summoned to see what happened to officers who dared go against the german government a waffenss captainthey had their own silly name for the rank but it amounted to captainspoke in a loud voice this man is guilty of treason against the reich and against our beloved fuhrer adolf hitler for treason in wartime there is only one sentencethe supreme penalty he turned to his own men a dozen more asphalt soldiers they all carried rifles when he looked at them they stiffened to attention maybe they didnt realize it but the watching panzer crewmen packed a lot more closerange firepower than they did lugers schmeissers the ss men could wind up dead before they knew it none of the wehrmacht troops in black coveralls looked happy at what was going on in front of them what would it take to turn dismay to mutiny not much not if theo was any judge a word from koch would have done it and what would have happened after that war between the army and the ss theo would have been ready even eager for it he knew he wasnt the only one eithernowhere close but it might also have been war between rebel and loyalist wehrmacht units he couldnt stomach that and while the germans were bashing one another what would the red army do stand around watching not likely raise your weapons the ss captain ordered the firing squad obeyed aim your weapons he said and they did lieutenant colonel koch did cry out then had he yelled save me or down with hitler the mutiny might have started then and there but all he said in a loud clear voice was long live germany fire the ss man shouted a dozen shots rang out as one koch slumped against his bonds blood darkened the front of his tunic the sergeant who headed the riflemen went over to him and felt for a pulse he must have found one for he grimaced finish him the ss captain snapped the sergeant drew a pistol and shot koch in the back of the head that surely ended that the ss captain looked out at the panzer troops you may bury him he said as if he were granting some large concession by his lights he probably was he and his men piled into a halftrack and a truck and sped away what other luckless officer was next on their list fuck adi stoss said next to theo i hope i never see anything like that again amen hermann witt said he was a good soldier the sergeant who commanded another panzer in the platoon said you cant plot against the government not in the middle of a war you cant if he did that adi said which made that sergeants jaw drop theo thought it was a reasonable comment the ss did things and chose victims for its reasons which often made no sense to ordinary mortals and even if he was a lousy politician he was still a good officer witt added as far as im concerned that counts for more cause chances are it saved my assand yoursa few times huh the other sergeant said and walked away well thats that we just went on his list adi sounded cheerful about it as long as were fighting the ivans it doesnt matter by contrast witt sounded like a man trying to convince himself heres hoping theo said his crewmates eyed him in mild surprise the way they did whenever he opened his mouth he never found out how the panzer men decided who would bury the regimental commander but koch got a much fancier grave than most german soldiers who met death at the front and the large cross had fallen for the vaterland written on the horizontal bar in big black letters if the ss goons see that theyll pitch another shitfit adi predicted good theo said they exchanged conspiratorial grins again they could ruin each other with a few words whispered in the wrong ears it wasnt the first time it wouldnt be the last they wouldnt have said such things if each didnt already have good reason to trust the other with his life hermann witt came up and looked at the grave and at the inscription on the cross i got a letter from my father a few days ago he said after looking around to make sure no one but his crewmates could hear him he says some of the death notices in the paper go fallen for fuhrer and vaterland and others just say fallen for the vaterland its a way of letting people see how you feel about things you know im surprised he talked death notices with you stoss remarked doesnt he think its bad luck or something nah hes a freethinker my old man the panzer commander said not without pride the way things are these days he has to keep his mouth shut more than he used to im the one he can let loose with as long as the army censors dont come down on him theo said he liked witt much better than heinz naumann he didnt want anything bad to happen to him or to his family hes careful the way he puts things i know him so i can read between the lines witt said the blockheads the army has reading mail they dont know crap from cabbage they may seem dumb a lot of the time but theyre smarter than you make them out to be stoss said how do you know witt retorted next letter you get will be the first adi shrugged my folks died in a train crash when i was little my grandfather raised me but he died a few years ago too the stosses never were a big family now theres me no girlfriend witt asked slyly another shrug i had one she didnt feel like giving me what i wanted before i headed off to training and i told her what i thought about that havent heard from her since the lousy bitch the panzer commander set a sympathetic hand on his shoulder some of em are like that and damn all you can do about it if they didnt have pussies thered be a bounty on em ought to be a bounty on some of em any which way well you can sing that in church adi said witt asked no more questions he just looked at lieutenant colonel kochs grave one more time shook his head and walked off theo asked no questions either questions of that kind werent his style hed served with adi a lot longer than the new commander had and had also noticed that the driver never got any mail stoss didnt seem to miss it it was as if he knew he wouldnt if he had no family if hed told his girlfriend to piss up a rope well hell didnt he have any friends he was a good guy theo thought so anyway didnt anyone else in the whole wide world didnt anyone else like him well enough to send him a note saying i hope youre still in one piece evidently not but why not several possibilities had occurred to theo hed long since decided which one he thought most likely and it had nothing to do with singing in church if the blackshirts ever came to ask him about it hed also decided he would deny everything as hard and as long as he could of course he would you didnt tell the blackshirts anything about your buddies not if you could help it but theo would have kept his mouth shut absent that ironclad injunction he had a keen sense of the absurd even if he didnt let other people see it very often a working sense of the absurd often came in handy in the third reich and if his conclusion didnt fit in well with the general preposterousness of life he was damned if he could imagine one that would sometimes the worst thing you could do was imagine something sergeant hideki fujita discovered that painful truth for himself as so many had before him the idea of getting transferred to attack vladivostok hadnt so much as crossed his mind till he and that other sergeant sat around chewing the fat and wasting time once it got into his head though it wouldnt go away it stayed there and stayed there like an eyelash you couldnt rub out of your eye other units had been called away from the blocking position it could happen to his regiment too when you were a soldier anything that could happen could happen to you it could and sooner or later it probably would you didnt want to have thoughts like that they meant that if you kept at this trade long enough you would stop a bullet you would get ripped up by a shell fragment you would get blasted into chunks of raw meat how could you keep on soldiering if you kept worrying about such things how your own side would deal with you if you tried not to soldier that was how and if you found yourself in the middle of the trackless siberian woods well not quite tracklessthere was the railroad line that had sent the japanese army blundering among the firs and spruces to begin with your best chancemaybe your only chancewas to do your job like everybody else this was bad nobody in his right mind would have called it anything else but soldiering had taught fujita one thing anyway the difference between bad and worse was much bigger than the difference between good and better my father fought at port arthur superior private hayashi said one afternoon the squad huddled around a small almost smokeless fire in the bottom of their trench it wasnt snowing now but it had been and it looked as if it would start up again pretty soon too they had thick greatcoats and furlined gloves and russianstyle felt boots although the ones they took from dead red army men were even better but that didnt mean the cold didnt seep into a mans bones fire and hot tea or soup were the best weapons against it yet even fire and tea were powerless against the chill that seeped into a mans head two of my uncles did fujita said they never liked to talk about it afterwards i didnt understand that till i went into the army myself you cant tell somebody what combats like till hes done it himselfand after that he doesnt need to hear it from you hai sergeantsan shinjiro hayashi nodded well of course a superior private would agree with his sergeant a sergeant would knock your block off if you were crazy enough to do anything else but then hayashi added thats very well put fujita smiled before he realized hed done it when a smart kid said youd said something well of course you were tickled yes he might be flattering youhe knew where his bowl of rice came from all right hed found a good way to go about it though fujitas voice lacked some of the growl he usually put into it speaking to inferiors when he said so what did your father tell you about port arthur he never talked about it much either not till just before i had to go in for basic training hayashi said then he said he hoped i never ended up in a spot like that he said the russian artillery was bad that sure hasnt changed somebody else exclaimed all the soldiers nodded no matter what other mistakes the russians made their artillery was always trouble and he said that our machine guns fired right over the heads of our men when they were attacking the russian forts hayashi went on right over their heads sometimes our gunners would shoot our men in the back it happens fujita said shigata ga nai life was hard to begin with soldiering was a hard part of life if the generals decided killing some of the troops on their own side would help the rest take an objective theyd do it without thinking twice it was just part of the cost of doing business he could understand that a sergeant sometimes had to make those choices too if on a smaller scale hai it does happen hayashi had seen enough to leave him no doubts on that score but please excuse me sergeantsani dont want it to happen to me well who does fujita said me i aim to die at the age of a hundred and three shot by an outraged husband the soldiers all laughed fujita couldnt remember where hed heard that line before somewhere it didnt matter it was funny when you heard something funny of course you used it yourself and passed it along eee i like that a private said an outraged husband with a pretty young wife neh oh yes fujita said whats the point to getting shot for screwing some ugly old woman eh no one saw any as soldiers will the men started talking about young women pretty women women theyd known women they claimed theyd known women they wished theyd known fujita told a little truth and more than a few lies he figured the other soldiers were doing the same thing well so what talk like that made the time go by in their foxholes and trenches farther north the russians were probably telling the same stories as if to remind the japanese that they hadnt gone away red army gunners greeted the next days dawn with an artillery barrage bombers flying above the ugly gray clouds dropped tonnes of explosives through them they were bombing blind and none of their presents fell anywhere close to the front for all kinds of reasons that didnt break fujitas heart he was in no danger himself and the softliving men who called themselves soldiers but never saw the trenchesthe clerks and the cooks and the staff officersgot a taste of what war was like he hoped they enjoyed it a couple of days after that the regiment got pulled out of the line the first place they went was to a delousing station like any japanese fujita was glad to soak in almost unbearably hot water he was even gladder the russian bombers had missed the bathhouse if the soap smelled powerfully of medicine so what getting his clothes baked to kill lice and nits was less delightful but he could put up with it some of the soldiers thought they were going home some people could smell pig shit and think of pork cutlets fujita was willingeven eagerto be surprised which didnt mean he expected it the men marched off to the west toward the ussuri river and the border with manchukuo the officers said nothing about where they were headed or why maybe they didnt know either more likely they didnt want the troops to find out till they couldnt do anything about it but complain a small flotilla of river steamers waited by the riverbank theyd all seen better decades some of them looked as if theyd seen a better century sergeant fujitas company and another filed aboard one of the riverboats they filled it to overflowing it waddled out into the stream and headed south fujita feared he knew what that meant which in the grand scheme of things mattered not at all spatters of snow chased the steamers the clouds overhead remained thick and dark for that the sergeant thanked whatever weather kami ruled in these parts clear skies would have let russian airplanes spot the steamers and shoot them up at their leisure each boat mounted a machine gun at the bow and another at the stern from everything fujita had seen they wouldnt do a sens worth of good in case of a real attack he said as much to hayashi the conscripted student looked back at him what difference does it make if the russians dont shoot us from the air now theyll shoot us on the ground pretty soon maybe they wont fujita answered you had to look on the bright side of things that was about as far on the bright side as he could make himself look though hai honto maybe they wont maybe our own machine gunners will do it for them the way they did in my fathers day hayashi had his share of cynicism or maybe more than his share your father made it so did my uncles fujita said again just surviving seemed like optimism the steamers lumbered south through the snow flurries peronne was a northern town that had kept some of its brickandstone walls german bombs and french artilleryor maybe it was the other way aroundhad done horrible things to them big chunks were bitten out of the church of st jean despite the chill of crisp fall days the stench of death fouled the air in the french drive to the east luc harcourt had seenand smelleda lot of towns and villages like this one he smelled bad himself he couldnt remember the last time hed bathed joinville and villehardouin were just as grimy and unshaven and odorous as he was so were all the other poilus pushing the fritzes back joinville pointed to a parade of sorts going through the streets of peronne by jesus theres something you dont see every day too bad tiny villehardouin added in his bad bretonflavored french luc harcourt thought it was too bad too the locals were forcing a dozen or so young women to march along bare to the waist their breasts bouncing at every step some had had their heads shaved others more humiliatingly still wore scalps half bare one was very visibly pregnant people yelled at them as they went whores cunts scumbags of the boches rotten vegetables flew through the air no one seemed ready to cast the first stone though i bet this happened after we chased the germans out the last time too joinville said the gascon had his eye on one of the girls in particular his chances were probably pretty good too if shed sleep with a german or a bunch of germans why wouldnt she sleep with a frenchman not with the same broads i bet luc said joinville laughed so hard the hotchkiss gun on his back almost fell off villehardouin who was burdened with the tripod fixed his crewmates straps the rumble of aircraft engines swelling out of the east made lucs head rise like that of a dog scenting danger if those were stukas he wanted to find somewhere else to be and in a hurry another country by choice but this flight wasnt full of vulturewinged dive bombers in fact the flying machines looked like something left over from his fathers war they were biplanes with open cockpits antiaircraft guns opened up on them black puffs of smoke marked shell bursts some came quite close to the planes but the oldfashioned ungainly machines buzzed on luc had trouble taking them seriously even when they swooped down on peronne but then all of a sudden it sounded as if god were firing giant machine guns up in the sky the townsfolk suddenly lost interest in tormenting their wayward women they ran screaming luc wanted to do the same thing only the fear of losing his mens respect forever held him in place hit the dirt he yelled and suited action to word both machine gun and tripod clanked as joinville and villehardouin followed suit that fearsome ratatattat grew louder yet as the german biplanes neared theyre doing it with their engines luc realized it was the same kind of trick as the sirens in a stukas landing gear it was designed to make people afraid and as with most things german it did what it was designed for did it ever the biplanes carried real machine guns luc saw them spitting fire and bombs fell from under their wings not the monsters stukas could haul the ones that pierced reinforced concrete and wrecked fortresses but even so luc rolled himself into a ball like a hedgehog he only wished he had real spines bullets sparked off brickwork and cobblestones bombs bounced him as if he were a basketball a round clanged off metal somewhere much too close and then the biplanes were gonehe hoped he needed a moment to take stock of himself both arms work check both legs check again no holes no blood no pain no and no and no fuck me he said im all right then he looked around to see how his buddies were doing villehardouin seemed to be going through a checklist like the one hed just used himself the big breton nodded and gave a thumbsup joinville had taken off the hotchkiss gun and was looking it over look he said pointing to a dent and a lead splash on one of the iron cooling fins at the base of the barrel it hit here and ricocheted if it hadnt ricocheted it would have gone into my back sometimes youd rather be lucky than good luc took his water bottle off his belt here have some of this pinard joinville asked taking the flask betterapplejack luc said ah merci mon ami the gascons throat worked after a couple of swallows he handed villehardouin the bottle the big man also took a knock then he gave the water bottle back to luc luc drank too before he stowed it on his belt he needed a little distilled courage or at least an anesthetic luc looked around again this time for the soldiers whod been hauling the hotchkiss guns ammunition none of the bullets from the biplanes had hit the aluminum strips of cartridges which was also lucky they might have started going off like ammo inside a burning tank which wouldnt have been healthy for anyone within a few hundred meters but one of the troopers was methodically bandaging his calf red soaked through the white cotton gauze how bad is it emile luc asked hurts like a motherfucker but i dont think itll kill me emile answered hell if you get me a stick i bet i can walk on it chances are theyll send you home then luc said not fucking likelyi grew up in verdun emile said the eastern town had held in the last war but fallen in this one oh luc had forgotten that if he ever knew it well theyll take you out of the line for a while anyway itll do emile said i only wish to christ theyd done it sooner loud shouts came from around the corner that was sergeant demanges voice of course hed live through a strafing and a dive bombing luc didnt think anything could kill him hed probably never been born but manufactured in some armaments plant during the last war maybe he had a serial number tattooed on his assor stamped into it now he was trying to pull order out of chaos he bawled for medics for stretcherbearers for peronnes firemen for water for anything else blasted houses and wounded people were likely to need he might have restored something resembling calm too if the church of st jean hadnt chosen that moment to fall in on itself with a crash shrieks from inside announced that people had sheltered there against the german biplanes sergeant demange effortlessly shifted gears come on he yelled to whoever might be listening let get the sorry sons of bitches out lets go luc told his menor all of them except joinville whod somehow disappeared after his slug of apple brandy well do what we can they followed him he was proud of that till hed got a corporals stripes no one had ever wanted to follow him maybe the rank helped make the man he didnt feel like complaining any which way the church wasnt burning a small thing on the scale of miracles but luc would take it he flung aside stones and chunks of brickwork and tugged at beams his hands were hard but he tore them up anyhow and the first woman he uncovered didnt need help falling masonry had made sure she never would he turned her over so he wouldnt have to look at what was left of her face he and the other soldiersand some townsfolkdid pull several people out alive that made him feel a little better joinville showed up about twenty minutes after he started heaving wreckage where the hell were you luc growled i found that broad the gascon said with a lazy smile never did it with nobody with no hair up top before didnt mattershe had plenty down below he set to work as if hed been there all along merde i ought to kick your sorry ass luc didnt know whether to laugh or to pound the soldierss thick head with a brick he ended up laughing life is too short for anything else joinvilles presence probably wouldnt have meant life for anyone whod died that being so why resent him for tearing off a piece when he saw the chance because i didnt get to goddammit yes that one answered itself didnt it luc bent to the task once more hansulrich rudel watched the hss land one after another the biplanes were as near obsolete as made no difference but they could still carry the fight to the enemy even if stukas could do more and do it better those henschels could take it too one of them had a hole in the aluminum skin of the fuselage big enough to throw a cat through it flew and landed as if it had just come off the assembly line rudel didnt like to think what that kind of hit would have done to his ju nothing goodhe was sure of that groundcrew men pushed the biplanes toward revetments after they shut down their engines before long the henschels would fill all of them hansulrichs squadron and the stukas the pilots flew were heading east to teach the red russians a thing or two sergeant dieselhorst ambled up i was talking to one of the guys in the radio shack he said sounds like they gave that peronne place a good pounding all right by me rudel said but they cant carry cannon under their wings you knownot a chance in the world ja ja dieselhorst nodded but the scuttlebutt is the ivans have more panzers than england and france put together well if they do well just have to make sure it doesnt last hansulrich spoke with the confidencewith the arroganceof youth dieselhorst an older man smiled and nodded and said not another word the stukas flew off to the east two days later the sun was rising in hansulrichs face when he rose from the airstrip in france and setting behind him when he put down on the smooth grassy runway at tempelhof just outside of berlin he and dieselhorst both eagerly hopped out of their stuka long flights were tough on the bladder rudel was happier once hed eased himself but only for a little while then he noticed the armored cars crewed by waffenss men near the edge of the airport their turrets were aimed at the justarrived bombers whats that all about he asked what do you think sergeant dieselhorst answered they dont want us to bomb up and go after the chancellery thats crazy hansulrich exclaimed we wouldnt do anything like that theyre kind of jumpy right now dieselhorst said dryly you cant blame them after whatever happened here hansulrich said he didnt know the details of the plot against hitler only that it had failed he was glad it had treason had brought down the reich at the end of the last war and now it was raising its ugly head again if it was it needed to be slapped down and slapped down hard we arent going to do anything like that theyve already been through us once to make sure we dont dieselhorst looked around and lowered his voice before going on and they didnt need to do that they thought they did you can see why if the fuhrer couldnt trust the generals right under his eye how can the reich trust anybody without checking him out real well rudel said sir dieselhorst hesitated again much longer this time he finally shook his head and started to turn away oh never mind spit it out hansulrich told him youll spit in my eye if i do by god i wont rudel raised his right hand with index and middle fingers extended and slightly crooked as if taking an oath in court we watch each others backs always always well i hope so sergeant dieselhorsts jaw worked as if he were chewing on that after another hesitation he picked his words with obvious care you know sir theres a difference between not fancying the fuhrer and being a traitor to the reich no there isnt hansulrich exclaimed dieselhorsts chuckle held no mirth whatever i knew youd say that but a devil of a lot of people think there is thats the biggest part of what this ruckus was all about if you try to overthrow the fuhrer of the german reich in wartime what are you but a backstabber rudel demanded as stern and certain as his father was about the tenets of their faith if he hadnt promised dieselhorst but he had and his word was good some people would say a german patriot the sergeant replied i dont know that thats true but i dont know that it isnt either what i do know is theres usually more than one way to look at things not this time hansulrich said i knew youd say that too dieselhorst stepped well away from the stuka to light a cigarette well well go on and hit the reds a good lick if you think im going to sing songs about how wonderful stalin is youre even crazier than i give you credit for sir he blew out a stream of smoke they slept in tents guarded by waffenss men when they got mush and doughy sausages and ersatz coffee the next morning the fellow who served them wore the ss runes on his fatigue uniform no one said much at breakfast even hansulrich was sure the messhall attendants who carried off the dirty dishes were listening going back to the airplanes was a relief flying off toward the front in the east was a bigger one at the front things were simple you knew who was a friend and who was a foe politics didnt get in the waynot so much anyhow before long the communication from the ground came from men who spoke german with an odd accent stressing the nexttolast syllable of every word whether they should have or not id say were over poland dieselhorst remarked through the speaking tube id say youre right hansulrich answered a flight of gullwinged monoplane fighters badged with the polish red and white foursquare checkerboard paced the stukas escorting them through an allys airspace that poland was an ally most germans disliked almost as much as the soviet enemy didnt matter for the moment hansulrich eyed the fighters with wary attention he didnt think they were anywhere near so good as german bfs of course they wouldnt have to be anywhere near that good to make mincemeat of a stuka squadron but they just flew along friendly as could be one of the polish pilots caught rudels eye and waved hansulrich waved back what else was he going to do he also kept a wary eye out for russian fighters the reds had monoplanes and biplanes both models with noticeably flat noses german pilots whod faced them in spain said they werent so good as messerschmitts either again though they didnt need to be to shoot him down how did they stack up against these polish planes he didnt know and hoped he wouldnt have to find out a couple of antiaircraft guns fired on the stukas when they flew over warsaw colonel steinbrenner screamed at the poles over the radio the firing abruptly cut off it hadnt hit anybody what that said about polish air defenses it sure didnt say anything good they landed at an airstrip about forty kilometers east of the capital when hansulrich got out of his ju artillery was grumbling in the middle distance well it wasnt as if he hadnt heard the same thing plenty of times in the low countries and france he wasnt used to hearing it come out of the east though and he wasnt used to the scenery either the land looked almost as flat as if it had been ironed a cold wind that had a long start did its best to blow right through him he was glad for his furandleather flying suit off in the distance a shabby village looked like something out of the seventeenth century at least to his jaundiced eye to sergeant dieselhorsts too jesus what a dump the noncom said now that you mention it yes hansulrich said dont let the poles hear you talk like that or theyll smash your face for you a groundcrew man advised they think were on their side not the other way around that made hansulrich laugh out loud and the flea thinks the dog is his horse too he said scornfully weve got our soldiers and our planes here and we arent going to leave until were good and ready if the poles didnt like that it was their hard luck they were only poles after all chapter no one had ever claimed wales was a place where you went to enjoy the weather there were good and cogent reasons why no one had ever said such a damnfool thing alistair walsh had seen plenty of bad weather there and even more in his army service all the same hed never imagined anything like winter in central norway the wind howled like a wolf snow blew as near horizontal as made no difference he had a wool balaclava under his tin hat and a sheepskin coat a herder had pressed on him that was far warmer than his britishissue greatcoat he wore greatcoat and sheepskin one on top of the other and two pairs of mittens on his hands he was cold anyway a british captain who was stumbling north with him said something whatever it was that vicious wind blew it away sorry sir walsh shouted back i saidthe captain put his mouth as close to walshs ear as a lover mighti said without the bloody gulf stream this country wouldnt be habitable at all walsh considered that who says it is sir ha the officer nodded makes you understand why the vikings went pirating so often what damned if it doesnt walsh agreed even scotland looks good next to this and by god i never thought id say that in this life the country up in the north there was bleak as could be but this outdid it after nodding again the captain said no fucking germans in scotland either right walsh wished there were no germans in norway either unfortunately wishing didnt make them go away they werent nearly far enough behind the retreating allies german mountain troops had snowshoes and skis and moved much faster than poor ordinary buggers stumbling up these indifferent roads oh the norwegians had ski troops too and a few french chasseurs alpins were also equipped for winter warfare but most of the allied expeditionary force was plain old infantry and the plain old infantry was in trouble one good thing the captain bawled into walshs none too shelllike ear whats that sir walsh answered its one more than ive come up with with the weather so beastly the luftwaffe cant get off the ground mm there is that walsh said we can get shot and shelled but the blighters wont bomb us for a while of course our own planes are also grounded yes sir walsh replied and said not another word the luftwaffe ruled the skies in norway and above the seas west of it the raf along with a few french planes and what little was left of the norwegian air force did what it could against the germans but it wasnt enough stukas swooped sirens screaming messerschmitts strafed almost as they pleased the fritzes artillery spotting planes the ones that could take off and land in next to nothing and hover in a headwind like a kestrel flew here there and everywhere showing the nazis what to strike next clear weather favored the enemy well there hadnt been much of it lately he trudged on for all he could tell the germans were shelling them right now the wind and snow cocooned him tightly if the bastards didnt score a direct hit hed never know it and if they did he figured hed end up in a warmer place than this at the moment eternal flame didnt seem half bad do you think theyll be able to pull us out sir he asked maybe if the bad weather holds and lets our ships into namsos the captain answered he studied walsh the veteran noncom wondered why neither of them showed more than his eyes what about you sergeant i daresay you have more experience in these matters than i do walsh only shrugged i may be older than you are sir but ive never been in anything like this last bugger who was in anything like this was scott and look what happened to him the captain laughed harshly no there was bloody amundsen too and he was a norwegian himself he must have felt right at home at the south pole eh wouldnt surprise me one bit walsh turned away from the wailing wind cupped his hands and lit a cigarette some people could strike a match in any weather no matter how dreadful the harsh smokehed taken a packet of gitanes off a dead frenchmangave him something to think about besides the blizzard if only the german generals had given hitler the boot the captain said if ifs and buts were candied nuts wed all have a bloody good christmas walsh answered dyou really suppose they would have stopped the war theyre fritzes too remember ive never known those sons of bitches to pack it in while they can still fight something to that i shouldnt wonder the captain said he brought up a mittened hand to the brim of his helmet some sort of checkpoint up ahead maybe theyll tell us which way namsos is walsh wasnt a hundred percent sure hed been going north hed been steering more by the wind than by anything else that and flocking with his friends if they were wrong so was he sheep liked to flock together maybe they will the captain said as he and walsh neared the crossroads a squads worth of men stood therevague shapes through the flying snow the officer let out a formidable bellow i say which way to namsos they didnt answer or if they did walsh couldnt hear them which was at least as likely the staff sergeant clumped on he and the captain were almost close enough to spit on the waiting soldiers when the other man shouted his question once more they heard him this time one of them answered for you it does not matter what do you mean it doesnt matter the captain said indignantly sir walsh grabbed his arm sir hes got a schmeisser one german submachine gun wouldnt have meant muchhe carried a schmeisser himself but theyve all got schmeissers you are our prisoners gentlemen the german said in excellent english drop your weapons and raise your hands try nothing foolish it would be the last mistake you ever madeyou may be sure of that some of the men with them started laying their rifles on the snowy ground walsh didnt know what made him take off and run stupidity odds were but there were a few soldiers between him and the boches and the sheepskin coat was a dirty white that might camouflage him in the swirling snow maybe they wouldnt even notice he was missing the captain ran with him misery loving company whatever it was it queered the deal the fritzes shouted shouting was bad enough then they started shooting and that was a lot worse but sure as hell they couldnt exactly see what they were shooting at some of the flying bullets came pretty close to walsh but hed had plenty of nearer misses and schmeissers wonderful as they were in closein combat werent the least bit accurate out past a couple of hundred yards they could run after him he risked a look back over his shoulder they were running after him as a matter of fact it wasnt as if he didnt leave a big juicy trail in the snow but if he could get to the pine woods a bit more than a quarter of a mile away before he got shot or tackled theyd have a lot more trouble catching up to him that captainwalsh wasnt even sure of his namewas running on a different line if the germans wanted to grab both of them theyd have to split up they might not like that maybe the allied soldiers were leading them into an ambush maybe there werent any more allied soldiers for miles and miles that was what walsh feared most in that case he was running for nothing he might end up freezing to death for nothing too was england worth it his feet must have thought so or they never would have taken off as he panted toward the pines he damned all his years and damned all his cigarettesexcept he wanted another gitane well that would have to wait couldnt those young fit nazi privates outrun an old reprobate like him evidently not because he got into the woods ahead of them it was like being in among all the christmas trees in the worldlittle ones big ones enormous ones even the smell was right he yanked his schmeisser off his shoulder and put a couple of mills bombs in the sheepskin coats righthand pocket now he could fight if he had to he wasnt just a target the germans hadnt been able to knock down which way was north he hadnt been sure before and now hed got all turned around it would be a hell of a note if he blundered straight back to the fritzes wouldnt it they didnt seem eager to come into the woods after him nor could he blame them a man might get hurt trying something like that capturing troops who didnt even realize you were on the other side was a hell of a lot easier fuck em all he muttered and his breath smoked around him even though he hadnt pulled that next gitane out of its packet he thought north was that way if he turned out to be wrong well hed given it his best shot the germans might be taking norway but they hadnt taken him yet chaim weinberg had a new sacred text from which to preach thieves fall out he told the nationalist prisoners in the park in madrid the germans are fighting among themselves some of them can see that hitler is only leading them into disaster and if that is true for germany isnt it even more true for spain he got somber looks from the pows german efficiency was a watchword in spain especially among the nationalists if the gangsters who lined up behind hitler could go for each others throats what about the goons who said they were for sanjurjo what would they do if they saw a better deal in going out on their own it was something for everybody to think about not just a bunch of hapless prisoners it seemed that way to chaim anyhow because it seemed that way to him he said so to anyone who would listen he had discovered his inner missionary while haranguing the pows what he hadnt discovered was how to make his inner missionary shut up he got into arguments in line for meals he got into arguments in cantinas and on street corners he got into fights too he won more often than he lost few people who hadnt been to the front wasted less time fighting clean than he did after he left a couple of loudmouthed spaniards groaning on cantina floorsand after he discouraged their friends with a footlong bayonet held in an underhand grip that warned he knew just what to do with it which he didthe arguments stayed verbal he got a name for himself eso narigon locothat crazy kike he wore it with pride of course by running his mouth he also set himself up for party discipline hed faced party discipline in the states they told you to quit doing whatever you were doing that they didnt like either you did or you dropped out of the party party discipline in spain was a different business they told you to quit doing whatever you were doing that they didnt like either you did or they threw your sorry ass into a spanish jail or a punishment company or they said to hell with it and shot you chaim wasnt altogether surprised when a scaredlooking runner summoned him to appear before a party organizer and explain himself he wasnt altogether thrilled either which was putting it mildly but what choice did he have he could try going over to the nationalists assuming they or the republicans didnt shoot him while he was trying to desert but that would have gagged a vulture he certainly couldnt stomach it himself and so he reported to the organizer she had her office in a beatup building the most common kind in embattled madrid that had housed government bureaucrats before the spanish civil war got going that she was a she hed inferred from the nom de guerre the runner gave him la martellita the little hammer with feminine article and ending that was a good namemolotov meant son of a hammer too sure as the devil she wasnt very big hed expected that he hadnt expected her to be dropdead gorgeous but she was blueblack hair flashing dark eyes cheekbones a spanish blade of a nose and the most kissable mouth hed ever seen that she looked at him as if he were a donkey turd in the gutter somehow only made her more beautiful he had no idea how come but it did well comrade why are you throwing around such bad ideology she snapped her voice cold as the north pole i did it so i could meet you chaim answered not for the first time in his life his mouth ran several lengths ahead of his brain people said you were very pretty and they were right if you think you can flatter me you had better think again la martellita said in tones not a tenth of a degree warmer than they were before you will only end up digging a deeper hole for yourselfmaybe one deep enough to bury you in she sounded as if she looked forward to shoveling dirt over him odds were she did i have a question for you chaim said yes she asked ominously whats your real name none of your business thats a funny name he said her nostrils flared and not with pleasure he sighed okay um bueno i have another question for you if you keep wasting my time youll regret it i believe you he said regretfully why is it such a sin to say the fascists have contradictions of their own and that we ought to do everything we can to take advantage of them because you are only a soldier she answered higherlevel policy is none of your businessnone do you hear me for all you know for all i know for all anyone knows we are trying to exploit those contradictions but soldiers have no business proposing policy im not just a soldier he said im a propagandist too trying to bring nationalist soldiers over to the republic if i cant talk politics with them i cant do my job did you get your views approved before you presented them la martellita asked uhno chaim admitted he was a communist a loyal communist but he was also an american he was used to doing things on his own hook and worrying about consequences later well here it was later and here were the consequences if this stunner in shapeless denim coverallsa crime thatwanted him shot shot he damn well would be she looked through him and why not it didnt seem necessary he answered feebly that was very stupid la martellita said i thought every man was free to be anything he wanted even stupid under the republic chaim threw out the line like a chess player offering a poisoned pawn and she took it every man may be stupid under the republic comrade but you abuse the privilege didnt trotsky say something like that chaim knew perfectly well trotsky had his voice was pure innocence all the same if you accused somebody of quoting the red antichrist you needed to sound innocent la martellitas eyes flashed again terribly she looked as if she hated him no doubt she did but now he had a hold on her even if they were dragging him off to the nearest wall he had a chance of getting her stood up against it right after him she took out a pack of cigarettes lit one and smoked in quick furious puffs she didnt offer it to him she stubbed hers out while it was only half donea rare thing in spain these days when she spoke again she came straight to the point what do you want from me she knew what shed done oh yes a little understanding would be nice chaim said what do you mean understanding if you think ill be your mattress or suck your stupid cock id sooner cut my throat she sure as hell did come straight to the point no no no chaim said thinking yes yes yes he went on i was talking about politics i didnt mean any harm when i said what i said any more than you did just now i dont think i should get in trouble for it oh politics the way la martellita said the word it sounded more obscene than cocksucking she drummed her fingers on the rickety little table she used for a desk can you try not to talk about your own so loudly when youre not reeducating the nationalists it was like getting sent out of the confessional with a penance of three our fathers and five hail marys ill try chaim said he didnt even have to promise to do it all right get the fuck out of here la martellita wanted to pretend shed never had anything to do with him tell me your name first he would sooner have faced nationalist artillery than her glare magdalena she spat now get the fuck out of here see you again i hope chaim said that makes one of us she said and for once he quit while he was ahead and got out pete mcgill stood sentry outside the american consulate in shanghai because he wore two stripes on his left sleeve he commanded the twoman detachment out there he could have done without the honor shanghai was a good bit south of peking you couldnt have proved it by him not this freezing early december morning fuck its cold he muttered bet your ass max weinstein agreed they both spoke with barely moving lips no one more than a few feet away would have had any idea they were talking they were there to look impressive and they did that like convicts they managed to go back and forth without letting the outside world notice there wasnt much outside world to notice shanghai wasnt used to this kind of godawful weather hardly anybody was on the streets the people who had to go out bundled up in all the clothes they owned a lot of them seemed to be wearing two or three peoples worth and to be freezing even so inside his thick wool coat and tunic and trousers pete felt himself slowly turning into a block of ice liable to be fires in the chinese part of town he said that was something over ninety percent of shanghai but he didnt think of it that way theyll throw anything that burns onto the brazier sure they will and they live in those crappy little houses that go up like billybedamned too max answered theyre the exploited ones sighing out fog pete said dont get all red on me man i was just saying it was something we need to be on the lookout for yeah yeah i was saying why we needed to be on the lookout for it dont you think why counts weinstein said what i think is a commie marines as crazy as a fish with fur or a general with sense pete said you take orders from guys like me not from stalin yeah yeah max said again dont remind me somebody better talking out of the side of his mouth pete felt like a movie gangster but if a sergeant or an officer came out to check on the sentries he wouldnt be seen moving his lips whyd you join the corps if youre a fuckin red on account of i like banging heads an theyd jug me if i did it back in the states max answered i thought about going to spain instead sometimes it still looks like i shoulda done that wonder how many fascists i woulda shot by now they shoot back pete said dryly besides youre liable to get your chance against the japs aint like they dont deserve it too but id rather shoot nazis any day max said gee how come pete asked weinstein gave him a sidelong dirty look two guesses asshole and the first one dont count thats corporal asshole to you pete had given max grief first if the other marine came back with something snappy he couldnt very well resent it oh he could but then hed really be an asshole funny guy funny like a truss max said before mcgill could answer something blew up a couple of blocks away pete was on the ground before he knew how hed got there not knocked over by the blast but automatically hitting the deck hed brought his springfield to his shoulder and had a round in the chamber and his finger on the trigger ready for well for anything marine training and drill were wondrous things weinstein sprawled a few feet away as ready as pete was the fuck he said yeah i pete got interrupted again another blast went off and then another and another son of a bitch he said i think theyre trying to blow shanghai up whos they max asked through several more booms some almost as close as the first others much farther off it was a good question as far as pete could see it had only one possible answer gotta be the chinks if this doesnt drive the japs squirrely whats going to more bombs went off as he spoke no airplanes buzzed overhead guerrillas inside the city must have planted the explosives theyd get better results from bombs aimed right at the occupiers than they would have if the ordnance fell thousands of feet from a speeding plane they got the results they wanted all right pete and max had hardly climbed to their feet before shanghai started bubbling like a pot with the lid on too tight chinese and westerners came running out to see what the hell was going on the american consul a pink doublechinned rotarian named bradley worthington iii a worthy whom pete had seen only two or three times before came out for a look around wow that was something wasnt it he said in midwestern accents yes sir pete said he noticed maxs trousers were out at the knee from his dive to the pavement if the consul said anything about it pete would have to gig the other sentry then max would find ways to make him sorry even if the red jew was only a private but worthington wasnt going to get excited about pants with holes he had bigger things to worry about the japanese will turn this place inside out and upside down to catch the terrorists who just did that he predicted yes sir mcgill repeated in a different tone of voice hed always assumed anyone plump prosperous and midwestern was unlikely to have two brain cells to rub together but bradley worthington iii had just come up with the same conclusion he had himself if that didnt make the consul a clever fellow what would shooting broke out a couple of minutes later max cocked his head to one side listening he was supposed to hold his stiff brace but the times were irregular arisakasmost of em anyway he said yeah they are pete agreed not wasting any time are they the consul said no sir pete answered suddenly painfully he hoped vera was okay the chinese shouldnt have had much reason to target the joint where she danced and slept but he knew he was going to worry any which way till he heard from her how long till his relief came he figured hed go check on her as soon as he could then a fire engine tore past red lights blinking and bells clanging more noise said ambulances were hauling casualties to hospitals please god went through petes mind dont let anything bad happen to her please a platoon of japanese soldiers went by at a quick march the lieutenant in charge of them shot the american consulate a look full of vitriol because it hadnt been bombed that was how it seemed to pete one of the ordinary japs started to aim his rifle at worthington a noncom yelled at him and he didnt follow through the platoon rounded the corner and disappeared pete decided going to check on vera might not be such a hot idea after all if the japs could think about firing at the consul on the steps of his own building what would they do to a marine they caught running around by his lonesome nothing goodpete was sure of that rifle fire crackled almost close enough to make him dive for cover bradley worthington iii started to do the same thing and checked himself at about the same time that was interesting had the consul gone over there in pete wouldnt have been surprised this could get very bad worthington said as if to underscore the words a machine gun went off in the distance a long somber stutter of death mcgill wondered whom the japs were shooting at he wondered if they knewor if they cared bad this could be another nanking max said christ i hope not pete said and the us consul nodded when the japs took nanking they went bluegoose loony most of the stories that came back from there were too outrageous to seem possible which proved exactly nothing because some of the worst stories had photos to back them up you wouldnt think people could do such things to other people let alone have fun while they were doing it but that was what the photos seemed to show another machine gun started up this one closer the gunner was an old pro squeezing out one murderous burp after another pete could hear screams too again who were the targets some of the chinese whod planted bombs or poor luckless devils who happened to have wound up in front of the gun a pause another short burst and then one more pete didnt know who the gunners targets were but he knew too well what he guessed they gave joaquin delgadillo his very own set of denim coveralls his old uniform was so torn and tattered it was almost falling off of him several nationalist prisoners were already wearing the unofficial uniform of the republic he was glad of that he wouldnt have wanted to be the first one he got razzed even so gone over to the other side have you said a middleaged pow still in the nationalists yellowish khaki im the same as i was yesterday joaquin answered only the clothes are different the same as you were yesterday the older man returned well how were you then by god why the same as i am today claro delgadillo said the other pow laughed and let him alone he was glad of that he didnt know himself how hed been yesterday not in the way the older man meant everything spun round and round inside his head making him wonder which way was upor if any way was he had all the things hed believed since he was a kid and he had chaim weinberg the jew threw grenades at those old certainties every time he opened his mouth if what weinberg said was true the republic had been right all along if what he said was true the future lay in its hands things would be richer freer better than anything marshal sanjurjo could deliver if but it was a big if joaquin had been fighting the republic for a long time before he got captured hed been in the republican trenches hed taken prisoners before he became one the bastards on the other sideon this sidewere at least as skinny at least as sorry as the fellows hed fought alongside they could claim to be the wave of the future but their present looked pretty sorry of course so did what hed been fighting for what did landlords do why they took factory owners the same thing no doubt about it priests them too them more than any of the others because what did they give back nothing you could eat nothing you could wear nothing you could use they give you heaven or a chance for it everything that got pounded into him while he was growing up was still there it hadnt gone away even if the jewthe jewhad done his best to exorcise it but now it had company inside his head new ideas and old warred in there like republicans and nationalists yes just like that he thought unhappily plainly the republic wasnt the tool of satan hed thought it was before the trench raid that went south as plainly more things were wrong with the nationalist regime than hed imagined but did that make the republic the new earthly paradise if it did how come he was still lousy free love called another nationalist still in decrepit khaki pointing to his overalls oh piss off joaquin said and his fellow prisoner chuckled it was an article of faith among the nationalists that all the women who favored the republic would lie down for you if you snapped your fingers joaquin didnt know of anybody whod had the chance to find out whether that was true but he did know everybody on his old side believed it which meant what weinberg went on and on about how stupid it was to take anything on faith unless you had a reason to think this that or the other thing why do it he would ask that over and over and nobody had a good answer for him joaquin had had a question that gave the jew pause though why do you think stalin is so wonderful have you met him have you gone to russia no weinberg said slowly but i have seen the bad things hitler and mussolini are doing theres a saying in english it goes the enemy of my enemy is my friend hitler and mussolini are the enemies of the workers and peasants stalin has to be their friend then we think stalin is spains enemy joaquin said where is spains gold in moscow thats where stalin stole it no he didnt weinberg shook his head the republic bought weapons from russia nobody else would sell to us but stalin did maybe that was true maybe it wasnt joaquin realized he shouldnt argue he believed some of what the guy whod captured him came out with if he tried to convince weinberg and the other reds on the far side of the barbed wire that he believed all of it maybe theyd turn him loose once he was on the far side of the wire himself well what then would they hand him a rifle and send him to a trench somewhere to fight against the men for whom hed formerly fought if they did that he might be better off staying right where he was some people did switch sides about half of them fought harder for the side they chose themselves than for the one where theyd started the rest were spies or worthless for some other reason sorting out who was who got interesting then again it was also possible that a distant trench was a better place than a pow camp in the middle of madrid nationalist bombers still visited the capital joaquin had cheered them on when they flew over the lines hed wanted the republicans to get what was coming to them now there was a chance that some of what was coming to them would land on him instead before theyd unloaded on madrid in broad daylight they mostly came at night these days the more modern fighters the republic had got from france and england made day bombing too costly to try very often any more even coming by day the bombers werent very accurate the craters pocking the park proved as much flying by night did nothing to improve their aim pounding guns and wailing sirens woke joaquin from a fitful sleep it was cold it had been bitterly cold latelythis was going to be a winter to remember and in no fond way the drone of engines overhead penetrated the rest of the din fuck em all somebody in the big tent said and promptly started snoring again joaquin envied him without being able to imitate him too much racket and too much in the way of nerves too swearing under his breath joaquin went outside to watch the show the sky was black as a sergeants heart the stars seemed even farther off than usualgrudging little flecks of light the blue ones might have been cut from ice the red ones didnt feel warm either searchlights darted and probed antiaircraft tracers and bursts were beautiful but they didnt make joaquin think of celebrations the way they usually did he knew too well that this was war and all the bright lights intended nothing but death a searchlight speared a threeengined bomberan italian planein its glare antiaircraft fire from half a dozen guns converged on the machine the gunners could see the bomber twisted and jinked writhing like a steppedon bug the searchlight hung on to it others also found the bomber fire licked along its right wing it tumbled toward the ground bombs whistled down not all the sirens that screamed belonged to the warning system some came from ambulances and fire engines joaquin wondered if he should jump into a trench the pows had dug them to try to stay alive through air raids but the show in the sky held a horrid fascination he didnt want to miss any of it he could have been smarter he could have done a better job of gauging the screams of falling bombs one went off close enough to knock him ass over teakettle fragments shouted and screamed past him once bitten twice shyhe stayed flat as a runover toad he did anyhow till he saw prisoners joyously running out through a big hole blasted in the wire then he scrambled to his feet and ran with them no guards shouted warnings or opened fire had they been blown to hell or were they just cowering in their own foxholes the way any men with a gram of sense would joaquin didnt care as soon as he got out into madrid in these overalls hed look like anybody else and thanks to chaim weinberg he knew how to sound like a republican too theyd never catch him once he got loose then he could what he wondered what could he do something anything as long as he was doing it for himself who cared if somebody needed him to haul sacks of shit hed do that hed like it too hed never been afraid of work nobody who grew up on a spanish farm could possibly be afraid of work another bomb whistled down joaquin flattened out again this one was going to be even closer maybe he should have waited before he chapter snow wind cold gloom sergei yaroslavsky took them for granted in wintertime he could think of very few russians who didntthe lucky handful who lived on the crimean coast perhaps the bad weather was settling in earlier than usual but even ordinary winters were long and hard by contrast anastas mouradian gave forth with a melodramatic shiver bozhemoi this weathers beastly he said in his accented russian he swigged from a bottle of vodka and passed it to sergei nobody would fly today not the red air force not the poles not the luftwaffe nobody by all the signs nobody would get off the ground any time soon either its winter stas sergei answered you got out of armenia a while ago now you know what winters are like once you come north like hell like dantes hell in the inferno mouradian said he put satan in ice not in fire either one would work if i believed in god or satan or hell mouradian tacked on the coda to keep the other officers sitting around there getting drunk because there was nothing more interesting to do from thinking him a believer he wasnt or not much of one believing in god and worshiping werent illegal but they wouldnt do your career any good another bottle came by sergei swigged then passed it on to mouradian the armenian said what do you suppose the other ranks are doing now overhearing that colonel borisov laughed raucously everybodyd put away a good deal by then those motherfuckers theyre already under the tableyou can bet your balls on it when they settle in with the popskull they dont dick around the squadron commander said maybe hed poured down enough vodka to leave his tongue loose at both ends or maybe he was just using mat to tell the truth as he saw it either way yaroslavsky thought he was bound to be right i hope sergeant kuchkov doesnt get into a brawl sergei said the liquor was making him fussily precise instead of careless and sloppy even mouradian smiled at the way he spoke the chimp will do whatever he does he said he proves darwin was rightif we still have apemen among us we must have come from them a long time ago kuchkovs reputation had spread through the whole squadron better not let him hear you talk like that a pilot warned hed tear your head off and piss in the hole hed be sorry afterwards but so would i mouradian broke in and got a laugh you bet you would be the other officer said wouldnt do you a kopeks worth of good though one more drunken truth hes still a good man to have in the bomb bay sergei said sure he is the other fellow agreed hes got more muscles in his cock than most guys have in their leg that was an exaggeration sergei thought so anyhow colonel borisov looked at his wristwatch that made several other people sergei among them do the same thing it was three or four minutes before the top of the hour borisov stood up a moment later he involuntarily sat down again swearing he tried again he swayed this time but stayed on his feet proud as a sozzled peacock he shuffled over to the radio set and turned it on the tubes needed half a minute or so to warm up when sound started coming out of the set a childrens chorus was singing of the glories of marx lenin and stalin listening sergei suddenly understood how a fly had to feel while it was drowning in a saucer of sugar syrup his face showed none of that even drunk he had no trouble hiding what he thought few soviet citizens had that kind of trouble most of the surviving ones who did were in a gulag these days mercifully the chorus ended an announcer spent a minute urging his listeners to buy war bonds work like stakhanovites save like stakhanovites he boomed then he too shut up and went away sergei wondered how many exhortations like that hed heard thousands it had to be thousands and the radio was a new invention too he remembered the first time hed ever listened to one hed been sure it was magic what else could it be moscow speaking a familiar voice said you could set your watch by the hourly news bulletins sergei had plenty of times if he tried it now hed make a hash of it enough antifreeze coursed through his veins to make that a certainty moscow speaking the newsreader repeated fierce fighting continues east of warsaw fascist claims to have driven the heroes of the red army back in headlong retreat are of course nothing but the usual lies that spew like vomit from the hitlerite and smiglyridz regimes advances by the forces of progress however have proved less rapid than our beloved general secretary comrade stalin would have preferred changes in the command structure of red army units fighting in poland are expected to improve matters in short order someone whistled softly sergei didnt see who it was but he shared the sentiment how many generals who hadnt advanced fast enough to suit stalin were advancing on siberia right this minute how many had died of mm heart failure when you shot a man in the back of the head his heart did stop beating heart failure made for a nice neat death certificate english french and norwegian forces continue to retreat in norway the newsreader continued we must resign ourselves to the fact that the capitalist and imperialist forces cannot be relied upon to check the nazis and that another country is vanishing down the hitlerite maw if norway falls it will bring the german cannibals dangerously close to the soviet unions northwestern borderonly a thin slice of finnish territory separates norway from the ussr and finland under the reactionary rule of marshal mannerheim cannot be relied upon the remain neutral what did that mean was stalin thinking about taking finland himself before the nazis could if he was would he get away with it the soviet union had had a tougher time in poland than anyone expected how tough were the finns sergei had no idea and wasnt eager to gain a firsthand education on the subject in the far east fighting continues against the japanese imperialists the newsman said and not another word on that score the bald announcement could mean only one thing the fighting wasnt going well for the soviet union sergei had wondered if the squadron would be detached from the fighting in poland and sent across the ussr to bomb the japanese invaders since it hadnt happened yet he doubted it would for a while not till spring at the earliest days of decent flying weather were so scarce in this season it might be faster to disassemble the sbs and ship them and their crews by train then put the machines back together again the trouble with that was the planes couldnt go far enough by rail barring a miracle vladivostok would fall and marxistleninist doctrine had no room for miracles too bad sergei thought the motherland could really use one over there on another front japans intolerable aggression and oppression have reaped what the historical dialectic would predict the newsreader continued chinese guerrilla strikes against the brutal enemy continue in shanghai peking and other centers occupied by the invaders anything that damages japan on one front cannot help but damage her on all fronts he was right sergei supposed he also sounded like someone whistling in the dark to try to show he wasnt afraid if japan were fighting the united states in the pacific that might draw off enough energy to weaken her against the ussr chinese guerrillas werent a big enough cause to create the same effect but the united states remained neutral if japan beat the ussr that would be all right with the americans and if the soviet union finally beat japan that would be all right too why not either way each country would hurt the other badly and the usa would end up facing a weakened foe the newsreader started bragging about aluminum production hydroelectric plants and kilometers of copper wire sergei stopped listening industrial output was important but he couldnt do anything about it the vodka bottle came round once more he damn well could do something about that he could and he did the bottle felt noticeably lighter when he passed it again outside the wind raved on christmas was coming again peggy druce hadnt expected to spend one holiday season away from herb let alone two she couldnt do anything about that before this latest trip to europe shed always thought she was too important or at least too clever for anything bad to happen to her she knew better now when the world went to hell around you you discovered you werent fireproof after all no matter what youd thought before well im doing asbestos i can she thought and smiled and flinched at the same time herb would make that kind of horrible pun at any excuse or none making it here wouldnt do her any good a lot of swedes maybe even most of them knew some english but they wouldnt get the wordplaywhich might be just as well still this was better than the joyless christmas and new years shed spent in berlin the year before the lights were onno blackouts in sweden food wasnt rationed people here wore better clothes and they went around looking happier than the germans had why not sweden wasnt in the war she wouldnt be either unless the nazis dragged her in the swedes were ready to fight if germany tried it you saw plenty of men in uniform in stockholm sweden had stronger industries than either denmark or norway she bought planes and tanks from other countries but also built her own she made her own artillery too peggy didnt suppose sweden could actually lick germany but shed let hitler know hed been in a fight didnt he already have enough on his plate he seemed likely to win in norway and germany and poland were doing all right against russia peggy was sure hitler would happily fight stalin to the last drop of polish blood but things werent going so well for the nazi supermen in the west and that was the key front wasnt it when the war first broke out she would have been certain it was with the exception that the german attack on marianske lazne almost killed her and what could be more important than that she wasnt so sure any more one way or another the russians would have their say peggy was no redherb would have bopped her over the head with something had she leaned that waybut she could look at a map and make sense of what she saw there was an awful lot of russia and there were an awful lot of russians sooner or later that had to count unless of course it didnt only one way to tell wait and see peggy had just reached that brilliant conclusion when a knock on the door to her hotel room chased it out of her head she opened the door without the least hesitation certainly with less than she would have shown in a hotel back in the states stockholm wasnt the kind of place where a burglar was likely to cosh you and make off with whatever he could carry yes she said and then ja the word was the same in swedish as in german but she tried to make it sound different jut because she could speak some german didnt mean she wanted to hello my name is gunnar landquist the man standing in the hallway said in almost perfect english i am a reporter from the handelstidningen in goteborg that was swedens secondlargest city right across the kattegat from denmark landquist was about her own age tall with brown hair going gray very fair skin and blue eyes isnt that the newspaper the germans dont like she said one of them landquist answered with a smallboy grin that made him look much younger no the nazis werent happy about freedom of the press and the freer the press was to call them the sobs they were the less happy they got the swede went on you have seen of the war more than most civilians or so my friends tell me our readers i am sure would be interested in the views of an intelligent american traveler thats nice peggy said where do you think youll find one the swede blinked then threw back his head and laughed oh it will be a pleasure to interview you he exclaimed he was armed with a pencil and a spiralbound notebook nearly identical to the ones reporters in the usa carried i doubt it but come on in anyway peggy stood aside so landquist could he laughed again when he perched on a chair peggy sat on the edge of the bed okay what do you want to know she asked how do you feel about the germans and their war he poised pencil above paper waiting peggy was about to rip hitler for all she was worth then she wondered what would happen if she did and german troops suddenly appeared in stockholm the way they had in copenhagen nothing good not to herand not to sweden either the nazis had long memories when it came to slights at least to slights aimed at them and so she was more prudent than she might have been what i want to do most is get back to the united states the german diplomats have done everything they could to give me a hand even hitler himself cleared up some red tape for me once butshe gave gunnar landquist one of her crooked smilesthey wont stop the shooting just to let me go back darn it he scribbled you have been under attack by the germans and by england and france is it not so which is worse her smile grew more crooked yet the one thats going on right this minute is the worst attack ever the one you lived through yesterday you dont need to worry about any more i see yes that makes good sense landquist wrote some more sorry ill try not to let it happen again peggy said he blinked again peggy got the feeling he had to put it into swedish inside his own head before he could realize it was meant for a joke once he figured it out he didnt hold back he had a big booming guffaw that made you want to like him you are wicked he said plainly meaning it for a compliment thank you peggy answered deadpan which produced another explosion of merriment from him my my he said how am i to write a story when i am laughing so hard let me ask you a more serious question with all the rationing she uses how long can germany go on fighting that was serious all right peggy gave it the best answer she could a long time at least by what i saw the food isnt so great but theres enough of it nobodys going hungry people cant get many new clothes but they can manage with their old stuff most of whats new goes straight to the wehrmacht but ive heard theres rationing in england and france too youd know better than i would and more about how tight it is i know it is there past that landquist shrugged no one on either side seems happy to admit he has not got plenty of everything youre bound to be right landquist lit a cigarette an american chesterfield seeing peggys wistful stare he offered her the pack they hadnt been her brand back in the usa but they came closer than any of the european blends shed been smoking she sighed with pleasure after he gave her a light then he said with the fighting to our west not many more of these will come through the war to the west is why im still here peggy answered floating on clouds of tobaccoflavored nostalgia i mean sweden is a nice country and everything but id still rather go home i want to but i cant i am sorry unlike a lot of people who said that gunnar landquist actually sounded as if he meant it if there were something i could do that subjunctive was correct even so most americans would have said if there was sometimes you could tell foreigners because they spoke your language more accurately than you did since you cannot go what will you do landquist asked stay peggy said which made him laugh yet again she went on if i have to stay somewhere that isnt america this is a nice place to be i am glad to hear it i shall write it down and quote you write it down he did he tipped her a wink so you like us better than germany do you oh lord yes peggy blurted gunnar landquist wrote that down too peggy wondered if she ought to ask him not to ifno whenthe germans read it it would only piss them off shed been trying to avoid that even in this interview well too goddamn bad this time she thought it was nothing but the truth theo hossbach hadnt much enjoyed spending a winter in the field in the low countries and france by the way things were going spending a winter in the field in poland would be even less fun he came from breslau not that far west of where he was now winters got pretty beastly there too not so beastly as this though he didnt think so anyhow adi stoss came from some lousy little town near munster way the hell over on the other side of germany he pissed and moaned about the cold and wind like you wouldnt believe this weather ought to be against the geneva convention he said with an exaggerated shiver huddling close to the fire the panzer crew had made of boards taken from a wrecked farmhouse the peasant whose house it had been was in no position to complain theyd found his body and his wifes and a little boys in the ruins screw the weather hermann witt said the panzer commander didnt get far from the fire either no matter what he said he wasnt one of the people who could light a cigarette in any weather finally giving it up as a bad job he went on what ought to be against the fucking geneva convention are the russians a puff of fog escaped from adis mouth as he grunted theo made some kind of small noise too but the wind grabbed it and blew it away neither of his crewmates paid any attention chances were they wouldnt have even if theyd heard him he didnt worry about that it wasnt as if he wanted people paying attention to him for gods sake adi looked east he pounded his mittened hands together to try to get some blood flowing in them you suppose its true what the damn foot soldiers were going on about i mean that the ivans cut the cocks off our guys in that patrol they caught that they stuffed em in their mouths afterwards gloomily witt nodded yeah i believe it i went through basic with one of the guys who found em im not saying benno wouldnt tell a lie but he wouldnt tell that kind of lieknow what i mean i only wish i didnt the driver answered he pounded his hands some more staring down at the ground between his feet when he looked up again his face seemed ravaged and old heres hoping our guys were dead before the russkis went to work on em yeah heres hoping witt scowled if i thought they were going to do that to me id shoot myself first christ who wouldnt stoss cupped his hands in front of his crotch fun old war aint it fun aber naturlich the corners of the sergeants mouth turned down even farther how the hell are you supposed to fight against people who do that kind of shit they arent people not really nothing but savages how do you fight em you kill em thats how and you make goddamn sure they dont take you alive adi slapped his hip i never let loose of my pistol these days makes sense to me witt turned toturned ontheo how about you hossbach huh theo said in surprise a blush heated his face he couldnt leave it there a few more words came out adi usually makes sense fat lot of good it does him too witt said sorry son of a bitch is stuck in poland just like the rest of us oh there are worse places adi said lightly yeah witt challenged name two dachau belsen all at once stoss tone wasnt light any more the names came off his tongue flat and hard as paving stones he didnt just kill the conversation he shot it right behind the ear witt got very busyalmost theatrically busyheating meatandbarley stew in his mess tin the cooks coyly declined to tell their customers what kind of meat it was that made theo suspect it would whinny if you poked it with a fork hed eaten horsemeat in the field before this had the same strong flavor and gluey texture he didnt worry about it a full belly beat an empty one any day of the week like adalbert stoss he preferred poland to a concentration camp inside the reich that didnt mean bad things couldnt happen to you here the russians announced that they werent shutting down for the christmas season by shelling the hell out of the position the wehrmacht and the poles were holding shouts of urra and the rumble of enemy panzers coming forward said they werent kidding around either as soon as the first shells burst all the german panzer crewmen raced for their machine theo slammed his hatch shut behind him a moment later fragments clanged off the panzer iis hull theo gave the interior wall a happy pat he pitied groundpounders why arent you starting this lousy cocksucker witt shouted at adi what the fuck do you think im trying to do the driver shouted back behind theo the starter motor clicked and whined the main engine didnt want to catch its cold outside stoss added well the ivans sure as shit have theirs going witt said that wasnt good news which was putting it mildly sitting in a panzer that didnt want to move made theo stop envying the infantry fine sarge adi said with what sounded like patience stretched very thin you can go jump in a russian panzer if that makes you happy he didnt say you can go jump in a lake but if theo could hear the words hanging in the air the panzer commander was bound to be able to hear them too if you dont get us started wed better bail out because one of those assholes is heading our way witts patience was also pretty frayed we dont want to be here when he starts shooting right adi said tightly and then to the panzer ii come on you he hadnt been in the army very long but he cussed like a twentyyear veteran the starter motor ground once moreand then with a coughing roar the main engine caught there you go witt yelled get us moving make for those bushes and for gods sake step on it adi must have stepped on it because the panzer ii jumped forward theo couldnt see what was going on outside how far away was the russian panzer the commanderd been having a fit about how soon before it opened up the ivans werent great gunners but a hit from anything bigger than a machinegun round would hole this thin armor the panzer iis little turret traversed the mm gun fired three rounds in quick succession these russian panzers werent so tough either unlike this one their cannon could fire useful highexplosive shells and give foot soldiers something new to worry about but the mm could get through their armor as easily as they could penetrate a german machines ha witt said nailed that fucker anyhow now go forward well see what kind of friends were keeping him company forward adi agreed forward they went theos inner ears and the seat of his coveralls would have told him so much even absent the order so would the radio traffic dinning in his earphones through the voice tube he told witt scads of ivans this looks like a big push happy day the panzer commander said and then thanks theo he sounded grateful that theo was talking at all even to relay the tactical situation that he did announced that he was getting to know his radioman pretty well a moment later he told adi put us behind that stone fence we can give them plenty of grief from there will do stoss said the panzer stopped a few seconds later so hed presumably done it the turret traversed the main armament fired several rounds witts exultant whoop said one or two of them had done what he wanted then the coaxial machine gun chattered witt knew how to handle the mg he squeezed off one short burst after another giving the barrel time to cool between them more urgent shouts in theos earphones he said sergeant were ordered to pull back theyre breaking through my ass they are witt said indignantly ive wrecked two of their panzers and scared off the foot soldiers and weve got enough infantry of our ownwell poles tooto keep them from flanking us out were ordered theo repeated theyve already torn a hole in our position south of here weve got to retreat so we can organize the counterattack all right ill do it im only a fucking sergeanti have to follow orders witt couldnt have sounded more disgusted he added i sure wouldnt want to be the dipshit officer who gave those orders though when the fuhrer finds out about it that sorry suckerll be lucky if hes still a corporal put it in reverse adisomebody with embroidered shoulder straps has the vapors im doing it the panzer driver replied and matched action to word theo knew what he thought of the fuhrers military judgment among other things he would have been very surprised if adi stoss didnt share his views adi probably had stronger reasons for such opinions than he did himself none of which would matter if the ivans set this perambulating coffin on fire as it did so often the local got in the way of the general once they freed themselves from this mess theo could worry about other things once they did if they did he wished the damned panzer would go faster sarah goldman had got used to the gestapo and the rest of the ss in munster even when the blackshirts werent harassing her or her family she had a feel for how often shed see them theyd become a familiar if unwelcome part of the local fauna like rats or cockroaches the comparison wasnt hers it came from her father in a low voice when they were both out on the street and away from any likely microphones once she heard it she couldnt get it out of her mind it fit too well when she started noticing far more ss uniforms than usual alarm filled her one possibleeven probablereason for a swarm of ss men was a pogrom to her surprise father didnt seem especially worried you may be right of course samuel goldman said but they already had more people than they needed if thats what theyve got in mind importing more would be like running over a kitten with a panzer checkpoints sprang up on every other street corner your papers a blackshirt barked at sarah holding out his hand gulping she gave them to him herehere you are he looked them over then returned them his lip curled that seemed a job requirement when sarah dealt with blackshirts but shed heard plenty of his colleagues who sounded nastier than he did when he asked you are a native of munster you have lived here your whole life yes thats right she answered all right then we dont expect trouble tonight from your kind pass on the ss man said he glowered at the grayhaired man behind her your papers pass on sarah did she wanted to scratch her head only the fear that the ss men at the checkpoint would find the gesture suspicious made her hold back she hurried home to help her mother peel potatoes and turnips and to pass on the curious news they could have given you a worse time but they didnt hanna goldman sounded as if she had trouble believing her ears sarah understood that if her mother had told her the same thing she too would have had trouble believing it after a long pause for thought mother went on i wonder what theyre up to beats me sarah said noise from the usually quiet street in front of the house made them both stop peeling and hurry out to the living room to see what was going on teams of horses drew two enormous antiaircraft guns down the street the men who served the guns followed in a horsedrawn wagon but one with modern rubber tires or it would have been much noisier like the fellows in charge of the gun teams they wore ss black well i dont know whats going on either hanna goldman said i wonder whether anyone does these days that made more sense to sarah than anything shed heard outside the house lately when father got home he had no doubts he seldom did he wasnt always right but he was almost always sure somebody important must be making a speech tonight he declared goring goebbels hess any one of them is possible but my moneys on hitler ah sarah said she didnt know if he had things straight but her money was that he did his explanation cleared up why munster was full of blackshirts they were here to protect somebody important from the wehrmacht and perhaps incidentally from the british and french she told her father about the antiaircraft guns and their ss crews he nodded yes that makes sense if somebody important starts talking in berlin or dresden or breslau the western democracies cant do anything about iteven if the russians might but here once they know a big bonz is talking they can put planes in the air and drop their bombs before hes finished he gave her a lopsided grin thats what you get for letting your speeches run long an abrupt way to edit but no doubt sincere sarah kissed him on his stubbly cheek youre quite mad she said affectionately well i do try father looked pleased with himself he turned on the radio the music that poured out of it would have needed to be more interesting to sound boring sarah thought the orchestra must have been dripped in treacle when the tune ended an announcer spoke in awed tones tonight the fuhrer addresses the german volk and the german reich from munster father looked even more pleased with himself almost indecently so hed not only figured out what was going on hed had the timing down to a t even a clever man which samuel goldman was didnt get to seem so clever very often sarah imagined airmen in flight suits jumping into airplanes with roundels of bluewhitered or redwhiteblue and roaring off into the night toward her home town stormy applause greeted the fuhrer she wondered where exactly he was did nazi bigwigs fill the concert hall or was he speaking at the stadium sudden tears stung her eyes saul had played there hed won cheers for his skill if not cheers like these what good did it do him she only hoped he was still alive people of germany that hot familiar hatefully exciting voice roared out of the radio people of germany i came here to tell you that the reich can never be defeated more applause waves of sound climbing up and falling back hitler went on foreign foes cannot beat us and neither can our own traitors they tried their best to stab us in the back again the way the jews stabbed us at the end of the last war but their best was not good enough samuel goldman made a rude noise if the gestapo did have a microphone hidden in the house their technicians might take it for a burst of static what theyd make of sarahs giggle right afterwards hitler of course wasnt finished we will hang the traitors he thundered we will hang them all small and great together for we have no right to hang the small ones while leaving the great ones fat and safe at home oh the listening nazis cheered sarah wondered how they or anyone could take him seriously those savage sentiments mixed with that stickysweet austrian accent year ago the socialists told me turn back adolf hitler i was only a newly discharged veteran a nobody but i never turned back once the fuhrer declared i never have i never will the reich goes forwardforward to victory sieg heil the party faithful cried sieg heil hitler echoed and we must go on to victory for one year of bolshevism would ruin germany the richest most beautiful civilization in the history of the world would fall into madness and destruction the reds would spare nothing not even our morals and our faith and i tell you this volk of the reich i shall not spare their backers inside germany and i shall not spare the godless jewish masters in moscow sieg heil the audience shouted again heil hitler there will be no peace in our country until we smash bolshevism and treason of every kind hitler said i put my whole life into this struggle every day and so must everyone who has joined me in it i have attacked the traitors and murderers here with my own hand i have shot them dead and now the wehrmacht at last purified from the stupid struggles of internal politics will show its thanks through devotion and loyalty and victory for germany is pledged to victory to victory over our foolish western foes and to a final solution for the bolshevikjewish russian monster we shall not falter we shall not fail like st george we will slay the dragon and he will never rise again sieg heil heil hitler the listening nazis roared hitler thumped a fist down on the lectern to show hed finished they cheered and cheered two and a half hours later munsters airraid sirens wailed a warning flak guns bellowed bombs whistled down out of the heartless sky banned from any proper shelter sarah and her parents huddled under the diningroom table and hoped the house wouldnt come down on top of it i knew theyd show up late her father might have been talking about a student who hadnt turned his paper in on time they might have nailed him if only theyd hustled but hes bound to be gone by now hes bound to be gone sarah agreed and the wars bound to go on right that minute she could think of nothing worse to say
