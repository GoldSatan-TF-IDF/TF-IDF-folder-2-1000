tigana by guy gavriel kay all that you held most dear you will put by and leave behind you and this is the arrow the longbow of your exile first lets fly you will come to know how bitter as salt and stone is the bread of others how hard the way that goes up and down stairs that never are your own dante the paradiso what can a flame remember if it remembers a little less than is necessary it goes out if it remembers a little more than is necessary it goes out if only it could teach us while it burns to remember correctly george seferis stratis the sailor describes a man prologue both moons were high dimming the light of all but the brightest stars the campfires burned on either side of the river stretching away into the night quietly flowing the deisa caught the moonlight and the orange of the nearer fires and cast them back in wavery sinuous ripples and all the lines of light led to his eyes to where he was sitting on the riverbank hands about his knees thinking about dying and the life hed lived there was a glory to the night saevar thought breathing deeply of the mild summer air smelling water and water flowers and grass watching the reflection of blue moonlight and silver on the river hearing the deisas murmurous flow and the distant singing from around the fires there was singing on the other side of the river too he noted listening to the enemy soldiers north of them it was curiously hard to impute any absolute sense of evil to those harmonizing voices or to hate them quite as blindly as being a soldier seemed to require he wasnt really a soldier though and he had never been good at hating he couldnt actually see any figures moving in the grass across the river but he could see the fires and it wasnt hard to judge how many more of them lay north of the deisa than there were here behind him where his people waited for the dawn almost certainly their last he had no illusions none of them did not since the battle at this same river five days ago all they had was courage and a leader whose defiant gallantry was almost matched by the two young sons who were here with him they were beautiful boys both of them saevar regretted that he had never had the chance to sculpt either of them the prince he had done of course many times the prince called him a friend it could not be said saevar thought that he had lived a useless or an empty life hed had his art the joy of it and the spur and had lived to see it praised by the great ones of his province indeed of the whole peninsula and hed known love as well he thought of his wife and then of his own two children the daughter whose eyes had taught him part of the meaning of life on the day shed been born fifteen years ago and his son too young by a year to have been allowed to come north to war saevar remembered the look on the boys face when they had parted he supposed that much the same expression had been in his own eyes hed embraced both children and then hed held his wife for a long time in silence all the words had been spoken many times through all the years then hed turned quickly so they would not see his tears and mounted his horse unwontedly awkward with a sword on his hip and had ridden away with his prince to war against those who had come upon them from over the sea he heard a light tread behind him and to his left from where the campfires were burning and voices were threading in song to the tune a syrenya played he turned to the sound be careful he called softly unless you want to trip over a sculptor saevar an amused voice murmured a voice he knew well it is my lord prince he replied can you remember a night so beautiful valentin walked over there was more than enough light by which to see and sank neatly down on the grass beside him not readily he agreed can you see vidomnis waxing matches ilarions wane the two moons together would make one whole a strange whole that would be saevar said tis a strange night is it is the night changed by what we do down here we mortal men in our folly the way we see it is valentin said softly his quick mind engaged by the question the beauty we find is shaped at least in part by what we know the morning will bring what will it bring my lord saevar asked before he could stop himself half hoping he realized as a child hopes that his darkhaired prince of grace and pride would have an answer yet to what lay waiting across the river an answer to all those ygrathen voices and all the ygrathen fires burning north of them an answer most of all to the terrible king of ygrath and his sorcery and the hatred that he at least would have no trouble summoning tomorrow valentin was silent looking out at the river overhead saevar saw a star fall angling across the sky west of them to plunge most likely into the wideness of the sea he was regretting the question this was no time to be putting a burden of false certitude upon the prince just as he was about to apologize valentin spoke his voice measured and low so as not to carry beyond their small circle of dark i have been walking among the fires and corsin and loredan have been doing the same offering comfort and hope and such laughter as we can bring to ease men into sleep there is not much else we can do they are good boys both of them saevar offered i was thinking that ive never sculpted either of them im sorry for that valentin said if anything lasts for any length of time after us it will be art such as yours our books and music orsarias green and white tower in avalle he paused and returned to his original thought they are brave boys they are also sixteen and nineteen and if i could have i would have left them behind with their brother and your son it was one of the reasons saevar loved him that valentin would remember his own boy and think of him with the youngest prince even now at such a time as this to the east and a little behind them away from the fires a trialla suddenly began to sing and both men fell silent listening to the silver of that sound saevars heart was suddenly full he was afraid that he might shame himself with tears that they would be mistaken for fear valentin said but i havent answered your question old friend truth seems easier here in the dark away from the fires and all the need i have been seeing there saevar i am so sorry but the truth is that almost all of the mornings blood will be ours and i am afraid it will be all of ours forgive me there is nothing to forgive saevar said quickly and as firmly as he could this is not a war of your making nor one you could avoid or undo and besides i may not be a soldier but i hope i am not a fool it was an idle question i can see the answer for myself my lord in the fires across the river and the sorcery valentin added quietly more that than the fires we could beat back greater numbers even weary and wounded as we are from last weeks battle but brandins magic is with them now the lion has come himself not the cub and because the cub is dead there must be blood for the morning sun should i have surrendered last week to the boy saevar turned to look at the prince in the blended moonlight disbelieving he was speechless for a moment then found his voice i would have gone home from that surrender he said with resolution and walked into the palace by the sea and smashed every sculpture i ever made of you a second later he heard an odd sound it took him a moment to realize that valentin was laughing because it wasnt laughter like any saevar had ever heard oh my friend the prince said at length i think i knew you would say that oh our pride our terrible pride will they remember that most about us do you think after we are gone perhaps saevar said but they will remember the one thing we know with certainty is that they will remember us here in the peninsula and in ygrath and quileia even west over the sea in barbadior and its empire we will leave a name and we leave our children valentin said the younger ones sons and daughters who will remember us babes in arms our wives and grandfathers will teach when they grow up to know the story of the river deisa what happened here and even more what we were in this province before the fall brandin of ygrath can destroy us tomorrow he can overrun our home but he cannot take away our name or the memory of what we have been he cannot saevar echoed feeling an odd unexpected lift to his heart i am sure that you are right we are not the last free generation there will be ripples of tomorrow that run down all the years our childrens children will remember us and will not lie tamely under the yoke and if any of them seem inclined to valentin added in a different tone there will be the children or grandchildren of a certain sculptor who will smash their heads for them of stone or otherwise saevar smiled in the darkness he wanted to laugh but it was not in him just then i hope so my lord if the goddesses and the god allow thank you thank you for saying that no thanks saevar not between us and not this night the triad guard and shelter you tomorrow and after and guard and shelter all that you have loved saevar swallowed you know you are a part of that my lord a part of what i have loved valentin did not reply only after a moment he leaned forward and kissed saevar upon the brow then he held up a hand and the sculptor his eyes blurring raised his own hand and touched his princes palm to palm in farewell valentin rose and was gone a shadow in moonlight back towards the fires of his army the singing seemed to have stopped on both sides of the river it was very late saevar knew he should be making his own way back and settling down for a few snatched hours of sleep it was hard to leave though to rise and surrender the perfect beauty of this last night the river the moons the arch of stars the fireflies and all the fires in the end he decided to stay there by the water he sat alone in the summer darkness on the banks of the river deisa with his strong hands loosely clasped about his knees he watched the two moons set and all the fires slowly die and he thought of his wife and children and the lifes work of his hands that would live after him and the trialla sang for him all night long part one a blade in the soul chapter in the autumn season of the wine word went forth from among the cypresses and olives and the laden vines of his country estate that sandre duke of astibar once ruler of that city and its province had drawn the last bitter breath of his exile and age and died no servants of the triad were by his side to speak their rituals at his end not the whiterobed priests of eanna nor those of dark morian of portals nor the priestesses of adaon the god there was no particular surprise in astibar town when these tidings came with the word of the dukes passing exiled sandres rage at the triad and its clergy through the last eighteen years of his life was far from being a secret and impiety had never been a thing from which sandre dastibar even in the days of his power had shied away the city was overflowing with people from the outlying distrada and far beyond on the eve of the festival of vines in the crowded taverns and khav rooms truths and lies about the duke were traded back and forth like wool and spice by folk who had never seen his face and who would have once paled with justifiable terror at a summons to the ducal court in astibar all his days duke sandre had occasioned talk and speculation through the whole of the peninsula men called the palm and there was nothing to alter that fact at the time of his dying for all that alberico of barbadior had come with an army from that empire overseas and exiled sandre into the distrada eighteen years before when power is gone the memory of power lingers perhaps because of this and certainly because he tended to be cautious and circumspect in all his ways alberico who held four of the nine provinces in an iron grip and was vying with brandin of ygrath for the ninth acted with a precise regard for protocol by noon of the day the duke died a messenger from alberico was seen to have ridden out by the eastern gate of the city a messenger bearing the bluesilver banner of mourning and carrying no one doubted carefully chosen words of condolence to sandres children and grandchildren now gathered at their broad estate seven miles beyond the walls in the paelion the khav room where the wittier sort were gathering that season it was cynically observed that the tyrant would have been more likely to send a company of his own barbadian mercenaries not just a single messagebearer were the living sandreni not such a feckless lot before the appreciative eyetowhomightbelistening ripple of amusement at that had quite died away one itinerant musician there were scores of them in astibar that week had offered to wager all he might earn in the three days to come that from the island of chiara would arrive condolences in verse before the festival was over too rich an opportunity the rash newcomer explained cradling a steaming mug of khav laced with one of the dozen or so liqueurs that lined the shelves behind the bar of the paelion brandin will be incapable of letting slip a chance like this to remind alberico and the rest of us that though the two of them have divided our peninsula the share of art and learning is quite tilted west towards chiara mark my words and wager who will well have a knottily rhymed verse from stout doarde or some silly acrostic thing of camenas to puzzle out with sandre spelled six ways and backwards before the music stops in astibar three days from now there was laughter though again it was guarded even on the eve of the festival when a long tradition that alberico of barbadior had circumspectly indulged allowed more license than elsewhere in the year a few men with heads for figures did some rapid calculations of sailingtime and the chances of the autumn seas north of senzio province and down through the archipelago and the musician found his wager quickly covered and recorded on the slate on the wall of the paelion that existed for just such a purpose in a city prone to gambling but shortly after that all wagers and mocking chatter were forgotten someone in a steep cap with a curled feather flung open the doors of the khav room shouted for attention and when he had it reported that the tyrants messenger had just been seen returning through the same eastern gate from which he had so lately sallied forth that the messenger was riding at an appreciably greater speed than hitherto and that not three miles to his rear was the funerary procession of duke sandre dastibar being brought by his last request to lie a night and a day in state in the city he once had ruled in the paelion the reaction was immediate and predictable men began shouting fiercely to be heard over the din they themselves were causing noise and politics and the anticipated pleasures of the festival made for a thirsty afternoon so brisk was his trade that the excitable proprietor of the paelion began inadvertently serving full measures of liqueur in the laced khavs being ordered in profusion his wife of more phlegmatic disposition continued to shortmeasure all her patrons with benevolent lack of favoritism theyll be turned back young adreano the poet cried decisively banging down his mug and sloshing hot khav over the dark oak table of the paelions largest booth alberico will never allow it there were growls of assent from his friends and the hangerson who always clustered about this particular table adreano stole a glance at the traveling musician whod made the brash wager on brandin of ygrath and his court poets on chiara the fellow looking highly amused his eyebrows quizzically arched leaned back comfortably in the chair he had brazenly pulled up to the booth some time ago adreano felt seriously offended by the man and didnt know whether his umbrage had been more aroused by the musicians socasual assertion of chiaras preeminence in culture or by his flippant dismissal of the great camena di chiara whom adreano had been assiduously imitating for the past halfyear both in the fashion of his verses and the wearing of a threelayered cloak by day and night adreano was intelligent enough to be aware that there might be a contradiction inherent in these twinned sources of ire but he was also young enough and had drunk a more than sufficient quantity of khav laced with senzian brandy for that awareness to remain well below the level of his conscious thoughts which remained focused on this presumptuous rustic the man had evidently journeyed into the city to saw or pluck for three days at some country instrument or other in exchange for a handful of astins to squander at the festival how did such a fellow dare sail into the most fashionable khav room in the eastern palm and thump his rural behind down onto a chair at the most coveted table in that room adreano still carried painfully vivid memories of the long month it had taken him even after his first verses had appeared in print to circle warily closer flinching inwardly at apprehended rebuffs before he became a member of the select and wellknown circle that had a claim upon this booth he found himself actually hoping that the musician would presume to contradict his opinion he had a choice couplet already prepared about rabble of the road spewing views on their betters in the company of their betters as if on cue to that thought the fellow slumped even more comfortably back in his chair stroked a prematurely silvered temple with a long finger and said directly to adreano this seems to be my afternoon for wagers ill risk everything im about to win on the other matter that alberico is too cautious to ruffle the mood of the festival over this there are too many people in astibar right now and spirits are running too high even with the halfmeasured drinks they serve in here to people who should know better he grinned to take some of the sting from the last words far better for the tyrant to be gracious he went on to lay his old enemy ceremoniously to rest once and for all and then offer thanks to whatever gods his emperor overseas is ordering the barbadians to worship these days thanks and offerings for he can be certain that the geldings sandres left behind will be pleasingly swift to abandon the unfashionable pursuit of freedom that sandre stood for in ungelded astibar by the end of his speech he was not smiling nor did the wideset grey eyes look away from adreanos own and here for the first time were truly dangerous words softly spoken but they had been heard by everyone in the booth and suddenly their corner of the paelion became an unnaturally quiet space amid the unchecked din everywhere else in the room adreanos derisive couplet so swiftly composed now seemed trivial and inappropriate in his own ears he said nothing his heart beating curiously fast with some effort he kept his gaze on the musicians who added the crooked smile returning do we have a wager friend parrying for time while he rapidly began calculating how many astins he could lay palms on by cornering certain friends adreano said would you care to enlighten us as to why a farmer from the distrada is so free with his money to come and with his views on matters such as this the others smile widened showing even white teeth im no farmer he protested genially nor from your distrada either im a shepherd from up in the south tregea mountains and ill tell you a thing the grey eyes swung round amused to include the entire booth a flock of sheep will teach you more about men than some of us would like to think and goats well goats will do better than the priests of morian to make you a philosopher especially if youre out on a mountain in rain chasing after them with thunder and night coming on together there was genuine laughter around the booth abetted somewhat by the release of tension adreano tried unsuccessfully to keep his own expression sternly repressive have we a wager the shepherd asked one more time his manner friendly and relaxed adreano was saved the need to reply and several of his friends were spared an amount of grief and lost astins by the arrival even more precipitous than that of the featherhatted talebearer of nerone the painter albericos given permission he trumpeted over the roar in the paelion hes just decreed that sandres exile ended when he died the dukes to lie in state tomorrow morning at the old sandreni palace and have a fullhonors funeral with all nine of the rites provided he paused dramatically provided the clergy of the triad are allowed in to do their part of it the implications of all this were simply too large for adreano to brood much upon his own loss of face young overly impetuous poets had that happen to them every second hour or so but these these were great events his gaze for some reason returned to the shepherd the mans expression was mild and interested but certainly not triumphant ah well the fellow said with a rueful shake of his head i suppose being right will have to compensate me for being poor the story of my life i fear adreano laughed he clapped the portly breathless nerone on the back and shifted over to make room for the painter eanna bless us both he said to him you just saved yourself more astins than you have i would have touched you to make a wager i would have just lost with your tidings by way of reply nerone picked up adreanos halffull khav mug and drained it at a pull he looked around optimistically but the others in the booth were guarding their drinks knowing the painters habits very well with a chuckle the darkhaired shepherd from tregea proffered his own mug selftaught never to query largesse nerone quaffed it down he did murmur a thankyou when the khav was drained adreano noted the exchange but his mind was racing down unfamiliar channels to an unexpected conclusion you have also he said abruptly addressing nerone but speaking to the booth at large just reaffirmed how shrewd the barbadian sorcerer ruling us is alberico has now succeeded with one decree in tightening his bonds with the clergy of the triad hes placed a perfect condition upon the granting of the dukes last wish sandres heirs will have to agree not that theyd ever not agree to something and i cant even begin to guess how many astins its going to cost them to assuage the priests and priestesses enough to get them into the sandreni palace tomorrow morning alberico will now be known as the man who brought the renegade duke of astibar back to the grace of the triad at his death he looked around the booth excited by the force of his own reasoning by the blood of adaon it reminds me of the intrigues of the old days when everything was done with this much subtlety wheels within the wheels that guided the fate line of the whole peninsula well now said the tregean his expression turning grave that may be the cleverest insight weve had this noisy day but tell me he went on as adreano flushed with pleasure if what albericos done has just reminded you and others ive no doubt though not likely as swiftly of the way of things in the days before he sailed here to conquer and before brandin took chiara and the western provinces then is it not possible his voice was low for adreanos ears alone in the riot of the room that he has been outplayed at this game after all outplayed by a dead man around them men were rising and settling their accounts in loud haste to be outside where events of magnitude seemed to be unfolding so swiftly the eastern gate was where everyone was going to see the sandreni bring their dead lord home after eighteen years a quarter of an hour earlier adreano would have been on his feet with the others sweeping on his triple cloak racing to reach the gate in time for a good viewing post not now his brain leapt to follow the tregeans voice down this new pathway and understanding flashed in him like a rushlight in darkness you see dont you his new acquaintance said flatly they were alone at the booth nerone had lingered to precipitously drain whatever khav had been left unfinished in the rush for the doors and had then followed the others out into the autumn sunshine and the breeze i think i do adreano said working it out sandre wins by losing by losing a battle he never really cared about the other amended a keenness in his grey eyes i doubt the clergy ever mattered to him at all they werent his enemy however subtle alberico may be the fact is that he won this province and tregea and ferraut and certando because of his army and his sorcery and he holds the eastern palm only through those things sandre dastibar ruled this city and its province for twentyfive years through half a dozen rebellions and assassination attempts that ive heard of he did it with only a handful of sometimes loyal troops with his family and with a guile that was legendary even then what would you say to the suggestion that he refused to let the priests and priestesses into his deathroom last night simply to induce alberico to seize that as a facesaving condition today adreano didnt know what he would say what he did know was that he was feeling a zest an exitement that left him left him unsure whether what he wanted just then was a sword in his hand or a quill and ink to write down the words that were starting to tumble about inside him what do you think will happen he asked with a deference that would have astonished his friends im not sure the other said frankly but i have a growing suspicion that the festival of vines this year may see the beginning of something none of us could have expected he looked for a moment as if he would say more than that but did not instead he rose clinking a jumble of coins onto the table to pay for his khav i must go rehearsaltime im with a company ive never played with before last years plague caused havoc among the traveling musicians thats how i got my reprieve from the goats he grinned then glanced up at the wager board on the wall tell your friends ill be here before sunset three days from now to settle the matter of chiaras poetic condolences farewell for now farewell adreano said automatically and watched as the other walked from the almost empty room the owner and his wife were moving about collecting mugs and glasses and wiping down the tables and benches adreano signaled for a last drink a moment later sipping his khav unlaced this time to clear his head he realized that hed forgotten to ask the musician his name chapter devin was having a bad day at nineteen he had almost completely reconciled himself to his lack of size and to the fairskinned boyish face the triad had given him to go with that it had been a long time since hed been in the habit of hanging by his feet from trees in the woods near the farm back home in asoli striving to stretch a little more height out of his frame the keenness of his memory had always been a source of pride and pleasure to him but a number of the memories that came with it were not he would have been quite happy to be able to forget the afternoon when the twins returning home from hunting with a brace of grele had caught him suspended from a tree upside down six years later it still rankled him that his brothers normally so reliably obtuse had immediately grasped what he was trying to do well help you little one povar had cried joyfully and before devin could right himself and scramble away nico had his arms povar his feet and his burly twin brothers were stretching him between them cackling with great good humor all the while enjoying among other things the ambit of devins precociously profane vocabulary well that had been the last time he actually tried to make himself taller very late that same night hed sneaked into the snoring twins bedroom and carefully dumped a bucket of pig slop over each of them sprinting like adaon on his mountain hed been through the yard and over the farm gate almost before their roaring started hed stayed away two nights then returned to his fathers whipping hed expected to have to wash the sheets himself but povar had done that and both twins stolidly goodnatured had already forgotten the incident devin cursed or blessed with a memory like eanna of the names never did forget the twins might be hard people to hold a grudge against almost impossible in fact but that did nothing to lessen his loneliness on that farm in the lowlands it was not long after that incident that devin had left home apprenticed as a singer to menico di ferraut whose company toured northern asoli every second or third spring devin hadnt been back since taking a weeks leave during the companys northern swing three years ago and again this past spring it wasnt that hed been badly treated on the farm it was just that he didnt fit in and all four of them knew it farming in asoli was serious sometimes grim work battling to hold land and sanity against the constant encroachments of the sea and the hot hazy grey monotony of the days if his mother had lived it might have been different but the farm in asoli where garin of lower corte had taken his three sons had been a dour womanless place acceptable perhaps for the twins who had each other and for the kind of man garin had slowly become amid the almost featureless spaces of the flatlands but no source of nurture or warm memories for a small quick imaginative youngest child whose own gifts whatever they might turn out to be were not those of the land after they had learned from menico di ferraut that devins voice was capable of more than country ballads it had been with a certain collective relief that they had all said their farewells early one spring morning standing in the predictable greyness and rain his father and nico had been turning back to check the height of the river almost before their parting words were fully spoken povar lingered though to awkwardly cuff his little odd brother on the shoulder if they dont treat you right enough hed said you can come home dev theres a place devin remembered both things the gentle blow which had been forced to carry more of a burden of meaning down the years than such a gesture should and the rough quick words that had followed the truth was he really did remember almost everything except for his mother and their days in lower corte but hed been less than two years old when shed died amongst the fighting down there and only a month older when garin had taken his three sons north since then almost everything was held in his mind and if hed been a wagering man which he wasnt having that much of careful asoli in his soul hed have been willing to put a chiaro or an astin down on the fact that he couldnt recall feeling this frustrated in years since if truth were told the days when it looked as if he would never grow at all what devin dasoli asked himself grimly did a person have to do to get a drink in astibar and on the eve of the festival no less the problem would have been positively laughable were it not so infuriating it was the doing he learned quickly enough in the first inn that refused to serve him his requested flask of senzio green wine of the pinchbuttocked joykilling priests of eanna the goddess devin thought fervently deserved better of her servants it appeared that a year ago in the midst of their interminable jockeying for ascendancy with the clergy of morian and adaon eannas priests had convinced the tyrants token council that there was too much licentiousness among the young of astibar and that more to the point of course such license bred unrest and since it was obvious that the taverns and khav rooms bred license it had taken less than two weeks for alberico to promulgate and begin enforcing a law that no youth of less than seventeen years could buy a drink in astibar eannas dustdry priests celebrated in whatever ascetic fashion such men celebrated their petty triumph over the priests of morian and the elegant priestesses of the god both of which deities were associated with darker passions and inevitably wine tavernkeepers were quietly unhappy it didnt do to be loudly unhappy in astibar though not so much for the loss of trade as for the insidious manner in which the law was enforced the promulgated law had simply placed the burden of establishing a patrons age on the owner of each inn tavern or khav room at the same time if any of the ubiquitous barbadian mercenaries should happen to drop by and should happen arbitrarily to decide that a given patron looked too young well that was one tavern closed for a month and one tavernkeeper locked up for the same length of time all of which left the sixteenyearolds in astibar truly out of luck along with it gradually became evident through the course of a morning one small boyishlooking nineteenyearold singer from asoli after three summary ejections along the west side of the street of the temples devin was briefly tempted to go across the road to the shrine of morian fake an ecstasy and hope they favored senzian green here as a means of succoring the overly ecstatic as another even less rational option he contemplated breaking a window in eannas domed shrine and testing if any of the ballless imbeciles inside could catch him in a sprint he forebore to do so as much out of genuine devotion to eanna of the names as to an oppressive awareness of how many very large and heavily armed barbadian mercenaries patrolled the streets of astibar the barbadians were everywhere in the eastern palm of course but nowhere was their presence so disturbingly evident as it was in astibar where alberico had based himself in the end devin wished a serious headcold on himself and headed west towards the harbor and then following his unfortunately stillfunctioning sense of smell towards tannery lane and there made almost ill by the effluence of the tanners craft which quite overwhelmed the salt of the sea he was given an open bottle of green no questions asked in a tavern called the bird by a shambling looselimbed innkeeper whose eyes were probably inadequate to the dark shadows of his windowless oneroom establishment even this nondescript evilsmelling hole was completely full astibar was crammed to overflowing for tomorrows start of the festival of vines the harvest had been a good one everywhere but in certando devin knew and there were plenty of people with astins or chiaros to spend and in a mood to spend them too there were certainly no free tables to be had in the bird devin wedged himself into a corner where the dark pitted wood of the bar met the back wall took a judicious sip of his wine watered but not unusually so he decided and composed his mind and soul towards a meditation upon the perfidy and unreasonableness of women as embodied specifically by catriana dastibar these past two weeks he calculated that he had enough time before the lateafternoon rehearsal the last before their opening engagement at the city home of a small wineestate owner tomorrow to muse his way through most of a bottle and still show up sober he was the experienced trouper anyhow he thought indignantly he was a partner he knew the performance routines like a hand knew a glove the extra rehearsals had been laid on by menico for the benefit of the three new people in the troupe including impossible catriana who happened to be the reason he had stormed out of the morning rehearsal a short while before he knew that menico planned to call the session to a halt how in the name of adaon was he supposed to react when an inexperienced new female who thought she could sing and to whom hed been genuinely friendly since shed joined them a fortnight ago said what shed said in front of everyone that morning cursed with memory devin saw the nine of them rehearsing again in the rented back room on the ground floor of their inn four musicians the two dancers menico catriana and himself singing up front they were doing rauders song of love a piece rather predictably requested by the winemerchants wife a piece devin had been singing for nearly six years a song he could manage in a stupor a coma sound asleep and so perhaps yes hed been a little bored a little distracted had been leaning a little closer than absolutely necessary to their newest redheaded female singer putting perhaps the merest shading of a message into his expression and voice but still even so devin in the name of the triad had snapped catriana dastibar breaking up the rehearsal entirely do you think you can get your mind away from your groin for long enough to do a decent harmony this is not a difficult song the affliction of a fair complexion had hurtled devins face all the way to bright red menico he saw menico who should have been sharply reprimanding the girl for her presumption was laughing helplessly even more flushed than devin was so were the others all of them unable to think of a reply unwilling to compromise the tattered shreds of his dignity by yielding to his initial impulse to reach up and whack the girl across the back of her head devin had simply spun on his heels and left hed thrown one reproachful glance at menico as he went but was not assuaged the troupeleaders ample paunch was quivering with laughter as he wiped tears from his round bearded face so devin had gone looking for a bottle of senzio green and a dark place to drink it in on a brilliant autumn morning in astibar having finally found the wine and the tenuous comfort of shadows he fully expected to figure out about half a bottle from now what he should have said to that arrogant redmaned creature back in the rehearsal room if only she wasnt so depressingly tall he thought morosely he filled his glass again looking up at the blackened crossbeams of the ceiling he briefly contemplated hanging himself from one of them by the heels of course for old times sake shall i buy you a drink someone said with a sigh devin turned to cope with one of the more predictable aspects of being small and looking very young while drinking alone in a sailors bar what he saw was somewhat reassuring his questioner was a soberly dressed man of middle years with greying hair and lines of worry or laughter radiating at his temples even so thank you devin said but ive most of my own bottle left and i prefer having a woman to being one for sailors im also older than i look the other man laughed aloud in that case he chuckled genuinely amused you can give me a drink if you like while i tell you about my two marriageable daughters and the other two who are on their way to that age sooner than im ready for im rovigo dastibar master of the sea maid just in from down the coast in tregea devin grinned and stretched across the bar for another glass the bird was far too crowded to bother trying to catch the owners rheumy eye and devin had his own reasons for not wanting to signal the man ill be happy to share the bottle with you he said to rovigo though your wife is unlikely to be well pleased if you press your daughters upon a traveling musician my wife said rovigo feelingly would turn ponderous cartwheels of delight if i brought home a cowherd from the certandan grasslands for the oldest one devin winced that bad he murmured ah well we can at least drink to your safe return from tregea and in time for festival by a fingernail im devin dasoli bar garin at your service and i at yours friend devin notasyoungasyoulook did you have trouble getting a drink rovigo asked shrewdly i was in and out of more doorways than morian of portals knows and as dry when i left as when id entered devin rashly sniffed the heavy air even among the odors of the crowd and despite the lack of windows the tannery stench from outside was still painfully discernible this would not have been my first or my tenth choice as a place for drinking a flask of wine rovigo smiled a sensible attitude will i seem eccentric if i tell you i always come straight here when the sea maid is home from a voyage somehow the smell speaks of land to me tells me im back you dont like the sea i am quite convinced that any man who says he does is lying has debts on land or a shrewish wife to escape from and he paused pretending to have been suddenly struck by a thought come to think of it he added with exaggerated reflectiveness then he winked devin laughed aloud and poured them both more wine why do you sail then trade is good rovigo said frankly the maid is small enough to slip into ports down the coast or around on the western side of senzio or ferraut that the bigger traders never bother with shes also quick enough to make it worth my while running south past the mountains to quileia it isnt sanctioned of course with the trade embargo down there but if you have contacts in a remote enough place and you dont dawdle about your business it isnt too risky and theres a profit to be made i can take barbadian spices from the market here or silk from the north and get them to places in quileia that would never otherwise see such things i bring back carpets or quileian wood carvings slippers jeweled daggers sometimes casks of buinath to sell to the taverns whatevers going at a good price i cant do volume so i have to watch my margins but theres a living in it as long as insurance stays down and adaon of the waves keeps me afloat i go from here to the gods temple before heading home but here first devin smiled here first they touched glasses and drained them devin refilled both whats news in quileia he asked as a matter of fact i was just there rovigo said tregea was a stop on the way back there are tidings actually marius won his combat in the grove of oaks again this summer i did hear about that devin said shaking his head in rueful admiration a crippled man and he must be fifty years old by now what does that make it six times in a row seven rovigo said soberly he paused as if expecting a reaction im sorry devin said is there a meaning to that marius decided there was hes just announced that there will be no more challenges in the oak grove seven is sacred hes proclaimed by allowing him this latest triumph the mother goddess has made known her will marius has just declared himself king in quileia no longer only the consort of the high priestess what devin exclaimed loudly enough to cause some heads to turn he lowered his voice hes declared a man i thought they had a matriarchy there so said rovigo did the late high priestess traveling across the peninsula of the palm from mountain village to remote castle or manor to the cities that were the centers of affairs musicians could not help but hear news and gossip of great events always in devins brief experience the talk had been only that a way to ease the passing of a cold winters night around an inn fire in certando or to try to impress a traveler in a tavern in corte with a murmured confiding that a probarbadior party was rumored to be forming in that ygrathen province it was only talk devin had long since concluded the two ruling sorcerers from east and west across the seas had sliced the palm neatly in half between them with only hapless decadent senzio not formally occupied by either looking nervously across the water both ways its governor remained paralytically unable to decide which wolf to be devoured by while the two wolves still warily circled each other after almost twenty years each unwilling to expose itself by moving first the balance of power in the peninsula seemed to devin to have been etched in stone from the time of his first awareness until one of the sorcerers died and sorcerers were rumored to live a very long time nothing much would or could come of khav room or great hall chatter quileia though was another matter one far beyond devins limited experience to sort out or define he couldnt even guess what might be the implications of what marius had now done in that strange country south of the mountains what might flow from quileias having a more than transitory king one who did not have to go into the oak grove every two years and there naked ritually maimed and unarmed meet the swordwielding foe who had been chosen to slay him and take his place marius had not been slain though seven times he had not been slain and now the high priestess was dead nor was it possible to miss the meaning in the way rovigo had said that a little overawed devin shook his head he glanced up and saw that his new acquaintance was staring at him with an odd expression youre a thoughtful young man arent you the merchant said devin shrugged suddenly selfconscious not unduly i dont know certainly not with any insight i dont hear news like yours every afternoon what do you think it will mean one answer he was not to receive the tavernkeeper who had quite efficiently succeeded in ignoring rovigos intermittent signaling for another bottle of wine now strode to their end of the bar black anger visible on his features even in the darkened room you he hissed your name devin taken aback devin nodded reflexive agreement the tavernkeepers expression grew even more malevolent get out of here he rasped your triadcursed sisters outside says your fathers ordered you home and morian blast you both that hes minded to turn me in for serving an underage you gutterspawned maggot ill teach you to put me at risk of being shut down on the eve of the festival before devin could move a full pitcher of soured black wine was flung into his face stinging like fire he scrambled back wiping at his streaming eyes swearing furiously when he could see again it was to observe an extraordinary sight rovigo not a big man had moved along the bar and had grabbed the keeper by the collar of his greasy tunic without apparent effort he had the man pulled halfway over the bar top feet kicking ineffectually in midair the collar was twisted to a degree sufficient to cause the helpless tavernowners face to begin turning a mottled shade of crimson goro i do not like my friends being abused rovigo said calmly the lad has no father here and i doubt he has a sister he cocked an eyebrow at devin who shook his dripping head vehemently as i say rovigo continued not even breathing hard he has no sister here he is also patently not underage as should be obvious to any tavernowner not blinded by swilling buckets of his own slop after hours now goro will you placate me a little by apologizing to devin dasoli my new friend and offering him two bottles of corked vintage certando red by way of showing your sincere contrition in return i may be persuaded to let you have a cask of the quileian buinath thats sitting on the sea maid even now at an appropriate price or course given what you can extort for that stuff at festivaltime goros face had accomplished a truly dangerous hue just as devin felt obliged to caution rovigo the tavernowner gave a jerky convulsive nod and the merchant untwisted the collar a little goro dragged fetid tavern air into his lungs as if it were scented with chiaran mountain tainflowers and spluttered a three word apology to devin and the wine rovigo reminded him kindly he lowered the other man still without any evident exertion enough for goro to fumble below the bar and resurface with two bottles of what certainly appeared to be certandan red rovigo let slip another notch of the tightened collar vintage he inquired patiently goro twitched his head up and down well then rovigo declared releasing goro completely it appears we are quits i suppose he said turning to devin that you should go see who is pretending to be your sister outside i know who it is devin said grimly thank you by the way im used to fighting my own battles but its pleasant to have an ally now and again it is always pleasant to have an ally rovigo amended but it seems obvious to me that you arent keen on dealing with this sister so ill leave you to do it in private do let me once more commend my own daughters to your kind remembrance theyve been quite well brought up all things considered i have no doubt of that at all devin said if i can do you a service in return i will im with the company of menico di ferraut and were here through the festival your wife might enjoy hearing us perform if you let me know youve come ill make sure you have good places at either of our public performances free of charge i thank you and if your path or your curiosity leads you southeast of town now or later in the year our land is about five miles along the road on the righthand side theres a small temple of adaon just before and my gate has a crest with a ship on it one of the girls designed it they are all he grinned very talented devin laughed and the two men touched palms formally rovigo turned back to reclaim their corner of the bar devin dismally aware that he was soaked with evilsmelling wine from lightbrown hair to waist with stains splotching his hose as well walked outside clutching his two bottles of certandan red he squinted owlishly in the sunshine for a few seconds before spotting catriana dastibar on the other side of the lane scarlet hair blazing in the light a handkerchief pressed firmly beneath her nose devin strode briskly into the road and almost collided with a tanners cart a brief and satisfying exchange of opinions ensued the tanner rumbled on and devin vowing inwardly not to be put on the defensive this time crossed the lane to where catriana had been expressionlessly observing the altercation well he said caustically i do appreciate your coming all this way to apologize but you might have chosen a different way of finding me if you were sincere i rather prefer my clothes unsaturated with spoiled wine you will offer to wash them for me of course catriana simply ignored all of this looking him up and down coldly you are going to need a wash and a change she said from behind the scented handkerchief i hadnt counted on that much of a reaction inside but not having a surplus of astins to spend on bribes i couldnt think of a better way to get tavernowners to bother looking for you it was an explanation devin noted but not an apology forgive me he said with exaggerated contrition i must talk with menico it seems we arent paying you enough in addition to all our other transgressions you must be used to better things she hesitated for the first time must we discuss this in the middle of tannery lane she said without a word devin sketched a performance bow and gestured for her to lead the way she started walking away from the harbor and he fell in stride beside her they were silent for several minutes until out of the range of the tannery smells with a faint sigh catriana put away her handkerchief where are you taking me devin asked another transgression it seemed the blue eyes flashed with anger in the name of the triad where would i be taking you catrianas voice dripped with sarcasm we are going to my room at the inn for a session of lovemaking like eanna and adaon at the dawn of days oh good devin snapped his own anger rekindling why dont we pool our funds and buy another woman to come play morian just so i dont get bored you understand catriana paled but before she could open her mouth devin grabbed her arm with his free hand and swung her around to face him in the street looking up into those blue eyes and cursing the fact that he had to do that he snapped catriana what exactly have i done to you why do i deserve that sort of answer or what you did this morning ive been pleasant to you from the day we signed you on and if youre a professional you know that isnt always the case in troupes on the road if you must know marra the woman you replaced was my closest friend in the company she died of the plague in certando i could have made life very hard for you i didnt and im not i did let you know from the first that i found you attractive im not aware that there is a sin in that if it is done with courtesy he released her arm abruptly conscious that he had been gripping it very hard and that they were in an extremely public place even with the earlyafternoon lull instinctively he looked around thankfully there were no barbadians passing just then there was a familiar tight feeling in his chest as of the apprehended return of pain that always came with the thought of marra the first true friend of his life two neglected children with voices that were gifts of eanna telling each other fears and dreams for three years in changing beds across the palm at night his first lover first death catriana released remained where she was and there was a look in her own eyes perhaps at the naming of death that made him abruptly revise his estimate of her age downwards hed thought she was older than him now he wasnt sure he waited breathing quickly after his outburst and at length he heard her say very softly you sing too well devin blinked it was not at all what hed expected i have to work very hard at performing she went on her face flushing for the first time rauder is hard for me all of his music and this morning you were doing the song of love without even thinking about it amusing the others trying to charm me devin i have to concentrate when i sing you were making me nervous and i snap at people when im nervous devin drew a careful breath and looked around the empty sunlit street for a moment thinking he said do you know has anyone ever told you that it is possible and even useful to tell things like this to people especially the people who have to work with you she shook her head not for me ive never been able to talk like that not ever why do it now then he risked why did you come after me a longer pause than before a cluster of artisans apprentices swept around the corner hooting with reflexive ribaldry at the sight of the two of them standing together there was no malice in it though and they went by without causing any trouble a few red and golden leaves skipped over the cobbles in the breeze somethings happened catriana dastibar said and menico told us all that you are the key to our chances menico sent you after me it was almost completely improbable after nearly six years together no catriana said quickly shaking her head no he said youd be back in time that you always were i was nervous though with so much at stake i couldnt just wait around youd left a little um upset after all a little devin agreed gravely noting that she finally had the grace to look apologetic he would have felt even more secure if he hadnt continued to find her so attractive he couldnt stop himself from wondering even now what her breasts would look like freed from the stiffness of her highcut bodice marra would have told him he knew and even helped him with a conquest they had done that for each other and shared the tales after traveling through that last year on the road before certando where she died you had better tell me whats happened he said forcing his thoughts back to the present there was danger in fantasies and in memories both the exiled duke sandre died last night catriana said she looked around but the street was empty again for some reason no one is sure why alberico is allowing his body to lie in state at the sandreni palace tonight and tomorrow morning and then she paused the blue eyes bright devin his pulse suddenly leaping finished it for her a funeral full rites dont tell me full rites and devin menicos been asked to audition this afternoon we have a chance to do the most talkedabout performance in the whole of the palm this year she looked very young now and quite unsettlingly beautiful her eyes were shining like a childs so you came to get me he murmured nodding his head slowly before i drank myself into a useless stupor of frustrated desire he had the edge now for the first time it was a pleasant turnabout especially coupled with the real excitement of her news he began walking forcing her to fall in stride with him for a change it isnt like that she protested its just that this is so important menico said your voice would be the key to our hopes that you were at your best in the mourning rites i dont know whether to be flattered by that or insulted that you actually thought id be so unprofessional as to miss a rehearsal on the eve of the festival dont be either catriana dastibar said with a hint of returning asperity we dont have time for either just be good this afternoon be the best youve ever been he ought to resist it devin knew but his spirits were suddenly much too high in that case are you sure were not going to your room he asked blandly more than he could know hung in the balance for the moment that followed then catriana dastibar laughed aloud and freely for the first time now that said devin grinning is much better i honestly wasnt sure if you had a sense of humor she grew quiet sometimes im not sure either she said almost absently then in a rather different voice devin i want this contract more than i can tell you well of course he replied it could make our careers thats right catriana said she touched his shoulder and repeated i want this more than i can say he might have sought a promise in that touch had he been a little less perceptive and had it not been for the way she spoke the words there was in fact nothing at all of ambition in that tone nor of desire in the way that devin had come to know desire what he heard was longing and it reached towards a space inside him that he hadnt known was there ill do what i can he said after a moment thinking for no good reason of marra and the tears hed shed on the farm in asoli they had known he was gifted with music quite early but it was an isolated place and none of them had a frame of reference whereby to properly judge or measure such things one of devins first memories of his father one that he summoned often because it was a soft image of a hard man was of garin humming the tune of some old cradle song to help devin fall asleep one night when he was feverish the boy four perhaps had woken in the morning with his fever broken humming the tune to himself with perfect pitch garins face had taken on the complex expression that devin would later learn to associate with his fathers memories of his wife that morning though garin had kissed his youngest child the only time devin could remember that happening the tune became a thing they shared an access to a limited intimacy they would hum it together in rough untutored attempts at harmony later garin bought a scaleddown three string syrenya for his youngest child on one of his twiceyearly trips to the market in asoli town after that there were actually a few evenings devin did like to remember when he and his father and the twins would sing ballads of the sea and hills by the fire at night before bed escapes from the drear wet flatness of asoli when he grew older he began to sing for some of the other farmers at weddings or naming days and once with a traveling priest of morian he sang counterpoint during the autumn ember days on the hymn to morian of portals the priest wanted to bed him after but by then devin was learning how to avoid such requests without giving offense later yet he began to be called upon in the taverns there were no age laws for drinking in northern asoli where a boy was a man when he could do a day in the fields and a girl was a woman when she first bled and it had been in a tavern called the river in asoli town itself on a market day that devin just turned fourteen had been singing the ride from corso to corte and had been overheard by a portly bearded man who turned out to be a troupeleader named menico di ferraut and who had taken him away from the farm that week and changed his life were next menico said nervously smoothing his best satin doublet over his paunch devin idly picking out his earliest cradle song on one of the spare syrenyae smiled reassuringly up at his employer his partner now actually devin hadnt been an apprentice since he was seventeen menico tired of refusing offers to buy the contract of his young tenor had finally offered devin journeyman status in the guild and a regular salary after first making clear how very much the young man owed him and how loyalty was the only marginally adequate way to repay such a large debt of gratitude devin knew that in fact and he liked menico anyway a year later after another sequence of offers from rival troupeleaders during the summer wedding season in corte menico had made devin a tenpercent partner in the company after making the same speech almost word for word as the last time the honor devin knew was considerable only old eghano who played drums and the certandan deep strings and who had been with menico since the company was formed had another partnership share everyone else was an apprentice or a journeyman on shortterm contract especially now when the aftermath of a plague spring in the south had every troupe in the palm short of bodies and scrambling to fill with temporary musicians dancers or singers a haunting thread of sound barely audible plucked devins attention away from his syrenya he looked over and smiled alessan one of the three new people was lightly tracing the melody of the cradle song devin had been playing on the shepherd pipes of tregea it sounded unearthly and strange alessan blackhaired though greying at the temples winked at him over the busyness of his fingers on the pipes they finished the piece together pipes and syrenya and humming tenor voice i wish i knew the words devin said regretfully as they ended my father taught me that tune as a child but he could never remember how the words went alessans lean mobile face was reflective devin knew little about the tregean after two weeks of rehearsal other than that the man was extraordinarily good on the pipes and quite reliable as menicos partner that was all that should matter to him alessan was seldom around the inn outside of practicetime but he was always there and punctual for the rehearsals slated i might be able to dredge them up for you if i thought about it he said pushing a hand through his hair in a characteristic gesture its been a long time but i knew the words once he smiled dont worry about it devin said ive survived this long without them its just an old song a memento of my father if you stay with us we can make it a winter project to try to track them down menico would approve of that last bit he knew the troupeleader had declared alessan di tregea to be a find and cheap at the wages hed asked the other mans expressive mouth crooked sideways a little wryly old songs and memories of fathers are important he said is yours dead then devin made the warding sign with his hand out and two fingers curled down not last i heard though ive not seen him in almost six years menico spoke to him when he went through the north of asoli last time took him some chiaros for me i dont go back to the farm alessan considered that dour asolini stock he guessed no place for a boy with ambition and a voice like yours his tone was shrewd almost exactly devin admitted ruefully though i wouldnt have called myself ambitious restless more and we werent originally from asoli in fact came there from lower corte when i was a small child alessan nodded even so he said the man had a bit of a knowitall manner devin decided but he could play the tregean pipes the way they might even have sounded on adaons own mountain in the south in any case they had no time to pursue the matter were on menico said hastily reentering the room where they were waiting amid the dust and covered furniture of the longunused sandreni palace we do the lament for adaon first he announced telling them something theyd all known for hours he wiped his palms on the side of his doublet devin that ones yours make me proud lad his standard exhortation then all of us are together on the circling of years catriana my love you are sure you can go high enough or should we pitch down ill go high enough catriana replied tersely devin thought her tone spoke to simple nervousness but when her gaze met his for a second he recognized that earlier look again the one that reached somewhere beyond desire towards a shore he didnt know id very much like to get this contract alessan di tregea said just then mildly enough how extremely surprising devin snapped discovering as he spoke that he too was nervous after all alessan laughed though and so did old eghano walking through the door with them eghano who had seen far too much in too many years of touring to ever be made edgy by a mere audition without saying a word he had as he always had an immediately calming effect on devin ill do the best i can devin said after a moment and for the second time that afternoon not really certain to whom he was saying it or why in the end whether because of the triad or in spite of them as his father used to say his best was enough the principal auditor was a delicately scented extravagantly dressed scion of the sandreni a man in his late thirties devin guessed who made it manifest in his limp posture and the artificially exaggerated shadows that ringed his eyes why alberico the tyrant didnt appear to be much worried about the descendants of sandre dastibar ranged behind this diverting personage were the priests of eanna and morian in white and smoke grey beside them vivid by contrast sat a priestess of adaon in crimson with her hair cropped very short it was autumn of course and the ember days were coming on devin wasnt surprised by her hair he was surprised to see the clergy there for the audition they made him uncomfortable another legacy of his father but this wasnt a situation where he could allow that to affect him and so he dismissed them from his thoughts he focused on the dukes elegant son the only one who really mattered now he waited reaching as menico had taught him for a still point inside himself menico cued nieri and aldine the two thin dancers in their greyblue almost translucent chemises of mourning and their black gloves a moment later after their first linked pass across the floor he looked at devin and devin gave him gave them all the lament for adaons autumnal dying among the mountain cypresses as he never had before alessan di tregea was with him all the way with the high heartpiercing grief of the shepherd pipes and together the two of them seemed to lift and carry nieri and aldine beyond the surface steps of their dance across the recently swept floor and into the laconic precise articulation of ritual that the lament demanded and was so rarely granted when they finished devin traveling slowly back to the sandreni palace from the cedar and cypress slopes of tregea where the god had died and where he died again each and every autumn saw that sandre dastibars son was weeping the tracks of his tears had smudged the carefully achieved shadowing around his eyes which meant devin realized abruptly that he hadnt wept for any of the three companies before them marra young and intolerantly professional would have been scornful of those tears he knew why hire a mongrel and bark yourself she would say when their mourning rituals were interrupted or marked by displays from their patrons devin had been less stern back then and was even less so now since shed died and he had found himself rather desperately fighting back a shameful public grief when burnet di corte had led his company through her mourning rites in certando as a gesture of courtesy to menico devin also knew by the smoldering look the sandreni scion gave him from within the smeared dark rings around his eyes and the scarcely less transparent glance from morians fatfingered priest why in the name of the triad were the triad so illserved that though they might have just won the sandreni contract he was going to have to be careful in this palace tomorrow he made a mental note to bring his knife they had won the contract the second number hardly mattered which is why cunning menico had begun with the lament afterwards menico carefully introduced devin as his partner when sandres son asked to meet him he turned out to be the middle son of three named tomasso the only one he explained huskily holding one of devins hands tightly between both his own with an ear for music and an eye for dance adequate to choosing performers equal to so august an occasion as his fathers funeral rites devin used to this politely retrieved his fingers grateful for menicos experienced tact presented as a partner he had some slight immunity from overly aggressive wooers even among the nobility he was introduced to the clergy next and promptly knelt before adaons priestess in red your sanction sisterofthegod for what i sang and for what i am asked to do tomorrow out of the corner of his eye he saw the priest of morian clench his chubby ringed fingers at his sides he accepted the blessing and protection of adaon the priestesss index finger tracing the gods symbol on his brow in the knowledge that he had successfully defused one priests burgeoning desire when he rose and turned it was to catch a wink dangerous in that room and among that company from alessan di tregea at the back with the others he suppressed a grin but not his surprise the shepherd was disconcertingly perceptive menicos first price was immediately accepted by tomasso dastibar bar sandre confirming in devins mind what a sorry creature he was to bear such a magnificent name and lineage it would have interested him and led him a step or two further down the head road towards maturity to learn that duke sandre himself would have accepted the same price or twice as much and in exactly the same manner devin was not quite twenty though and even menico three times his age would loudly curse himself back at the inn amid the celebratory wine for not having quoted even more than the extortionate sum he had just received in full only eghano aged and placid softly drumming two wooden spoons on their trestle table said leave well enough we need not hold out a greedy palm there will be more of these from now on if you are wise youll leave a tithe at each of the temples tomorrow we will earn it back with interest when they choose musicians for the ember days menico in high good humor swore even more magnificently than before and announced a set intention to offer eghanos wrinkled body as a tithe to the fleshy priest of morian instead eghano smiled toothlessly and continued his soft drumming menico ordered them all to bed not long after the evening meal theyd have an early start tomorrow pointing towards the most important performance of their lives he beamed benevolently as aldine led nieri from the room the girls would share a bed that night devin was sure and for the first time he suspected he wished them joy of each other knowing that they had come together magically as dancers that afternoon and also knowing for it had happened to him once how that could spill over into the candles of a late night in bed he looked around for catriana but she had gone upstairs already shed kissed him briefly on the cheek though right after menicos fierce embrace back in the sandreni palace it was a start it might be a start he bade good night to the others and went up to the single room that was the one luxury hed demanded of menicos tour budget after marra had died he expected to dream of her because of the mourning rites because of unslaked desire because he dreamt of her most nights instead he had a vision of the god he saw adaon on the mountainside in tregea naked and magnificent he saw him torn apart in frenzy and in flowing blood by his priestesses suborned by their womanhood for this one autumn morning of every turning year to the deeper service of their sex shredding the flesh of the dying god in the service of the two goddesses who loved him and who shared him as mother daughter sister bride all through the year and through all the years since eanna named the stars shared him and loved him except on this one morning in the falling season this morning that was shaped to become the harbinger the promise of spring to come of winters end this one single morning on the mountain when the god who was a man had to be slain torn and slain to be put into his place which was the earth to become the soil which would be nurtured in turn by the rain of eannas tears and the moist sorrowings of morians endless underground streams twisting in their need slain to be reborn and so loved anew more and more with each passing year with each and every time of dying on these cypressclad heights slain to be lamented and then to rise as a god rises as a man does as the wheat of summer fields to rise and then lie down with the goddesses with his mother and his bride his sister and his daughter with eanna and morian under sun and stars and the circling moons the blue one and the silver devin dreamt terribly that primal scene of women running on the mountainside their long hair streaming behind them as they pursued the mangod to that high chasm above the torrent of casadel he saw their clothing torn from them as they cried each other on to the hunt saw branches of mountain trees of spiny bristling shrubs claw their garments away saw them render themselves deliberately naked for greater speed to the chase seizing bloodred berries of sonrai to intoxicate themselves against what they would do high above the icy waters of casadel he saw the god turn at last his huge dark eyes wild and knowing both as he stood at the chasm brink a stag at bay at the deemed decreed perennial place of his ending and devin saw the women come upon him there with their flying hair and blood flowing along their bodies and he saw adaon bow his proud glorious head to the doom of their rending hands and their teeth and their nails and there at the end of the chase devin saw that the womens mouths were open wide as they cried to each other in ecstasy or anguish in unrestrained desire or madness or bitter grief but in his dream there was no sound at all to those cries instead piercing through the whole of that wild scene among cedar and cypress on the mountainside the only thing devin heard was the sound of tregean shepherd pipes playing the tune of his own childhood fever high and far away and at the end at the very last devin saw that when the women came upon the god and caught him and closed about him at that high chasm over casadel his face when he turned to his rending was that of alessan chapter even before the coming of cautious alberico from overseas in barbadior to rule in astibar the city that liked to call itself the thumb that rules the palm had been known for a certain degree of asceticism in astibar the mourning rites were never done in the presence of the dead as was the practice in the other eight provinces such a procedure was regarded as excessive too fevered an appeal to emotion they were to perform in the central courtyard of the sandreni palace watched from chairs and benches placed around the courtyard and from the loggias above leading off the interior rooms on the two upper floors in one of those rooms marked by the appropriate hangings greyblue and black lay the body of sandre dastibar coins over his eyes to pay the nameless doorman at the last portal of morian food in his hands and shoes on his feet for no one living could know how long that final journey to the goddess was he would be brought down to the courtyard later so that all those citizens of his city and its distrada who wished to do so and who were willing to brave the recording eyes of the barbadian mercenaries posted outside could file past his bier and drop bluesilver leaves of the olive tree in the single crystal vase that stood on a plinth in the courtyard even now the ordinary citizens weavers artisans shopkeepers farmers sailors servants lesser merchants would enter the palace later they could be heard outside now gathered to hear the music of the old dukes mourning rites the people drifting into the courtyard in the meantime were the most extraordinary collection of petty and high nobility and of accumulated mercantile wealth that devin had ever seen in one place because of the festival of vines all the lords of the astibar distrada had come into town from their country estates and being in town they could hardly not be present to see sandre mourned for all that many or most of them had bitterly hated him while he ruled and the fathers or grandfathers of some had paid for poison or hired blades thirty years ago and more in the hope that these same rites might have taken place long since the two priests and adaons priestess were already in their scats seeming in the manner of clergy everywhere to be privy to a mystery that they collectively shielded from lesser mortals with the gravity of their repose menicos company waited in a small room off the courtyard that tomasso had ordered set aside for their use all the usual amenities were there and some that were far from usual devin couldnt remember seeing blue wine offered to performers before an extravagant gesture that he wasnt tempted though it was too early and he was too much on edge to calm himself he walked over to eghano who was lazily drumming as he always seemed to be on a tabletop eghano glanced up at him and smiled its just a performance he said in his soft sibilant voice we do what we always do we make music we move on devin nodded and forced a smile in return his throat was dry though he went to the sidetables and one of the two hovering servants hastened to pour him water in a gold and crystal goblet worth more than everything devin owned in the world a moment later menico signaled and they went out into the courtyard the dancers began it backed by hidden strings and pipes no voices not yet if aldine and nieri had burned love candles late last night it didnt show or if it did only in the concentration and intensity of their twinned movements that morning sometimes seeming to pull the music forward sometimes following it they looked with their thin whitened faces their bluegrey tunics and the jetblack gloves that hid their palms truly otherworldly which was as menico had trained his dancers to be not inviting or alluring as some other troupes approached this dance of the rites nor a merely graceful prelude to the real performance as certain other companies conceived it menicos dancers were guides cold and compelling towards the place of the dead and of mourning for the dead gradually inexorably the slow grave movements the expressionless almost inhuman faces imposed the silence that was proper on that restive preening audience and in that silence the three singers and four musicians came forward and began the invocation to eanna of the lights who had made the world the sun the two moons and the scattered stars that were the diamonds of her diadem rapt and attentive to what they were doing using all the contrivances of professional skill to shape an apparent artlessness the company of menico di ferraut carried the lords and ladies and the merchant princes of astibar with them on a ruthlessly disciplined cresting of sorrow in mourning sandre duke of astibar they mourned as was proper the dying of all the triads mortal children brought through morians portals to move on adaons earth under eannas lights for so short a time so sweet and bitter and short a season of days devin heard catrianas voice reaching upwards towards the high place where alessans pipes seemed to be calling her cold and precise and austere he felt even more than he heard menico and eghano grounding them all with their deep line he saw the two dancers now statues in a frieze now whirling as captives in the trap of time and at the moment that was proper he let his own voice soar with the two syrenyae into the space that had been left for them to fill in the middle range where mortals lived and died so menico di ferraut had shaped his approach to the seldomperformed full mourning rites long ago bringing forty years of art and a full muchtraveled life to the moment that this morning had become even as he began to sing devins heart swelled with pride and a genuine love for the round unassuming leader who had guided them here and into what they were shaping they stopped as planned after the sixth stage for their own sake and their listeners tomasso had spoken with menico beforehand and the nobles progression past sandres bier would now take place upstairs after the company would finish with the last three rites ending on devins lament and then the body would be brought down and the crowd outside admitted with their leaves for the crystal vase menico led them out from the courtyard amid a silence so deep it was their highest possible accolade they reentered the room that had been reserved for their use caught up in the mood they themselves had created no one spoke devin moved to help the two dancers into the robes they wore between performances and then watched as they paced the perimeter of the room slender and catlike in their grace he accepted a glass of green wine from one of the servants but declined the offered plate of food he exchanged a glance but not a smile not now with alessan drenio and pieve the syrenyaplayers were bent over their instruments adjusting the strings eghano pragmatic as ever was eating while idly drumming the table with his free hand menico walked by restless and distracted he gave devin a wordless squeeze on the arm devin looked for catriana and saw her just then leaving the room through an inner archway she glanced back their glances met for a second then she went on light strangely filtered fell from a high unseen window upon the space where she had been devin really didnt know why he did it even afterwards when so much had come to pass flowing outwards in all directions like ripples in water from this moment he was never able to say exactly why he followed her simple curiosity desire a complex longing born of the look in her eyes before and the strange floating place of stillness and sorrow where they now seemed to be none or some or all of these he felt as if the world wasnt quite as it had been before the dancers had begun he drained his wine and rose and he went through the same archway catriana had passing through he too looked back alessan was watching him there was no judgment in the tregeans glance only an intent expression devin could not understand for the first time that day he was reminded of his dream and because of that perhaps he murmured a prayer to morian as he went on through the archway there was a staircase with a high narrow stainedglass window on the firstfloor landing in the manycolored fall of light he caught a glimpse of a bluesilver gown swirling to the left at the top of the stairs he shook his head struggling to clear it to slip free of this eerie dreamlike mood and as he did an understanding slid into place and he muttered a curse at himself she was from astibar she was going upstairs as was entirely fit and proper to pay her own farewell to the duke no lord or newly wealthy merchant was about to deny her right to do so not after her singing this morning on the other hand for a farmers son from asoli by way of lower corte to enter that upstairs room would be sheerest illbred presumption he hesitated and he would have turned back then had it not been for the memory that was his blessing and his curse and always had been he had seen the hanging banners from the courtyard the room where sandre dastibar lay was to the right not the left at the top of these stairs devin went up he took care now though still not knowing why to be quiet at the landing he bore left as catriana had done there was a doorway he opened it an empty room long unused dusty hangings on the walls scenes of a hunt the colors badly faded there were two exits but the dust came to his aid now he could see the neat print of her sandals going towards the door on the right silently devin followed that trail through the warren of abandoned rooms on the first floor of the palace he saw sculptures and objects of glass exquisite in their delicacy marred by years of overlaid dust much of the furniture was gone much that remained was covered over the light was dim most of the windows were shuttered a great many darkened begrimed portraits of stern lords and ladies gazed inimically down upon him as he passed he bore right and again right tracing the path of catrianas feet careful to keep from getting too close she went straight on after that through the rooms along the outer side of the palace none that offered onto the crowded balustrades overlooking the courtyard it was brighter in these rooms he could hear murmuring voices off to his right and he realized that catriana was walking around to the far side of the room where sandre lay in state at length he opened a door which proved to be the last she was alone inside a very large chamber standing by the side of a huge fireplace there were three bronze horses on the mantelpiece and three portraits on the walls the ceiling was gilded in what devin knew would be gold along the outer wall where a line of windows overlooked the street there were two long tables laden with food and drink this room unlike the others had been recently cleaned but the curtains were still drawn against the morning brightness and the crowd outside in the thin filtered light devin closed the door behind him deliberately letting the latch click shut the sound was a loud report in the stillness catriana wheeled a hand to her mouth but even in the halflight devin could see that what blazed in her eyes was fury and not fear what do you think you are doing she whispered harshly he took a hesitant step forward he reached for a witticism a mild deflecting remark to shatter the heavy spell that seemed to lie upon him upon the whole of the morning he couldnt find one he shook his head i dont know he said honestly i saw you leave and i followed it isnt what you think he finished lamely how would you know what i think she snapped she seemed to calm herself by an act of will i wanted to be alone for a few moments catriana said controlling her voice the performance affected me and i needed to be by myself i can see that you were disturbed too but can i ask you as a courtesy to leave me to my privacy for just a little while it was courteously said he could have gone then on any other morning he would have gone but devin had already passed halfknowingly a portal of morians he gestured at the food on the tables and said gravely a quiet observation of fact and not a challenge or accusation this is not a room for privacy catriana wont you tell me why you are here he braced for her rage to flare again but once more she surprised him silent for a long moment she said at length you have not shared enough with me to be owed an answer to that truly it will be better if you go for both of us he could still hear muffled voices on the other side of the wall to the right of the fireplace and the bronze horses this strange room with its laden sumptuously covered tables and the grim portraits on the dark walls seemed to be a chamber in some waking trance he remembered catriana singing that morning her voice yearning upwards to where the pipes of tregea called he remembered her eyes as she paused in the doorway theyd both passed through truly he felt as if he were not entirely awake not in the world he knew and in that mood devin heard himself say over a sudden constriction in his throat could we not begin then is there not a sharing we could start once more she hesitated her eyes were wide but impossible to read in the uncertain light she shook her head though and remained where she was standing straight and very still on the far side of the room i think not she said quietly not on the road im on devin dasoli but i thank you for asking and i will not deny that a part of me might wish things otherwise i have little time now though and a thing i must do here please will you leave me he had scarcely expected to find or feel so much regret over and above all the nuances the morning had already carried he nodded his head there was nothing else he could think of to do or say and this time he did turn to go but a portal had indeed been crossed in the sandreni palace that morning and in exactly the moment that devin turned they both heard voices again but this time from behind him oh triad catriana hissed snapping the mood like a fishbone i am cursed in all i turn my hands to she spun back to the fireplace her hands frantically feeling around the underside of the mantelpiece for the love of the goddesses be silent she whispered harshly the urgency in her voice made devin freeze and obey he said he knew who built this palace he heard her mutter under her breath that it should be right over she stopped devin heard a latch click a section of the wall to the right of the fire swung slightly open to reveal a tiny cubbyhole beyond his eyes widened dont stand there gawking fool catriana whispered fiercely quickly a new voice had joined the others behind him there were three now devin leaped for the concealed door slipped inside beside catriana and together they pulled it shut a moment later they heard the door on the far side of the room click open oh morian catriana groaned from the heart oh devin why are you here addressed thusly devin found himself quite incapable of framing an adequate response for one thing he still couldnt say why hed followed her for another the closet where they were hiding was only marginally large enough for the two of them and he became increasingly aware of the fact that catrianas perfume was filling the tiny space with a heady unsettling scent if he had been half in a dream a moment ago he abruptly found himself wide awake and in dangerous proximity to a woman he had seriously desired for the past two weeks catriana seemed to arrive belatedly at the same sort of awareness he heard her make a small sound in a register somewhat different from before devin closed his eyes even though it was pitchblack in the hidden closet he could feel her breath tickling his forehead and he was conscious of the fact that by moving his hands only a very little he could encircle her waist he held himself carefully motionless tilting back from her as best he could his own breathing deliberately shallow he felt more than sufficiently a fool for having created this ridiculous situation he wasnt about to compound his rapidly growing catalogue of sins by making a grope for her in the darkness catrianas robe rustled gently as she shifted position her thigh brushed his devin drew a ragged breath which caused him to inhale more of her scent than was entirely good for him given his virtuous resolutions sorry he whispered though she was the one whod moved he felt beads of perspiration on his brow to distract himself he tried to focus on the sounds from outside behind him the shuffling of feet and a steady diffused murmur made it clear that people were still filing past sandres bier to his left in the room theyd just fled three voices could be distinguished one was curiously almost recognizable i had the servants posted with the body across the way it gives us a moment before the others come did you notice the coins on his eyes a much younger voice asked crossing to the outer wall where the laden tables were very amusing of course i noticed the first man replied acerbically where had devin heard that tone and recently who do you think spent an evening scrounging up two astins from twenty years ago who do you think arranged for all of this the third voice was heard laughing softly and a fine table of food it is he said lightly that is not what i meant laughter i know it isnt but its a fine table all the same taeri this is not a time for jests particularly bad ones we only have a moment before the family arrives listen to me carefully only the three of us know what is happening it is only us then the young voice queried no one else not even my father not gianno and you know why i said only us hold questions and listen pup just then devin dasoli felt his pulse accelerate in a quite unmistakable way partly because of what he was hearing but rather more specifically because catriana had just shifted her weight again with a quiet sigh and devin became incredulously aware that her body was now pressed directly against his own and that one of her long arms had somehow slipped around his neck do you know she whispered almost soundlessly mouth close to his ear i rather like the thought of this all of a sudden could you be very quiet the very tip of her tongue for just an instant touched the lobe of his ear devins mouth went bone dry even as his sex leaped to full painful erection within his bluesilver hose outside he could hear that voice he almost knew beginning a terse explanation of something involving pallbearers and a hunting lodge but the voice and its explanations had abruptly been rendered definitively trivial what was not trivial what was in fact of the vastest importance imaginable was the undeniable fact that catrianas lips were busy at his neck and ear and that even as his hands moved as of their own imperative accord to touch her eyelids and throat and then drift downward to the dreamtof swell of her breasts her own fingers were nimble among the drawstrings at his waist setting him free oh triad he heard himself moan as her cool fingers stroked him why didnt you tell me before that you liked it dangerous he twisted his head sharply and their lips met fiercely for the first time he began gathering the folds of her gown up about her hips she settled back on a ledge against the wall behind her to make it easier for him her own breath now rapid and shallow as well there will be six of us devin heard from the room outside by second moonrise i want you to be catrianas hands suddenly tightened in his hair almost painfully and at that moment the last folds of her robe rode free of her hips and devins fingers slipped in among her undergarments and found the portal hed been longing for she made a small unexpected sound and went rigid for just a second before becoming extremely soft in his arms his fingers gently stroked the deepest folds of her flesh she drew an awkward reaching breath then shifted again very slightly and guided devin into her she gasped her teeth sinking hard into his shoulder for a moment lost in astonished pleasure and sharp pain devin was motionless holding her close to him murmuring almost soundlessly not knowing what he was saying enough the others are here the third voice outside rasped crisply even so said the first remember then you two come your own ways from town not together to join us tonight whatever you do be sure you are not followed or we are dead there was a brief silence then the door on the farthest side of the room opened and devin beginning now to thrust slowly silently into catriana finally recognized the voice hed been hearing for the same speaker continued talking but now he assumed the delicate remembered intonations of the day before at last fluted tomasso dastibar bar sandre we feared dreadfully that youd all contrived to lose yourselves in these dusty recesses never to be found again no such luck brother a voice growled in reply though after eighteen years it wouldnt have been surprising i need two glasses of wine very badly sitting still for that kind of music all morning is cursed thirsty work in the closet devin and catriana clung to each other sharing a breathless laughter then a newer urgency came over devin and it seemed to him it was in her as well and there was suddenly nothing in the peninsula that mattered half so much as the gradually accelerating rhythm of the movements they made together devin felt her fingernails splay outwards on his back feeling his climax gathering he cupped his hands beneath her she lifted her legs and wrapped them around him a moment later her teeth sank into his shoulder a second time and in that moment he felt himself explode silently into her for an unmeasured enervated space of time they remained like that their clothing damp where it had been crushed against skin to devin the voices from the two rooms outside seemed to come from infinitely far away from other worlds entirely he really didnt want to move at all at length however catriana carefully lowered her legs to the ground to bear her own weight he traced her cheekbones with a finger in the blackness behind him the lords and merchants of astibar were still shuffling past the body of the duke so many had hated and some few had loved to devins left the younger generation of the sandreni ate and drank toasting an end to exile devin wrapped close with catriana still sheathed within her warmth could not have hoped to find words to say what he was feeling suddenly she seized one of his tracing fingers and bit it hard he winced because it hurt she didnt say anything though after the sandreni left catriana found the latch and they slipped out into the room again quickly they reorganized their clothes pausing only long enough to seize a chickenwing apiece they hastily retraced their path back through the rooms leading to the stairway they met three liveried servants coming the other way and devin feeling exceptionally alert and alive now claimed catrianas fingers and winked at the servants as they passed she withdrew her hand a moment later he glanced over whats wrong she shrugged id as soon it wasnt proclaimed throughout the sandreni palace and beyond she murmured looking straight ahead devin lifted his eyebrows what would you rather they thought about us being upstairs i just gave them the obvious boring explanation they wont even bother to talk about it this sort of thing happens all the time not to me said catriana quietly i didnt mean it that way devin protested taken aback but unfortunately they were going down the stairs by then and so it was with a quite unexpected sense of estrangement that he paused to let her reenter the room before him more than a little confused he took his place behind menico as they prepared to go back out into the courtyard he had only a minor supporting role in the first two hymns and so he found his thoughts wandering back over the scene just played out upstairs back and then back again with the memory that seemed to be his birthright focusing like a beam of sunlight upon one detail then another illuminating and revealing what he had missed the first time around and so it was that by the time it was his own turn to step forward to end and crown the mourning rites seeing the three clergy leaning forward expectantly noting how tomasso struck a pose of rapt attentiveness devin was able to give the lament for adaon an undivided soul for he was confused no longer but quite decided in what he was going to do he began softly in the middle range with the two syrenyae building and shaping the ancient story of the god then when the pipes of alessan came in devin let his voice leap upward in response to them as though in flight from mountain glen to crag to chasm brink he sang the dying of the god with a voice made pure in the caldron of his own heart and he pitched the notes to rise above that courtyard and beyond it out among the streets and squares of highwalled astibar high walls he intended to pass beyond that night beyond and then following a trail he would find into a wood where lay a hunting lodge a lodge where pallbearers were to carry the body of the duke and where a number of men six the clear voice of his memory reminded him were to gather in a meeting that catriana dastibar had just done the very best she could short of murder to prevent him learning about he strove to turn the acrid taste of that knowledge into grief for adaon to let it guide and infuse the pain of the lament better for both of us he remembered her saying and he could recapture in his mind the regret and the unexpected softness in her voice but a certain kind of pride at devins age is perhaps stronger than at any other age of mortal man and he had already decided before even he began to sing here in this crowded courtyard among the great of astibar that he was going to be the judge of what was better not she so devin sang the rending of the god at the hands of the women and he gave that dying on the tregean mountain slope all he had to give it making his voice an arrow arching outwards to seek the heart of everyone who heard he let adaon fall from the high cliff he heard the sound of the pipes recede and fall and he let his grieving voice spiral downward with the god into casadel as the song came to its end and so too that morning did a part of devins life for when a portal of morians has been crossed there is as everyone knows never a turning back chapter escorting his fathers bier out the eastern gate in the hour before sunset tomasso bar sandre settled his horse to an easy walk and allowed his mind to drift for the first time in fortyeight intensely stressful hours the road was quiet normally it would have been clogged at this hour with people returning to the distrada before curfew locked the city gates normally sundown cleared the streets of astibar of all save the patrolling barbadian mercenaries and those reckless enough to defy them in search of women or wine or other diversions of the dark this was not a normal time however tonight and for the next two nights there would be no curfew in astibar with the grapes gathered and the distradas harvest a triumphant one the festival of vines would see singing and dancing and things wilder than those in the streets for all three nights for these three nights in the year astibar tried to pretend it was sensuous decadent senzio no duke in the old days and not even dour alberico now had been foolish enough to rouse the people unnecessarily by denying them this ancient release from the sober round of the year tomasso glanced back at his city the setting sun was red among thin clouds behind the templedomes and the towers bathing astibar in an eerily beautiful glow a breeze had come up and there was a bite to it tomasso thought about putting on his gloves and decided against it he would have had to remove some of his rings and he quite liked the look of his gems in this elusive transitory light autumn was very definitely upon them with the ember days approaching fast it would not be long a matter of days before the first frost touched those last few precious grapes that had been left on chosen vines to become if all fell rightly the icy clear blue wine that was the pride of astibar behind him the eight servants plodded stolidly along the road bearing the bier and the simple coffin bare wood save for the ducal crest above of tomassos father on either side of them the two vigilkeepers rode in grim silence which was not surprising given the nature of their errand and the complex manygenerationed hatreds that twisted between those two men those three men tomasso corrected himself it was three if one chose to count the dead man who had so carefully planned all of this down to the detail of who should ride on which side of his bier who before and who behind not to mention the rather more surprising detail of exactly which two lords of the province of astibar should be asked to be his escorts to the hunting lodge for the nightlong vigil and from there to the sandreni crypt at dawn or to put the matter rather more to the point the real point which two lords could and should be entrusted with what they were to learn during the vigil in the forest that night at that thought tomasso felt a nudge of apprehension within his rib cage he quelled it as he had taught himself to do over the years unbelievable how many years of discussing such matters with his father but now sandre was dead and he was acting alone and the night they had labored towards was almost upon them with this crimson waning of light tomasso two years past his fortieth naming day knew that were he not careful he could easily feel like a child again the twelveyearold child he had been for example when sandre duke of astibar had found him naked in the straw of the stables with the sixteenyearold son of the chief groom his lover had been executed of course though discreetly to keep the matter quiet tomasso had been whipped by his father for three days running the lash meticulously rediscovering the closing wounds each morning his mother had been forbidden to come to him no one had come to him one of his fathers very few mistakes tomasso reflected thinking back thirty years in autumn twilight from those three days he knew he could date his own particular taste for the whip in lovemaking it was one of what he liked to call his felicities though sandre had never punished him that way again nor in any other direct manner when it became clear past the point of nursing any hope of discretion that tomassos preferences were to put it mildly not going to be changed or subdued the duke simply ceased to acknowledge the existence of his middle son for more than ten years they went on that way sandre patiently trying to train gianno to succeed him and spending scarcely less time with young taeri making it clear to everyone that his youngest son was next in line to his eldest for over a decade tomasso simply did not exist within the walls of the sandreni palace though he most certainly did elsewhere in astibar and in a number of the other provinces as well for reasons that were achingly clear to him now tomasso had set out through the course of those years to eclipse the memories of all the dissolute nobility that astibar still told shocked tales about even though some of them had been dead four hundred years he supposed that he had to a certain degree succeeded certainly the raid on the temple of morian that ember night in spring so long ago was likely to linger a while yet as the nadir or the paradigm all came down or up to perspective as hed been fond of saying then of sacrilegious debauchery the raid hadnt had any impact on his relationship with the duke there was no relationship to impact upon ever since that morning in the straw when sandre had returned from his ride a destined hour too soon he and his father simply contrived not to speak to or even acknowledge each other whether at family dinners or formal state functions if tomasso learned something he thought sandre should know which was often enough given the circles in which he moved and the chronic danger of their times he told his mother at one of their weekly breakfasts together and she made sure his father heard tomasso also knew she made equally sure sandre was aware of the source of the tidings not that it mattered really she had died drinking poisoned wine meant for her husband in the final year of the dukes reign still working to the last morning of her life towards a reconciliation between sandre and their middle child greater romantics than were either the father or the son might have allowed themselves to think that as the sandreni family pulled tightly together in the bloody retaliatory aftermath of that poisoning she had achieved her wistful hope by dying both men knew it was not so in fact it was only the coming of alberico from the empire of barbadior with his willsapping sorcery and the brutal efficiency of his conquering mercenaries that brought tomasso and sandre to a certain very latenight talk during the dukes second year of exile it was albericos invasion and one further thing the monumental irredeemable inescapable stupidity of gianno dastibar bar sandre titular heir to the shattered fortunes of their family and to these two things there had slowly been added a third bitter truth for the proud exiled duke it had gradually become more and more obvious past all denial that whatever of his own character and gifts had been manifested in the next generation whatever of his subtlety and perception his ability to cloak his thoughts and discern the minds of others whatever of such skills he had passed on to his sons had gone all of it to the middle child to tomasso who liked boys and would leave no heir himself nor ever a name to be spoken let alone with pride in astibar or anywhere else in the palm in the deepest inward place where he performed the complex act of dealing with his feelings for his father tomasso had always acknowledged even back then and very certainly now on this last evening road sandre would travel that one of the truest measures of the dukes stature as a ruler of men had emerged on that winter night so long ago the night he broke a decades stony silence and spoke to his middle son and made him his confidant his sole confidant in the painfully cautious eighteenyear quest to drive alberico and his sorcery and his mercenaries from astibar and the eastern palm a quest that had become an obsession for both of them even as tomassos public manner became more and more eccentric and decayed his voice and gait a parody a selfparody in fact of the mincing lisping lover of boys it was planned all of it in latenight talks with his father on their estate outside the city walls sandres parallel role had been to settle visibly and loudly into impotent brooding triadcursing exile marked by querulous blustering hunts and too much drinking of his own wine tomasso had never seen his father actually drunk and he never used his own fluting voice when they were alone at night eight years ago they had tried an assassination a chef traceable only to the canziano family had been placed in a country inn in ferraut near the provincial border with astibar for over half a year idle gossip in astibar had touted that inn as a place of growing distinction no one remembered afterwards where the talk had begun tomasso knew very well how useful it was to plant casual rumors of this sort among his friends in the temples the priests of morian in particular were legendary for their appetites all their appetites a full year from the time they had set things in motion alberico of barbadior had halted on his way back from the triad games exactly as sandre had said he would to take his midday meal at a wellreputed inn in ferraut near the astibar border by the time the sun went down at the end of that bright latesummer day every person in that inn servants masters stableboys chefs children and patrons had had their backs legs arms and wrists broken and their hands cut off before being bound living upon hastily erected barbadian skywheels to die the inn was razed to the ground taxes in the province of ferraut were doubled for the next two years and for a year in astibar tregea and certando during the course of the following six months every living member of the canziano family was found seized publicly tortured and burned in the grand square of astibar with their severed hands stuffed in their mouths so that the screaming might not trouble alberico or his advisers in their offices of state above the square in this fashion had sandre and tomasso discovered that sorcerers cannot in fact be poisoned for the next six years they had done nothing but talk at night in the manorhouse among the vineyards and gather what knowledge they could of alberico himself and events to the east in barbadior where the emperor was said to be growing older and more infirm with each passing year tomasso began commissioning and collecting walking sticks with heads carved in the shape of the male organs of sex it was rumored that hed had some of his young friends model for the carvers sandre hunted gianno the heir consolidated a burgeoning reputation as a genial uncomplicated seducer of women and breeder of children legitimate and illegitimate the younger sandreni were allowed to maintain modest homes in the city as part of albericos overall policy to be as discreet a ruler as possible except when danger or civil unrest threatened him at which time children might die on skywheels the sandreni palace in astibar remained very prominently shuttered empty and dusty a useful potent symbol of the fall of those who might resist the tyrant the superstitious claimed to see ghostly lights flickering there at night especially on a bluemoon night or on the spring or autumn ember nights when the dead were known to walk abroad then one evening in the country sandre had told tomasso without warning or preamble that he proposed to die on the eve of the festival of vines two autumns hence he proceeded to name the two lords who were to be his vigilkeepers and why that same night he and tomasso decided that it was time to tell taeri the youngest son what was afoot he was brave not stupid and might be necessary for certain things they also agreed that gianno had somehow sired one likely son albeit illegitimate and that herado twentyone by then and showing encouraging signs of spirit and ambition was their best hope of having the younger generation share in the unrest sandre hoped to create just after the time of his dying it wasnt in fact a question of who in the family could be trusted family was after all family the issue was who would be useful and it was a mark of how diminished the sandreni had become that only two names came readily to mind it had been an entirely dispassionate conversation tomasso remembered leading his fathers bier southeast between the darkening trees that flanked the path their conversations had always been like that this one had been no different afterwards though he had been unable to fall asleep the date of the festival two years away branded into his brain the date when his father so precise in his planning so judicious had decided he would die so as to give tomasso a chance to try again a different way the date that had come now and gone carrying with it the soul of sandre dastibar to wherever the souls of such men went tomasso made a warding gesture to avert evil at that thought behind him he heard the steward order the servants to light torches it grew colder as the darkness fell overhead a thin band of high clouds was tinted a somber shade of purple by the last upwardangled rays of light the sun itself was gone down behind the trees tomasso thought of souls his fathers and his own he shivered the white moon vidomni rose and then not long after came blue ilarion to chase her hopelessly across the sky both moons were nearly full the procession could have done without torches in fact so bright was the twinned moonlight but torchlight suited the task and his mood and so tomasso let them burn as the company cut off the road onto the familiar winding path through the sandreni woods to come at length to the simple hunting lodge his father had loved the servants laid the bier on the trestles waiting in the center of the large front room candles were lit and the two fires built up at opposite ends of the room food they had set up earlier that day it was quickly uncovered on the long sideboard along with the wine the windows were opened to air the cabin and admit the breeze at a nod from tomasso the steward led the servants away they would go on to the manor further east and return at daybreak at vigils end and so they were left alone finally tomasso and the lords nievole and scalvaia so carefully chosen two years before wine my lords tomasso asked we will have three others joining us very shortly he said it deliberately in his natural voice dropping the artificial fluting tone that was his trademark in astibar he was pleased to see both of them note the fact immediately their glances sharpening as they turned to him who else growled bearded nievole who had hated sandre all his life he made no comment on tomassos voice nor hid scalvaia such questions gave too much away and these were men long skilled in giving away very little indeed my brother taeri and nephew herado one of giannos byblows and much the cleverest he spoke casually uncorking two bottles of sandreni red reserve as he spoke he poured and handed them each a glass waiting to see who would break the small silence his father had said would follow scalvaia would ask sandre had said who is the third lord scalvaia asked softly inwardly tomasso saluted his dead father then twirling his own glass gently by the stem to release the wines bouquet he said i dont know my father did not name him he named the two of you to come here and the three of us and said there would be a sixth at our council tonight that word too had been carefully chosen council elegant scalvaia echoed it appears that i have been misinformed i was naively of the impression that this was a vigil nievoles dark eyes glowered above his beard both men stared at tomasso a little more than that said taeri as he entered the room herado behind him tomasso was pleased to see them both dressed with appropriate sobriety and to note that for all the suavely flippant timing of taeris entrance his expression was profoundly serious you will know my brother tomasso murmured moving to pour two more glasses for the new arrivals you may not have met herado giannos son the boy bowed and kept silent as was proper tomasso carried the drinks over to his brother and nephew the stillness lasted a moment longer then scalvaia sank down into a chair stretching his bad leg out in front of him he lifted his cane and pointed it at tomasso the tip did not waver i asked you a question he said coldly in the famous beautiful voice why do you call this a council tomasso bar sandre why have we been brought here under false pretenses tomasso stopped playing with his wine they had come to the moment at last he looked from scalvaia over to burly nievole the two of you he said soberly were considered by my father to be the last lords of any real power left in astibar two winters past he decided and informed me that he intended to die on the eve of this festival at a time when alberico would not be able to refuse him full rites of burial which rites include a vigil such as this at a time when you would both be in astibar which would allow me to name you his vigilkeepers he paused in the measured deliberate recitation and let his glance linger on each of them my father did this so that we might come together without suspicion or interruption or risk of being detected to set in motion certain plans for the overthrow of alberico who rules in astibar he was watching closely but sandre had chosen well neither of the two men to whom he spoke betrayed surprise or dismay by so much as a flicker of a muscle slowly scalvaia lowered his cane and laid it down on the table by his chair the stick was of onyx and machial tomasso found himself noticing strange how the mind worked at moments such as this do you know said bluff nievole from by the larger fire do you know that this thought had actually crossed my mind when i tried to hazard why your triadcursed father ah forgive me old habits die hard his smile was wolfish rather than apologetic and it did not reach his narrowed eyes why duke sandre would name me to hold vigil for him he must have known how many times i tried to hasten these mourning rites along in the days when he ruled tomasso smiled in return just as thinly he was certain you would wonder he said politely to the man he was almost sure had paid for the cup of wine that had killed his mother he was also quite certain you would agree to come being one of the last of a dying breed in astibar indeed in the whole of the palm bearded nievole raised his glass you flatter well bar sandre and i must say i do prefer your voice as it is now without all the dips and flutters and wristy things that normally go with it scalvaia looked amused taeri laughed aloud herado was carefully watchful tomasso liked him very much though not as hed had to assure his father in one diverting conversation in his own particular fashion i prefer this voice as well he said to the two lords you will both have been deducing in the last few minutes being who and what you are why i have conducted certain aspects of my life in certain wellknown ways there are advantages to being seen as aimlessly degenerate there are scalvaia agreed blandly if you have a purpose that is served by such a misconception you named a name a moment ago and intimated we might all be rendered happier in our hearts were the bearer of that name dead or gone we will leave aside for the moment what possibilities might follow such a dramatic eventuality his gaze was quite unreadable tomasso had been warned it would be he said nothing taeri shifted uneasily but blessedly kept quiet as instructed he walked over and took one of the other chairs on the far side of the bier scalvaia went on we cannot be unaware that by saying what you have said you have put yourselves completely in our hands or so it might initially appear at the same time i do surmise that were we in fact to rise and begin to ride back towards astibar carrying word of treachery we would join your father among the dead before we left these woods it was casually stated a minor fact to be confirmed before moving on to more important issues tomasso shook his head hardly he lied you do us honor by your presence and are entirely free to leave indeed we will escort you if you wish for the path is deceptive in darkness my father did suggest that i might wish to point out that although you could readily have us wristed and deathwheeled after torture it is exceedingly likely approaching a certainty that alberico would then see compelling cause to do the same to both of you for having been considered likely accomplices of ours you will remember what happened to the canziano after that unfortunate incident in ferraut some years ago there was a smoothly graceful silence acknowledging all of this it was broken by nievole that was sandres doing wasnt it he growled from by his fire not the canziano at all it was our doing tomasso agreed calmly we learned a great deal i must say so scalvaia murmured drily did the canziano your father always hated fabro bar canzian they could not have been said to be on the best of terms tomasso said blandly though i must say that if you focus on that aspect of things i fear you might miss the point the point you prefer us to take nievole amended pointedly unexpectedly scalvaia came to tomassos aid not fair my lord he said to nievole if we can accept anything as true in this room and these times it is that sandres hatred and his desire had moved beyond old wars and rivalries his target was alberico his icy blue eyes held neivoles for a long moment and finally the bigger man nodded scalvaia shifted in his chair wincing at a pain in his afflicted leg very well he said to tomasso you have now told us why we are here and have made clear your fathers purpose and your own for my own part i will make a confession i will confess in the spirit of truth that a death vigil should inspire that being ruled by a coarse vicious overbearing minor lord from barbadior brings little joy to my aged heart i am with you if you have a plan i would like to hear it on my oath and honor i will keep faith with the sandreni in this tomasso shivered at the invocation of the ancient words your oath and honor are sureties beyond measure he said and meant it they are indeed bar sandre said nievole taking a heavy step forward from the fire and i will dare to say that the word of the nievolene has never been valued at lesser coin the dearest wish of my heart is for the barbadian to lie dead and cut to pieces triad willing by my own blade i too am with you by my oath and honor such terribly splendid words said an amused voice from the window opposite the door five faces four white with shock and the bearded one flushing red whipped around the speaker stood outside the open window elbows resting on the ledge chin in his hands he eyed them with a mild scrutiny his face shadowed by the wood of the window frame i have never yet he said known gallant phrases from however august a lineage to succeed in ousting a tyrant in the palm or anywhere else with an economical motion he hoisted himself upwards swung his feet into the room and sat comfortably perched on the ledge on the other hand he added agreeing on a cause does make a starting point i will concede that much you are the sixth of whom my father spoke tomasso asked warily the man did look familiar now that he was in the light he was dressed for the forest not the city in two shades of grey with a black sheepskin vest over his shirt and breeches tucked into worn black riding boots there was a knife at his belt without ornament i heard you mention that the fellow said i actually hope im not because if i am the implications are unsettling to say the least the fact is i never spoke to your father in my life if he knew of my activities and somehow expected me to find out about this meeting and be here well i would be somewhat flattered by his confidence but rather more disturbed that he would have known so much about me on the other hand he said for a second time it is sandre dastibar were talking about and i do seem to make six here dont i he bowed without any visible irony towards the bier on its trestles you are then also in league against alberico nievoles eyes were watchful i am not said the man in the window quite bluntly alberico means nothing to me except as a tool a wedge to open a door of my own and what is it lies behind that door scalvaia asked from deep in his armchair but in that moment tomasso remembered i know you he said abruptly i saw you this morning you are the tregean shepherd who played the pipes in the mourning rites taeri snapped his fingers as the recognition came home to him as well i played the pipes yes the man on the windowledge said quite unruffled but i am not a shepherd nor from tregea it has suited my purposes to play a role many different roles in fact for a great many years tomasso bar sandre ought to appreciate that he grinned tomasso did not return the smile perhaps then under the circumstances you might favor us by saying who you really are he said it as politely as the situation seemed to warrant my father might have known but we do not nor im afraid shall you learn just yet the other said he paused though i will say that were i to swear a vow of my own on the honor of my family it would carry a weight that would eclipse both such oaths sworn here tonight it was matteroffactly said which made the arrogance greater not less to forestall nievoles predictable burst of anger tomasso said quickly you will not deny us some information surely even if you choose to shield your name you said alberico is a tool for you a tool for what alessan notoftregea he was pleased to find that he remembered the name menico di ferraut had mentioned yesterday what is your own purpose what brings you to this lodge the others face lean and curiously hollowed with cheekbones in sharp relief grew still almost masklike and into the waiting silence that ensued he said i want brandin i want brandin of ygrath dead more than i want my souls immortality beyond the last portal of morian there was a silence again broken only by the crackle of the autumn fires on the two hearths it seemed to tomasso as if the chill of winter had come into the room with that speech then such terribly splendid words murmured scalvaia lazily shattering the mood he drew a shout of laughter from nievole and taeri both scalvaia himself did not smile the man on the windowledge acknowledged the thrust with the briefest nod of his head he said this is not my lord a subject about which i permit frivolity if we are to work together it will be necessary for you to remember that you i am forced to say are an overly proud young man replied scalvaia sharply it might be appropriate for you to remember to whom you speak the other visibly bit back his first retort pride is a family failing he said finally i have not escaped it im afraid but i am indeed mindful of who you are and the sandreni and my lord nievole it is why i am here i have made it my business to be aware of dissidence throughout the palm for many years at times i have encouraged it discreetly this evening marks the first instance in which i have come myself to a gathering such as this but you have already told us that alberico is nothing to you tomasso inwardly cursed his father for not having better prepared him for this very peculiar sixth figure nothing in himself the other corrected will you allow me without waiting for a reply he lifted himself down from the ledge and walked over to the wine please said tomasso belatedly the man poured himself a generous glass of the vintage red he drained it and poured another only then did he turn back to address the five of them herados eyes watching him were enormous two facts the man called alessan said crisply learn them if you are serious about freedom in the palm one if you oust or slay alberico you will have brandin upon you within three months two if brandin is ousted or slain alberico will rule this peninsula within that same period of time he stopped his eyes grey tomasso noticed now moved from one to the other of them challenging no one spoke scalvaia toyed with the handle of his cane these two things must be understood the stranger went on in the same tone neither i in my own pursuit nor you in yours can afford to lose sight of them they are the core truths of the palm in our time the two sorcerers from overseas are their own balance of power and the only balance of power in the peninsula right now however different things might have been eighteen years ago today only the power of one keeps the magic of the other from being wielded as it was when they conquered us if we take them then we must take them both or make them bring down each other how taeri asked too eagerly the lean face under the prematurely silvering dark hair turned to him and smiled briefly patience taeri bar sandre i have a number of things yet to tell you about carelessness before deciding if our paths are to join and i say this with infinite respect for the dead man who seems remarkably enough to have drawn us here im afraid you are going to have to agree to submit yourselves to my guidance or we can do nothing together at all the scalvaiane have submitted themselves willingly to nothing and no one in living memory or recorded history that vulpine lord said the texture of velvet in his voice i am not readily of a mind to become the first to do so would you prefer the other said to have your plans and your life and the long glory of your line snuffed out like candles on the ember days because of sheer sloppiness in your preparations you had better explain yourself tomasso said icily i intend to who was it who chose a doublemoon night at double moonrise to meet alessan retorted his voice suddenly cutting like a blade why are no rear guards posted along the forest path to warn you if someone approaches as i just did why were no servants left here this afternoon to guard this cabin have you even the faintest awareness of how dead the five of you would be severed hands stuffed into your throats were i not who i am my father sandre said that alberico would not have us followed tomasso stammered furiously he was absolutely certain of that and he is likely to have been absolutely right but you cannot let your focus be so narrow your father i am sorry to have to say it was alone with his obsession for too long he was too intent upon alberico it shows in everything you have done these past two days what of the idly curious or the greedy the petty informer who might decide to follow you just to see what happened here just to have a story to tell in the tavern tomorrow did you or your father give even half a thought to such things or to those who might have learned where you planned to come and arranged to be here before you there was a hostile silence a log on the smaller fire settled with a crack and a shower of sparks herado jumped involuntarily at the sound will it interest you to know the man called alessan went on more gently that my people have been guarding the approaches to this cabin since you arrived or that ive had someone in here since midafternoon keeping an eye on the servants setting up and who might follow them what taeri exclaimed in here in our hunting lodge for your protection and my own the other man said finishing his second glass of wine he glanced upwards to the shadows of the halfloft above where the extra pallets were stored i think that should do it my friend he called pitching his voice to carry youve earned a glass of wine after so long drythroated among the dust you may as well come down now devin it had actually been very easy menico purse jingling with more money than he had ever earned from a single performance in his life had graciously passed their concert at the winemerchants house over to burnet di corte burnet who needed the work was pleased the winemerchant angry at first was quickly mollified upon learning what menicos hitherto unfinalized tariff would now have been in the aftermath of the sensation theyd caused that morning so in the event devin and the rest of the company had been given the rest of the day and evening off menico counted out for everyone an immediate bonus of five astins and benevolently waved them away to the various delights of the festival he didnt even offer his usual warning lecture already just past noon there were winestands on every corner more than one at the busier squares each vineyard in astibar province and even some from farther afield in ferraut or senzio had its vintages from previous years available as harbingers of what this years grapes would offer merchants looking to buy in quantity were sampling judiciously early revelers rather less so fruit vendors were also in abundance with figs and melons and the enormous grapes of the season displayed beside vast wheels of white cheeses from tregea or bricks of red ones from northern certando over by the market the din was deafening as the people of the city and its distrada canvassed the offerings of this years itinerant tradesmen overhead the banners of the noble houses and of the larger wine estates flapped brightly in the autumn breeze as devin strode purposefully towards what hed just been told was the most fashionable khav room in astibar there were benefits to fame he was recognized at the doorway his arrival excitedly announced and in a matter of moments he found himself at the dark wooden bar of the paelion nursing a mug of hot khav laced with flambardion no awkward questions asked about anyones age thank you very much it was the work of half an hour to find out what he needed to know about sandre dastibar his questions seemed entirely natural coming from the tenor who had just sung the dukes funeral lament devin learned about sandres long rule his feuds his bitter exile and his sad decline in the last few years into a blustering drunken hunter of small game a wraith compared to what he once had been in that last context rather more specifically devin asked about where the duke had liked to hunt they told him they told him where his favorite hunting lodge had been he changed the subject to wine it was easy he was a hero of the hour and the paelion liked heroes for an hour they let him go eventually he pleaded an artists strained sensitivity after the mornings endeavors with the benefit of hindsight he now attached a deal more importance than he had at the time to glimpsing alessan di tregea at a booth full of painters and poets they were laughing about some wager concerning certain verses of condolence that had not yet arrived from chiara he and alessan had saluted each other in an elaborately showy performers fashion that delighted the packed room back at the inn devin had fended off the most ardent of the group who had walked him home and went upstairs alone he had waited in his room chafing for an hour to be sure the last of them had gone having changed into a darkbrown tunic and breeches he put on a cap to hide his hair and a woolen overshirt against the coming chill of evening then he made his way unnoticed through the now teeming crowds in the streets over to the eastern gate of the city and out among several empty wagons goods all sold being ridden back to the distrada by sober prudent farmers who preferred to reload and return in the morning instead of celebrating all night in town spending what theyd just earned devin hitched a ride on a cart part of the way commiserating with the driver on the taxes and the poor rates being paid that year for lambs wool eventually he jumped off feigning youthful exuberance and ran a mile or so along the road to the east at one point he saw with a grin of recognition a temple of adaon on the right just past it as promised was the delicately rendered image of a ship on the roadside gate of a modest country house rovigos home what devin could see of it set well back from the road among cypress and olive trees looked comfortable and cared for a day ago a different person he would have stopped but something had happened to him that morning within the dusty spaces of the sandreni palace he kept going a half mile further on he found what he was looking for he made sure he was alone and then quickly cut to his right south into the woods away from the main road that led to the east coast and ardin town on the sea it was quiet in the forest and cooler where the branches and the manycolored leaves dappled the sunlight there was a path winding through the trees and devin began to follow it towards the hunting lodge of the sandreni from here on he redoubled his caution on the road he was simply a walker in the autumn countryside here he was a trespasser with no excuse at all for being where he was unless pride and the strange dreamlike events of the morning just past could be called adequate excuses devin rather doubted it at the same time it remained to be seen whether he or a certain manipulative redheaded personage was going to dictate the shape and flow of this day and those to come if she were under the impression that he was so easy to dupe a helpless youthful slave to his passions blinded and deafened to anything else by the sogracious offer of her body well it was for this afternoon and this evening to show how wrong an arrogant girl could be what else the evening might reveal devin didnt know he hadnt allowed himself to slow down long enough to consider the question there was no one there when he came to the lodge though he lay silently among the trees for a long time to be certain the front door was chained but marra had been very good with such devices and had taught him a thing or two he picked the lock with the buckle of his belt went inside opened a window and climbed out to relock the chain then he slipped back in through the window closed it and took a look around there was little option really the two bedchambers at the back would be dangerous and not very useful if he wanted to hear devin balanced himself on the broad arm of a heavy wooden chair and jumping managed to make it up to the halfloft on his second attempt nursing a shin bruised in the process he took a pillow from one of the pallets stored up there and proceeded to wedge himself into the remotest darkest corner he could find behind two beds and the stuffed head of an antlered corbin stag by lying on his left side eye to a chink in the floorboards he had an almost complete view of the room below he tried to guide himself towards a mood of calm and patience unfortunately he soon became irrationally conscious of the fact that the glassy eye of the corbin was glitteringly fixed upon him under the circumstances it made him nervous eventually he got up turned the chestnut head to one side and settled in to his hidingplace again and right about then as the grimly purposeful activities of the day gave way to a time when he could do nothing but wait devin began to be afraid he was under no real illusions he was a dead man if they found him here the secrecy and tension in tomasso bar sandres words and manner that morning made that clear enough even without what catriana had done in her own effort to overhear those words and then to prevent him from doing so for the first time devin began to contemplate where the rash momentum of his wounded pride had carried him when the servants came half an hour later to prepare the room they gave him some very bad moments bad enough in fact to make him briefly wish that he was back home in asoli guiding a plow behind a pair of stolid water buffaloes they were fine creatures water buffaloes patient uncomplaining they plowed fields for you and their milk made cheese there was even something to be said for the predictable grey skies of asoli in autumn and the equally predictable people none of their girls for example were as irritatingly superior as catriana dastibar who had got him into this nor would any asolini servant devin was quite certain ever have volunteered as one triadblighted fool below was doing even now to bring down a pallet from the halfloft in case one of the vigilkeeping lords should grow weary goch dont be more of a fool than you absolutely must be the steward snapped officiously in reply they are here to keep a waking watch all night a pallet in the room is an insult to them both be grateful you arent dependent on your brain to feed your belly goch devin fervently seconded the sentiments of the insult and wished the steward a long and lucrative existence for the tenth time since the sandreni servants had entered the lower room he cursed catriana and for the twentieth time himself the ratio seemed about right finally the servants left heading back for astibar to bear the dukes body here the stewards instructions were painstakingly explicit with idiots like goch around devin thought spitefully they had to be from where he lay devin could see the daylight gradually waning towards dusk he found himself softly humming his old cradle song he made himself stop his mind turned back to the morning to the long walk through empty dusty rooms of the palace to the hidden closet at the end the sudden silken feel of catriana when her gown had drifted above her hips he made himself stop that too it grew steadily darker the first owl called not far away devin had grown up in the country it was a familiar sound he heard some forest animal rooting in the underbrush at the edge of the clearing once in a while a gusting of the wind would set the leaves to rustling then abruptly there came a shining of white light through one of the drawn window curtains and devin knew that vidomni was high enough to look down upon this clearing amid the tall trees of the wood which meant that blue ilarion would be rising even now which meant it would not be very much longer it wasnt there was a wavering of torchlight and the sound of voices the lock clinked rattled and the door swung open the steward led in eight men carrying a bier eye glued to his crack in the floor breathing shallowly devin saw them lay it down tomasso came in with the two lords whose names and lineage devin had learned in the paelion the servants uncovered and laid out the food and then they left goch stumbling on the threshold and banging his shoulder pleasingly on the doorpost the steward last to go shrugged a discreet apology bowed and closed the door behind him wine my lords said tomasso dastibar in the voice devin had heard from the secret closet we will have three others joining us very shortly and from then on they had said what they said and devin heard what he heard and so gradually became aware of the magnitude of what he had stumbled upon the peril he was in then alessan appeared at the window opposite the door devin couldnt in fact see that window but he knew the voice immediately and it was with disbelief bordering on stupefaction that he heard menicos recruit of a fortnight ago deny being from tregea at all and then name brandin king of ygrath as the everlasting target of his souls hate rash devin certainly was and he would not have denied that he carried more than his own due share of impulsive foolishness but he had not ever been less than quick or clever in asoli small boys had to be so by the time alessan named him and invited him to come down devins racing mind had put two more pieces of the puzzle together and he adroitly took the path offered him all quiet since midafternoon he called out extricating himself from his corner and stepping past the corbins antlers to the edge of the halfloft only the servants were here but they didnt do much of a job when they chained the door the lock was easy to pick two thieves and the emperor of barbadior could have been up here without seeing each other or anyone down there being the wiser he said it as coolly as he could then he lowered himself with a deliberately showy flip to the ground he registered the looks on the faces of five of the men there all of whom most certainly recognized him but his concentration and his satisfaction lay in the brief smile of approval he received from alessan for the moment his apprehension was gone replaced by something entirely different alessan had claimed him given him legitimacy here he was clearly linked to the man who was controlling events in the room and the events were on a scale that spanned the palm devin had to fight hard to control his growing excitement tomasso went over to the sideboard and smoothly poured a glass of wine for him devin was impressed with the composure of the man he was also aware from the exaggerated courtesy and the undeniable sparkle in bar sandres accentuated eyes that although the fluting voice might be faked tomasso in certain matters and propensities was still very much what he was said to be devin accepted the glass careful not to let their fingers touch i wonder now drawled lord scalvaia in his magnificent voice are we to be treated to a recital here while we pass our vigil there does seem to be a quantity of musicians here tonight devin said nothing but following alessans example did not smile shall i name you a provincial grower of grapes my lord there was real anger in alessans voice and call nievole a grainfarmer from the southwestern distrada what we do outside these walls has little to do with why we are here save in two ways only he held up a long finger one as musicians we have an excuse to cross back and forth across the palm which offers advantages i need not belabor a second finger shot up beside the first two music trains the mind like mathematics or logic to precision of detail the sort of precision my lords that would have precluded the carelessness that has marked tonight if sandre dastibar were alive i would discuss it with him and i might defer to his experience and his long striving he paused looking from one to another of them then said much more softly i might but i might not it is a vanished tune that one never to be sung as matters stand i can only say again that if we are to work together i must ask you to accept my lead he spoke this last directly to scalvaia who still lounged elegant and expressionless in his deep chair it was nievole who answered though blunt and direct i am not in the habit of delaying my judgment of men i think you mean what you say and that you are more versed in these things than we are i accept i will follow your lead with a single condition which is that you tell us your name devin watching with rapacious intensity anxious not to miss a word or a nuance saw alessans eyes close for an instant as if to hold back something that might otherwise have shown through them the others waited through the short silence then alessan shook his head it is a fair condition my lord under the circumstances it is entirely fair i can only pray you will not hold me to it though it is a grief i cannot tell you how much of a grief it is but i am unable to accede for the first time he appeared to be reaching for words choosing them carefully names are power as you know as the two tyrantsorcerers from overseas most certainly know and as i have been made to know in the bitterest ways there are my lord you will learn my name in the moment of our triumph if it comes and not before i will say that this is imposed upon me it is not a choice freely made you may call me alessan which is common enough here in the palm and happens to be truly the name my mother gave me will you be gracious enough to let that suffice you my lord or must we now part ways the last question was asked in a tone bereft of the arrogance that had infused the mans bearing and speech from the moment of his arrival just as devins earlier fear had given way to excitement so now did excitement surrender to something else something he could not yet identify he stared at alessan the man seemed younger than before somehow unable to prevent this almost naked showing of his need nievole cleared his throat loudly as if to dispel an aura a resonance of something that seemed to have entered the room like the mingled light of the two moons outside another owl hooted from the clearing nievole opened his mouth to reply to alessan they never knew what he would have said or scalvaia afterwards on nights when sleep eluded him and he watched one or both moons sweep the sky or counted the stars in eannas diadem in a moonless dark devin would let his clear memory of that moment carry him back trying for reasons he would have found difficult to explain to imagine what the two lords would have done or said had all their briefly tangled fate lines run differently from that lodge he could guess analyze play out scenarios in his mind but he would never know it was a nighttime truth that became a queer private sorrow for him amid all that came after a symbol a displacement of regret a reminder of what it was to be mortal and so doomed to tread one road only and that one only once until morian called the soul away and eannas lights were lost we can never truly know the path we have not walked the paths that each of the men in that lodge were to walk through their own private portals to endings near or far were laid down by the owl that cried a second time very clearly just as nievole began to speak alessan flung up his hand trouble he said sharply then baerd the door banged open devin saw a large man his very long paleyellow hair held back by a leather band across his brow there was another leather thong about his throat he wore a vest and leggings cut in the fashion of the southern highlands his eyes even by firelight gleamed a dazzling blue he carried a drawn sword which was punishable by death this close to astibar lets go the man said urgently you and the boy the others belong here the youngest son and the grandson have easy explanations get rid of the extra glasses what is it tomasso dastibar asked quickly his eyes wide twenty horsemen on the forest path continue your vigil and be as calm as you can we wont be far away well return after alessan come on the tone of his voice pulled devin halfway to the door alessan was lingering though his eyes for some reason locked on those of tomasso and that look what was exchanged in it became another one of the things that devin never forgot or fully understood for a long moment a very long moment it seemed to devin with twenty horsemen riding through the forest and a drawn sword in the room no one spoke then it seems we will have to continue this extremely interesting discussion at a later hour tomasso bar sandre murmured with genuinely impressive composure will you take a last glass before you go in my fathers name alessan smiled then a full open smile he shook his head though i hope to have a chance to do so later he said i will drink to your father gladly but i have a habit i dont think even you can satisfy in the time we have tomassos mouth quirked wryly ive satisfied a number of habits in my day do tell me yours the reply was quiet devin had to strain to hear my third glass of a night is blue alessan said the third glass i drink is always of blue wine in memory of something lost lest on any single night i forget what it is i am alive to do not forever lost i hope said tomasso equally softly not forever i have sworn upon my soul and my fathers soul wherever it has gone then there will be blue wine when next we drink after tonight said tomasso if it is at all in my power to provide it and i will drink it with you to our fathers souls alessan snapped the yellowhaired man named baerd in adaons name i said twenty horsemen will you come i will said alessan he hurled his wineglass and devins through the nearest window into the darkness triad guard you all he said to the five in the room then he and devin followed baerd into the moonlit shadows of the clearing with devin in the middle they ran swiftly around to the side of the cabin farthest from the path that led to the main road they didnt go far his pulse pounding furiously devin dropped to the ground when the other two men did so peering cautiously out from under a cluster of darkgreen serrano bushes they could see the lodge firelight showed through the open windows a moment later devins heart lurched like a ship caught by a wave across its bows as a twig cracked just behind him twentytwo riders a voice said the speaker dropped neatly to the ground on baerds other side the one in the middle of them is hooded devin looked over and by the mingled light of the two moons saw catriana dastibar hooded alessan repeated on a sharply taken breath you are certain of course i am said catriana why what does it mean eanna be gracious to us all alessan murmured not answering i wouldnt be counting on it now the man named baerd said grimly i think we should leave this place they will search for a moment alessan looked as if he would demur but just then they heard a jingling of many riders from the path on the other side of the lodge without another word spoken the four of them rose and silently moved away this evening murmured scalvaia grows more eventful by the moment tomasso was grateful for the elegant lords equanimity it helped steady his own nerves he looked over at his brother taeri seemed all right herado was whitefaced however tomasso winked at the boy have another drink nephew you look infinitely prettier with color in your cheeks there is nothing to fear we are here doing exactly what we have permission to be doing they heard the horses herado went over to the sideboard filled a glass and drained it at a gulp just as he put the goblet down the door crashed loudly open banging into the wall beside it and four enormous fullyarmed barbadian soldiers strode in making the lodge seem suddenly small gentlemen tomasso fluted expertly wringing his hands what is it what brings you here to interrupt a vigil he was careful to sound petulant not angry the mercenaries didnt even deign to look at him let alone reply two of them quickly went to check the bedrooms and a third seized the ladder and ran up it to examine the halfloft where the young singer had been hiding other soldiers tomasso registered apprehensively were taking up positions outside each of the windows there was a great deal of noise outside among the horses and a confusion of torches tomasso abruptly stamped his foot in frustration what is the meaning of this he shrilled as the soldiers continued to ignore him tell me i shall protest directly to your lord we have albericos express permission to conduct this vigil and the burial tomorrow i have it in writing under his seal he addressed the barbadian captain standing by the door again it was as if he hadnt even spoken so completely did they disregard him four more soldiers came in and spread out to the edges of the room their expressions blank and dangerous this is intolerable tomasso whined staying in character his hands writhing about each other i shall ride immediately to alberico i shall demand that you all be shipped straight back to your wretched hovels in barbadior that will not be necessary said a burly hooded figure in the doorway he stepped forward and threw back the hood you may make your childish demand of me right here said alberico of barbadior tyrant of astibar tregea ferraut and certando tomassos hands flew to his throat even as he dropped to his knees the others too knelt immediately even old scalvaia with his game leg a black mindcloak of numbing fear threatened to descend over tomasso trammeling all speech and thought my lord he stammered i did not i could we could not know alberico was silent gazing blankly down upon him tomasso fought to master his terror and bewilderment you are most welcome here he bleated rising carefully most welcome most honored lord you do us too much honor with your presence at my fathers rites i do said alberico bluntly tomasso received the full weight of a heavy scrutiny from the small eyes closeset and unblinking deep in the folds of the sorcerers large face albericos bald skull gleamed in the firelight he drew his hands from the pockets of his robe i would have wine he demanded gesturing with a meaty palm but of course of course tomasso stumbled to obey intimidated as always by the sheer bulky physicality of alberico and his barbadians they hated him he knew and all his kind over and above everything else these conquerors felt about the people of the eastern palm whose world they now ruled whenever he faced alberico tomasso was overwhelmingly conscious that the tyrant could crack his bones with bare hands and not think twice about having done so it was not a comforting line of thought only eighteen years of carefully schooling his body to shield his mind kept his hands steady as they carried a full glass ceremoniously over to alberico the soldiers eyed his every movement nievole was back by the larger fire taeri and herado together by the small one scalvaia stood braced upon his cane beside the chair in which hed been sitting it was time tomasso judged to sound more confident less guilty you will forgive me my lord for my ill judged words to your soldiers not knowing you were here i could only guess they were acting in ignorance of your wishes my wishes change alberico said in his heavy unchanging voice they are likely to know of those changes before you bar sandre of course my lord but of course they i wanted said alberico of barbadior to look upon the coffin of your father to look and to laugh he showed no trace of an inclination toward amusement tomassos blood felt suddenly icy in his veins alberico stepped past him and stood massively over the remains of the duke this he said flatly is the body of a vain wretched fatuous old man who decreed the hour of his own death to no purpose no purpose at all is it not amusing he did laugh then three short harsh barks of sound that were more truly frightening than anything tomasso had ever heard in his life how had he known will you not laugh with me you three sandreni nievole my poor crippled impotent lord scalvaia is it not diverting to think how all of you have been brought here and doomed by senile foolishness by an old man who lived too long to understand how the labyrinthine twistings of his own time could be so easily smashed through with a fist today his clenched hand crashed heavily down on the wooden coffin lid splintering the carved sandreni arms with a faint sound of distress scalvaia sank back into his chair my lord tomasso gulped gesticulating what can you possibly mean what are you he got no further than that wheeling savagely alberico slapped him meatily across the face with an open hand tomasso staggered backwards blood spattering from his ripped mouth you will use your natural voice son of a fool the sorcerer said the words more terrifying because spoken in the same flat tone as before will it at least amuse you to know how easy this was to learn how long herado bar gianno has been reporting to me and with those words the night came down the full black cloak of anguish and raw terror tomasso had been fighting desperately to hold back oh my father he thought stricken to his soul that it should have been by family that they were now undone by family family several things happened then in an extremely short span of time my lord herado cried out in highpitched dismay you promised you said they would not know you told me it was all he said it is difficult to expostulate with a dagger embedded in your throat the sandreni deal with the scrapings of dirt under their own fingernails said his uncle taeri who had drawn the blade from the back of his boot even as he spoke taeri pulled his dagger free of herado and smoothly part of one continuous motion sheathed it in his own heart one less sandreni for your skywheels barbadian he taunted gasping triad send a plague to eat the flesh from your bones he dropped to his knees his hands were on the dagger haft blood was spilling over them his eyes sought tomassos farewell brother he whispered morian grant our shadows know each other in her halls something was clenched around tomassos heart squeezing and squeezing as he watched his brother die two of the guards trained to ward a very different sort of blow at their lord stepped forward and flipped taeri over on his back with the toes of their boots fools spat alberico visibly upset for the first time i needed him alive i wanted both of them alive the soldiers blanched at the fury written in his features then the focus of the room went elsewhere entirely with an animal roar of mingled rage and pain nievole dastibar a very big man himself linked his two hands like a hammer or the head of a mace and swung them full into the face of the soldier nearest to him the blow smashed bones like splintering wood blood spurted as the man screamed and crumpled heavily back against the coffin still roaring nievole grappled for his victims sword he actually had it out and was turning to do battle when four arrows took him in the throat and chest his face went dully slack for an instant then his eyes widened and his mouth relaxed into a macabre smile of triumph as he slipped to the floor and then just then with all eyes on fallen nievole lord scalvaia did the one thing no one had dared to do slumped deep in his chair so motionless they had almost forgotten him the aged patrician raised his cane with a steady hand pointed it straight at albericos face and squeezed the spring catch hidden in the handle sorcerers cannot indeed be poisoned a minor protective art one that most of them master in their youth on the other hand they most certainly can be slain by arrow or blade or any of the other instruments of violent death which is why such things were forbidden within a decreed radius of wherever alberico might be there is also a wellknown truth about men and their gods whether of the triad in the palm or the varying pantheon worshiped in barbadior whether of mother goddess or dying and reviving god or lord of wheeling stars or single awesome power above all of these in some rumored prime world far off amid the drifts of space it is the simple truth that mortal man cannot understand why the gods shape events as they do why some men and women are cut off in fullest flower while others live to dwindle into shadows of themselves why virtue must sometimes be trampled and evil flourish amid the beauty of a country garden why chance sheer random chance plays such an overwhelming role in the running of the life lines and the fate lines of men it was chance that saved alberico of barbadior then in a moment that had his name half spelledout for death his guards were intent upon the fallen men and on the taut bleeding form of tomasso no one had spared a glance for the crippled lord in his chair it was only the fact mercilessly random that that evenings captain of the guard happened to have moved into the cabin on scalvaias side of the room that changed the course of history in the peninsula of the palm and beyond by things so achingly small are lives measured and marred alberico turning in a white rage to snap an order at his captain saw the cane come up and scalvaias finger jerk upon the handle had he been facing straight ahead or turning the other way he would have died of a sharpened projectile bursting into his brain it was toward scalvaia that he turned though and he was the mightiest wielder of magic save one in the palm in that hour even so what he did the only single thing he could do took all the power he had and very nearly more than he could command there was no time for the spoken spell the focusing gesture the bolt that was his ending had already been loosed alberico released his hold upon his body watching in terror and disbelief tomasso saw the lethal bolt whip through a blurred oozing of matter and air where albericos head had been the bolt smashed harmlessly into the wall above a window and in that same scintilla of time knowing that an instant later would be an instant too late that his body could be unknit forever his soul neither living nor dead left to howl impotently in the waste that lay in ambush for those who dared essay such magic alberico summoned the lineaments of his form back to himself it was a near thing he had a droop to his right eyelid from that day on and his physical strength was never again what it had been when he was tired ever after his right foot would have a tendency to splay outward as if retracing the strange release of that momentary magic he would limp then much as scalvaia had done through eyes that fought to focus properly alberico of barbadior saw scalvaias silvermaned head fly across the room to bounce with a sickening sound on the rushstrewn floor decapitated by the belated sword of the captain of the guard the deadly cane crafted of stones and metals alberico did not recognize clattered loudly to the ground the air seemed thick and viscous to the sorcerer unnaturally dense he was conscious of a loose rattling sound to his breathing and a spasmodic trembling at the back of his knees it was another moment etched in the rigid stunned silence of the other men in the room before he trusted himself to even try to speak you are dung he said thickly coarsely to the ashen captain you are less than that you are filth and crawling slime you will kill yourself now he spoke as if there were sliding soil clogging and spilling from his mouth with an effort he swallowed his saliva ferociously straining to make his eyes work properly he watched as the blurry form of his captain bowed jerkily and reversing his sword severed his own jugular with a swift jagged slash alberico felt a froth of rage foaming and boiling through his mind he fought to will an end to a palsied tremor in his left hand he could not there were a great many dead men in the room and he very nearly had been one of them he didnt even entirely feel as if he lived his body seemed to have reassembled itself in not quite the same way as before he rubbed with weak fingers at the drooping eyelid he felt ill nauseous the air was hard to breathe he needed to be outside away from this suddenly stifling lodge of his enemies nothing had come to pass as hed expected there was only one single element left of his original design for the evening one thing that might yet offer a kind of pleasure that might redeem a little of what had gone so desperately awry he turned slowly to look at sandres son at the lover of boys he dragged his mouth upwards into a smile unaware of how hideous he looked bring him he said thickly to his soldiers bind him and bring him there are things we can do with this one before we allow him to die things appropriate to what he was his vision was still not working properly but he saw one of his mercenaries smile tomasso bar sandre closed his eyes there was blood on his face and clothing there would be more before they were done alberico put up his hood and limped from the room behind him the soldiers lifted up the body of the dead captain and supported the man whose face had been broken by nievole they had to help the tyrant mount his horse which he found humiliating but he began to feel better during the torchlit ride back to astibar he was utterly devoid of magic though even through the dulled sensations of his altered reassembled body he could feel the void where his power should be it would be at least two weeks probably more before it all came back if it all came back what he had done in the flashing of that instant in the lodge had drained more from him than any act of magic ever had in his life he was alive though and he had just shattered the three most dangerous families left in the eastern palm even more he had the middle sandreni son here now as evidence public proof of the conspiracy for the days to come the pervert who was said to relish pain alberico allowed himself a tiny smile within the recesses of his hood it was all going to be done by law and openly as had been his practice almost from the day hed taken power here no unrest born of arbitrary exercise of might would be permitted to rear its dangerous head they might hate him of course they would hate him but not one citizen of his four provinces would be able to doubt the justice or deny the legitimacy of his response to this sandreni plot or miss the point of how comprehensive that response was about to be with the prudent caution that was the truest wellspring of his character alberico of barbadior began thinking through his actions of the next hours and days the high gods of the empire knew this far peninsula was a place of constant danger and needed stern governing but the gods who were not blind could see that he knew how to give it what was needful and it was growing more and more possible that the emperors advisers back home who were no more sightless than the gods would see the same things and the emperor was old alberico withdrew his thoughts from these familiar too seductive channels he made himself focus on detail again detail was everything in matters such as this the neat steps of his planning clicked into place like beads on a djarra string as he rode drily precisely he assembled the orders he would give the only commands that caused him an inward flicker of emotion were the ones concerning tomasso bar sandre these at least did not have to be made public and they would not be only the confession and its revealing details needed to be known outside his palace walls whatever took place in certain rooms underground could be extremely private indeed he surprised himself a little with the anticipation he felt at one point he remembered that hed wanted the hunting lodge torched when they left smoothly he adjusted his thinking on that let the lesser sandreni and their servants find the dead when they came at dawn let them wonder and fear the doubt would only last a little while then he would cause everything to be made extremely clear chapter oh morian alessan whispered wistful regret infusing his voice i could have sent him to your judgment even now a child could have put an arrow in his eye from here not this child devin thought ruefully gauging the distance and the light from where they were hidden among the trees north of the ribbon of road the barbadians had just ridden along he looked with even more respect than before at alessan and the crossbow hed picked up from a cache theyd looped past on the way here she will claim him when she is ready baerd said prosaically and you are the one who has spent his life saying that it will be to no good if either one of them dies too soon alessan grunted did i shoot he asked pointedly baerds teeth flashed briefly in the moonlight i would have stopped you in any case alessan swore succinctly then a moment later relaxed into quiet amusement the two men had a manner with each other that spoke to long familiarity catriana devin saw had not smiled certainly not at him on the other hand he reminded himself he was supposed to be the one who was angry the present circumstances made it a little hard though he felt anxious and proud and excited all at once he was also the only one of the four of them who hadnt noticed tomasso bound at wrist and ankle to his horse wed better check the lodge baerd said as the transient mood slipped away then i think we will have to travel very fast sandres son will name you and the boy we had better have a talk about the boy first catriana said in a tone that made it suddenly very easy for devin to reclaim his anger the boy he repeated raising his eyebrows i think you have evidence to the contrary he let his gaze rest coldly on hers and was rewarded to see her flush and turn away briefly rewarded unworthy devin alessan said i hope not to hear that note from you again catriana violated all i know of her nature in doing what she did this morning if you are intelligent enough to have come here you will be more than intelligent enough to now understand why she did it you might suspend your own pride long enough to think about how she is feeling it was mildly said but devin felt as if he had just been punched in the stomach swallowing awkwardly he looked from alessan back to catriana but her gaze was fixed on the stars away from and above them all finally shamed he looked down at the darkened forest floor he felt fourteen years old again i dont particularly appreciate that alessan he heard catriana saying coldly i fight my own wars you know it not to mention baerd added casually the dazzling inappropriateness of your chastising anyone alive for having too much pride alessan chose to ignore that to catriana he said bright star of eanna do you think i dont know how you can fight this is different though what happened this morning cannot be allowed to matter i cant have this becoming a battle between you if devin is to be one of us if he what catriana wheeled on him are you mad is it the music because he can sing why should someone from asoli possibly be hold peace alessan said sharply catriana fell abruptly silent not having any good idea where to look or what to feel devin continued to simulate an intense interest in the loamy forest soil beneath his feet his mind and heart were whirling with confusion alessans voice was gentler when he resumed catriana what happened this morning was not his fault either you are not to blame him you did what you felt you had to do and it did not succeed he cannot be blamed or cursed for following you as innocently as he did if you must curse me for not stopping him as he went through the door i could have why didnt you then baerd asked devin remembered alessan looking at him as hed paused in the archway of that inner door that had seemed a gateway to a land of dreaming yes why he asked awkwardly looking up why did you let me follow the moonlight was purely blue now vidomni was over west behind the tops of the trees only ilarion was overhead among the stars making the night strange with her shining ghostlight the country folk called it when the blue moon rode alone alessan had the light behind him so his eyes were hidden for a moment the only sounds were the night noises of the forest rustle of leaf in breeze of grass the dry crackle of the woodland floor quick flap of wings to a branch near by somewhere north of them a small animal cried out and another answered it alessan said because i knew the tune his father taught him as a child and i know who his father is and he isnt from asoli catriana my dear it isnt just the music whatever you may think of my own weaknesses he is one of us my darling baerd will you test him on the most conscious rational level devin understood almost none of this nonetheless he felt himself beginning to grow cold even as alessan spoke he had a swooping sense like the descent of a hunting bird that he had come to where morians portal had led him here in the shadows of this wood under the waxing blue moon nor was he made easier when he turned to baerd and saw the stricken look on the face of the other man even by the distorting moonlight he could see how pale baerd had become alessan baerd began his voice roughened you are dearer to me than anyone alive alessan said calm and grave you have been more than a brother to me i would not hurt you for the world and especially not in this never in this i would not ask unless i was sure test him baerd still baerd hesitated which made devins own anxiety grow he understood less and less of what was happening only that it seemed to matter to the others a great deal for a long moment no one moved finally baerd walking carefully as if holding tightly to control of himself took devin by the arm and led him a dozen steps further into the wood to a small clearing among a circle of trees neatly he lowered himself to sit crosslegged on the ground after a moments hesitation devin did the same there was nothing he could do but follow the leads he was being given he had no idea where they were going not on the road im on he remembered catriana saying in the palace that morning he linked his hands together to keep them steady he felt cold and it had little to do with the chill of night he heard alessan and catriana following them but he didnt look back for the moment what was important was the enormous thing whatever it was that he could see building in baerds eyes the blondhaired man had appeared so effortlessly competent until this moment and now absurdly he seemed to have become terribly fragile someone who could be shattered with unsettling ease abruptly and for the second time in that long day devin felt as if he were crossing over into a country of dream leaving behind the simple denned boundaries of the daylight world and in this mood under the blue light of ilarion he heard baerd begin the tale so that it came to him that first time like a spell something woven in words out of the lost spaces of his childhood which is what in the end it was in the year alberico took astibar said baerd while the provinces of tregea and certando were each preparing to fight him alone and before ferraut had fallen brandin king of ygrath came to this peninsula from the west he sailed his fleet into the great harbor of chiara and he took the island he took it easily for the grand duke killed himself seeing how many ships had come from ygrath this much i suspect that you know his voice was low devin found himself leaning forward straining to hear a trialla was singing sweetly sadly from a branch behind him alessan and catriana made no sound at all baerd went on in that year the peninsula of the palm became a battleground in an enormous balancing game between ygrath and the empire of barbadior neither thought it could afford to give the other free rein here halfway between the two of them which is one of the reasons brandin came the other reason as we learned afterward had to do with his younger mostbeloved son stevan brandin of ygrath sought to carve out a second realm for his child to rule what he found was something else the trialla was still singing baerd paused to listen as if finding in its liquescent voice gentler even than the nightingales an echo to something in his own the chiarans attempting to rally a resistance in the mountains were massacred on the slopes of sangarios brandin took asoli province soon after and word of his power ran before him he was very strong in his sorcery even stronger than alberico and though he had fewer soldiers than the barbadians in the east his were more completely loyal and better trained for where alberico was only a wealthy ambitious minor lord of the empire using hired mercenaries brandin ruled ygrath and his were the picked soldiers of that realm they moved south through corte almost effortlessly defeating each provinces army one by one for none of us acted together in that year or after naturally baerds voice wasnt quite detached enough for the irony he was trying for from corte brandin himself turned east with the smaller part of his army to meet alberico in ferraut and pin him down there he sent stevan south to take the last free province in the west and then cross over to join him in ferraut to meet the barbadians in the battle that i think they all expected would shape the fate of the palm it was a mistake though he could not really have known it then eighteen years ago newly landed here ignorant of the natures of the different provinces in this peninsula i suppose he wanted stevan to have a taste of leadership on his own he gave him most of the army and his best commanders relying on his own sorcery to hold alberico until the others joined him baerd paused for a moment his blue eyes focused inward when he resumed there was a new timbre to his voice it seemed to devin to be carrying many different things all of them old and all of them sorrowful at the line of the river deisa baerd said a little more than halfway between certando and the sea at corte stevan was met by the bitterest resistance either of the invading armies was to find in the palm led by their prince for in their pride they had always named their ruler so the people of that last province in the west met the ygrathens and held them and beat them back from the river with heavy losses on both sides and prince valentin of that province the province you know as lower corte slew stevan of ygrath brandins beloved son on the bank of the river at sunset after a bitter day of death devin could almost taste the keenness of old grief in the words he saw baerd glance over for the first time to where alessan was standing neither man spoke devin never took his own eyes away from baerd he concentrated as if his life depended on his doing so treating each word spoken as if it were a jeweled mosaic piece to be set into the memory that was his own pride and right about then it seemed to devin that a distant bell began to toll in some recess of his mind ranging a warning as might a village bell in a temple of adaon summoning farmers urgently back from the fields a far bell heard faint but clear from over morning fields of waving yellow grain brandin knew what had happened immediately through his sorcery baerd said his voice like the rasp of a file he swept back south and west leaving alberico a free hand in ferraut and certando he came down with the full weight of his sorcery and his army and with the rage of a father whose son has been slain and he met the remnant of his last foes where they had waited for him by the deisa once more baerd looked over at alessan his face was bleak ghostly in the moonlight he said brandin annihilated them he smashed them to pieces without mercy or respite drove them helplessly before him back into their own country south of the deisa and he burned every field and village through which he passed he took no prisoners he had women slain in that first march and children which was not a thing hed done anywhere else but nowhere else had his own child died so many souls crossed over to morian for the sake of the soul of stevan of ygrath his father overran that province in blood and fire before the summer was out he had leveled all the glorious towers of the city in the foothills of the mountains the one now called stevanien on the coast he smashed to rubble and sand the walls and the harbor barriers of the royal city by the sea and in the battle by the river he took the prince who had slain his son and later that year had him tortured and mutilated and killed in chiara baerds voice was a dry whisper now under the starlight and the light of the single moon and with it there was still that bell warning of sorrows yet to come tolling in devins mind louder now baerd said brandin of ygrath did something more than all of this he gathered his magic the sorcerous power that he had and he laid down a spell upon that land such as had never even been conceived before and with that spell he tore its name away he stripped that name utterly from the minds of every man and woman who had not been born in that province it was his deepest curse his ultimate revenge he made it as if we had never been our deeds our history our very name and then he called us lower corte after the bitterest of our ancient enemies among the provinces behind him now devin heard a sound and realized that catriana was weeping baerd said brandin made it come to pass that no one living could hear and then remember the name of that land or of its royal city by the sea or even of that high golden place of towers on the old road from the mountains he broke us and he ravaged us he killed a generation and then he stripped away our name and those last words were not whispered or rasped into the autumn dark of astibar they were hurled forth as a denunciation an indictment to the trees and the night and stars the stars that had watched this thing come to pass the grief in that accusation clenched itself like a fist within devin more tightly than baerd could ever have known than anyone could have known for no one since marra had died really knew what memory meant to devin dasoli the way in which it had come to be the touchstone of his soul memory was talisman and ward for him gateway and hearth it was pride and love shelter from loss for if something could be remembered it was not wholly lost not dead and gone forever marra could live his dour stern father hum a cradle song to him and because of this because this was at the heart of what devin was the old vengeance of brandin of ygrath smashed into him that night as if it had been newly wrought pounding through to the vulnerable center of how devin saw and dealt with the world and it cut him like a fresh and killing wound with an effort he forced himself to steadiness willing the concentration that would allow him to remember this all of this which seemed to matter more than ever now especially now with the echo of baerds last terrible words fading in the night devin looked at the blondhaired man with the leather bands across his brow and about his neck and he waited he had been quick as a boy he was a clever man he understood what was coming it had fallen into place older by far than he had been only an hour ago devin heard alessan murmur from behind him the cradle song i heard you playing was from that last province devin a song of the city of towers no one not of that place could have learned that tune in the way you told me you did it is how i knew you as one of us it is why i did not stop you when you followed catriana i left it to morian to see what might lie beyond that doorway devin nodded absorbing this a moment later he said as carefully as he could if this is so if i have properly understood you then i should be one of the people who can still hear and remember the name that has been otherwise taken away alessan said it is so devin discovered that his hands were shaking he looked down at them concentrating but he could not make them stop he said then this is something that has been stolen from me all my life will you give it back to me will you tell me the name of the land where i was born he was looking at baerd by starlight for ilarion too was gone now over west beyond the trees alessan had said it was baerds to tell devin didnt know why in the darkness they heard the trialla one more time a long descending note and then baerd spoke and for the first time in his days devin heard someone say tigana within him the bell he had been hearing as if in a dream of unknown summer fields fell silent and within that abrupt absolute inner stillness a surge of loss broke over him like an ocean wave and after that wave came another and then a third the one bearing love and the other a heartdeep pride he felt a strange lightheaded dizzying sensation as of a summons rushing along the corridors of his blood then he saw how baerd was staring at him saw his face rigid and white the fear transparent even by starlight and something else as well bitterest thirst an aching deprived hunger of the soul and then devin understood and gave to the other man the release he needed thank you devin said he didnt seem to be trembling anymore around a difficult thickness in his throat he went on for it was his turn now his test tigana tigana i was born in the province of tigana my name my true name is devin di tigana bar garin even as he spoke something akin to glory blazed in baerds face the fairhaired man squeezed his eyes tightly shut as if to hold that glory in to keep it from escaping into the dispersing dark to clutch it fiercely to his need devin heard alessan draw an unsteady breath and then surprised he felt catriana touch his shoulder and then withdraw her hand baerd was lost in a place beyond speech it was alessan who said that is one of the two names taken away and the deepest tigana was our province and the name of the royal city by the sea the fairest city under eannas lights you would have heard it named or perhaps perhaps only the second most fair a thread of something that seemed to genuinely long to become laughter was in his voice laughter and love together for the first time devin turned to look up at him alessan said if you were to have spoken with those from inland and south in the city where the river sperion descending from the mountain begins its run westward to find the sea you would have heard it said that second way for we were always proud and there was always rivalry between the two cities in the end hard as he tried his voice could only carry loss you were born in that inland city devin and so was i we are children of that high valley and of the silver running of that mountain river we were born in avalle in avalle of the towers there was music in devins mind again with that name but this time it was different from the bells hed heard before this time it was a music that took him back a long way all the way to his father and his childhood he said you do know the words then dont you of course i do said alessan gently please devin asked but it was catriana who answered him in the voice a young mother might have used rocking her child to sleep on an evening long ago springtime morning in avalle and i dont care what the priests say im going down to the river today on a springtime morning in avalle when im all grown up come what may ill build a boat to carry me away and the river will take it to tigana bay and the sea even further from avalle but wherever i wander by night or by day where water runs swiftly or high trees sway my heart will carry me back and away to a dream of the towers of avalle a dream of my home in avalle the sweet sad words to the tune hed always known drifted down to devin and with them came something else a sense of loss so deep it almost drowned the light grace of catrianas song no breaking waves now or trumpets along the blood only the waters of longing a longing for something taken away from him before hed even known it was his taken so completely so comprehensively he might have lived his whole life through without ever knowing it was gone and so devin wept as catriana sang small boys younglooking for their age learned very early in northern asoli how risky it was to cry where someone might see but something too large for devin to deal with had overtaken him in the forest tonight if he understood properly what alessan had just said this song was one his mother would have sung to him his mother whose life had been ripped away by brandin of ygrath he bowed his head though not to shield the tears and listened as catriana finished that bittersweet cradle song a song of a child defying orders and authority even when young who was selfreliant enough to want to build a ship alone and brave enough to want to sail it into the wideness of the world never turning back nor ever losing or forgetting the place where it all began a child very much as devin saw himself which was one of the reasons he wept for he had been made to lose and forget those towers hed been robbed of any dream he himself might ever have had of avalle or tigana on its bay so his tears followed one another downward in darkness as he mourned his mother and his home and in the shadows of that wood not far from astibar those two griefs fused to each other in devin and became welded in the forge of his heart with what memory meant to him and the loss of memory and out of that blazing something took shape in devin that was to change the running of his life line from that night he dried his eyes on his sleeve and looked up no one spoke he saw that baerd was looking at him very deliberately devin held up his left hand the hand of the heart very carefully he folded his third and fourth fingers down so that what showed was a simulacrum of the shape of the peninsula of the palm the position for taking an oath baerd lifted his right hand and made the same gesture they touched fingertips together devins small palm against the other mans larger callused one devin said if you will have me i am with you in the name of my mother who died in that war i swear i will not break faith with you nor i with you said baerd in the name of tigana gone there was a rustling as alessan sank to his knees beside them devin i should be cautioning you he said soberly this is not a thing in which to move too fast you can be one with our cause without having to break your life apart to come with us he has no choice catriana murmured moving nearer on the other side tomasso bar sandre will name you both to the torturers tonight or tomorrow im afraid the singing career of devin dasoli may be over just as it truly begins she looked down on the three men her eyes unreadable in the darkness it is over devin said quietly it ended when i learned my name catrianas expression did not change he had no idea what she was thinking very well said alessan he held up his own left hand two fingers down devin met it with his right alessan hesitated an oath in your mothers name is stronger for me than you could have guessed he said you knew her we both did baerd said quietly she was ten years older than us but every adolescent boy in tigana was a little in love with micaela and most of the grown men too i think another new name and all the hurt that came with it devins father had never spoken it his sons had never even known their mothers name there were more avenues to sorrow in this night than devin could have imagined we all envied and admired your father more than i can tell you alessan added though i was pleased that an avalle man won her in the end i can remember when you were born devin my father sent a gift to your naming day i dont remember what it was you admired my father devin said stunned alessan heard that and his voice changed do not judge him by what he became you only knew him after brandin smashed a whole generation and their world ending their lives or blighting their souls your mother was dead avalle fallen tigana gone he had fought and survived both battles by the deisa above them catriana made a small sound i never knew devin protested he never told us any of that there was a new ache inside him so many avenues few of the survivors spoke of those days baerd said neither of my parents did said catriana awkwardly they took us as far away as they could to a fishing village here in astibar down the coast from ardin and never spoke a word of any of this to shield you alessan said gently his palm was still touching devins it was smaller than baerds a great many of the parents who managed to survive fled so that their children might have a chance at a life unmarred by the oppression and the stigma that bore down that still bear down upon tigana or lower corte as we must name it now they ran away said devin stubbornly he felt cheated deprived betrayed alessan shook his head devin think dont judge yet think do you really imagine you learned that tune by chance your father chose not to burden you or your brothers with the danger of your heritage but he set a stamp upon you a tune wordless for safety and he sent you out into the world with something that would reveal you unmistakably to anyone from tigana but to no one else i do not think it was chance no more than catrianas mother giving her daughter a ring that marked her to anyone born where she was born devin glanced back catriana held out her hand for him to see it was dark but his eyes had adjusted to that and he could make out a strange twining shape upon the ring a man half human half creature of the sea he swallowed will you tell me of him he asked turning back to alessan of my father of stolid dour garin grim farmer in a wet grey land who had it now appeared come from bright avalle of the towers in the southern highlands of tigana and who had in his youth wooed and won a woman beloved of all who saw her who had fought and lived through two terrible battles by a river and who had if alessan was right in his last conjecture very deliberately sent out into the world his one quick imaginative child capable of finding what he seemed to have found tonight who had also devin abruptly realized almost certainly lied when he said hed forgotten the words to the cradle song it was all suddenly very hard i will tell you what i know of him and gladly alessan said but not tonight for catriana is right and we must get ourselves away before dawn right now i will swear faith with you as baerd has done i accept your oath you have mine you are as kin to me from now until the ending of my days devin turned to look up at catriana will you accept me she tossed her hair i dont have much choice do i she said carelessly you seem to have entangled yourself rather thoroughly here she lowered her left hand though as she spoke two fingers curled her fingers met his own with a light cool touch be welcome she said i swear i will keep faith with you devin di tigana and i with you im sorry about this morning devin offered her hand withdrew and her eyes flashed even by starlight he could see it oh yes she said sardonically im sure you are it was very clear all along how regrettable you found the experience alessan snorted with amusement catriana my darling he said i just forbade him to mention any details of what happened how do i enforce that if you bring them up yourself without the faintest trace of a smile catriana said i am the aggrieved party here alessan you dont enforce anything on me the rules are not the same baerd chuckled suddenly the rules he said have not been the same since you joined us why indeed should this be any different catriana tossed her head again but did not deign to reply the three men stood up devin flexed his knees to relieve the stiffness of sitting so long in one position ferraut or tregea baerd asked which border ferraut alessan said theyll have me placed as tregean as soon as tomasso talks poor man if id been thinking clearly i would have shot him as they rode by oh very clear thinking that baerd retorted with twenty soldiers surrounding him you would have had us all in chains in astibar by now you would have deflected my arrow alessan said wryly is there a chance he wont speak devin interjected awkwardly im thinking about menico you see if im named alessan shook his head everyone talks under torture he said soberly especially if sorcery is involved im thinking about menico too but there isnt anything we can do about it devin it is one of the realities of the life we live there are people put at risk by almost everything we do i wish he added that i knew what had happened in that lodge you wanted to check it catriana reminded him can we afford the time i did and yes i think we can said alessan crisply there remains a piece missing in all of this i still dont know how sandre dastibar could have expected me to be the he stopped there except for the drone of the cicadas and the rustling leaves it was very quiet in the woods the trialla had gone alessan abruptly raised one hand and pushed it roughly through his hair he shook his head do you know he said to baerd in what was almost a conversational tone how much of a fool i can be at times it was in the palm of my hand all along his voice changed come on and pray we are not too late the fires had both died down in the sandreni lodge only the stars shone above the clearing in the woods the cluster of eannas diadem was well over west following the moons a nightingale was singing as if in answer to the trialla of before as the four of them approached in the doorway alessan hesitated for a moment then shrugged his shoulders in a gesture devin already recognized then he pushed open the door and walked through by the red glow of the embers they looked with eyes accustomed by now to darkness on the carnage within the coffin still rested on its trestles although splintered and knocked awry around it though lay dead men who had been alive when they left this room the two younger sandreni nievole a quiver of arrows in his throat and chest the body of scalvaia dastibar then devin made out scalvaias severed head in a black puddle of blood a terrible distance away and he fought to control the lurch of sickness in his gorge oh morian alessan whispered oh lady of the dead be gentle to them in your halls they died dreaming of freedom and before their time three of them did came a harsh desiccated voice from deep in one of the armchairs the fourth should have been strangled at birth devin jumped half a foot his heart hammering with shock the speaker rose and stood beside the chair facing them he was entirely hidden in shadow i thought you would come back he said the sixth man devin realized struggling to understand straining to make out the tall gaunt form by the faint glow of the embers alessan seemed quite unruffled im sorry i kept you waiting then he said it took me too long to riddle this through will you allow me to express my sorrow for what has happened he paused and my respect for you my lord sandre devins jaw dropped open as if unhinged he snapped it shut so hard he hurt his teeth he hoped no one had seen events were moving far too fast for him i will accept the first said the gaunt figure in front of them i do not deserve your respect though nor that of anyone else once perhaps not anymore you are speaking to an old vain fool exactly as the barbadian named me a man who spent too many years alone tangled in his own spun webs you were right in everything you said before about carelessness it has cost me three sons tonight within a month less probably the sandreni will be no more the voice was dry and dispassionate objectively damning devoid of selfpity the tone of a judge in some dark hall of final adjudication what happened alessan asked quietly the boy was a traitor flat uninflected final oh my lord baerd exclaimed family my grandson giannos boy the his soul is cursed baerd said quiet and fierce he is in morians custody now and she will know how to deal with him may he be trammeled in darkness until the end of time the old man seemed not to have even heard taeri killed him he murmured wonderingly i had not thought he was brave enough or so quick then he stabbed himself to deny them the pleasure of whatever they might have learned of him i had not thought he was so brave he repeated absently through the thick shadows devin looked at the two bodies by the smaller fire uncle and nephew lay so close to each other they seemed almost intertwined on the far side of the coffin the empty coffin you said you waited for us alessan murmured will you tell me why for the same reason you came back sandre moved for the first time stiffly making his way to the larger fire he seized a small log and threw it on the guttering flame a shower of sparks flew up he nursed it poking with the iron until a tongue of flame licked free of the ash bed the duke turned and now devin could see his white hair and beard and the bony hollows of his cheeks his eyes were set deep in their sockets but they gleamed with a cold defiance i am here sandre said and you are here because it goes on it goes on whatever happens whoever dies while there is breath to be drawn and a heart with which to hate my quest and your own until we die they go on you were listening then said alessan from in the coffin you heard what i said the drug had worn off by sundown i was awake before we reached the lodge i heard everything you said and a great deal of what you chose not to say the duke replied straightening a chilly hauteur in his voice i heard what you named yourself and what you chose not to tell them but i know who you are he took a step towards alessan he raised a gnarled hand and pointed it straight at him i know exactly who you are alessan bar valentin prince of tigana it was too much devins brain simply gave up trying to understand too many pieces of information were coming at him from too many different directions contradicting each other ferociously he felt dizzy overwhelmed he was in a room where only a little while ago he had stood among a number of men now four of them were dead with a more brutal violence than he had ever thought to come upon at the same time the one man hed known to be dead the man whose mourning rites he had sung that very morning was the only man of astibar left alive in this lodge if he was of astibar for if he was how could he have just spoken the name of tigana given what devin had just learned in the wood how could he have known that alessan was and this too devin fought to assimilate a prince the son of that valentin who had slain stevan of ygrath and so brought brandins vengeance down upon them all devin simply stopped trying to put it all together he set himself to listen and look to absorb as much as he could into the memory that had never failed him yet and to let understanding come after when he had time to think so resolved he heard alessan say after a blank silence more than long enough to reveal the degree of his own surprise and wonder now i understand finally i understand my lord i thought you always a giant among men from the first time i saw you at my first triad games twentythree years ago you are even more than i took you for how did you stay alive how have you hidden it from the two of them all these years hidden what it was catriana her voice so angry and bewildered it immediately made devin feel better he wasnt the only one desperately treading water here he is a wizard baerd said flatly there was another silence then the wizards of the palm are immune to spells not directed specifically at them alessan added this is true of all magicusers wherever they come from however they find access to their power for this reason among others brandin and alberico have been hunting down and killing wizards since they came to this peninsula and they have been succeeding because being a wizard has alas nothing to do with wisdom or even simple common sense sandre dastibar said in a corrosive voice he turned and jabbed viciously at the fire with the iron poker the blaze caught fully this time and roared into red light i survived said the duke simply because no one knew it involved nothing more complex than that i used my power perhaps five times in all the years of my reign and always cloaked under someone elses magic and i have done nothing with magic not a flicker since the sorcerers arrived i didnt even use it to feign my death their power is stronger than ours far stronger it was clear from the time each of them came magic was never as much a part of the palm as it was elsewhere we knew this all the wizards knew this you would have thought they would apply their brains to that knowledge would you not what good is a finding spell or a fledgling mental arrow if it leads one straight to a barbadian deathwheel in the sun there was an acid mocking bitterness in the old dukes voice or one of brandins alessan murmured or brandins sandre echoed it is the one thing those two carrion birds have agreed upon other than the dividing line running down the palm that theirs shall be the only magic in this land and it is said alessan or so nearly so as to be the same thing i have been searching for a wizard for a dozen years or more alessan baerd said quickly why the duke asked in the same moment alessan baerd repeated more urgently the man devin had just learned to be the prince of tigana looked over at his friend and shook his head not this one baerd he said cryptically not sandre dastibar he turned back to the duke and hesitated choosing his words then with an unmistakable pride he said you will have heard the legend it happens to be true the line of the princes of tigana all those in direct descent can bind a wizard to them unto death for the first time a gleam of curiosity of an actual interest in something appeared in sandres hooded eyes i do know that story the only wizard who ever guessed what i was after i came into my own magic warned me once to be wary of the princes of tigana he was an old man and doddering by then i remember laughing you actually claim that what he said was true it was i am certain it still is i have had no chance to test it though it is our primal story tigana is the chosen province of adaon of the waves the first of our princes rahal being born of the god by that micaela whom we name as mortal mother of us all and the line of the princes has never been broken devin felt a complex stir of emotions working within himself he didnt even try to enumerate how many things were tangling themselves in his heart micaela he listened and watched and set himself to remember and he heard sandre dastibar laugh i know that story too the duke said derisively that hoary enfeebled excuse for tiganese arrogance princes of tigana not dukes oh no princes descended of the god he thrust the poker toward alessan you will stand here tonight now among the stinking reality of the tyrants and of these dead men and the world of the palm today and spew that old lie at me you will do that it is truth said alessan quietly not moving it is why we are what we are it would have been a slight to the god for his descendants to claim a lesser title the gift of adaon to his mortal son could not be immortality that eanna and morian forbade but the god granted a binding power over the palms own magic to his son and to the sons and daughters of his son while a prince or a princess of tigana lived in that direct line if you doubt me and would put it to the test i will do as baerd would have had me do and bind you with my hand upon your brow my lord duke the old tale is not to be lightly dismissed sandre dastibar if we are proud it is because we have reason to be not any more the duke said mockingly not since brandin came alessans face twisted he opened his mouth and closed it how dare you catriana snapped bravely devin thought prince and duke ignored her rigidly intent on each other sandres sardonic amusement gradually receded into the deep lines etched in his face the bitterness remained in eyes and stance and the pinched line of his mouth alessan said i had not expected that from you under all the circumstances you are in no position to have any idea what to expect from me the duke replied very low under all the circumstances shall we part company now then for a long moment something lay balanced in the air between them a process of weighing and resolution complicated immeasurably by death and grief and rage and the stiff reflexive pride of both men devin responding with his nerveendings to the tension found that he was holding his breath i would prefer not said sandre dastibar finally not like this he added as devin drew breath again will you accept an apology from one who is sunken as low as he has ever been i will said alessan simply and i would seek your counsel before we must indeed part ways for a time your middle son was taken alive he will name me and devin both tomorrow morning if not tonight not tonight the duke said almost absently alberico apprehends no danger anymore he will also be quite seriously debilitated by what happened here he will leave tomasso until a time when he can enjoy what happens when he is in a mood to play tonight tomorrow said baerd his blunt voice jarring the mood it makes little difference he will talk we must be away before he does perhaps perhaps not sandre murmured in the same strangely detached voice he looked at the four dead men on the floor i wish i knew exactly what happened he said inside the coffin i could see nothing but i can tell you that alberico used a magic here tonight so strong it is still pulsating and he used it to save his own life scalvaia did something i dont know what but he came very near he looked at alessan near to giving brandin of ygrath dominion over the whole peninsula you heard that alessan said you agree with me i think i always knew it to be true and i know i succeeded in denying it within myself i was so focused on my own enemy here in astibar i needed to hear it said but once will be enough yes i agree with you they must be taken down together alessan nodded and some of his own rigidly controlled tension seemed to ease away he said there are those who still think otherwise i value your agreement he glanced over at baerd smiling a little wryly then back to the duke you mentioned albericos use of magic as if it should have a meaning now for us what meaning then we are ignorant in these matters no shame if you arent a wizard you are meant to be ignorant sandre smiled thinly the meaning is straightforward though there is such an overflow of magic spilling out from this room tonight that any paltry power of my own that i invoke will be completely screened i think i can ensure that your names are not given to the torturers tomorrow i see said alessan nodding slowly devin did not see anything he felt as if he were churning along in the turbulent wake of information you can take yourself through space you can go in there and bring him out alessans eyes were bright sandre was shaking his head though he held up his left hand all five fingers spread wide i never chopped two fingers in the wizards final binding to the palm my magic is profoundly limited i cant say i regret it i would never have been duke of astibar had i done so given the prejudices and the laws governing wizards here but it constrains what i am able to do i can go in there myself yes but i am not strong enough to bring someone else out i can take him something though i see said alessan again but in a different voice there was a silence he pushed a hand through his disordered hair i am sorry he said at length softly the dukes face was expressionless above the white beard and the gaunt cheeks his eyes gave nothing away at all behind him the fire crackled sparks snapping outward into the room i have a condition sandre said which is that you allow me to come with you i am now a dead man given to morian here in astibar i can speak to no one achieve nothing if i am to preserve any purpose now to the botched deception of my dying i must go with you prince of tigana will you accept a feeble wizard in your entourage a wizard come freely not bound by some legend for a long time alessan was silent looking at the other man his hands quiet at his sides then unexpectedly he grinned it was like a flash of light a gleam of warmth cracking the ice in the room how attached are you he asked in a quite unexpected tone of voice to your beard and your white hair a second later devin heard a strange sound it took him a moment to recognize that what he was hearing was the high wheezing genuine amusement of the duke of astibar do with me what you will sandre said as his mirth subsided what will you do tinge my locks red as the maids alessan shook his head i hope not one of those manes is more than sufficient for a single company i leave these matters to baerd though i leave a great many things to baerd then i shall place myself in his hands sandre said he bowed gravely to the yellowhaired man baerd devin saw did not look entirely happy sandre saw it too i will not swear an oath the duke said to him i swore one vow when alberico came and it is the last vow i shall ever swear i will say though that it shall be my endeavor for the rest of my days to ensure that you do not regret this will that content you slowly baerd nodded it will listening devin had an intuitive sense that this too was an exchange that mattered that neither man had spoken lightly or less than the truth of his heart he glanced over just then at catriana and discovered that she had been watching him she turned quickly away though and did not look back sandre said i think i had best set about doing what i have said i would because of the screening of albericos magic i must go and return from this room but i dare say you need not spend a night among the dead however illustrious they are have you a camp in the woods shall i find you there the idea of magic was unsettling to devin still but sandres words had just given him an idea his first really clear thought since theyd entered the lodge are you sure youll be able to stop your son from talking he asked diffidently quite sure sandre replied briefly devins brow knit well then it seems to me none of us is in immediate danger except for you my lord you must not be seen until baerds done with him alessan interposed but go on devin turned to him id like to say farewell to menico and try to think of a reason to give for leaving i owe him a great deal i dont want him to hate me alessan looked thoughtful he will hate you a little devin even though he isnt that kind of man what happened this morning is what a lifelong trouper like menico dreams about and no explanation you come up with is going to alter the fact that he needs you to make that dream a real thing now devin swallowed he hated what he was hearing but he couldnt deny the truth of it a season or two of the fees menico had said he could now charge would have let the old campaigner buy the inn in ferraut hed talked about for so many years the place where hed always said hed like to settle when the road grew too stern for his bones where he could serve ale and wine and offer a bed and a meal to old friends and new ones passing through on the long trails where he could hear and retell the gossip of the day and swap the old stories he loved and where on the cold winter nights he could stake out a place by the fire and lead whoever happened to be there into and out of all the songs he knew devin shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his breeches he felt awkward and sad i just dont like disappearing on him all three of us at once weve got concerts tomorrow too alessans mouth quirked i do seem to recall that he said two of them three said catriana unexpectedly three alessan agreed cheerfully and one the next day at the woolguild hall i also have it has just occurred to me a substantial wager in the paelion that i expect to win which drew an already predictable growl from baerd do you seriously think the festival of vines is going to blithely proceed after what has occurred tonight you want to go make music in astibar as if nothing has happened music ive been down this road with you before alessan i dont like it actually im quite certain the festival will go on it was sandre alberico is cautious almost before he is anything else i think tonight will redouble that in him he will allow the people their celebrations let those from the distrada scatter and go home then slam down hard immediately after but only on the three families that were here i suspect it is frankly what i would do myself taxes alessan asked perhaps he raised them after the canziano poisoning but that was different an actual assassination attempt in a public place he didnt have much choice i think hell narrow it this time there will be enough bodies for his wheels among the three families here devin found it unsettling how casually the duke spoke of such things this was his kin they were discussing his oldest son grandchildren nephews nieces cousins all to be fodder for barbadian killingwheels devin wondered if he would ever grow as cynical as this if what had begun tonight would harden him to that degree he tried to think of his brothers on a deathwheel in asoli and found his mind flinching away from the very image unobtrusively he made the warding sign against evil the truth was he was upset just thinking about menico and that was merely a matter of costing the man money nothing more people moved from troupe to troupe all the time or left to start their own companies or retired from the road into a business that offered them more security there would be performers who would be expecting him to go on his own after his success this morning that should have been a helpful thought but it wasnt somehow devin hated to make it appear as if they were right something else occurred to him wont it look a bit odd too if we disappear right after the mourning rites right after albericos unmasked a plot that was connected with them were sort of linked to the sandreni now in a way should we draw attention to ourselves like that it isnt as if our disappearance wont be noticed he said it for some reason to baerd and was rewarded a moment later with a brief sober nod of acknowledgment now that cloth i will buy baerd said that does make sense though im sorry to say it a good deal of sense sandre agreed devin fidgeted a little as he came under the scrutiny of those dark sunken eyes the two of you the duke gestured at devin and catriana may yet redeem your generation for me this time devin refused to look at the girl instead his glance went over to the corner where sandres grandson lay by the second dying fire his throat slashed by a family blade alessan broke the silence with a deliberate cough there is also he said in a curious tone another argument entirely only those who have spent as many nights outdoors as i have can properly appreciate the depth as it were of my preference for a soft bed at night in short he concluded with a grin your eloquence has quite overcome me devin lead me back to menico at the inn even a bed shared with two syrenyaplayers who snore in marginal harmony is a serious improvement over cold ground beside baerds relative silence baerd favored him with a forbidding glare one that alessan appeared to weather quite easily i will refrain baerd said darkly from a recitation of your own nocturnal habits i will wait here alone for duke sandre to return well have to burn this lodge tonight for obvious reasons theres a body that will otherwise be missing when the servants come back in the morning well meet the three of you by the cache three mornings from now as early as you see fit to rise from your pillows assuming he added with heavy sarcasm that soft city living doesnt prevent you from being able to find the cache ill find it if he gets lost catriana said alessan looked from one to the other of them his expression wounded that isnt fair he protested it is just the music you both know that devin hadnt alessan was still gazing at baerd you know it is only the music im going back for of course i know that baerd said softly his expression changed im only afraid that the music will kill us both one of these days intercepting the look that passed between them then devin learned something new and sudden and unexpected on a night when hed already learned more things than he could easily handle about the nature of bonding and about love go said baerd with a scowl as alessan still hesitated catriana was already by the door we will meet you after the festival by the cache dont he added expect to recognize us alessan grinned suddenly and a moment later baerd allowed himself to smile as well it changed his face a great deal he didnt devin realized smile very often he was still thinking about that as he followed alessan and catriana out the door and into the darkness of the wood again chapter it happened the long path of that day and night did not lead back to the inn after all the three of them returned through the forest to the main road from astibar to ardin town they walked in silence along the road under the arch of the autumn stars cicadas loud in the woods on either side devin was glad of his woolen overshirt it was chilly now there might be a frost tonight it was strange to be abroad in the darkness so late when they were traveling menico was always careful to have his company quartered and settled by the dinner hour even with the stern measures both tyrants had taken against thieves and brigands the paths of the palm were not often traveled by decent folk at night folk such as he himself had been only this morning he had been secure in his niche and his calling had even had improbably enough a triumph hed been poised on the edge of a genuine success and now he was walking a road in darkness having abandoned any such prospects or security and having sworn an oath that marked him for a deathwheel in chiara if not here both places actually if tomasso bar sandre talked it was an odd lonely feeling he trusted the men he had joined he even trusted the girl if it came to that but he didnt know them very well not like he knew menico or eghano after so many years it occurred to him that the same dilemma applied to the cause he had just sworn to make his own he didnt know tigana either which was the whole point of what brandin of ygrath had done with his sorcery devin was in the process of changing his life for a story told under the moon for a childhood song an evocation of his mother something almost purely an abstraction for him a name he was honest enough to wonder if he was doing this as much for the adventure of it for the glamor that alessan and baerd and the old duke represented as for the depth of old pain and grief hed learned about in the forest tonight he didnt know the answer he didnt know how much catriana fitted into his reasons how much his father did or pride or the sound of baerds voice speaking his loss to the night the truth was that if sandre dastibar could stop his son from talking as he had promised to do then there was nothing to prevent devin from carrying on exactly as he had for the past six years from having the triumph and the rewards that seemed to lie before him he shook his head it was astonishing in a way but that course with menico on the road performing across the palm the life hed woken to this morning seemed almost inconceivable to him now as if hed already crossed to the other side of some tremendous divide devin wondered how often men did what they did made the choices of their lives for reasons that were clean and uncomplicated and easily understood as they were happening he was jolted from his reverie by alessan abruptly raising a hand in warning without a word spoken the three of them slipped into the trees again beside the road after a moment there was a flicker of torchlight to the west and devin heard the sound of a cart approaching there were voices male and female both revelers returning home late he guessed there was a festival going on in some ways it had begun to seem another irrelevance they waited for the cart to go by it did not the horse was pulled up with a soft slap and jingle of reins just in front of where they were hiding someone jumped down then they heard him unlocking a chain on a gate i really am hopelessly overindulgent they heard him complain every single time i look at this excuse for a crest i am reminded that i should have had an artisan design it there are limits or there ought to be to what a father allows devin recognized the place and the voice in the same moment an impulse a striving back toward the ordinary and familiar after what had happened in the night made him rise trust me he whispered as alessan threw him a glance this is a friend then he stepped out into the road i thought it was a handsome design he said clearly better than most artisans i know and to tell the truth rovigo i remember you saying the same thing to me yesterday afternoon in the bird i know that voice rovigo replied instantly i know that voice and i am exceedingly glad to hear it even though you have just unmasked me before a shrewish wife and a daughter who has long been the bane of her fathers unfortunate existence devin dasoli if i am not mistaken he strode forward from the gate seizing the cart lantern from its bracket devin heard relieved laughter from the two women in the cart behind him alessan and then catriana stepped into the road you are not mistaken devin said may i introduce two of my company members catriana dastibar and alessan di tregea this is rovigo a merchant with whom i was sharing a bottle in elegant surroundings when catriana arranged to have me assaulted and ejected yesterday ah rovigo exclaimed holding the lantern higher the sister catriana lit by the widened cast of the flame smiled demurely i needed to talk to him she said by way of explanation i didnt much want to go inside that place a wise and a providential woman rovigo approved grinning would that my clutch of daughters were half so intelligent no one he added should much want to go inside the bird unless they have a headcold so virulent that it defeats all sense of smell alessan burst out laughing wellmet on a dark road master rovigo the more so if you are the owner of a vessel called the sea maid devin blinked in astonishment i have indeed the great misfortune to own and sail that unseaworthy excuse for a vessel rovigo admitted cheerfully how do you come to know it friend alessan seemed highly amused because i was asked to seek you out if i could i have tidings for you from ferraut town from a somewhat portly redfaced personage named taccio my esteemed factor in ferraut rovigo exclaimed well met indeed by the god where did you encounter him in another tavern i am sorry to have to say a tavern where i had been playing music and he was well escaping retribution was his own phrase we two were as it happened the last patrons of the night he wasnt in any great hurry to return home for what seemed to me prudent reasons and we fell to talking it is never hard to fall to talking with taccio rovigo assented devin heard a giggle from the cart it didnt sound like the amusement of a ponderous unmarriageable daughter he was beginning to take the measure of rovigos attitude to his women in the darkness he found himself grinning alessan said the worthy taccio explained his dilemma to me and when i came to mention that i had just joined the company of menico di ferraut and was bound this way for the festival he charged me to seek you out and carry verbal confirmation of a letter he says hes had conveyed to you half a dozen letters rovigo groaned to it then your verbal confirmation friend alessan good taccio bade me tell you and to swear it as true by the triads grace and the three fingers of the palm alessans voice became a flawless parody of a sententious stage messenger that did the new bed not arrive from astibar before the winter frosts the dragon that slumbers uneasily by his side would awaken in wrath unimaginable and put a violent end to his life of care in your esteemed service there was laughter and applause from the shadows of the cart the mother devin decided pursuing his earlier thought didnt sound even remotely shrewish eanna and adaon who bless marriages together forfend that such a thing should ever come to pass rovigo said piously the bed is ordered and it is made and it is ready to be shipped immediately the festival is over then the dragon shall slumber at ease and taccio be saved alessan intoned assuming the sonorous voice used for the moral at the end of a childrens puppetshow though why came a mild stillamused female voice from the cart all of you should be so intimidated by poor ingonida i honestly dont know rovigo are we bereft entirely of our manners tonight will we keep these people standing in the cold and dark absolutely not my beloved her husband exclaimed hastily alix it was only the conjured vision of ingonida in wrath that addled my brain devin found that he couldnt stop grinning even catriana he noticed had relaxed her habitual expression of superior indifference were you going back to town rovigo asked the first tricky moment and alessan left it to him we were devin said wed taken a long walk to clear our heads and escape the noise but were just about ready to brave the city again i imagine the three of you would have been besieged by admirers all night rovigo said we do seem to have achieved a certain notoriety alessan admitted well said rovigo earnestly all jesting aside i could well understand if you wanted to rejoin the celebrations they were nowhere near their peak when we left it will go on all night of course but i confess i dont like leaving the younger ones alone too late and my unfortunate oldest alais suffers from twitches and fainting spells when overexcited how sad said alessan with a straight face father came a softly urgent protest from the cart rovigo stop that at once or i shall empty a basin on you in your sleep her mother declared though not devin judged with any genuine anger you see the way of things the merchant said gesturing expressively with his free hand i am hounded without respite even into my dreams but if you are not entirely put off by the grievous stridency of my women and the prospect of three more inside very nearly as unpleasant you are all most welcome most humbly welcome to share a late repast and a quieter drink than you are likely to find in astibar tonight and three beds if you care to honor us alix added we heard you play and sing this morning at the dukes rites truly it would be an honor if you joined us you were in the palace devin asked surprised hardly rovigo murmured in a selfdeprecating tone we were in the street outside among the crowd he hesitated sandre dastibar was a man i greatly honored and admired the sandreni lands are just east of my own small holding you have been walking by their woods even now he was an easyenough neighbor to the very end i wanted to hear his mourning sung and when i learned that my newest young friends company had been selected to perform the rites well will you come in with us this time devin left it to alessan who said still highly amused his teeth flashing white in the darkness we could not dream of refusing an offer so gracious it will allow us to toast the safe journey of taccios new bed and the restful slumbers of his dragon oh poor ingonida said alix from the cart trying unsuccessfully not to laugh you are all so unfair inside there was light and warmth and continuing laughter there were also three undeniably attractive young women whose names flew past devin amid screams and blushes much too fast to be caught the oldest of these three though about seventeen he guessed had a musical lilt to her voice and an exceptionally flirtatious glance alais was different in the light of the hallway of her home the merchants oldest daughter turned out to be small and grave and slender she had long very straight black hair and eyes of the mildest shade of blue devin could remember seeing beside her catrianas own blue gaze looked more challenging than ever and her tumbling red hair resembled nothing so much as the mane of a lioness they were ushered by insistent female hands and voices into immensely comfortable chairs in a sittingroom furnished in shades of green and gold a huge country fire blazed on the hearth repudiating the autumn chill a large carpet in a design that was unmistakably quileian even to devins untutored eye covered the floor the seventeenyearold selvena it emerged sank gracefully down upon it at devins feet she looked up at him and smiled he received and chose to ignore a quick sardonic glance from catriana as she took a seat nearer to the fire alais was elsewhere for the moment helping her mother just then rovigo reappeared flushed and triumphant from some back room carrying three bottles i hope he said beaming down upon them that you all have a taste for astibars blue wine and for devin that simple question cast an entirely benevolent aura of fate over his impulsive action in the darkness outside he glanced over at alessan and was rewarded with an odd smile that seemed to him to acknowledge many things rovigo quickly began uncorking and pouring the wine if any of my wretched females are bothering you he said over his shoulder feel free to swat them away like cats a curl of blue smoke could be seen rising from each glass selvena settled her gown more becomingly about her on the carpet ignoring her fathers gibe with an ease that bespoke long familiarity with this sort of thing her mother neat trim competent a laughably far cry from rovigos description in the bird came in with alais and an elderly household servant in a very short while a sideboard was covered with a remarkable variety of food devin accepted a glass from rovigo savoring the icyclean bouquet he leaned back in his chair and prepared to be extremely content for the next little while selvena rose at a glance from her mother but only to fill a plate of food for devin she brought it back to him smiling and settled on the carpet again marginally nearer than before alais served alessan and catriana while the two youngest daughters sank down on the floor by their father he aimed a mockferocious cuff at each of them devin doubted if hed ever seen a man so obviously happy to be where he was it must have shown in the amused irony of his glance for rovigo catching the look shrugged daughters he lamented sorrowfully shaking his head ponderous cartwheels devin reminded him looking pointedly at the merchants wife rovigo winced alix laughterlines crinkling at her temples had overheard the exchange he did it again did he she said tilting her head to one side let me guess i was of elephantine proportions and formidably evil disposition and the four girls had scarcely enough good features among them to make up one passably acceptable woman am i right laughing aloud devin turned to see rovigo not at all discomfited beaming with pride at his wife exactly right devin said to alix but i must say in his defense that ive never heard anyone give such a description so happily he was rewarded with alixs quick laughter and a wonderfully grave smile over her shoulder from alais busy at the sideboard rovigo raised his glass moving it in small circles to make a pattern in the air with the icy smoke will you join me in drinking to the memory of our duke and to the glory of music i dont believe in making idle toasts with blue wine nor do i alessan said quietly he lifted his own glass to memory he said very deliberately to sandre dastibar to music then he added something else under his breath before sipping from the wine devin drank tasting for only the third or fourth time in his life the astonishingly rich cold complexity of astibars blue wine there was nothing like it anywhere else in the palm and its price reflected that fact he looked over and saluted rovigo with his glass to all of you catriana said suddenly to kindness on a dark road she smiled a smile without any edge or mockery to it devin was surprised then decided it was unfair for him to feel that way not on the road im on shed said in the sandreni palace and that was something he could understand now for he too was on that road after all despite what shed done to keep him from it he tried to catch her eye but failed she was talking to alix now seated beside her briefly reflective devin turned his attention to his food a moment later selvena touched his foot lightly will you sing for us she asked with a delicious smile she didnt move her hand alais heard you and my parents but the rest of us have been here all day selvena mother and older sister snapped the name together selvena flinched as if struck but devin noticed it was to her father that she turned biting her lip he was looking at her soberly dear heart he said in a voice far removed from the raillery of before you have a lesson to learn our friends make music for their livelihood they are our guests here tonight one does not light of my life ask guests to work in ones home selvenas eyes brimmed with tears she lowered her head in the same serious tone rovigo said to devin will you accept an apology she meant it in good faith i can assure you of that i know she did devin protested as selvena sniffled softly at his feet there is no apology needed truly none alessan added setting his plate of food aside we make music to live indeed but we also make music because doing so is most truly to live it is not work to play among friends rovigo selvena wiped her eyes and looked up at him gratefully i shall be happy to sing catriana said she glanced briefly at selvena unless of course it was only devin you had in mind devin winced even though the slash had not been directed at him selvena flinched again badly flustered for the second time in as many minutes out of the corner of his eye devin saw an intriguing expression cross alaiss face selvena began protesting earnestly that of course shed meant all three of them alessan seemed amused by the entire exchange devin had a sudden intuition looking at him that this relaxed sociable man was at least as close to the center of the prince of tigana as was the arrogantly precise figure hed seen in the forest cabin he escapes this way he thought suddenly and even as the idea entered his mind he knew that it was true he had heard the man play the lament for adaon well said rovigo smiling at catriana if you are gracious enough to indulge a shameless child i blush to acknowledge as my own it happens that i do have a set of tregean pipes in the house the triad alone know why i seem to remember once having a doting fathers fancy that one of these creatures might emerge with a talent of some sort alix from several feet away mimed a blow with a spoon at her husband unabashed his good spirits restored rovigo sent the youngest girl off to fetch the pipes while he set about refilling everyones glass devin caught alais looking at him from the seat shed taken next to the fire reflexively he smiled at her she didnt smile back but her gaze mild and serious did not break away he felt a small unsettling skip to the rhythm of his heart as it turned out after the meal was over he and catriana sang for better than an hour to alessans pipes part of the way through as they began one of the rousing old certandan highland ballads rovigo left briefly and returned with a linked pair of senzian drums shyly at first very softly he joined in on the refrain proving as competent at that as at everything else devin had seen him do catriana favored him with a particularly dazzling smile rovigo needed no further encouragement to stay with them on the next song and the next no man devin found himself thinking should need more encouragement to do anything in the world than that look from those blue eyes not that catriana had ever favored him with anything remotely resembling such a glance he found himself feeling somewhat confused all of a sudden someone alais evidently had filled his glass a third time he drank a little more quickly than was good for him given the legendary potency of blue wine and then he led the other three into the next number the last one for the two younger girls alix ruled over protests he couldnt sing of tigana and he was certainly not about to sing of passion or love so he began the very old song of eannas making the stars and committing the name of every single one of them to her memory so that nothing might ever be lost or forgotten in the deeps of space or time it was the closest he could come to what the night had meant to him to why in the end he had made the choice he had as he began it he received a look from alessan thoughtful and knowing and a quick enigmatic glance from catriana as they joined with him rovigos drums fell silent this time as the merchant listened devin saw alais her black hair backlit by the fire watching him with grave concentration he sang one whole verse directly to her then in fidelity to the song he sent his vision inward to where his purest music was always found and he looked at no one at all as he sang to eanna herself a hymn to names and the naming of things somewhere part of the way through he had a bright image in his mind of a bluewhite star named micaela aloft in a black night and he let the keenness of that carry him high and soaring up toward catrianas harmony and then back down softly to an end in the quiet of the mood so shaped selvena and the two younger girls went to bed with surprising tranquility a few moments later alix rose as well and so to devins disappointment did alais in the doorway she turned and looked at catriana you must be very tired rovigos daughter said if you like i can show you your room now i hope you dont mind sharing with me selvena usually does but shes in with the girls tonight devin expected catriana to demur or worse at this fairly transparent separation of the women and the men she surprised him again though hesitating only a second before rising i am tired and i dont mind sharing at all she said it will remind me of home devin who had been smiling at the irony of the situation suddenly found the expression less appropriate than hed thought catriana had seen him grinning though he wished abruptly that she hadnt she was sure to misunderstand it occurred to him with a genuine sense of unreality that they had made love together that morning for some time after the women had gone the three men sat in silence each lost in his own thoughts rovigo rose at length and refilled their glasses with the last of the wine he put another log on the fire and watched until it caught with a sigh he sank back into his chair toying with his glass he looked from one to the other of his guests it was alessan who broke the silence though devins a friend he said quietly we can talk rovigo though i fear hes about to be extremely angry with both of us devin sat up abruptly and put aside his glass rovigo a wry expression playing about his lips glanced briefly over at him and then returned alessans gaze tranquilly i wondered he said though i suspected he might be with us now given the circumstances alessan was smiling too they both turned to devin who felt himself going red his brain raced frantically back over the events of the day before he glared at rovigo you didnt find me in the bird by accident alessan sent you you had him follow me didnt you he accused turning to the prince the two men exchanged another glance before alessan replied i did he admitted i had a certain suspicion that there would be funeral rites for sandre dastibar coming up and that we might be asked to audition i couldnt afford to lose track of you devin im afraid i was behind you most of the way down the street of the temples yesterday rovigo added he had the grace to look embarrassed devin noted he was still furious though and very confused you lied about the bird then all that talk about going there whenever you came back from a journey no that part was true rovigo said everything i said was true devin once you were forced down to the waterfront you happened to end up in a place i know very well and catriana devin pursued angrily what about her how did she i paid a boy to run a message back to your inn when i saw that old goro was letting you stay inside the bird devin dont be angry there was a purpose to all of this there was alessan echoed you should understand some of it by now the whole reason catriana and i were in astibar with menicos troupe was because of what i expected to see happen with sandres death wait a minute devin exclaimed expected how did you know he was going to die rovigo told me alessan said simply he let a small silence register he has been my contact in astibar for nine years now i formed the same impression of him back then that you did yesterday and about as quickly devin his mind reeling looked over at the merchant the casual friend hed made the day before who turned out to be not so casual at all rovigo put down his glass i feel the same way about tyrants that you do he said quietly alberico here or brandin of ygrath ruling in chiara and corte and asoli and in that province alessan comes from whose name i cannot hear or remember hard as i might try devin swallowed and duke sandre he asked how did you know i spied on them rovigo said calmly it wasnt hard i used to monitor tomassos comings and goings they were wholly focused on alberico i was their neighbor here in the distrada it was easy enough to slip onto their land i learned of tomassos deception years ago and though i wont say it is a thing i am proud of last year i was outside their windows at the estate and at the lodge on many different nights while they shaped the details of sandres death devin looked quickly over at alessan he opened his mouth to say something then without speaking he closed it alessan nodded thank you he said he turned to rovigo there are one or two things here as there have been before that you are better off not knowing for your own safety and your familys i think you know by now it isnt a matter of trust or any such thing after nine years i think i do know that rovigo murmured what should i know about what happened tonight alberico arrived just after i joined tomasso and the vigilkeepers in the lodge baerd and catriana warned us and i had time to hide with devin who had made his way to the cabin on his own on his own how rovigo asked sharply devin lifted his head i have my own resources he said with dignity out of the corner of his eye he saw alessan grin and he suddenly felt ridiculous sheepishly he added i overhead the sandreni talking upstairs between the two sessions of the mourning rites rovigo looked as if he had another question or three but with a glance at alessan he held them in devin was grateful alessan said when we went back to the cabin afterwards we found the vigilkeepers dead tomasso was taken baerd has remained behind to take care of a number of things by the cabin tonight he will burn it later we passed the barbadians as we left the city rovigo said quietly absorbing this i saw tomasso bar sandre with them i feared for you alessan with some cause alessan said drily there was an informer there the boy herado giannos son was in the service of alberico rovigos face registered shock family morian damn him to darkness for that he rasped harshly how could he do such a thing alessan gave his small characteristic shrug a great deal has broken down since the tyrants came would you not say there was a silence as rovigo fought to master his shock and rage devin coughed nervously and broke it your own family he asked do they they know nothing of this the merchant said regaining his calm neither alix nor any of the girls had ever seen alessan or catriana before tonight i met alessan and baerd in tregea town nine years ago and we discovered in the course of a long night that we had certain dreams and certain enemies in common the told me something of what their purposes were and i told them i was willing to assist in those pursuits as best i could without unduly endangering my wife or daughters i have tried to do that i will continue to try it is my hope to live long enough to be able to hear the oath alessan offers when he drinks blue wine he spoke the last words quietly but with obvious passion devin looked at the prince remembering the inaudible words he had murmured under his breath before he drank alessan gazed steadily at rovigo there is one other thing you should know devin is one of us in more than the obvious way i learned that by accident yesterday afternoon he too was born in my own province before it fell which is why he is here rovigo said nothing what is the oath devin asked and then more diffidently is it something that i should know not as anything that matters in the scheme of things i only spoke a prayer of my own alessans voice was careful and very clear i always do i said tigana let my memory of you be like a blade in my soul devin closed his eyes the words and the voice no one spoke devin opened his eyes and looked at rovigo whose brow was knotted in fierce angry consternation my friend devin should understand this alessan said to him gently it is a part of the legacy he has taken on what did you hear me say rovigo gestured with helpless frustration the same thing i heard the first time this happened that night nine years ago when we switched to blue wine i heard you ask that the memory of something be a blade in you in your soul but i didnt hear ive lost the beginning again the something tigana alessan said again tenderly clear as chiming crystal but devin saw rovigos expression grow even more baffled and dismayed the merchant reached for his glass and drained it will you one more time tigana devin said before alessan could speak to make this legacy this grief at the heart of things more truly his own as properly it was his own for the land was his or it had been and its name was part of his own and they were both lost taken away let my memory of you be like a blade in my soul he said his voice faltering at the end though he tried hard to keep it as steady as alessans had been wondering disoriented visibly distressed rovigo shook his head and brandins magic is behind this he asked it is alessan said flatly after a moment rovigo sighed and leaned back in his chair i am sorry he said softly forgive me both of you i should not have asked i have opened a wound i was the one who asked devin said quickly the wound is always open said alessan a moment later there was an extraordinary compassion in rovigos face it was difficult to realize that this was the same man who had been jesting about senzian rustics as husbands for his daughters the merchant rose abruptly and became busy tending to the fire again though the blaze was doing perfectly well while he did so devin looked at alessan the other man met his gaze they said nothing though alessans eyebrows lifted a little and he gave the small shrug devin had come to know what do we do now then asked rovigo dastibar returning to stand beside his chair his color was high perhaps from the fire i am as disturbed by this as i was when we first met i do not like magic especially this kind of magic it remains a matter of some significance to me to be able to hear one day what i was just debarred from hearing devin felt a rush of excitement run through him again the other element to his feelings this evening his pique at having been deceived in the bird was entirely gone these two and baerd and the duke were men to be reckoned with in every possible way and they were shaping plans that might change the map of the palm of the whole world and he was here with them he was one of them chasing a dream of freedom he took a long drink of his blue wine alessans expression was troubled though he looked suddenly as if he were burdened with a new and difficult weight he leaned slowly back in his chair his hand going through the tangle of his hair as he looked at rovigo in silence for a long time turning from one man to the other devin felt abruptly lost again his excitement fading almost as quickly as it had come rovigo have we not involved you enough already alessan asked at length i must admit this has become harder for me now that i have met your wife and daughters this coming year may see a change in things and i cannot even begin to tell you how much more danger four men died in that cabin tonight and i think you know as well as i do how many will be deathwheeled in astibar in the weeks to come it has been one thing for you to keep an ear open here and on your travels to quietly monitor albericos doings and sandres for you and baerd and i to meet every so often and touch palms and talk friend to friend but the shape of the tale is changing now and i greatly fear to put you in danger rovigo nodded i thought you might say something like that i am grateful for your concern but alessan i made up my mind on this a long time ago i would not expect that freedom could be found or won without a price paid you said three days ago that the coming spring might mark a turningpoint for all of us if there are ways that i can help in the days to come you must tell me he hesitated then one of the reasons i love my wife is that alix would echo this were she with us and did she know alessans expression was still troubled but she isnt with us and she doesnt know he said there have been reasons for that and there will be more of them after tonight and your girls how can i ask you to endanger them how can you decide for me or them rovigo replied softly but without hesitation where is our choice our freedom if you do that i would obviously prefer not to do anything that will put them into actual danger and i cannot afford to suspend my business entirely but within these confines is there no aid i can offer that will make a difference finally understanding the source of alessans doubts devin kept grimly silent this was something to which he had attached no weight at all while alessan had been wrestling with it all along he felt chastened and sobered and afraid now though not for himself there will be people put at risk by everything we do the prince had said in the forest speaking of menico and now devin was beginning to understand painfully the reality of that he didnt want these people hurt in any way at all his excitement quite gone devin had driven home for him for the first time this one among the many ancillary sorrows that lay on the road he seemed to have found he was brought facetoface with the distance that road imposed between them and it now seemed almost everyone they might meet even friends even people who might share a part or all of their dream he thought of catriana in the palace again and he understood her even more now than he had an hour ago watching letting the growth of wisdom guide him into silence devin focused on alessans momentarily unguarded face and he saw him come hard to his decision he watched as the prince took a deep slow breath and so shouldered another burden that was the price of his blood alessan smiled an odd rueful smile actually there is he said to rovigo there is something you can do now that will help he hesitated then unexpectedly the smile deepened and it reached his eyes had you ever given any thought he said in an elaborately casual voice to taking on some business partners for just a moment rovigo seemed nonplussed then a quick answering smile of understanding broadened across his face i see he said you need access to some places alessan nodded that and there are more of us now as well devin is with us and there may be others before spring things will be different from the years when it was only baerd and i i have been giving thought to this since catriana joined us his voice quickened grew crisper devin remembered this tone from the cabin this was the man hed first seen there alessan said in business together you and i will have a more legitimate means of exchanging information and im going to need information regularly this winter as partners we have reason to be writing each other about any affairs that touch on trade and of course all affairs touch on trade indeed they do said rovigo his eyes intent on alessans face we can communicate directly if you have resources for that or through taccio in ferraut he glanced over at devin i know taccio by the way that wasnt a coincidence either i assume youd figured that out devin hadnt even thought about it actually but before he could speak alessan had turned back to rovigo i assume you have a courier service you can trust rovigo nodded alessan said you see the newest problem is that although we could still travel as musicians after this mornings performance wed be notorious wherever we went had i thought about it in time id have botched the music a little or told devin to be a little less impressive no you wouldnt have devin said quietly whatever other things you would have done ruining the music isnt one of them alessans mouth quirked as he acknowledged the hit rovigo smiled perhaps so the prince murmured it was special wasnt it there was a brief silence rovigo got up and put one more log on the fire alessan said it all makes sense there are certain places and certain activities that would be awkward for us as performers especially wellknown performers as merchants we would have a new access to such places certain islands perhaps rovigo asked quietly from by the fire perhaps alessan agreed if it comes to that though there it may be a matter of five of one hand five of the other artists are welcome at brandins court on chiara this gives us another option though and i like having options to work with it has been necessary once or twice for a character ive assumed to disappear or die his voice was quiet matteroffact he took a sip of his wine after a moment he turned back to rovigo who was now stroking his chin in a fine imitation of a shrewdly avaricious businessman well the merchant said in a greedy wheedling voice you appear to have made a most intriguing proposal gentlemen i do have to ask one or two preliminary questions ive known alessan for some time but this particular issue has never come up before you understand his eyes narrowed with exaggerated cunning what if anything do you know about business alessan gave a sudden burst of laughter then quickly grew serious again have you any money to hand he asked ive my ship just in rovigo replied cash from two days transactions and easy credit based on profits over the next few weeks why i would suggest buying a reasonable but not indiscreet amount of grain in the next fortyeight hours twentyfour hours actually if you can rovigo looked thoughtful i could do that he said and my means are sufficiently limited that no purchase i made would be large enough to be indiscreet i have a contact too the steward at the nievolene farms by the ferraut border not from nievole alessan said quickly another silence rovigo nodded his head slowly i see he said startling devin again with his quickness you think we can expect some confiscation after the festival you can alessan said among all the other even less pleasant things have you another source for buying up grain i might rovigo looked from alessan to devin and back again four partners then he said crisply the three of you and baerd is that right alessan nodded almost right but make it five partners there is one other person who should be brought in to divide our share if that is all right with you why should it not be rovigo shrugged that doesnt touch my share at all will i meet this person i hope so sooner or later said alessan i expect you will be happy with each other fine rovigo said crisply the usual terms for a contraina association are twothirds to the one investing the funds and one third to the ones who do the traveling and put in the time based on what you have just told me i will accept that you are likely to be able to offer information which will be of real value to our venture i propose a half interest each way on all affairs were jointly conduct is that acceptable he was looking at devin with as much composure as he could manage devin replied it is quite acceptable it is more than fair alessan agreed his expression was troubled again he looked as if he would go on it is done then said rovigo quickly no more to be said alessan we will go into town tomorrow to have the contraina formally drawn up and sealed which way do you plan to go after the festival ferraut i think said alessan slowly we can discuss what comes after but i have something to do there and an idea for some trade with senzio we might want to consider ferraut said rovigo ignoring the latter remarks a smile slowly widened across his face ferraut that is splendid absolutely splendid you can save us some money already ill give you a cart and all of you can take ingonida her new bed on the way upstairs alais couldnt remember when she had last been so happy not that she was prone to moodiness like selvena but life at home tended to be very quiet especially when her father was away and now so many things seemed to be happening at once rovigo was home after a longer trip than usual down the coast alix and alais were never at ease when he ventured south of the mountains into quileia no matter how many times he reassured them of his caution and on top of that this trip had come unsettlingly late in the season of autumn winds but he was home now and palm to palm with his return had come the festival of vines it was her second one and alais had loved every moment of the day and night absorbing with her wide alert eyes all she saw drinking it in in the crowded square in front of the sandreni palace that morning she had stood extremely still listening to a clear voice soar from the inner courtyard out among the unnatural silence of the people gathered a voice that lamented adaons death among the cedars of tregea so bitterly so sweetly that alais had been afraid she would cry she had closed her eyes it had been a source of astonished pride for her when rovigo had casually mentioned to her and her mother having had a drink the day before with one of the singers who were doing the dukes mourning rites he had even invited the young man he said to come meet his four ungainly offspring the teasing bothered alais not at all she would have felt that something was wrong by now had rovigo spoken about them in any other way neither she nor her sisters nursed any anxieties about their fathers affection they had only to look at his eyes on the road home late at night already badly unsettled by the thundering clatter of the barbadian soldiers they had made way for at the city walls she had been truly frightened when a voice called out to them from the darkness near their gate then when her father had replied and she came gradually to understand who this was alais had thought her heart would stop from sheer excitement she could feel the telltale color rising in her cheeks when it became clear that the musicians were coming inside it had taken a supreme act of selfcontrol for her to regain the mien and composure proper to her parents oldest most trusted child in the house it became easier because the instant the two male guests stepped through the doorway selvena had gone into her predictable mating frenzy a course of behavior so embarrassingly transparent to her older sister that it drove alais straight back into her own habitual detached watchfulness selvena had been crying herself to sleep for much of the year because it looked more and more as if she would still be unmarried when her eighteenth naming day came in the spring devin the singer was smaller and youngerlooking than shed expected but he was neat and lithe with an easy smile and quick intelligent eyes under sandybrown hair that curled halfway over his ears shed expected him to be arrogant or pretentious despite what her father had said but she saw nothing of that at all the other man alessan looked about fifteen years older perhaps more his black tangled hair was prematurely greying silvering actually at the temples he had a lean expressive face with very clear grey eyes and a wide mouth he intimidated her a little even though he was joking easily with her father right from the start in exactly the manner she knew rovigo most enjoyed perhaps that was it alais thought few people shed met could keep up with her father in jesting or in anything else and this man with the sharp quizzical features appeared to be doing so effortlessly she wondered aware that the thought was more than a little arrogant on her own part how a tregean musician could manage that on the other hand she reflected she didnt know very much about musicians at all which made her even more curious about the woman alais thought catriana was terribly beautiful with her commanding height and the startlingly blue eyes under the blaze of her hair like a second fire in the room she made alais feel small and pale and bland in a curious way that combined with selvenas outrageous flirtation to relax rather than unsettle her this sort of activity competition exercise was simply not something with which she was going to get involved watching closely she saw catriana register selvenas soft flouncing at devins feet and she intercepted the sardonic glance the redhaired singer directed at her fellow musician alais decided to go into the kitchen her mother and menka might need help alix gave her a quick thoughtful glance when she came in but did not comment they quickly put a meal together back in the front room alais helped at the sideboard and then listened and watched from her favorite chair next to the fire later she had genuine cause to bless selvenas shamelessness none of the rest of them would have dreamt of asking their guests to sing this time she could see the singers so she kept her eyes open devin sang directly to her once near the end and alais her color furiously rising forced herself not to look away for the rest of that last song about eanna naming the stars she found her mind straying into channels unusual for her the sort of thing selvena speculated about at night all the time in detail alais hoped they would all attribute her color to the warmth of the fire she did wonder about one thing though having been an observer of people for most of her life there was something between devin and catriana but it certainly wasnt love or even tenderness as she understood either of those things they would look at each other from time to time usually when the other was unaware and the glances would be more challenging than anything else she reminded herself again that the world of these people was farther removed from her own than she could even imagine the younger ones said their good nights selvena doing so with a highly suspicious lack of protest and touching shockingly fingertip to palm with both men in farewell alais caught a glance from her father and a moment later she rose when her mother did it was impulse nothing more that led her to invite catriana to come up with her immediately the words were spoken she realized how they must sound to the other woman someone so independent and obviously at ease in the company of men alais flinched inwardly at her own provincial clumsiness and braced herself for a rebuff catrianas smile though was all graciousness as she stood it will remind me of home she said thinking about that as the two of them went up the stairs past the lamps in their brackets and the wallhangings her grandfather had brought back south from a voyage to khardhun years and years ago alais tried to fathom what would lead a girl her own age to venture out among the rough and tumble of long roads and uncertain lodging of late nights and men who would surely assume that if she was among them she had to be available alais tried but she honestly couldnt grasp it despite that or perhaps because of it something generous in her spirit opened out toward the other woman thank you for the music she said shyly small return for your kindness catriana said lightly not as small as you think alais said our room is over here im glad this reminds you of home i hope it is a good memory that was probing a little but not rudely she hoped she wanted to talk to this woman to be friends to learn what she could about a life so remote from her own they stepped into the large bedroom menka had the fire going already and the two bedspreads turned back the deeppiled quilts were new this autumn more contraband brought back by rovigo from quileia where winters were so much harsher than here catriana laughed a little under her breath her eyebrows arching as she surveyed the chamber sharing a room does this is rather more than i knew in a fishermans cottage alais flushed fearful of having offended but before she could speak catriana turned to her eyes still very wide and said casually tell me will we need to tie your sister down she seems to be in heat and im worried about the two men surviving the night alais went from feeling spoiled and insensitive to redfaced shock in one second then she saw the quick smile on the other womans face and she laughed aloud in a release of anxiety and guilt shes just terrible isnt she shes vowed to kill herself in some dreadfully dramatic way if she isnt married by the festival next year catriana shook her head i knew some girls like her at home ive met a few on the road too ive never been able to understand it nor i said alais a little too quickly catriana glanced at her alais ventured a hesitant smile i guess thats a thing we have in common one thing the other woman said indifferently turning away she strolled over to one of the woven pieces on the wall this is nice enough she said fingering it where did your father find it i made it alais said shortly she felt patronized suddenly and it irritated her it must have shown in her voice for catriana looked quickly back over her shoulder the two women exchanged a look in silence catriana sighed im hard to make friends with she said at length i doubt its worth your effort no effort said alais quietly besides she ventured i may need your help tying selvena down later surprised catriana chuckled shell be all right she said sitting on one of the beds neither of them will touch her while they are guests in your fathers house even if she slithers into their room wearing nothing but a single red glove shocked for the second time but finding the sensation oddly enjoyable alais giggled and sat down on her own bed dangling her legs over the side catrianas feet she noticed ruefully easily reached the carpet she just might do that she whispered grinning at the image i think she even has a red glove hidden somewhere catriana shook her head then its roping her down like a heifer or trusting the men i guess but as i say they wont do anything you know them very well i suppose alais hazarded she still wasnt sure whether any given remark would earn her a rebuff or elicit a smile this was not she was discovering an easy woman to deal with alessan i know better catriana said but devins been on the road a long time and i have no doubt he knows the rules she glanced away briefly as she said that last her own color a little high still wary of another rejection alais said cautiously i have no idea about that actually are there rules do any of them do you have problems when you travel catriana shrugged the kind of problems your sisters longing to find not from the musicians theres an unwritten code or else the companies would only get a certain kind of woman to tour and that would hurt the music and the music really does matter to most of the troupes the ones that last anyway men can be quite badly hurt for bothering a girl too much certainly theyll never find work if it happens too often i see said alais trying to imagine it you are expected to pair off with someone though catriana added as if its the least you can do remove yourself as a temptation so you find a man you like or some of the girls find a woman of course theres a fair bit of that too oh said alais clasping her hands in her lap catriana who was really much too clever by half flashed a glance of mingled amusement and malice dont worry she said sweetly looking pointedly at where alaiss hands had settled like a barrier that glove doesnt fit me abruptly alais put her hands to either side of her blushing furiously i wasnt particularly worried she said trying to sound casual then goaded by the others mocking expression she shot back what glove does fit you then the other womans amusement quickly disappeared there was a small silence then you do have some spirit in you after all catriana said judiciously i wasnt sure that said alais moved to a rare anger is patronizing how would you be sure of anything about me and why would i let you see it again there was a silence and again catriana surprised her im sorry she said truly im really not very good at this i warned you she looked away as it happens you hit a nerve and i tend to lash out when that occurs alaiss anger as quick to recede as it was slow to kindle was gone even as the other woman spoke this was she reminded herself sternly a guest in her house she had no immediate chance to reply though or to try to mend the rift because just then menka bustled importantly into the room with a basin of water heated over the kitchen fire followed by the youngest of rovigos apprentices with a second basin and towels draped over both his shoulders the boys eyes were desperately cast downwards in a room containing two women as he carried the basin and the towels carefully over to the table by the window the garrulous fuss menka inevitably stirred up wherever she went broke the mood entirely both the good and the bad parts of it alais thought after the two servants left the women washed up in silence alais stealing a glance at the others longlimbed body felt even more inadequate in her own small white softness and the sheltered life shed lived she climbed into bed feeling as if shed like to begin the whole conversation over again good night she said good night catriana replied after a moment alais tried to read an invitation to further conversation in her tone but she wasnt sure if catriana wanted to talk she decided she had only to say something they blew out their bedside candles and lay silently in the semidarkness alais watched the red glow of the fire curled her toes around the hot brick menka had put at the foot of her bed and thought ruefully that the distance to selvenas side of the room had never seemed so great sometime later still unsleeping though the fire was down to its embers she heard a burst of hilarity from the three men downstairs the warm carrying sound of her fathers laughter somehow worked its way into her and eased her distress he was home she felt sheltered and safe alais smiled to herself in the darkness she heard the men come upstairs soon after and go to their separate rooms she remained awake for a while with an ear perked to catch the sound of her sister in the hallway though she didnt really believe even selvena would do that she heard nothing and eventually she fell asleep she dreamt of lying on a hilltop in a strange place of a man there with her lowering himself upon her a mild moonless night glittering with stars she lay with him upon that windy height amid a scattering of dewdrenched summer flowers and in the high unknown place of that dreaming alais was filled with complex yearnings she could never have named aloud it was bitterly cold in the dungeon where they had thrown him at last the stones were damp and icy they smelled of urine and feces hed only been allowed to put back on his linen underclothing and his hose there were rats in the cell he couldnt see them in the blackness but he had been able to hear them from the beginning and hed been bitten twice already as he dozed earlier he had been naked the new captain of the guard the replacement for the one whod killed himself had permitted his men to play with their prisoner before locking him up for the night they all knew tomassos reputation everyone knew his reputation he had made sure of that it had been part of the plan so the guards had stripped him in the harsh brightness of the guardroom and they had amused themselves coarsely pricking him with their swords or with the heated poker from the fire sliding them around his flaccid sex prodding him in the buttocks or the belly bound and helpless tomasso had wanted only to close his eyes and wish it all away for some reason it was the memory of taeri that wouldnt let him do that he still couldnt believe his younger brother was dead or that taeri had been so brave and so decisive at the end it made him want to cry thinking about it but he was not going to let the barbadians see that he was a sandreni which seemed to mean more to him now naked and near the end than it ever had before so he kept his eyes open and he fixed them bleakly on the new captain he did his best to ignore the things they were doing to him and the sniggering brutal suggestions as to what would happen tomorrow they werent very imaginative actually he knew the mornings reality was going to be worse intolerably worse they hurt him a little with their blades and drew blood a few times but nothing very much tomasso knew they were under orders to save him for the professionals in the morning alberico would be present then as well this was just play eventually the captain grew tired of tomassos steady gaze or else he decided that there was enough blood flowing down the prisoners legs puddling on the floor he ordered his men to stop tomassos bonds were cut and they gave him back his undergarments and a filthy pestinfested strip of blanket and they took him down the stairs to the dungeons of astibar and they threw him into the blackness of one of them the entrance was so low that even on his knees hed scraped his head on the stone when they pushed him in more blood he realized as his hand came away sticky it didnt actually seem to matter very much he hated the rats though hed always been afraid of rats he rolled the useless blanket as tightly as he could and tried to use it as a feeble club it was hard though in the dark tomasso wished he were a physically braver man he knew what was coming in the morning and the thought now that he was alone turned his bowels to jelly he heard a sound and realized a moment later that he was whimpering he fought to keep control of himself he was alone though and in freezing darkness in the hands of his enemies and there were rats he couldnt entirely keep the sounds from coming he felt as if his heart was broken as if it lay in jagged pieces at odd angles in his breast among the fragments he tried to assemble a curse for herado and his betrayal but nothing seemed equal to what his nephew had done nothing seemed large enough to encompass it he heard another rat and lashed out blindly with his rolled weapon he hit something and heard a squeal again and again he pounded at the place of that sound he thought he had killed it one of them he was trembling but the frenzy of activity seemed to help him fight back his weakness he didnt weep any more he leaned back against the damp slime of the stone wall wincing because of his open cuts he closed his eyes though he couldnt see in any case and he thought of sunlight it was then that he must have dozed because he woke suddenly with a shout of pain one of the rats had bitten viciously at his thigh he flailed about with the blanket for a few moments but he was shivering now and beginning to feel genuinely ill his mouth was swollen and pulpy from albericos blow in the cabin he found it painful to swallow he felt his forehead and decided he was feverish which is why when he saw the wan light of a candle he was sure he was hallucinating he was able to look around though by its glow the cell was tiny there was a dead rat near his right leg and there were two more living ones big as cats near the door he saw on the wall beside him a scratchedout image of the sun with notches for days cut into the rim it had the saddest face tomasso could ever remember seeing he looked at it for a long time then he looked back towards the glowing light and realized with certainty that this was a hallucination or a dream his father was holding the candle dressed in the bluesilver robe of his burial looking down with an expression different from any tomasso could ever remember seeing on his face the fever must be extreme he decided his mind was conjuring forth in this abyss an image of something his shattered heart so desperately desired a look of kindness and even if one wanted to reach for the word even of love in the eyes of the man whod whipped him as a child and then designated him as useful for two decades of plotting against a tyrant which had ended tonight which would truly end most horribly for tomasso in the morning amid pain he didnt even have the capacity to imagine he liked this dream though this feverinduced fantasy there was light in it it kept the rats away it even seemed to ease the bonenumbing cold of the wet stones beneath him and against his back he lifted an unsteady hand towards the flame through a dry throat and torn puffy lips he croaked something what he wanted to say was im sorry to the dreamimage of his father but he couldnt make the words come right this was a dream though his dream and the image of sandre seemed to understand you have nothing to be sorry for tomasso heard his dreamfather say so gently it was my fault and only mine through all those years and at the end i knew giannos limitations from the start i had too many hopes for you as a child it affected me too much after the candle seemed to waver a little a part of tomasso a corner of his heart seemed to be knitting itself slowly back together even though this was only a dream only his own longing a last feeble fantasy of being loved before they flayed him will you let me tell you how sorry i am for the folly that has condemned you to this will you hear me if i tell you i have been proud of you in my fashion tomasso let himself weep the words were balm for the deepest ache he knew crying made the light blur and swim though and so he raised his shaking hands and kept trying to wipe the tears away he wanted to speak but his shattered mouth could not form words he nodded his head though over and over then he had a thought and he raised his left hand the heart hand of oaths and fidelity toward this dream of his dead fathers ghost and slowly sandres hand came down as if from a long long way off from years and years away seasons lost and forgotten in the turning of time and pride and father and son touched fingertips together it was a more solid contact than tomasso had thought it would be he closed his eyes for a moment yielding to the intensity of his feelings when he opened them his fathers image seemed to be holding something out towards him a vial of some liquid tomasso did not understand this is the last thing i can do for you the ghost said in a strange unexpectedly wistful voice if i were stronger i could do more but at least they will not hurt you in the morning now they will not hurt you any more my son drink it tomasso drink it and this will all be gone all go away i promise you then wait for me tomasso wait if you can in morians halls i would like to walk with you there tomasso still did not understand but the tone was so mild so reassuring he took the dreamvial again it was more substantial than hed expected it to be his father nodded encouragement with trembling hands tomasso fumbled and removed the stopper then with a last gesture a final mocking parody of himself he raised it in a wide sweeping elaborate salute to his own powers of fantasy and he drained it to the dregs which were bitter his fathers smile was so sad smiles are not supposed to be sad tomasso wanted to say he had said that to a boy once in a temple of morian at night in a room where he was not supposed to be his head felt heavy he felt as if he were about to fall asleep even though he already was asleep and dreaming in his fever he really didnt understand he especially didnt understand why his father who was dead should ask him to wait in morians halls he looked up again wanting to ask about that his vision seemed to be going completely strange on him though he knew this was so because the image of his father looking down upon him seemed to be crying there were tears in his fathers eyes which was impossible even in a dream farewell he heard farewell he tried to say in return he wasnt sure if hed actually managed to form the word or if hed only thought it but just then a darkness more encompassing than he had ever known came down over him like a blanket or a mantle and the difference between the spoken and the unspoken ceased to matter anymore part two dianora chapter dianora could remember the day she came to the island the air that autumn morning had been much like it was today at the beginning of spring white clouds scudding in a high blue sky as the wind had swept the tribute ship through the whitecaps into the harbor of chiara beyond harbor and town the slopes mounting to the hills had been wild with fall colors the leaves were turning red and gold and some that clung yet to green she remembered the sails of the tribute ship so long ago had been red and gold as well colors of celebration in ygrath she knew that now she hadnt known it then she had stood on the forward deck of the ship to gaze for the first time at the splendor of chiaras harbor at the long pier where the grand dukes used to stand to throw a ring into the sea and from where letizia had leaped in the first of the ring dives to reclaim the ring from the waters and marry her duke turning the dives into the luck and symbol of chiaras pride until beautiful onestra had changed the ending of the story hundreds and hundreds of years ago and the ring dives had ceased even so every child in the palm knew that legend of the island young girls in each province would play at diving into water for a ring and rising in triumph with their hair shining wet to wed a duke of power and glory from near the prow of the tribute ship dianora had looked up beyond the harbor and palace to gaze at the majesty of snowcrowned sangarios rising behind them the ygrathen sailors had not disturbed her silence they had allowed her to come forward to watch the island approach once shed been safely aboard ship and the ship away to sea theyd been kind to her women thought to have a real chance at being chosen for the saishan were always treated well on the tribute ships it could make a captains fortune in brandins court if he brought home a hostage who became a favorite of the tyrant sitting now on the southern balcony of the saishan wing looking out from behind the ornately crafted screen that hid the women from gawkers in the square below dianora watched the banners of chiara and ygrath flap in the freshening spring breeze and she remembered how the wind had blown her hair about her face more than twelve years ago she remembered looking from the bright sails to the slopes of the treeclad hills running up to sangarios from the blue and white of the sea to the clouds in the blue sky from the tumult and chaos of life in the harbor to the serene grandeur of the palace just beyond birds had been wheeling crying loudly about the three high masts of the tribute ship the rising sun had been a dazzle of light striking along the sea from the east so much vibrancy in the world so rich and fair and shining a morning to be alive twelve years ago and more she had been twentyone years old and nursing her hatred and her secret like two of morians three snakes twining about her heart she had been chosen for the saishan the circumstances of her taking had made it very likely and brandins celebrated grey eyes had widened appraisingly when she was led before him two days later shed been wearing a silken palecolored gown she remembered chosen to set off her dark hair and the dark brown of her eyes she had been certain she would be chosen shed felt neither triumph nor fear even though shed been pointing her life toward that moment for five full years even though in that instant of brandins choosing walls and screens and corridors closed around her that would define the rest of her days shed had her hatred and her secret and guarding the two of them left no room for anything else or so shed thought at twentyone for all shed seen and lived through even by then dianora reflected twelve years later on her balcony shed known very little dangerously little about a great many things that mattered far too much even out of the wind it was cool here on the balcony the ember days were upon them but the flowers were just beginning in the valleys inland and on the hill slopes and the true onset of spring was some time off even this far north it had been different at home dianora remembered sometimes there would still be snow in the southern highlands when the springtime ember days had come and passed without looking backwards dianora raised a hand in a moment the castrate had brought her a steaming mug of tregean khav trade restrictions and tariffs brandin was fond of saying in private had to be handled selectively or life could be too acutely marred khav was one of the selected things only in the palace of course outside the walls they drank the inferior products of corte or neutral senzio once a group of senzian khav merchants had come as part of a trade embassy to try to persuade him of improvements in the crop they grew and the cup it brewed neutral indeed brandin had said judiciously tasting so neutral it hardly seems to be there the merchants had withdrawn consternated and pale desperately seeking to divine the hidden meaning in the ygrathen tyrants words senzians spent much of their time doing that dianora had observed drily to brandin afterward hed laughed shed always been able to amuse him even in the days when she was too young and inexperienced to do it deliberately which thought reminded her of the young castrate attending her this morning scelto was in town collecting her gown for the reception that afternoon her attendant was one of the newest castrates sent out from ygrath to serve the growing saishan in the colony he was well trained already vencels methods might be harsh but there was no denying that they worked she decided not to tell the boy that the khav wasnt strong enough he would very probably fall to pieces which would be inconvenient shed mention it to scelto and let him handle the matter there was no need for vencel to know it was useful to have some of the castrates grateful to her as well as afraid the fear came automatically a function of who she was here in the saishan gratitude or affection she had to work at twelve years and more this spring she thought again leaning forward to look down through the screen at the bustling preparations in the square for the arrival of isolla of ygrath later that day at twentyone shed been at the peak she supposed of whatever beauty shed been granted shed had nothing of such grace at fifteen and sixteen she remembered they hadnt even bothered to hide her from the ygrathen soldiers at home at nineteen shed begun to be something else entirely though by then she wasnt at home and ygrath was no danger to the residents of barbadianruled certando or not normally she amended reminding herself though this was not by any means a thing that really needed a reminder that she was dianora di certando here in the saishan and across in the west wing as well in brandins bed she was thirtythree years old and somehow with the years that had slipped away so absurdly fast she was one of the powers of this palace which of course meant of the palm in the saishan only solores di corte could be said to vie with her for access to brandin and solores was six years older than she was one of the first years harvest of the tribute ships sometimes even now it was all a little too much a little hard to believe the younger castrates trembled if she even glanced slantwise at them courtiers whether from overseas in ygrath or here in the four western provinces of the palm sought her counsel and support in their petitions to brandin musicians wrote songs for her poets declaimed and dedicated verses that spun into hyperbolic raptures about her beauty and her wisdom the ygrathens would liken her to the sisters of their god the chiarans to the fabled beauty of onestra before she did the last ring dive for grand duke cazal though the poets always stopped that analogy well before the dive itself and the tragedies that followed after one such adjectivebestrewn effort of doardes shed suggested to brandin over a late private supper that one of the measures of difference between men and women was that power made men attractive but when a woman had power that merely made it attractive to praise her beauty hed thought about it leaning back and stroking his neat beard shed been aware of having taken a certain risk but shed also known him very well by then two questions brandin tyrant of the western palm had asked reaching for the hand shed left on the table do you think you have power my dianora shed expected that only through you and for the little time remaining before i grow old and you cease to grant me access to you a small slash at solores there but discreet enough she judged but so long as you command me to come to you i will be seen to have power in your court and poets will say i am more lovely now than i ever was more lovely than the diadem of stars that crowns the crescent of the girdled world or whatever the line was the curving diadem i think he wrote he smiled shed expected a compliment then for he was generous with those his grey eyes had remained sober though and direct he said my second question would i be attractive to you without the power that i wield and that she remembered had almost caught her out it was too unexpected a question and far too near to the place where her twin snakes yet lived however dormant they might be shed lowered her eyelashes to where their hands were twined like the snakes she thought she backed away quickly from that thought looking up with the sly sidelong glance she knew he loved dianora had said feigning surprise do you wield power here i hadnt noticed a second later his rich lifegiving laughter had burst forth the guards outside would hear it she knew and they would talk everyone in chiara talked the island fed itself on gossip and rumor there would be another tale after tonight nothing new only a reaffirmation in that shouted laughter of how much pleasure brandin of ygrath took in his dark dianora hed carried her to the bed then still amused making her smile and then laugh herself at his mood hed taken his pleasure slowly and in the myriad of ways hed taught her through the years for in ygrath they were versed in such things and he was then and now the king of ygrath over and above everything else he was and she on her balcony now in the springtime morning sunlight dianora closed her eyes on the memory of how that night and before that night for years and years before that night and after after even until now her own rebel body and heart and mind traitors together to her soul had slaked so desperate and deep a need in him in brandin of ygrath whom she had come here to kill twelve years ago twin snakes around the wreckage of her heart for having done what he had done to tigana which was her home or had been her home until he had battered and leveled and burned it and killed a generation and taken away the very sound of its name of her own true name she was dianora di tigana bren saevar and her father had died at second deisa with an awkwardlyhandled sword and not a sculptors chisel in his hand her mothers spirit had snapped like a water reed in the brutality of the occupation that followed and her brother whose eyes and hair were exactly like her own whom she had loved more than her life had been driven into exile in the wideness of the world hed been fifteen years old she had no idea where he was all these years after if he was alive or dead or far from this peninsula where tyrants ruled over broken provinces that had once been so proud where the name of the proudest of them all was gone from the memory of men because of brandin in whose arms she had lain so many nights through the years with such an ache of need such an arching of desire every time he summoned her to him whose voice was knowledge and wit and grace to her water in the dryness of her days whose laughter when he set it free when she could draw it forth from him was like the healing sun slicing out of clouds whose grey eyes were the troubling unreadable color of the sea under the first cold slanting light of morning in spring or fall in the oldest of all the stories told in tigana it was from the grey sea at dawn that adaon the god had risen and come to micaela and lain with her on the long dark destined curving of the sand dianora knew that story as well as she knew her name her true name she also knew two other things at least as well that her brother or her father would kill her with their hands if either were alive to see what she had become and that she would accept that ending and know it was deserved her father was dead her heart would scald her at the very thought of her brother so even if death might spare him a grief so final as seeing where she had come but each and every morning she prayed to the triad especially to adaon of the waves that he was overseas and so far away from where tidings might ever reach him of a dianora with dark eyes like his own in the saishan of the tyrant unless said the quiet voice of her heart unless the morning might yet come when she could find a way to do a thing here on the island that would still despite all that had happened despite the intertwining of limbs at night and the sound of her own voice crying aloud in need assuaged bring back another sound into the world into the voices of men and women and children all over the palm and south over the mountains in quileia and north and west and east beyond all the seas the sound of the name of tigana gone gone but not if the goddesses and the god were kind if there was any love left in them or pity not forever forgotten or forever lost and perhaps and this was dianoras dream on the nights she slept alone after scelto had massaged and oiled her skin and had gone away with his candle to sleep outside her door perhaps it would come to pass that if she could indeed find a way to do this thing that her brother far from home would miraculously hear the name of tigana spoken by a stranger in a world of strangers in some distant royal court or bazaar and somehow he would know in a rush of wonder and joy in the deep core of the heart she knew so well that it was through her doing that the name was in the world again she would be dead by then she had no doubts as to that brandins hate in this one thing in the matter of his vengeance for stevan was fixed and unalterable it was the one set star in the firmament of all the lands he ruled she would be dead but it would be all right for tiganas name would be restored and her brother would be alive and would know it had been she and brandin brandin would understand that she had found a way to do this thing while sparing his life on all the nights the numberless nights when she could have slain him while he slept by her side after love this was dianoras dream she used to be driven awake tears cold on her cheeks by the intensity of the feelings it engendered no one ever saw those tears but scelto though and scelto she trusted more than anyone alive she heard his quick light footsteps at the doorway and then briskly crossing the floor toward her balcony no one else in the saishan moved like scelto the castrates were notoriously prone to lassitude and to eating too much the obvious substitutions for pleasure not scelto though slim as hed been when she met him he still sought out those errands the other castrates strove to avoid trips up into the steep streets of the old town or even farther north into the hills or partway up sangarios itself in search of healing herbs or leaves or simply meadow flowers for her room he seemed ageless but he hadnt been young when vencel assigned him to dianora and she guessed that he must be sixty now if vencel ever died a hard thing to imagine in fact scelto was certainly next in line to succeed him as head of the saishan they had never spoken about it but dianora knew as surely as she knew anything that he would refuse the position if it were offered to him in order to remain bound to her she also knew and this was the thing that touched her that this would be true even if brandin stopped sending for her entirely and she became merely another aging ignored item of history in the saishan wing and this was the second thing shed never expected to find when hate had carried her through autumn seas to chiara on the tribute ship kindness and caring and a friend behind the high walls and ornate screens of the place where women waited among men who had lost their manhood sceltos tread rapid even after the long climb up the great staircase and then another flight up to the saishan clicked across the mosaics of the balcony floor behind her she heard him murmur kindly to the boy and dismiss him he took another step forward and coughed once to announce himself is it terribly hideous she asked without turning around it will do scelto said coming to stand beside her she looked over smiling to see his closecropped grey hair the thin precise mouth and the terribly broken hook of his nose ages ago hed said when shed asked a fight over a woman back in ygrath hed killed the other man who happened to be a noble which unfortunate fact had cost scelto his sex and his liberty and brought him here dianora had been more disturbed by the story than he seemed to be on the other hand she remembered thinking it had been new to her while for him it was only the familiar coinage of his life from a long time past he held up the dark red gown theyd had made in the old town from his smile which matched her own dianora knew it had been worth cajoling vencel for the funds to have this done the head of the saishan would want a favor later he always did but through such exchanges was the saishan run and dianora looking at the gown had no regrets what is solores wearing she asked hala wouldnt tell me scelto murmured regretfully dianora laughed aloud at the straight face he managed to maintain im quite sure he wouldnt she said what is she wearing green he said promptly high waisted high neck two shades in pleats below the waist gold sandals a great deal of gold everywhere else her hair will be up of course she has new earrings dianora laughed again scelto allowed himself a tiny smile of satisfaction i took the liberty he added of purchasing something else while i was in town he reached into a fold of his tunic and handed her a small box she opened it and wordlessly held up the gem inside in the bright morning light of the balcony it dazzled and shone like a third red moon to join vidomni and blue ilarion scelto said i thought it would be better with the gown than anything vencel would offer you from the saishan jewels she shook her head wonderingly it is beautiful scelto can we afford this will i have to go without chocolate for all of the spring and summer not a bad idea he said ignoring her first question you ate two pieces this morning while i was gone scelto she exclaimed stop that go spy on solores and see what shes spending her chiaros on i have my habits and my pleasures and none of them so far as i can see are particularly evil do i look fat to you almost reluctantly he shook his head i have no idea why not he murmured ruefully well you keep thinking about it till you figure it out she said with a toss of her head in the meantime that reminds me the boy this morning was fine except that the khav was very weak will you speak to him about how i like it i did i told him to make it a little weak you what scelto i absolutely you always begin drinking more khav at the end of winter when the weather begins to turn and every spring you always have trouble sleeping at night you know this is true my lady either fewer cups or weaker khav it is my duty to try to keep you rested and tranquil dianora was speechless for a second tranquil she finally managed to exclaim i might have frightened that poor child to the tips of his fingernails i would have felt terrible i had told him what to say scelto said placidly he would have blamed it on me oh really and what if id reported it directly to vencel instead dianora retorted scelto he would have had that boy starved and lashed sceltos dignified little sniff conveyed quite clearly what he thought about the likelihood of her having done any such thing his expression was so wryly knowing that against her will dianora found herself laughing again very well she said surrendering then let it be fewer cups because i do like it strong scelto it isnt worth the drinking otherwise besides i dont think thats why i cant sleep at night this season simply makes me restless you were taken as tribute in the spring he murmured everyone in the saishan is restless in the season they were taken he hesitated i cant do anything about that my lady but i thought perhaps the khav might be making it worse there was concern and affection in his brown eyes almost as dark as her own you worry too much about me she said after a moment he smiled who else should i worry about there was a little silence dianora could hear the noises from far below in the square speaking of worrying said scelto in a transparent effort to change the mood we may be concentrating too much on what solores is doing we may want to start keeping an eye on the young one with the green eyes lassica dianora said surprised what ever for brandin hasnt even called her to him and shes been here a month already exactly said scelto he paused somewhat awkwardly which piqued her curiosity what are you saying scelto i um have been told by tesios who has been looking after her that he has never seen or heard of a woman in the saishan with such control of her body or such capacity for the climax of love he was blushing furiously which made dianora abruptly selfconscious too it was a standard practice with some quite unstandard variations for the women of the saishan to use their castrates to give them physical release if too much time went by between summonses to the other wing dianora had never asked scelto for such a service something about the very idea disturbed her it seemed an abuse in a way she couldnt articulate he had been a man she reminded herself frequently who had killed someone for love of a woman their relationship close as it was had never entered that dimension it was strange she thought even amusing how shy they could both become at the very mention of the subject and triad knew it came up often enough in the hothouse atmosphere of the saishan she turned back to the railing looking down through the screen to give him time to regain his composure thinking about what hed said though she found herself feeling a certain amusement after all she was already working out how and when to tell brandin about this my friend she said you may know me well but in exactly the same way and for many of the same reasons i know brandin very well she glanced back at her castrate he is older than you scelto he is almost sixtyfive and for reasons i dont entirely understand he has said he must live here in the palm another sixty years or so all the sorcery in the world would surely not avail him to prolong his life that long if lassica is as exceptional as tesios suggests she would wear him out however pleasantly in a year or two scelto blushed again and glanced quickly back over his shoulder they were quite alone though dianora laughed partly out of genuine amusement but more specifically to mask the recurring sorrow she felt whenever this one lie had to be told the thing she still kept from scelto the one secret that mattered of course she knew why brandin needed to stay here in the palm why he needed to use his sorcery to prolong his life here in what was surely a place of exile for him in a land of grief he had to wait for everyone born in tigana to die only then could he leave the peninsula where his son had been slain only then would the full measure of the vengeance he had decreed be poured out on the bloodied ground for no one would be left alive in the world who had any true memory of tigana before the fall of avalle of the towers the songs and the stories and the legends all the long bright historyit would truly be gone then wiped out seventy or eighty years wreaking as comprehensive an obliteration as millennia had on the ancient civilizations no one could now recall whole cultures that were now only an awkwardly pronounced name of a place or a deciphered pompous title emperor of all the earth on a broken pottery shard brandin could go home after sixty years he could do whatever he chose by then she would be long dead and so too would be those from tigana even younger than she those born up to the very year of the conquest the last inheritors the last children who could hear and read the name of the land that had been their own eighty years brandin was giving himself more than enough given lifespans in the palm eighty years to oblivion to the broken meaningless pottery shard the books were gone already and the paintings tapestries sculptures music torn or smashed or burned in the terrible year after valentins fall when brandin had come down upon them in the agony of a fathers loss bringing them the reciprocal agony of a conquerors hate the worst year of dianoras life seeing so much of beauty and splendor crumble to rubble and dust or burn down to ashes of loss shed been fifteen then sixteen still too young to comprehend the full reality of what was being eradicated for her fathers death and the destruction of his art the works of his hands and days she could mourn bitterly and so too for the deaths of friends and the sudden terrors of an occupied impoverished city the larger losses the implications for the future she couldnt really grasp back then many in the city had gone mad that year others had fled taking their children away to try to shape a life far from the burning or the memory of burning of hammers smashing into the statues of the princes in the long covered loggia of the palace by the sea some had withdrawn so far into themselves a madness of another kind that only the merest spark was left within to make them eat and sleep and somehow walk through the waste spaces of their days her mother had been one of those on the balcony in chiara so many years later dianora looked up at scelto and realized from the blinking concern in his face that shed been silent for too long she forced a smile shed been here for a long time she was good at dissembling at smiling when it was needful even with scelto whom she hated to deceive and especially with brandin whom she had to deceive or die lassica is not a concern she said mildly resuming the conversation as if nothing had happened indeed nothing had happened only old memories come back nothing of weight or import in the world nothing that mattered or could matter only loss she said skillfully laughing she is far too unintelligent to divert him and too young to relax him as solores does im glad of your information though i think we can use it tell me is tesios growing weary tending her should i speak to vencel about assigning someone younger or perhaps more than one she made him smile even as he flushed again it always seemed to go this way if she could make them smile or laugh it would brush away the clouds like a wind a springtime or an autumn wind leaving behind the high clear blue of the sky dianora wished with an aching heart that shed known how to do that eighteen years ago for her mother and her brother for both of them so long ago no laughter then no laughter anywhere and the blue skies a mockery looking down upon ruin vencel more awesomely obese every time she saw him approved soloress gown nesaias chylmoenes and then her own only the four of them experienced enough to know how to cope with the exigencies of a formal reception were going down to the audience chamber the envy in the saishan during the past week had been acute enough to produce a scent scelto had said wryly more than once dianora hadnt noticed she was used to it vencels shrewd eyes widened from deep in the manifold creases of his dark face as he studied her she had the gem on her brow set in a band of white gold that held back her hair sprawled on his couch of pillows the head of the saishan played with the billowing folds of his elephantine white robe the sun shining through the arch of a window behind him glinted distractingly from his bald head i do not recall that stone among our treasures he murmured in his high disconcerting voice it was a voice so utterly inconsequential that it might lead one to underestimate the speaker which as a good many people had discovered over the years was a serious sometimes a mortal mistake it isnt dianora replied cheerfully though after we return this afternoon may i ask you to guard it in my name among the other treasures sceltos suggestion that vencel could be corrupt and venal about a great many things but not when it came to the formal aspects of his office he was too clever for that again a truth some had paid the ultimate price to discover he nodded benignly now it seems a very fine stone from this distance obediently dianora stepped nearer and inclined her head graciously to let him see it more clearly the scent of tainflowers that he always wore after winters end enveloped her it was too sweet but not unpleasant she had feared vencel once a fear mixed of physical revulsion at his grossness and rumors of the things he liked to do with the younger castrates and some of the women who were in the saishan for purely political reasons with no hope of ever seeing the outside world or the west wing of the palace and brandins chambers long ago though she and the saishan head had reached their understanding solores had the same unspoken pact with vencel and out of the delicate balance achieved thereby the three of them controlled as best they could their enclosed overintense incenseladen world of idle frustrated women and halfmen with a surprisingly delicate finger vencel touched the gem on her brow he smiled a good stone he said again this time in judgment his breath was fragrant i must talk to scelto about it i know about such things you see vairstones come from the north you see from my own land they are mined in khardhun for years and years i used to play with them as trinkets a monarchs toys in the days when i was more than i am now for as you know i have been a king in khardhun dianora nodded gravely for this too was a part of the unspoken terms of her relationship with vencel that however many times he might speak this wild fabrication of a lie and he said it many times a day in one variant or another she was to nod knowingly reflectively as if pondering the message hidden in the grandeur of his fall only in her rooms alone with scelto could she give way to fits of girlish giggling at the very thought of the vasty saishan head being more than he was now or at the subversive deadly imitation scelto could give of vences speech and gestures you do that wonderfully she might say innocently as scelto dressed her hair or polished her curved slippers till they shone it is a thing i know about you see he would reply if certain they were alone his voice pitched high above its normal range he would gesticulate slowly expansively for as you are aware i have been a king in khardhun she would laugh like a little girl who knew just how naughty she was being the more out of control because of that very fact she had asked brandin about it once his khardhun campaign had been only a marginal success she learned he was frank with her about such things by then there was real magic in khardhun in that hot northern land across the sea beyond the coastal villages and the desert wastes a magic far greater than anything in the peninsula of the palm and equal to the sorcery of ygrath brandin had taken one city and established a tenuous control over some lands that lay on the fringes of the great desert stretching north there had been losses though serious losses she gathered the khardhu had long been celebrated for their skill in battle nor was this unknown in the palm many of them had served as wellpaid mercenaries in the warring provinces before the tyrants had come and made all such feuding irrelevant vencel had been a herald captured late in the campaign brandin told her hed already been unmanned a thing they did to messengers in the north for no reason brandin had understood it had been manifestly evident where the castrate belonged when brought back to ygrath he had already brandin confirmed been enormous dianora straightened as vencel withdrew his finger from the red gleam of the vairstone will you escort us down she asked a ritual i think not he said judiciously as if actually giving thought to the matter perhaps scelto and hala can manage that office between them i have some matters that need my attention here this afternoon you see i understand dianora glanced over at solores and each of them raised a spread palm in respectful salute in fact vencel hadnt left the saishan wing in at least five years even when he toured the rooms on this floor it was on a cleverly contrived rolling platform of cushions dianora could not remember the last time shed actually seen him stand upright scelto and soloress hala attended to virtually all the formal outofsaishan duties vencel believed in delegating they went down the stairway that led out from the saishan to the world one flight below they accepted the scrutiny respectful but careful of the two guards posted outside the heavy bronze doors that barred access to and from the level where the women were dianora responded to their cautious glances with a smile one of them returned it shyly the guards were changed often she didnt know either of these two but a smile was a start at bonding and a friend never hurt scelto and hala dressed unobtrusively in brown led the four women out of the saishan wing along the main corridor of the palace to the grand staircase in the center there the two castrates paused to let the women precede them with some pride but not with hauteur they were the captives and concubines of a conqueror dianora and solores led the way down the sweeping stair they were noticed of course the women of the saishan were always noticed when they came out there were a number of people milling about in the marbled vestibule waiting to enter the audience chamber they made way for the four of them some of the newer men smiled in a manner that had taken dianora some time to accept others knew her better and their expressions were rather different in the arched doorway to the largest of the formal reception rooms she and solores paused again side by side this time entirely for effect the bloodred gown beside the green and then walked together into the crowded room of state as she did so every single time she did so dianora offered an inward voicing of gratitude for the impulse that had led brandin to change the rules for his saishan here in the colony he now ruled in ygrath she knew this would never have been allowed for a man other than the king or one of the castrates to see let alone hold converse with a saishan woman was death for both of them and vencel had told her once for the head of the saishan wing as well things had been different here in chiara almost from the start over the years dianora had learned enough to know that some of her gratitude should go to dorotea queen of ygrath and her decision to remain there with girald her elder son and not accompany her husband into his selfimposed exile abroad doroteas choice or depending on to whom one listened brandins decision not to demand the company of his queen somewhat instinctively dianora always preferred the latter version of the story but she was wise enough to know why that was so and this was one of the things she never spoke about with brandin not that the matter was taboo he wasnt that kind of man it was simply that she wasnt sure if or how she could deal with whatever answer he gave her if the question was ever asked in any case with dorotea remaining in ygrath there were few highborn court ladies willing to risk the seas and the queens displeasure in journeying to the colony in the palm which meant an extreme scarcity of women at brandins new court in chiara and this in turn led to a change in the role of the saishan the more so since especially in the early years brandin had deliberately ordered the tribute ships to search out daughters of distinguished houses in corte or asoli on chiara he made the choices himself from lower corte which had once borne a different name he took no women at all as a matter of absolute policy the hatred there ran both ways and too deep and the saishan was not a place to let it fester hed sent for only a few of the women from his saishan in ygrath leaving it largely intact the politics were straightforward control of the saishan was a symbol that would confirm the status and authority of girald now ruling as regent of ygrath in his fathers name with such changes here in the colony the new saishan was a very different place from the old vencel and scelto had both told her that it had another kind of mood to it a different character entirely it also had among all those women from corte and chiara and asoli and the handful from ygrath one woman named dianora from certando from barbadianruled certando or so everyone in the palace thought it had almost started a war dianora remembered in the days after her brother left home sixteenyearold dianora di tigana daughter of a sculptor who had died in the war and of a mother who had scarcely spoken since that day resolved that she would point her own life towards the killing of the tyrant on chiara hardening herself the way she heard that men in battle were forced to do the way her father must have tried to do by the deisa she had begun preparing to leave her mother in the hollow echoing house that had once been a place crowded with joy where the prince of tigana had walked in their courtyard an arm flung about her fathers shoulders discussing and praising the works in progress there dianora could remember entering the audience chamber she checked and approved her reflection in the wall of goldplated mirrors on the far side of the room then her eyes sought instinctively those of deymon of ygrath the chancellor the second most powerful man in the court he was predictably already looking towards solores and herself his glance precisely as bleak as it always was it was a look that had bothered dianora when first she came shed thought deymon had taken a dislike to her or worse that he somehow suspected her it wasnt long before she realized that he disliked and suspected virtually every person who entered this palace everyone received the same glacial appraising scrutiny it had been exactly so she gathered in ygrath as well deymons loyalty to brandin was fanatical and unwavering and so was his zeal in protecting his king over the years dianora had developed a respect grudging at first and then less so for the grim ygrathen she counted it as one of her own triumphs that he seemed to trust her now for years now in fact or she would never have been allowed to spend a night in brandins bed while he slept a triumph of deception she thought with an irony whose teeth were all directed inward against herself deymon made an economical circling motion with his head and then repeated the gesture for solores it was what they had expected they were to mingle and converse neither of them was to take the chair set beside the island throne they did sometimes and so had the beautiful unlamented chloese before her surprising untimely death but brandin was quite punctilious when guests from ygrath were among them at such times the seat beside him stood pointedly empty for dorotea his queen brandin had not yet entered the room of course but dianora saw rhun the slacklimbed balding fool shamble towards one of the servers carrying wine rhun clumsy grievously retarded was clad sumptuously in gold and white and so dianora knew that brandin would be as well it was an integral part of the complex relationship of the sorcerer kings of ygrath and their chosen fools for centuries in ygrath the fool had served as shadow and projection for the king he was dressed like his monarch ate next to him at public functions was there when honors were conferred or judgment passed and every kings chosen fool was someone visibly sometimes painfully afflicted or malformed rhuns walk was sluggish his features twisted and deformed his hands dangled at awkward angles in repose his speech was badly slurred he recognized people in the court but not invariably and not always in the manner one might expect which sometimes carried a message a message from the king that part dianora didnt entirely comprehend and doubted she ever would she knew that rhuns dim limited mind was mostly under his own control but she also knew that that was not completely so there was sorcery at work in this the subtle magic of ygrath this much she understood that in addition to serving very graphically to remind their king of his mortality and his own limitations the fools of ygrath dressed exactly like their lord could sometimes also serve as a voice an external conduit for the thoughts and emotions of the king which meant that one could not always be sure whether rhuns words and actions slurred or awkward as they might be were his own or an important revelation of brandins mood and that could be treacherous ground for the unwary right now rhun seemed smiling and content bobbing and bowing jerkily at every second person he encountered his golden cap slipping off every time he would laugh though as he bent to pick it up and set it again on his thinning hair every so often an overanxious courtier seeking to curry favor in any way he could would hastily stoop to pick up the fallen cap and present it to the fool rhun would laugh at that too dianora had to admit that he made her uneasy though she tried to hide that beneath the real pity she felt for his afflictions and his increasingly evident years but the core truth for her was that rhun was intimately tied to brandins magic he was an extension of it a tool and brandins magic was the source of all her loss and fear and her guilt so over the years she had become adroit at avoiding situations where she might find herself alone with the fool his guileless eyes unnervingly similar to brandins gave her genuine trouble they seemed if she looked into them for too long to have no depth to be only a surface reflecting her image back to her in a fashion very different from that of the goldplated mirrors and at such times she did not like what she was made to see from the doorway with the polished grace of long experience solores drifted to her right as dianora moved left smiling at people she knew nesaia and chylmoene chestnut and ambertressed crossed the floor together creating a palpable stir where they passed dianora saw the poet doarde standing with his wife and daughter the girl about seventeen was obviously excited her first formal reception dianora guessed doarde smiled unctuously across the room at her and bowed elaborately even at a distance though she could read the discomfiture in his eyes a reception on this scale for a musician from ygrath had to be bitter gall for the most senior poet in the colony all winter he had preened with pride over his verses that brandin had sent east as a goad for the barbadian when word had come in the fall of the death of sandre dastibar doarde had been insufferable for months today though dianora could sympathize with him a little even though he was a monumental fraud in her view shed told brandin as much once only to learn that he found the poets pompousness amusing for genuine art hed murmured he looked elsewhere and you destroyed it shed wanted to say wanted so much to say remembering with an almost physical pain the broken head and sundered torso of her fathers last adaon on the steps of the palace by the sea the one for which her brother finally old enough had served as model for the young god she remembered looking dryeyed at the wreckage of that sculpted form wanting to weep and not knowing where her tears were anymore she glanced back at doardes daughter at her young scarcely contained exhilaration seventeen just after her own seventeenth naming day she had stolen half of the silver from her fathers hidden strongbox begging pardon of his spirit and her mothers blessing in her heart and asking the compassion of eanna who saw all beneath the shining of her lights shed gone without saying goodbye though she had looked in a last time by carried candlelight upon the thin worn figure of her mother uneasily asleep in the wideness of her bed dianora was hardened as for battle she did not weep four days later shed crossed the border into certando having forded the river at a lonely place north of avalle shed had to be careful getting there ygrathen soldiers were still ranging the countryside and in avalle itself they were hammering at the towers bringing them down some yet stood she could see them from her crossingplace but most were rubble by then and what she saw of avalle was through a screen of smoke it wasnt even avalle by then either the spell had been laid down brandins magic the city where the pall of smoke and summer dust hung so heavily was now called stevanien dianora could remember not being able to understand how a man could name the ugly wreckage of a place once so fair after a child he had loved later that would become clearer to her the name had nothing to do with brandins memory of stevan it was solely for those living there and elsewhere in what had been tigana a constant inescapable reminder of whose death had meant their ruin the tiganese now lived in a province named lower corte and corte had been their bitterest foe for centuries the city of tigana was the city of lower corte now and avalle of the towers was stevanien the vengeance of the king of ygrath went deeper than occupation and burning and rubble and death it encompassed names and memory the fabric of identity it was a subtle thing and merciless there were a number of refugees in the summer dianora went east but none had anything remotely resembling her own fixed purpose and so most of them went much further away to the far side of the certandan grainlands to ferraut tregea astibar itself willing anxious even to live under the spreading tyranny of the barbadian lord in order to put as much distance as they could between themselves and their images of what brandin of ygrath had done to their home but dianora was clinging to those images she was nursing them within her breast feeding them with hate shaping hatred with memory twin snakes inside her she only went a handful of miles across the border into certando the latesummer fields of corn had been yellow and tall she remembered but all the men were gone away to the north and east where alberico of barbadior having carefully consolidated his conquests of ferraut and astibar was now moving south he was master of certando by the end of the fall and had taken borifort in tregea the last major stronghold to stand against him by the following spring after a winter siege long before then dianora had found what she was looking for in the western highlands of certando a hamlet twenty houses and a tavern south of sinave and forese the two great forts that watched each other on either side of the border that divided certando from what she learned to call lower corte the land so near the southern mountains was not nearly as good as it was farther north the growing season was shorter cold winds swept down from the braccio and sfaroni ranges early in fall bringing snow soon after and a long white winter wolves would howl in the wintry nights and sometimes in the morning strange footmarks could be found in the deep snow marks that came down from the mountains and then returned once long ago the village had been near to one of the roads forking northeast from the main highway down from the sfaroni pass in the days when there was still overland trade with quileia to the south that was why the ancient tavern was so large in a village now so small why it had four rooms upstairs for the travelers who had not come for a great many years dianora hid her fathers silver south of the village on a thickly wooded slope away from the goatherd runs and she went to work as a serving girl in the tavern there was no money to pay her of course she worked for her room and the scanty board available that first summer and fall and she labored in the fields with the other women and the young boys to bring home what they could of the harvest she told them she was from the north near ferraut that her mother was dead and her father and brother had gone to war she said her uncle had begun to abuse her and so she had run away she was good with accents and she had the northern speech right enough for them to believe her or at least to ask no questions there were many transients in the palm in those days questions were seldom pushed too far she ate little and worked as hard as any in the fields there was actually little enough to do in the inn with the men away to war she slept in one of the rooms upstairs she even had it to herself they were kind enough to her after their fashion and given the nature of things in that time when the light and the place were right morning usually and in certain of the higher fields she could look away to the west across the border towards the river and see the remaining towers and the smoke above what had been avalle one morning late in the year she realized that she couldnt see anything anymore that she hadnt in fact seen anything for some time the last tower was gone around that time the men had begun to come home beaten and weary there was work again in the kitchen and waiting on tables or behind the counter of the bar she was also expected and had been preparing herself for this as best she could all through the fall to take a man up to her room if he offered the going rate every village seemed to need one such woman and she was the obvious candidate here she tried to make herself not mind but this was the most difficult thing yet she had a mission though a reason for being here a vengeance to enact and this even this she would tell herself going up the stairs with someone was a part of it she hardened herself but not always and not quite enough perhaps that showed through several men asked her to marry them one day she caught herself thinking about one of them as she wiped down the tables after lunch he was quiet and kind shy when he took her upstairs and his eyes would follow her movements in the tavern with a fierce concentration whenever he was there that day was when she knew it was time for her to leave she was a little surprised to realize that almost three years had gone by it was spring she slipped away one night again without a farewell remembering her arrival even as she went meadow flowers were blooming beside the path into the hills the air was clean and mild by the mingled light of the two moons she found her buried silver and walked away without looking back taking the road north towards the fort at sinave she was nineteen years old nineteen and sometime in the past two years she had grown beautiful her angular boniness had softened even as her face lost its last traces of girlhood it was oval wide at the cheekbones almost austere it changed when she laughed though and for some reason she still knew how to laugh becoming warm and animated the unexpected dance in her dark eyes seeming to promise things that went deeper than amusement men who had seen her laughing or who had caused her to smile at them would encounter that look again in their dreams or in the memories that lay on the border of sleep and dream years after dianora had gone away at sinave the barbadians disturbed her with their oppressive size and careless casual brutality she forced herself to be calm and to linger there two weeks would be enough she judged she had to leave an impression and a memory a carefully constructed memory of an ambitious pretty country girl from some hamlet near the mountains a girl usually silent during the tavern talk at night but who when she did speak told vivid memorable tales of her home village to the south told them with the distinctively laconic diction and round vowels that would have marked her anywhere in the palm as being from the highlands of certando the tales were usually sad most stories were in those years but once in a while dianora would offer a wonderfully droll imitation of some highland rustic voicing his considered opinion on great affairs in the wider world and those at the table where she was sitting would laugh for a long time she appeared to them to have some money earned very likely in the way that pretty girls usually came to have some money but she shared a room with another woman at the better of the two hostelries within the walls of the fort and neither of them was ever seen to invite a man upstairs or to accept an invitation to go elsewhere the barbadian soldiers might have been a problem indeed they had been over the winter but orders had come from astibar and the mercenaries were under a tighter rein that spring what she wanted to do dianora confided one night to the loosely knit group of young men and women she had joined was to work in a tavern or diningplace that saw a better class of person coming through its doors shed had two hands full and more thank you of the other sort of inn she declared someone mentioned the queen in stevanien across the border in lower corte with a heartfelt inward sigh of relief dianora began asking questions about it questions to which shed known the answers for three days during which time shed sat among these selfsame people every night planting subtle hints in the hope that the name might emerge spontaneously subtlety shed finally decided was wasted among young certandans here on the border and so shed practically had to drag the conversation over to the subject she wanted now she listened seemingly enraptured and wideeyed as two of her recent acquaintances animatedly described the newest most elegant ygrathen innovation in lower corte a diningplace that boasted a master chef brought all the way from ygrath itself by the current governor of stevanien and its distrada the governor it emerged was notoriously fond of wine and food and of good music played in comfortable chambers he had helped establish the new chef in a set of rooms on the ground floor of a former bankinghouse and now he basked in the reflected glory of the most elaborate most luxurious eatingplace in the palm he dined there himself several times a week dianora learned for the second time shed picked up all of this in gossip among the merchants during her days checking out the prices and styles of clothing available in fort sinave she needed some things fit for the city she knew it might make a difference from the very first time shed heard the name shed realized that the queen would be perfect for the next stage of her plan to change her past what she learned from the merchants was that no one from lower corte was allowed to dine here traders from corte were cordially greeted as were those from farther afield in asoli or chiara itself any ygrathen naturally soldier merchant or whoever he might be come to seek his fortune in the newest colony was graciously ushered in to salute the portrait of queen dorotea that hung on the wall opposite the door even those merchants crossing the line that divided the eastern palm from the west were more than welcome to leave some of whatever currency they carried in the queen it was only the kings true enemies the denizens of lower corte of stevanien itself who were forbidden to stain or sully the ambience with their postulent heirmurdering presence they never did dianora learned from a ferraut trader bound back north and east with leather from stevanien that he expected to sell at a profit even with that years tariff levels what the inhabitants of stevanien had done in response to the ban was simply refuse to work for the new establishment neither as servers or kitchen help or stable hands nor even as musicians or artisans to help decorate and maintain the splendid rooms the governor when he learned what was happening had vowed in redfaced rage to force the contemptible inhabitants to work wherever they were required by their masters of ygrath force them with dungeon and lash and a deathwheel or three if needed the master chef arduini had demurred one did not arduini had said in a muchquoted display of artistic temperament build up and maintain an establishment of quality by using enforced surly labor his standards were simply too high for that even the stableboys at his restaurant said arduini of ygrath were to be trained and willing and to have a certain style to them there had been widespread hilarity when that was reported stylish stablehands indeed but dianora learned the amusement had turned to respect quite soon because arduini pretentious or not did know what he was doing the queen the ferraut trader told her was like an oasis amid the deserts of khardhun in dispirited broken stevanien it cast a warm glow of ygrathen civility and grace the merchant lamented though discreetly on this side of the border the complete absence of any such traits in the barbadians who had occupied his own province but yes he said in response to dianoras apparently casual question arduini was still struggling with staff problems stevanien was a backwater and a backwater moreover in the most oppressively taxed and militarily subjugated province in the palm it was next to impossible to get people to travel there or stay and since none of the trickle of adventurers from ygrath had come so far from home to wash dishes or clear tables or tend to a stable however stylish a stable it might be there appeared to be a chronic need for workers from elsewhere in the palm in that moment dianora had changed every plan she had she cast the line of her life with a silent prayer to adaon in the direction of this chance information she had been intending with some real apprehension to go northwest to corte that had always been the nexttolast destination in her plans she had seriously wondered almost every night as she lay awake whether three years in certando would be enough to shake off anyone pursuing the true history of her life shed had no good ideas about what else she could do though now she did and so it was that a few nights later in the largest of the taverns in fort sinave a cheerful crowd of young people watched their new friend drink more than was good for her for the first time since shed arrived more than one of the men saw cause for cautious optimism in that with respect to possibilities later in the evening youve settled it then dianora cried in her attractive southcountry voice she leaned for support against the shoulder of a bemused cartwright hand to the new plow for me tomorrow im over the border as soon as i can to visit the queen of ygrath triad bless her days triad shelter and hold my soul she was thinking as she spoke absolutely sober cold to her bones with the sense of the words she was so glibly shouting they silenced her laughing uproariously in part to cover her words in barbadian certando it was a long way from the path of wisdom to thus salute ygraths queen dianora giggled quite endearingly but she subsided the cartwright and another man tried to see her up to her room afterwards but found themselves charmingly put off and drinking together amid offduty mercenaries in the one allnight tavern fort sinave possessed she was just a little too untutored too country to succeed in her ambitious hopes they agreed sagely they also agreed a few drinks later that she had the most extraordinarily appealing smile something about her eyes what happened to them when she was pleased in the morning dianora was dressed and packed and waiting very early at the main gate of the fort she struck a bargain for passage to stevanien with a pleasantenough middleaged merchant from senzio carrying barbadian spices for the luxury trade his only reason for going to dreary flattened stevanien she learned as they started west was because of the new restaurant the queen she took that coincidence as a good omen closing the fingers of her left hand over the thumb three times to make the wish come true the roads were better than she remembered certainly the merchants traveling them seemed to feel safer rolling along in the cart she asked the senzian about it he grinned sardonically the tyrants have cleaned out most of the highway brigands just a matter of protecting their own interests they want to make sure no one else robs us before they do with their border tariffs and taxes he spat discreetly into the dust of the road personally i preferred the brigands there were ways of dealing with them not long after that she saw evidence of what he was talking about they passed two deathwheels beside the roadway the bodies of wouldbe thieves spreadeagled upon them spiraling lazily in the sun severed hands rotting in their mouths the smell was very bad the senzian stopped just across the border to do some dealing in the fort of forese he also paid his transit duties there scrupulously waiting patiently in line to have his cart examined and levied the deathwheels he pointed out to her after in the acerbic senzian manner were not reserved for highway thieves and captured wizards thus delayed they spent the night at a coachhouse on the welltraveled road joining a party of ferraut traders for dinner dianora excused herself early and went to bed shed paid for a room alone and took the precaution of pushing an oak dresser in front of her door nothing disturbed her though except her dreams she was back in tigana and yet she wasnt because it wasnt there she whispered the name to herself like a talisman or a prayer before falling into a restless sleep shot through with images of destruction from the burning year they spent the second night at another inn beside the river just outside the walls of stevanien having arrived after sundown curfew closed the city gates they ate alone this time and she talked to the senzian until late he was decent and sober belying the cliches about his decadent province and it was clear that he liked her she enjoyed his company and she was even attracted to his dry witty manner she went to bed alone though this was not the village in certando she had no obligations or not those kinds of obligations and as for pleasure or the ordinary needs of human interaction she would have been honestly uncomprehending if anyone had mentioned them to her she was nineteen years old and in tigana thathadbeen in the morning just inside the city walls she bade farewell to the senzian touching palm to palm only briefly he seemed somewhat affected by the night before but she turned and walked away before he could find whatever words his eyes were reaching for she found a hostelry not far away one where her family had never stayed she wasnt really worried about being recognized though she knew how much she had changed and how many girls named dianora there were scattered across the palm she paid in advance for three nights lodging and left her belongings there then she walked out into the streets of what had been avalle of the towers not very long ago avalle on the green banks of the sperion just before the river turned west to find the sea there was an ache building in her as she went and what hurt most of all she found was how much the same a place could be after everything had changed she went through the leather district and the wool district she could remember skipping along beside her mother when they had all come inland to avalle to see one of her fathers sculptures ceremoniously placed in some square or loggia she even recognized the tiny shop where shed purchased her first grey leather gloves with coins hoarded from her naming day in the summer for just such a thing grey was a color for grown young women not for little girls the redbearded artisan had teased i know sixyearold dianora had said proudly that autumn long ago her mother had laughed once upon a time her mother had been a woman who laughed dianora could remember in the wool quarter she saw women and girls working tirelessly carding and spinning as they had for centuries in doorways open to the earlysummer earlymorning light over by the river she could see and smell the dyeing sheds and yards when quileia beyond the mountains to the south had folded inward upon its matriarchy hundreds upon hundreds of years ago avalle had lost a great deal more perhaps than any other city in the palm once poised directly on one of the two main trade routes through the mountains it had found itself in danger of sudden inconsequentially with a collective ingenuity bordering on genius the city had decisively shifted its orientation and focus within a generation that city of banking and trade to north and south had become the principal center in all of the palm for works in leather and for sumptuously dyed wool hardly missing a beat avalle pursued its new prosperity and its pride and the towers kept rising with a catch to her heart dianora finally acknowledged that she had been carefully working her way around the edges of stevanien the outlying districts the artisans quarters looking outwards only and into doorways not into the center up towards the hill where the towers were gone and so realizing that she did look standing stock still in the middle of a wide square at the bottom of the street of the woolguild there was a small very beautiful temple of morian fronting the square done in marble of a muted rose color she gazed at it for a moment then looked up and beyond and in that moment dianora had a truth brought home to her with finality how something can seem quite unchanged in all the small surface details of existence where things never really change men and women being what they are but how the core the pulse the kernel of everything can still have become utterly unlike what it had been before the wide beautiful streets seemed even wider than before but that was because they were almost empty there was a muted swell of noise over to her left where the riverside market still was but the sound was not a fraction her memory told her not a fraction of what it had been in mornings that were lost there were too few people too many were gone or dead and the ygrathen soldiers were all the more visible because of how empty the streets were dianora let her gaze travel past the temple up the line of the broad boulevard beside it towards the heart of the city we can and we will build wide and straight the people of avalle had said even in the very beginning when towns everywhere else were tortuous warrens of twisty alleys and crooked lanes easy to defend there will be no city like ours in all the world and if need comes for defense we will defend ourselves from our towers which were gone the squat ugly skyline jarred dianora with a painful discontinuity it was as if the eye was tricked looking ceaselessly for something it knew had to be there from the earliest days of that broad elegant city on the banks of the sperion towers had been associated with avalle assertions of tiganese pride sheer arrogance they called it in the provinces of corte and chiara and astibar they were symbols of internecine rivalry as well as each noble family or wealthy guild of bankers or traders or artisans thrust its own tower as high as and then higher than they could truly afford graceful or warlike red stone or sandy or grey the towers of avalle pushed up towards eannas heaven like a forest within the city walls the domestic conflicts had actually become dangerous for a time with murder and sabotage not nearly uncommon enough and the best masons and architects claiming stupefying fees it had been the third prince alessan in tigana by the sea who had put an end to the insanity in the simplest possible way more than two hundred years ago he commissioned orsaria the most celebrated of the architects to build for him a palace in avalle and that palace was to have a tower said prince alessan that would be and would remain by force of law the highest in the city so it had been the spire of the princes tower slender and graceful wrapped in bands of green and white to serve as a memory of the sea this far inland put an end to the competition for the summit of avalle and from then on also by that prince alessans example which became custom and then tradition the princes and princesses of tigana were born in avalle in the palace beneath that spire to mark them as belonging to both of the cities to tigana of the waves and avalle of the towers there had been over seventy towers once dianora knew crowned in glory by that green and white preeminence once four years ago what dianora thought her vision hurting for that absence is a person who moves through her days as she has always moved who speaks and walks and labors eats makes love sleeps sometimes even finds access to laughter but whose heart has been cut out from her living body leaving no scar at all to be seen no wound by which to remember the sliding blade the rubble had all been cleared away there was no smoke save from over by the dyeworks to mar the clear blue of the sky the day was mild and bright birds sang a welcome to the coming warmth there was nothing nothing at all to show that there had ever been towers in this place in this low steadily dwindling town of stevanien here in its remote corner of the peninsula of the palm in the most oppressed province of them all what is such a person dianora thought again that person whose heart was gone she had no answer how could she have an answer loss coiled to life within her and hate followed it again as if both of them were newborn colder and sharper than before she walked up that wide boulevard into the center of stevanien she passed the soldiers barracks and the doors of the governors palace not far away she found the queen she was hired immediately to start that same night help was badly needed help was hard to find arduini of ygrath who did all his own hiring decided that this pretty creature from certando had a certain style to her she would have to do something though he admonished her about that wretchedly vulgar highland accent she promised to try within six months she was speaking almost like a native of the city he observed by then he had her out of the kitchen and into the front room waiting on tables clad in the cream and darkbrown colors around which he had designed his establishment colors that happened to suit her very well she was quiet deft unassuming and polite she remembered names and patrons preferences she learned quickly four months later in the spring before she turned twentyone arduini offered her the coveted position at the front of the queen greeting guests and supervising the staff in the three rooms of dining she astonished him by refusing she astonished a great many people but dianora knew that this would be far too prominent a position for her own purposes which had not changed if she was to travel north into corte soon and clearly marked by now as being from certando she needed to have been associated with the queen but not so very prominently prominent people had questions asked about them that much she knew so she feigned an attack of countrygirl anxiety the night arduini made his offer she broke two glasses and dropped a platter then she spilled senzian green wine on the governor himself tearfully she went to arduini and begged for more time to grow sure of herself he agreed it helped that he was in love with her by then he invited her gracefully to become his mistress in this too she demurred pleading the inevitable tension that such a liaison would elicit within the staff badly damaging the queen it was the right argument his establishment was arduinis true mistress in fact dianora had resolved to let no man touch her now she was in ygrathen territory and she had a purpose the rules had changed she had tentatively decided to leave in the fall north towards corte she had been weighing possibilities and excuses for doing so when events had overtaken her so spectacularly slowly circling the audience chamber dianora paused to greet doardes wife whom she liked the poet seized the opportunity to present his daughter the girl blushed but dipped her head hands pressed together in a creditable manner dianora smiled at her and moved on a steward caught up to her bearing khav in a black chalice set with red gemstones a gift years ago from brandin it was her trademark on occasions such as this she never drank anything stronger than khav at public receptions with a guilty glance towards the doorway where she knew scelto would be stationed against the wall she took a grateful sip of the hot drink praise the triad and the growers of tregea it was dark and rich and very strong my dear lady dianora you are looking more magnificent than ever she turned smoothly suppressing an expression of distaste she had recognized the voice neso of ygrath a minor nobleman from overseas who had recently arrived at brandins court on the first ship of the season solely in the hope of becoming a major nobleman in the colony he was so far as dianora had been able to tell talentless and venal she smiled radiantly at him and allowed him to touch her hand my dear neso how kind of you to lie so skillfully to an aging woman she rather liked saying that sort of thing for as scelto had shrewdly observed once if she was old what did that make solores neso hastened to offer all the emphatic predictable denials he praised her gown and the vairstone noting with a courtiers eye and tongue how exquisitely the stones of her chalice echoed her colors that day then lowering his voice towards an unearned intimacy he asked her for the eighth time at least if she happened to have heard anything further about the planned disposition of that very trivial office of taxing master in north asoli it was in fact a lucrative position the incumbent had made his fortune or enough for his own purposes evidently and was returning to ygrath in a few weeks dianora hated that sort of graft and she had even been bold enough to say so to brandin once a little amused which had irritated her he had prosaically pointed out how difficult it was to get men to serve in places as devoid of attraction as the north of asoli without offering them a chance at modest wealth his grey eyes beneath the thick dark eyebrows had rested upon her as shed wrestled and then finally come to terms with the depressing truth inherent in this shed finally looked up and nodded a reluctant agreement which made him burst into laughter i am so relieved chuckled brandin of ygrath that my clumsy reasoning and government meet with your approval she had gone red to the roots of her hair but then catching his mood had laughed herself at the absurdity of her presumption that had been several years ago now all she did was try discreetly to see that positions such as this one did not go to the most transparently greedy of the motley crew of petty ygrathen courtiers from whom brandin had to choose neso she had resolved was not getting this posting if she could help it the problem was that deymon seemed for inscrutable reasons of his own to be favoring nesos appointment shed already asked scelto to see if he could find out why now she let her smile fade to an earnestly benevolent look of concern as she gazed at the sleek plump ygrathen lowering her voice but without leaning towards him she murmured i am doing what i can you should know that there seems to be some opposition nesos eyes narrowed on the far side of the curl of smoke rising from her khav with practiced subtlety they flicked past her right shoulder to where she knew deymon would still be standing by the kings door neso looked back at her eyebrows raised very slightly dianora gave a small apologetic shrug have you a suggestion neso asked his brow furrowed with anxiety id start by smiling a little she said with deliberate tartness there was no point in intriguing in such a way that the whole court knew of it neso forced an immediate laugh and then applauded stagily as if shed offered an irresistible witticism forgive me he said smiling as ordered this matters a great deal to me it matters a great deal more to the people of asoli you greedy bloodleech dianora thought she laid a hand lightly on nesos puffed sleeve i know it does she said kindly i will do what i can if circumstances allow me to neso whatever he was was no stranger to this sort of thing once more the false laugh greeted her nonexistent jest i hope to be able to assist the circumstances he murmured she smiled again and withdrew her hand it was enough scelto was going to receive some more money that afternoon she hoped it would come to a decent part of the vairstones cost as for deymon she would probably end up talking directly to him later in the week or as directly as discussions ever got with that man sipping at her khav she moved on people came up to her wherever she went it was bad politics in brandins court not to be on good terms with dianora di certando conversing absently and inconsequentially she kept an ear pitched for the discreet raps of the heralds staff that would be brandins sole announcement rhun she noted was making faces at himself in one of the mirrors and laughing at the effect he was in high humor which was a good sign turning the other way she suddenly noticed a face she liked one that was undeniably central to her own history in could be said in many ways to have been the governors own fault so anxious was he to assuage the evident frustration of rhamanus captain of that years tribute ship that he ordered the certandan servinggirl who had apologized so very charmingly after the spilledwine incident some time ago to bring rather more of the queens best vintages than were entirely good for any of them at the table rhamanus young enough to still be ambitious old enough to feel his chances slipping away had made some pointedly acid remarks earlier in the day on board the river galley about the state of affairs in stevanien and its environs so much of a backwater so desultory in its collection of duties and taxes he murmured a little too casually that he wasnt even sure if the galley run upriver in spring was worthwhile under the present administrative circumstances the governor long past the point of ambition but needing a few more years here skimming his share of border tariffs and internal levies along with the criminal justice fines and confiscations had winced inwardly and cursed the conjunctions of his planets why when he strove so hard to be decent and uncontentious in everything he did to leave any waters he entered as unruffled as possible did he have so little luck short of a massive midsummer military assertion there was no way to force more money or goods out of this impoverished region if brandin had seriously wanted to extract real wealth out of stevanien he would have been better advised not to have so successfully smashed the city and its distrada to its knees not that the governor would have even dreamt of letting such a furtive thought come anywhere near his lips but the reality was that he was doing the best he could if he squeezed the leather or the wool guilds any harder than he was they would simply start to fold stevanien already thinly inhabited and particularly bereft of men in their prime years would become a town of ghosts and empty squares and he had explicit instructions from the king to prevent that if the kings various orders and demands rammed so violently up against each other in such patent contradiction what in all fairness was a middleechelon administrator to do not that such a plaint could be used with this bristly unhappy rhamanus what care would the captain have for the governors dilemmas the tribute ship captains were judged by what came home to chiara in their holds their job was to put as much pressure on the local administrators as they could even to the point sometimes of forcing them to surrender a portion of their own levies to bring the contents of the ship nearer to the mark the governor had already resigned himself dismally to doing just that by the end of the week if the last hurried sweep of the distrada that hed ordered didnt produce enough to satisfy rhamanus it wouldnt he knew this was an ambitious captain he was dealing with and there had been a tenuous harvest in corte last fall rhamanuss next stop his retirement estate in eastern ygrath on the promontory hed already chosen in his mind seemed farther away this evening than ever before he signaled for another round of wine for all of them inwardly grieving for the bluegreen sea and the splendid hunting woods by the home hed probably never be able to build on the other hand as they liked to say here it appeared that his attempt to soothe the ire of this rhamanus had been unexpectedly successful the governor had asked his wonderful arduini the true and only joy there was for him in this benighted place to prepare an evening meal for them of an unforgettable order all of my meals are unforgettable arduini had bridled predictably but had been mollified by a judicious mixture of flattery gold ygras and a quiet reminder almost certainly not the truth the governor reflected unrepentantly that their guest that evening had ready access to the ear of the king on chiara the meal had been an ascending series of revelations the service prompt soothing and unobtrusive the wines a sequence of complementary grace notes to arduinis undeniable artistry rhamanus a man who appeared to keep his trim physique with some difficulty had progressed from edginess through guarded appreciation to increasing pleasure ending up in a volubly expansive good humor somewhere in the nexttolast bottle of dessert wine imported from back home in ygrath he had also become quite drunk which was the only explanation the only possible explanation for the fact that after the dinner was over and the queen closed for the night hed had their evenings darkhaired waitress formally seized as tribute for brandin in chiara and bundled directly onto the galley in the river the servinggirl the servinggirl from certando certando on the other side of the border where alberico of barbadior held sway not alas brandin of ygrath the governor of stevanien had been awakened at dawn from a fitful winefogged slumber by a terrified apologetic clerk of the council unclothed and without so much as a whiff of his morning khav he had heard through the ominous pounding of a colossal headache the nature of the news stop that galley he roared as the horrifying implications fought their way through to register upon his slowly emerging consciousness he had tried to roar anyway what came forth was a pitiful squeal that had been nonetheless sufficiently explicit to send the clerk flying his gown flapping in his haste to obey they blocked the river sperion stopping rhamanus just as he was raising anchor unfortunately the tribute captain then proceeded to reveal a stubbornness that ran stupefyingly counter to the most rudimentary political good sense he refused to surrender the girl for one wild hallucinatory moment of insanity the governor actually contemplated storming the galley the river galley of brandin king of ygrath lord of burrakh in khardhun tyrant of the western provinces of the peninsula of the palm said galley then flying rather pointedly brandins own device as well as the royal banner of ygrath deathwheels the governor reflected were lovingly made for minor functionaries who essayed such maneuvers desperately his brain curdling in the unfair brightness of the morning sunlight by the river the governor tried to find a way of communicating reason to a tribute captain seized by the manifest throes of a midsummer madness do you want to start a war he shouted from the dock he had to shout from the dock they wouldnt let him on the galley the wretched girl was nowhere to be seen stowed doubtless in the captains cabin the governor wished she were dead he wished that he himself was dead he wished in the most grievous inner sacrilege of all that arduini the master chef had never set foot in stevanien and why captain rhamanus called blandly from the middle of the river should my doing my precise duty by my king cause any such a thing has the sea salt rotted your miserable excuse for a brain the governor screamed illadvisedly the captains brow darkened the governor pushed on dripping with sweat in the sun shes a certandan in the name of the seven holy sisters of the god do you have any idea how easy it will be to goad alberico into starting a border war over this he mopped at his brow with the square of red cloth a servant belatedly produced rhamanus cursedly composed despite having drunk at least as much as the governor the night before seemed unimpressed as far as im concerned he pronounced airily the words drifting over the water shes living in stevanien shes working in stevanien and she was taken in stevanien by my reckoning that makes her perfectly suitable for the saishan or whatever our king in his wisdom decides to do with her he leveled a finger suddenly at the governor now clear the river of these boats or i will ram and sink them in the name of each of the seven sisters and the king of ygrath unless he added leaning forward lowering his hand to the railing you would care to farspeak chiara and have the king settle this himself they had a saying here in the colony naked between a fist and a fist it was an exact phrase for the place where that insidious cleverly calculated viciously unfair proposition put the man to whom it was addressed a phrase that described in precise and graphic terms where the governor of stevanien abruptly felt himself to be the red cloth swabbed repeatedly and ineffectually at his forehead and neck one did not farspeak the king without it had been painstakingly impressed upon all the regional administrators in the western palm very compelling reason the power demanded of brandin to sustain such a link with his nonsorcerous underlings was considerable one most particularly did not willingly undertake such a course of action in the very early morning hours when the king might be asleep most relevant of all perhaps one did not hasten to bespeak the mental presence of ones monarch with a mind clogged and befuddled with the miasmic aftermath of wine and over an issue that in essence might be seen to involve no more than the tribute seizure of a common farm girl that was one of the fists the other was war on the border with the brainbattering possibility of more than that for who in the name of the sisters and the god knew how the devious pagan mind of alberico of barbadior worked how he might regard or decide to regard an incident such as this despite rhamanuss glib analysis the fact that the girl worked in the queen made it obvious that she wasnt really a lower cortean in the name of the sisters they couldnt even seize a lower cortean for tribute they werent allowed to by order of the king to take the woman she had to be certandan if rhamanus wanted to argue she was a resident of stevanien well that made her a lower cortean which meant that they couldnt take her which meant that he didnt know what that meant the governor held out his sopping kerchief and it was exchanged for a fresh one his brain felt as if it was frying in the sun all he had wanted out of his declining years in service was the quiet mildly lucrative postings his familys long if fairly minor support of brandins original claim to succession in ygrath had earned them that was it all he wanted with a decent house on that eastern promontory one day where he could watch the sun come up out of the sea and go hunting in the woods with his dogs so very much to ask instead a fist and a fist he briefly considered washing his hands of the whole affair and let the cursed inhabitants of this peninsula chew on that for a phrase letting the imbecilic tribute captain row his galley down the river just as he pleased in fact he realized lamentably too late if he had stayed in bed and pretended hed not received the message in time he would have been entirely blameless in this affair of a drunken captains blunder he closed his eyes tasting the exquisite vanished sweetness of such a possibility too late he was standing by the riverside in the blinding light and the heat of the sun and half of stevanien had heard what he and rhamanus had just shouted back and forth across the water with a small diffident prayer to his own patron gods of food and forest and a poignantly clear image of that seaside estate the governor chose his fist let me on board then he said as briskly as he could manage im not about to farspeak the king while standing on this dock i want a chair and some quiet and an extremely strong mug of whatever passes for khav on a galley rhamanus was visibly nonplussed the governor was able to derive a certain sour pleasure from that they gave him everything he asked for the woman was taken below deck and he was left alone in the captains cabin he took a deep breath and then several more he drank the khav scalding his tongue which as much as anything else woke him up then for the first time in three years of office he narrowed his mind down to a pinpoint image as brandin had taught him and he framed questioningly the name of the king in his thoughts with profoundly unsettling speed brandins crisp cool always slightly mocking voice was in his head it was dizzying the governor fought to keep his composure as carefully but as quickly as he could speed mattered they had all been taught he outlined the situation they faced he apologized twice en route but dared not risk the time required for a third however much his lifetimes instincts bade him to what good were a career diplomats lifetime instincts when enmeshed in sorcery he felt sick to his stomach with the strain and the discontinuity of the farspeaking then with a surging of his spirit with glory with paeans of praise to twenty different deities chorusing within him the governor of stevanien was given to understand that his king was not angered more that he had been exactly correct in this farspeaking that the political timing could not be better for such a testing of albericos resolve that accordingly rhamanus should indeed be allowed to take the girl as tribute but and the king stressed this very clearly identified as a certandan a certandan who happened to be in lower corte that fact was to be their claim of authority no evasions about her being a resident of stevanien or some such thing they would see what sort of spirit this minor barbadian sorcerer had after all the governor had done well the king said the image of the house by the sea grew almost incandescently vivid in the back of the governors mind even as he heard himself babbling silently over the link brandin made his most abject protestations of love and obedience the king cut him short we must end now he said do go easier on the wine down there then he was gone the governor sat alone in the captains cabin for a long time trying to reassure himself that brandins last tone had been amused not reproving he was fairly certain it was he was almost sure a very tense period had ensued the galley was allowed to leave that same morning in the fortnight that followed the king had farspoken him twice once to order the border garrison at forese quietly increased but not by so much as to amount to further provocation in itself the governor spent an anguished sleepless night trying to calculate what number of soldiers would suit that command reinforcements from the city of lower corte arrived up the river to supplement his own forces in stevanien later he was instructed by the king to watch for a possible barbadian envoy from certando and to greet such a one with utmost cordiality referring all questions to chiara for resolution he was also warned to be on full alert for a retaliatory border raid from sinave and to annihilate any and all barbadian troops that might venture into lower corte the governor had very little personal experience at annihilation but he swore to obey merchants he was told were to be advised to delay their plans to travel east for a little while no orders nothing official merely a piece of advice a prudent businessman might wish to heed most did in the end nothing happened alberico chose to entirely ignore the affair short of a willingness to have things escalate a long way there was nothing else he could do without losing face for a while there was speculation he might punish some merchant or itinerant musician from the western palm who happened to be in his provinces but there was no sign of this either the barbadians simply treated the girl as having been an established resident of lower corte exactly as rhamanus had so blithely opined the morning hed seized her in the ygrathen provinces though the girl was deliberately described as certandan from the start the woman from barbadian territory that brandin had seized mocking alberico all the while she was said to be beautiful as well rhamanus made his slow progression home through the rest of that summer and into the early fall the galley took them downriver and all the collected inland tributes were transferred to the great tribute ship itself with its broad filling sails slowly it made its way up the coast collecting taxes and tariffs at the designated places in corte and asoli the harvest had indeed been bad in corte they had to struggle to meet the quotas there twice they rested at anchor for long periods while the captain led a company to an inland post and all the while rhamanus searched for women who might be useful as more than hostages or symbols of ygraths manifest dominance women who might credit the saishan itself and so make the career of a certain tribute captain who was just about ready for a landside posting after twenty years at sea three possibilities were found one was of noble birth her existence revealed by an informer she was taken only after her fathers manor in corte had been somewhat regretfully burned to the ground at length in the autumn turning of the year beautiful even in flat unlovely asoli when the rains chose to relent the tribute ship slipped through the tricky passages of the strait of asoli and entered the waters of the chiaran sea a few days later red and gold sails billowing triumphantly it had sailed into the great harbor of the island celebrated in song for more years than could be counted the tribute ship of rhamanus had carried gold and gems and silver and coinage of various kinds it bore leather from stevanien and wood carvings from corte and great huge wheels of saull cheese from the west coast of asoli they had spices and herbs and knives stained glass and wool and wine there were two women from corte and one from asoli and besides these three there was another woman and this one was different this one was the darkhaired browneyed beauty known throughout the peninsula by the time their voyage ended as the woman whod come near to starting a war dianora di certando her name was dianora who had intended to come to the island from the very first from the earliest glimmerings of her plan when she had sat alone before a dead fire one summer night in her fathers silent house who had hardened herself as men in battle were said to have to do to the thought of being captured and brought here and locked for life inside the saishan of the tyrant she had worked it out that far five years ago a girl with death in her heart with a father dead and a brother gone and a mother gone even farther away images of all three of them rising in her dreams from the ashes of the burning in her land and death was still there still with her on that ship she still had those dreams but with them now as fabled chiara drew nearer under the brightness of the sky was something else a bemused an almost numbed incredulity at how the line of her life had run how things had fallen out so completely wrong and yet so precisely as she had planned from the first she had tried to see that as an omen closing her left hand three times over her thumb to make her wish come true as she entered that new world chapter it was strange dianora thought still moving through the crowded audience chamber as spring sunlight filtered down on brandins court from the stainedglass windows above how the so clear portents of youth were alchemized by time into the manylayered ambiguities of adult life sipping from her jeweled cup she considered the alternative that she had simply allowed things to become nuanced and difficult that the real truths were exactly the same as they had been on the day she arrived that all she was doing was hiding from what she had become and what she had not yet done it was the central question of her life and once more she pushed it away to the edges of her awareness not today not in any daytime those thoughts belonged to nights alone in the saishan when only scelto by her door might know how sleepless she was or find the tracks of tears along her cheeks when he came to wake her in the morning night thoughts and this was bright day in a very public place so she walked over towards the man shed recognized and let her smile reach her eyes balancing her chalice gracefully she sketched a full ygrathen salute to the portly soberly dressed personage with three heavy gold chains about his neck greetings she murmured straightening and moving nearer this is a surprise it is rare indeed that the sobusy warden of the three harbors deigns to spare a moment from his sodemanding affairs to visit old friends unfortunately rhamanus was as hard to ruffle or disconcert as he had ever been dianora had been trying to get a rise out of him ever since the night hed had her bundled like a brown heifer out of the street in front of the queen and onto the river galley now he simply grinned heavier with the years gone by and latterly his shorebound duties but unmistakably the man whod brought her here one of the few men from ygrath she genuinely liked not so much flavor from you girl he mockgrowled it is not for idle women who do nothing all day but put their hair up and down and up again for exercise to criticize those of us who have stern and arduous tasks that shorten our nights and put grey in our hair dianora laughed rhamanuss thick black curls the envy of half the saishan showed not a trace of grey she let her gaze linger expressively on his dark locks im a liar rhamanus conceded with untroubled equanimity leaning forward so only she could hear its been a deadquiet winter not much to do at all i could have come to visit but you know how much i hate these goingson at court my buttons pop when i bow dianora laughed again and gave his arm a quick squeeze rhamanus had been kind to her on the ship and courteous and friendly ever since even when shed been merely another new body if a slightly notorious one in the saishan of the king she knew he liked her and she also knew from deymon himself that the former tribute ship captain was an efficient and a fair administrator she had helped him get the posting four years ago it was a high honor for a seaman supervising harbor rules and regulations at the three main ports of chiara itself it was also to judge from rhamanuss slightly threadbare clothing a little too near the seat of power for any real gains to be extracted thinking she clicked her tongue against her upper teeth a habit brandin teased her about he claimed it always signaled a request or a suggestion he knew her very well which frightened her at least as much as it did anything else this is the merest thought she said now to rhamanus quietly but would you have any interest at all in living in north asoli for a few years not that i want to get rid of you its a dreadful place everyone knows that but there are opportunities and id as soon a decent man reaped them as some of the greedy clutch that are hovering about here the taxing office he asked very softly she nodded his eyes widened slightly but schooled to discretion he gave no other sign of interest or surprise what he did do an instant later was glance quickly beyond her shoulder towards the throne dianora was already turning by then an inexplicable sense almost an antenna having alerted her so she was facing the island throne and the doorway behind it by the time the heralds staff rapped the floor twice not loudly and brandin came into the room he was followed by the two priests and the priestess of adaon rhun shambled quickly over to stand near by dressed identically to the king except for his cap the truer measure of power brandin had once said to her wouldnt be found in having twenty heralds deafen a room by proclaiming ones arrival any fool in funds for a day could rivet attention that way the more testing course the truer measure was to enter unobtrusively and observe what happened what happened was what always happened the audience chamber had been collectively poised as if on the edge of a cliff for the past ten minutes waiting now just as collectively the court plummeted into obeisance not one person in the whole crowded room was still speaking by the time the heralds muted staff of office proclaimed the king in the silence the two discreet raps on the marbled floor sounded like echoing thunder brandin was in high good humor dianora could have told that from halfway across the room even if she hadnt had a hint from rhun already her heart was beating very fast it always did whenever brandin entered a room where she was even after twelve years even still and despite everything so many lines of her life led to or from this man or came together hopelessly intertwined in him he looked to deymon first as always and received the others expressionless bow sketched low in the ygrathen fashion then as always he turned and smiled at solores then at dianora braced as she was as she always tried to be she still could not quite master what happened to her when the grey eyes found and held her own his glance was like a touch a gliding presence fiery and glacial both as brandin was and all this from a look across a very crowded room once in bed years before she had dared to ask him a question that had long troubled her is there sorcery involved when you love me here or when we first meet in a public place she hadnt known what answer she wanted or what to expect by way of reaction shed thought he might be flattered by the implication or at least amused you could never be sure with brandin though his mind ran through too many different channels and with too much subtlety which is why questions especially revealing ones were dangerous this had been important to her though if he said yes she was going to try to use that to kindle her killing anger again the anger she seemed to have lost here in the strange world that was the island her expression must have been very grave he turned on his pillow head propped on one hand to regard her from beneath level brows he shook his head not in any way you are thinking nothing that i control or shape with my magic other than the matter of children i will not have any more heirs you know that she did know that all his women did he said after a pause carefully why do you ask what happens to you for a second she thought shed heard uncertainty in his voice but one could never be sure of such things with brandin too much shed answered too much happens and shed been speaking for that one time the unshielded truth of a no longer innocent heart there was an acute understanding in his clear eyes which frightened her she moved herself moved by all the layers of her need to slide over against his body again and then above and upon it that it might begin once more the whole process all of it betrayal and memory mixed with yearning as in the ambercolored wine the triad were said to drink too potent for mortals to taste are you truly serious about that posting in asoli rhamanuss voice was soft brandin had not gone to the throne but was making a relaxed circuit of the room more evidence of his benign mood rhun with his lopsided smile shambled in his wake i confess i had never even given it a thought the former tribute captain added with an effort dianora forced her thoughts back to him for a second she had forgotten her own query brandin did that to her it was not a good thing she thought for many reasons it was not a good thing she turned again to rhamanus im quite serious she said but im not sure if you would want the position even if it were possible you have more status where you are and this is chiara after all asoli can offer you some chance at wealth but i think you have an idea what would be involved what matters to you rhamanus it was more bluntly put than courtesy would have deemed appropriate especially with a friend he blinked and fingered one of his chains of office is that what it comes down to he asked hesitantly is that how you see it can a man not perhaps be moved by the prospect of a new challenge or even at the risk of sounding foolish by the desire to serve his king her turn to blink you shame me she said simply after a moment rhamanus i swear you do she stilled his quick protests with a hand on his sleeve sometimes i wonder what is happening to me all the intriguing that goes on here she heard footsteps approaching and what she said next was spoken as much to the man behind as to the one in front of her sometimes i wonder what this court is doing to me should i be wondering as well asked brandin of ygrath smiling he joined them he did not touch her he very seldom touched the saishan women in public and this was an ygrathen reception they knew his rules their lives were shaped by his rules my lord she said turning and sketching her salutation she kept her voice airily provocative do you find me more cynical than i was when this terrible man brought me here brandins amused glance went from her to rhamanus it was not as if hed needed the reminder of which tribute captain had brought him dianora she knew that and he knew she did it was all part of their verbal dance his intelligence stretched her to her limits and then changed what those limits were she noticed perhaps because the subject had come up with rhamanus that there was as much grey in his beard now as black he nodded judiciously simulating a deep concern over the question i would have to say so yes you have grown cynically manipulative in almost exactly the same proportion as the terrible man has grown fat so much dianora protested my lord he is very fat both men chuckled rhamanus patted his belly affectionately this he said is what happens when you feed a man cold salt meat for twenty years at sea and then expose him to the delights of the kings city well then said brandin we may have to send you away somewhere until you are sleek as a seal again my lord said rhamanus instantly i am yours to command in all things his expression was sober and intense brandin registered that and his tone changed as well i know that he murmured i would that i had more of you at court at both of my courts portly or sleek rhamanus i am not unmindful of you whatever our dianora may think very high praise a promise of sorts and a dismissal for the moment brighteyed rhamanus bowed formally and withdrew brandin walked a couple of paces away rhun shuffling along beside him dianora followed as she was expected to once out of earshot of anyone but the fool brandin turned to her he was she was sorry to see suppressing a smile what did you do offer him north asoli dianora heaved a heartfelt sigh of frustration this happened all the time now that she protested is unfair you are using magic he let the smile come she knew that people were watching them she knew what they would say amongst each other hardly brandin murmured i wouldnt waste it or drain myself on something so transparent transparent she bridled not you my cynical manipulator but rhamanus was too serious too quickly when i jested about posting him away and the only position of significance currently available is north asoli and so he let the sentence trail off laughter lingered in his eyes would he be such a bad choice dianora asked defiantly it was genuinely disconcerting how easily brandin could sound the depths of things if she allowed herself to dwell on that she could become frightened again what do you think he asked by way of reply i think she lifted her plucked eyebrows in exaggerated arches how should a mere object of the kings occasional pleasure venture to have an opinion on such matters now that said brandin nodding briskly is an intelligent observation i shall have to consult solores instead if you get an intelligent observation out of her dianora said tartly i shall hurl myself from the saishan balcony into the sea all the way across the harbor square a long leap said brandin mildly so she replied is an intelligent observation for solores and at that he laughed aloud the court was listening everyone heard everyone would draw their own conclusions but they would all be the same conclusion in the end scelto she reflected was likely to receive discreet contributions from sources other than neso of ygrath before the day was out i saw something interesting on the mountain this morning brandin said his amusement subsiding something quite unusual this she realized was why hed wanted to speak to her alone hed been up on sangarios that morning she was one of the few who knew about it brandin kept this venture quiet in case he should fail shed been prepared to tease him about it at the beginning of spring just as the winds began to change before the last snows melted in certando and tregea and the southern reaches of what had been tigana came the three ember days that marked the turning of the year no fires not already burning were lit anywhere in the palm the devout fasted for at least the first of the three days the bells of the triad temples were silent men stayed within their doors at night especially after darkfall on the first day which was the day of the dead there were ember days in autumn as well halfway through the year when the time of mourning came for adaon slain on his mountain in tregea when the sun began to fade as eanna mourned and morian folded in upon herself in her halls underground but the spring days inspired a colder dread especially in the countryside because so much depended upon what would follow them winters passing the season of sowing and the hope of grain of life in the summers fullness to come in chiara there was an added ritual different from anything elsewhere in the palm on the island the tale was told that adaon and eanna had first come together in love for three full days and nights on the summit of sangarios that in the surging climax of her desire on the third night eanna of the lights had created the stars of heaven and strewn them like shining lace through the dark and the tale was told that nine months later which is three times three the triad was completed when morian was born in the depths of winter in a cave on that same mountain and with morian had come both life and death into the world and with life and death came mortal man to walk under the newly named stars the two moons of the nights warding and the sun of day and for this reason had chiara always asserted its preeminence among the nine provinces of the palm and for this reason as well did the island name morian as guardian of its destiny morian of portals who had sway over all thresholds for everyone knew that all islands were worlds unto themselves that to come to an island was to come to another world a truth known under the stars and moons if not always remembered by the light of day every three years then at the beginning of each year of morian on the first of the springtime ember days the young men of chiara would vie with each other in a dawn race up to the summit of sangarios there to pluck a blooddark sprig of sonrai the intoxicating berries of the mountain under the watchful eye of the priests of morian who had kept vigil on the peak all night long among the waking spirits of the dead the first man down the mountain was anointed lord of sangarios until the next such run in three years time in the old days the very old days the lord of sangarios would have been hunted down and slain on his mountain by the women six months later on the first of the ember days of fall not anymore not for a long time now the young champion was likely to find himself in fierce demand as a lover by women seeking the blessing of his seed a different sort of hunt dianora had said to brandin once he hadnt laughed he didnt find the ritual amusing in fact six years ago the king of ygrath had elected to run the course himself the morning before the actual race he had done it again three years past no small achievement really for a man of his years considering how hard and how long the runners trained for this dianora didnt know what to find more whimsical the fact that brandin would do this thing in such secrecy or the ebullient masculine pride hed felt both times hed made it up to the summit of sangarios and down again in the audience chamber dianora asked the question she was clearly expected to ask what did you see then she did not know for mortals seldom do know when they approach a threshold of the goddess that the question would mark the turning of her days something unusual brandin repeated i had of course outstripped the guards running with me of course she murmured giving him a sidelong glance he grinned i was alone on the path part of the way up the trees were still very thick on either side mountain ash mostly some sejoias how interesting she said this time he quelled her with a look dianora bit her lip and schooled her expression dutifully i looked over to my right brandin said and saw a large grey rock almost like a platform at the edge of the trees and sitting on the rock there was a creature a woman i would swear and very nearly human very nearly she wasnt teasing anymore within the actual archway of a portal of morian we sometimes do know that a thing of importance is happening thats what was unusual she certainly wasnt entirely human not with green hair and such pale skin skin so white i swear i saw blue veins beneath dianora and her eyes were unlike any ive ever seen i thought she was a trick of light the sun filtering through trees but she didnt move or change in any way even when i stopped to look at her and now dianora knew exactly where she was the ancient creatures of water and wood and cave went back in time as far as the triad did almost and from the description she knew what he had seen she knew other things as well and was suddenly afraid what did you do she asked as casually as she could i wasnt sure what to do i spoke she didnt answer so i took a step towards her and as soon as i did she leaped down from the rock and backed away she stopped among the trees i held out my open palms but she seemed to be startled by that or offended and a moment later she fled did you follow i was about to but by then one of the guards had caught up to me did he see her she asked too quickly brandin gave her a curious look i asked he said no though i think he would have answered that way regardless why do you ask she shrugged it would have confirmed she was real she lied brandin shook his head she was real this was no vision in fact he added as if the thought had just occurred to him she reminded me of you with what was it green skin and blue hair she replied letting her court instincts guide her now something large was happening here though she labored to hide the turmoil she felt i thank you so much my gracious lord i suppose if i talked to scelto and vencel we could achieve the skin color and blue hair should be easy enough if it excites you so dramatically he smiled but did not laugh green hair not blue he said almost absently and she did dianora he repeated looking at her oddly she did remind me of you i wonder why do you know anything about such creatures i do not she said in certando we have no tales of greenhaired women in the mountains she was lying she was lying as well as she could wideeyed and direct she could scarcely believe what she had just heard what he had seen brandins good humor was still with him what mountain tales do you have in certando he queried smiling expectantly stories of hairy things that walk on legs like tree stumps and eat goats and virgins in the night his smile broadened are there any goats yes she said with a straight face fewer virgins hairy creatures with such specific appetites are not an incentive to chastity are you sending out a party to search for this creature a question so important she held her breath awaiting his reply i think not brandin said i suspect such things are only seen when they want to be which she knew for a fact was absolutely true i havent told anyone but you he added unexpectedly there was no dissembling in the expression she felt come over her face at that but over and above everything else there was something new inside her with these tidings she badly needed to be alone to think a vain hope she wouldnt get that chance for a long time yet today best to push his story as far back as she could with all the other things she was always pushing to the edges of her mind thank you my lord she murmured aware that they had been talking privately for some time aware as ever of how that would be construed in the meantime brandin suddenly said in a quite different tone you still have not yet asked me how i did on the run solores i have to tell you made it her first question which carried them back to familiar ground very well she said feigning indifference do tell me halfway threequarters a glint of royal indignation nickered in the grey eyes you are presumptuous sometimes he said i indulge you too much i went if you please all the way to the summit and came down again this morning with a cluster of sonrai berries i will be extremely interested to see if any of tomorrows runners are up and down as quickly well she said quickly unwisely they wont have sorcery to help them dianora have done and that tone she recognized and knew shed gone too far as always at such moments she had a dizzying sense of a pit gaping at her feet she knew what brandin needed from her she knew the reason he granted her license to be outrageous and impertinent she had long understood why the wit and edge she brought to their exchanges were important to him she was his counterbalance to soloress soft unquestioning undemanding shelter the two of them in turn balancing deymons ascetic exercise of politics and government and all three of them in orbit around the star that brandin was the voluntarily exiled sun removed from the heavens it knew from the lands and seas and people bound to this alien peninsula by loss and grief and revenge decreed she knew all this she knew the king very well her life depended on that she did not often stray across the line that was always there invisible but inviolate when she did it was likely to be over something as apparently trivial as this it was such a paradox for her how he could shrug off or laugh at or even invite her caustic commentary on court and colony and yet bridle like a boy with affronted pride if she teased about his ability to run up and down a mountain in a morning at such times he had only to say her name in a certain way and endless chasms opened before her in the delicately inlaid floor of the audience chamber she was a captive here more slave than courtesan at the court of a tyrant she was also an impostor living an ongoing lie while her country slowly died away from the memories of men and she had sworn to kill this man whose glance across a room was as wildfire on her skin or amber wine in her mortal blood chasms everywhere she turned and now this morning he had seen a riselka he and very possibly a second man as well fighting back her fear she forced herself to shrug casually to arch her eyebrows above a face schooled to bland unconcern this amuses me she said reaching for selfpossession knowing precisely what his need in her was even now especially now you profess to be pleased even touched by soloress doubtlessly agitated query about your mountain run the first thing she asked you say how she must have wondered whether or not you succeeded and yet when i knowing as surely as i know my own name that you were up on the summit this morning treat it lightly as something small never in doubt why then the king grows angry he bids me sternly to have done but tell me my lord in all fairness which of us truly has honored you more for a long time he was silent and she knew that the court would be avidly marking the expression on his face for the moment she cared nothing for them or even for her past or his encounter on the mountainside there was one specific chasm here that began and ended in the depths of the grey eyes that were now searching her own when he spoke it was in a different voice again but this tone she happened to know exceedingly well and in spite of everything that had just been said and in spite of where they were and who was watching them she felt herself go weak suddenly her legs trembled but not with fear now i could take you said brandin king of ygrath thickly his face flushed on the floor of this room right now before all of my gathered court her throat was dry she felt a nerve flutter beneath the skin of her wrist her own color was high she knew she swallowed with some difficulty perhaps tonight would be wiser she murmured trying to keep her tone light but not really managing it unable to hide the swift response in her eyes spark to spark like the onset of a blaze the jeweled khav chalice trembled in her hand he saw that and she saw that he did and that her response as always served as kindling for his own desire she sipped at her drink holding it with both hands clinging to selfcontrol better tonight surely she said again overwhelmed as always by what was happening to her she knew what he needed her to say though now at this moment in this room of state thronged with his court and emissaries from home she said it looking him in the eyes articulating carefully after all my lord at your age you should marshal your strength you did run partway up a hill this morning an instant later for the second time the chiaran court of brandin of ygrath saw their king throw back his handsome bearded head and they heard him laugh aloud in delight not far away rhun the fool cackled in simultaneous glee isolla of ygrath this time there were trumpets and a drum as well as the heralds staff resounding as it struck the floor by the double doors at the southern end of the audience chamber standing most of the way towards the throne dianora had time to observe the stately progress of the woman brandin had called the finest musician in ygrath the assembled court of chiara was lined several rows deep flanking the approach to the king a handsome woman still murmured neso of ygrath and shes fifty years old if shes a day somehow he had managed to end up next to her in the front row his unctuous tone irritated her as always but she tried not to let it show isolla was clad in the simplest possible robe of dark blue belted at the waist with a slender gold chain her hair brown with hints of grey was cut unfashionably short although the spring and summer fashion might change after today dianora thought the colony always took its cue in these matters from ygrath isolla walked confidently not hurrying down the aisle formed by the courtiers brandin was already smiling a welcome he was always immensely pleased when one or another of ygraths artists made the long often dangerous sea voyage to his second court several steps behind isolla and carrying her lute in its case as if it were an artifact of immeasurable worth dianora saw with genuine surprise the poet camena di chiara clad in his ubiquitous triplelayered cloak there were murmurs from the assembly she wasnt the only one caught off guard by this instinctively she threw a glance across the aisle to where doarde stood with his wife and daughter she was in time to see the spasm of hate and fear that flickered across his face as his younger rival approached an instant later the revealing expression was gone replaced by a polished mask of sneering disdain at camenas vulgar lowering of himself to serve as porter for an ygrathen still dianora considered this was an ygrathen court camena she guessed in a flash of intuition had probably had one of his verses set to music if isolla was about to sing a song of his it would be a dazzling coup for the chiaran poet more than sufficient to explain why he would offer to further exalt isolla and ygrathen artists by serving as a bearer for her the politics of art dianora decided was at least as complex as that of provinces and nations isolla had stopped as was proper about fifteen steps from the dais of the island throne very close to where dianora and neso stood neatly she proceeded to perform the triple obeisance very graciously a mark of high honor brandin rose to his feet to bid her welcome he was smiling so was rhun behind him and to his left for no reason she would ever afterwards be able to name or explain dianora turned from monarch and musician back to the poet bearing the lute camena had stopped a further half a dozen paces behind isolla and had knelt on the marble floor what detracted from the grace of the tableau was the dilation of his eyes nilth leaves dianora concluded instantly hes drugged himself she saw beads of perspiration on the poets brow it was not warm in the audience chamber you are most welcome isolla brandin was saying with genuine pleasure it has been far too long since we have seen you or heard you play dianora saw camena make a small adjustment in the way he held the lute she thought he was preparing to open the case it did not look like an ordinary lute though in fact afterwards she was able to know one thing only with certainty it had been the story of the riselka that made her so sharp to see the story and the fact that brandin wasnt certain if the second man his guard had seen her or not one man meant a fork in the path two men meant a death either way something was to happen and now it did all eyes but hers were on brandin and isolla only dianora saw camena slip the velvet cover off the lute only dianora saw that it was not in fact a lute and only she had heard brandins tale of the riselka die isolla of ygathl camena screamed hoarsely his eyes bulged as he hurled the velvet away and leveled the crossbow he carried with the lightning reaction of a man half his years brandin reflexively threw out his hand to cast a sorcerers shield around the threatened singer exactly as he was expected to dianora realized brandin no she screamed its you and seizing the gapemouthed neso of ygrath by the near shoulder she propelled herself and him both into the aisle the crossbow bolt aimed meticulously to the left of isolla on a line for brandins heart buried itself instead in the shoulder of a stupefied neso he shrieked in pain and shock her momentum drove dianora stumbling to her knees beside isolla she looked up and for the rest of her days never forgot the look she met in the singers eyes she turned away from it the emotion the hatred was too raw she felt physically ill trembling with aftershock she forced herself to stand she looked at brandin he hadnt even lowered his hand there was still the shimmer of a protective barrier around isolla who had never been in danger at all the guards had camena by now hed been dragged to his feet dianora had never seen anyone look so white even his eyes were white from the drug for a moment she thought he was going to faint but then camena threw his head back as far as he could in the iron grip of the ygrathen soldiers he opened his mouth as if in agony chiara he cried once and then freedom for chiara before they silenced him brutally the echoes rang for a long time the room was large and the stillness was almost absolute no one dared to move dianora had a sense that the court wasnt even breathing no one wanted the slightest attention drawn to them on the mosaicinlaid floor neso moaned again in fear and pain breaking the tableau two soldiers knelt to tend to him dianora was still afraid she was going to be sick she couldnt make her hands stop trembling isolla of ygrath had not moved she could not move dianora realized brandin was holding her in a mindlock like a flower pressed flat on a sheet the soldiers lifted neso and helped him from the room dianora stepped back herself leaving isolla alone before the king fifteen very proper paces away camena was a tool brandin said softly chiara has virtually nothing to do with this do not think that i am unaware of that i can offer you nothing now but an easier death you must tell me why you did this his voice was rigidly measured careful and uninflected dianora had never heard such a tone from him she looked at rhun the fool was weeping tears streaking his distorted features brandin lowered his hand freeing isolla to move and speak the blazing flash of hatred left her features in its place was a defiant pride dianora wondered if she had actually thought the deception would work if after the king had been slain she had really expected to walk freely from this room and if not if she had not expected to do so what did that mean holding herself very straight isolla gave part of an answer i am dying she said to brandin the physicians have given me less than a season before the growth inside reaches my brain already there are songs i can no longer remember songs that have been mine for forty years i am sorry to hear it said brandin formally his courtesy so perfect it seemed a violation of human nature he said all of us die isolla some very young not all of us plot the death of our king you have more to tell me before i may grant you release from pain for the first time isolla seemed to waver she lowered her gaze from his eerily serene grey eyes only after a long moment did she say you had to have known that there would be a price for what you did exactly what is it that i did her head came up you exalted a dead child above the living one and revenge above your wife and more highly than your own land have you spared a thought a fraction of a thought for any of them while you pursued your unnatural vengeance for stevan dianoras heart thudded painfully it was a name not spoken in chiara she saw brandins lips tighten in a way she had seen only a handful of times but when he spoke his voice was as rigidly controlled as before i judged that i had considered them fairly girald has governance in ygrath as he was always going to have he even has my saishan as a symbol of that dorotea i invited here several times a year for the first several years invited here that she might wither and grow old while you kept yourself young a thing no sorcererking of ygrath has ever done before lest the gods punish the land for that impiety but for ygrath you never spared a thought did you and girald he is no king his father is that is your title not his what does the key to a saishan mean against that reality he is even going to die before you brandin unless you are slain and what will happen then it is unnatural it is all unnatural and there is a price to be paid there is always a price he said softly a price for everything even for living i had not expected to pay it in my own family there was a silence isolla i must extend my years to do what i am here to do then you pay for it isolla repeated and girald pays and dorotea and ygrath and tigana dianora thought no longer trembling her own ache come back like a wound in her tigana pays too in broken statues and fallen towers in children slain and a name gone she watched brandins face and rhuns i hear you the king said at length to the singer i have heard more than you have chosen to say i need only one thing further you must tell me which of them did this it was said with visible regret rhuns ugly face was screwed up tightly his hands gestured with a random helplessness and why said isolla drawing herself up and speaking with the frigid hauteur of one who had nothing left to lose should you imagine their purposes to be at odds in this why the one or the other king of ygrath her voice rang out harsh as the message it bore slowly he nodded the hurt was clear in him now dianora could see it in the way he stood and spoke however much he controlled himself she didnt even need to look at rhun very well brandin said and you isolla what could they have offered to make you do this thing can you really hate me so much the woman hesitated only for an instant then as proudly as defiantly as before she said i can love the queen so much brandin closed his eyes how so in all the ways that you forsook when you chose exile here and love of the dead over the heart and the bed of your wife in any normal any halfway normal time there would have been a reaction to this from the court there would have had to be dianora heard nothing though only the sound of a great many people breathing carefully as brandin opened his eyes again to look down upon the singer there was an unveiled triumph in the ygrathen womans face she was invited here he repeated almost wistfully i could have compelled her but i chose not to do so she had made her feelings clear and i left the choice to her i thought it was the kinder fairer action it would appear that my sin lies in not having ordered her to take ship for this peninsula so many different griefs and shapes of pain seemed to be warring for preeminence within dianora behind the king she could see deymon his face was a sickly grey he met her eyes for only an instant then quickly looked away later she might think of ways to use this sudden ascendancy over him but right now she felt only pity for the man he would offer to resign tonight she knew offer probably to kill himself after the old fashion brandin would refuse but after this nothing would be quite the same for a great many reasons brandin said i think you have told me what i had need to know the chiaran acted alone isolla volunteered unexpectedly she gestured at camena in the bonecracking grip of the soldiers behind her he joined us when he visited ygrath two years ago our purposes appeared to march together this far brandin nodded this far he echoed quietly i thought that might be the case thank you for confirming it he added gravely there was a silence you promised me an easy death isolla said holding herself very straight i did brandin said i did promise you that dianora stopped breathing the king looked at isolla without expression for what seemed an unbearably long time you can have no idea he said at last in a voice little above a whisper how happy i was that you had come to make music for me again then he moved his right hand in exactly the same casual gesture he would use to dismiss a servant or a petitioner isollas head exploded like an overripe fruit smashed with a hammer dark blood burst from her neck as her body collapsed like a sack dianora was standing too near the blood of the slain woman spattered thickly on her gown and face she stumbled backwards a hideous illusion of reptilian creatures was coiling and twisting in the place where isollas head had been mashed to a formless oozing pulp there was screaming everywhere and a frenzied pandemonium as the court backed away one figure suddenly ran forward stumbling almost falling in its haste the figure jerked out a sword then awkwardly with great clumsy twohanded slashes rhun the fool began hacking at the dead body of the singer his face was weirdly distorted with rage and revulsion foam and mucus ran from his mouth and nose with one savage butchers blow he severed an arm from the womans torso something dark and green and blind appeared to undulate from the stump of isollas shoulder leaving a trail of glistening black slime behind dianora someone gagged with horror stevan she heard rhun cry brokenly and amid nausea and chaos and terror an overwhelming pity suddenly laid hard siege to her heart she looked at the frantically laboring fool clad exactly like the king bearing a kings sword spittle flew from his mouth music stevan music stevan rhun shouted obsessively and with each slurred ferocious articulation of the words his slender jeweled court sword went up and down glinting brilliantly in the streaming light hewing the dead body like meat he lost his footing on the slippery floor and fell to his knees with the force of his own fury a grey thing with eyes on waving stalks appeared to attach itself like a bloodleech to his knee music rhun said one last time softly with unexpected clarity then the sword slipped through his fingers and he sat in a puddle of blood beside the mutilated corpse of the singer his balding head slewed awkwardly down and to one side his whiteandgold court garments hopelessly soiled weeping as though his heart was broken dianora turned to brandin the king was motionless standing exactly as he had been throughout his hands relaxed at his sides he gazed at the appalling scene in front of him with a frightening detachment there is always a price he said quietly almost to himself through the incessant screaming and tumult that filled the audience chamber dianora took one hesitant step towards him then but he had already turned and with deymon quickly following brandin left the room through the door behind the dais with his departure the slithering oleaginous creatures immediately disappeared but not the mangled body of the singer or the pitiful crumpled figure of the fool dianora seemed to be alone near them everyone else had surged back towards the doors isollas blood felt hot where it had landed on her skin people were tripping and pushing each other in their frantic haste to quit the room now that the king was gone she saw the soldiers hustling camena di chiara away through a side door other soldiers came forward with a sheet to cover isollas body they had to move rhun away to do it he didnt seem to understand what was happening he was still weeping his face grotesquely screwed up like a hurt childs dianora moved a hand to wipe at her cheek and her fingers came away streaked with blood the soldiers placed the sheet over the singers body one of them gingerly picked up the arm rhun had severed and pushed it under the sheet as well dianora saw him do that there seemed to be blood all over her face on the very edge of losing all control she looked around for help any kind of help come my lady said a desperately needed voice that was somehow by her side come let me take you back to the saishan oh scelto she whispered please please do that scelto the news blazed through the dry tinder of the saishan setting it afire with rumor and fear an assassination attempt from ygrath with chiaran participation and it had very nearly succeeded scelto hustled dianora down the corridor to her rooms and with a bristling protectiveness slammed the door on the nervous fluttering crowd that clung and hovered in the hallway like so many silkclad moths murmuring continuously he undressed and washed her and then wrapped her carefully into her warmest robe she was shivering uncontrollably unable to speak he lit the fire and made her sit before it in docile submission she drank the mahgoti tea he prepared as a sedative two cups of it one after the other eventually the trembling stopped she still found it difficult to speak he made her stay in the chair before the fire she didnt want to leave it anyway her brain felt battered numb she seemed to be utterly incapable of marshaling any understanding of shaping an adequate response to what had just happened one thought only kept driving the others away pounding in her head like the hammer of a heralds staff on the floor a thought so impossible so disabling that she tried with all she could through the blinding pulse of an onrushing headache to block it out she couldnt the hammering crashed through again and again she had saved his life tigana had been a single pulsebeat away from coming back into the world the pulsebeat of brandin that the crossbow would have ended home was a dream shed had yesterday a place where children used to play among towers near the mountains by a river on curving sweeps of white or golden sand beside a palace at the edge of the sea home was a longing a desperate dream a name in her dreams and this afternoon she had done the one thing she could possibly have done to bar that name from the world to lock it into a dream until all the dreams too died how was she to deal with that how possibly cope with what it meant she had come here to kill brandin of ygrath to end his life that lost tigana might live again and instead the shivering started once more fussing and murmuring scelto built up the fire and brought yet another blanket for her knees and feet when he saw the tears on her face he made a queer helpless sound of distress someone knocked loudly on her door sometime later and she heard scelto driving them away with language she had never known him to use before gradually very slowly she began to pull herself together from the color of the light that gently drifted down through the high windows she knew that the afternoon would be waning towards dusk she rubbed her cheeks and eyes with the backs of her hands she sat up she had to be ready when twilight came twilight was when brandin sent to the saishan she rose from her chair pleased to find that her legs were steadier scelto rushed up protesting but when he saw her face he quickly checked himself without another word he led her through the inner doors and down that hallway to the baths his ferocious glare silenced the attendants there she had a sense that he would have struck them if they had spoken she had never heard of him doing a single violent act not since he had killed a man and lost his own manhood she let them bathe her let the scented oils soften her skin there had been blood on it that afternoon the waters swirled around her and then away the attendants washed her hair after scelto painted the nails of her fingers and toes a soft shade dusty rose far from the color of blood far from anger or grief later she would paint her lips the same shade she doubted they would make love though she would hold him and be held she went back to her room to wait for the summons from the light she knew when evening had fallen everyone in the saishan always knew when evening fell the day revolved towards and then away from the hour of darkness she sent scelto outside to receive the word when it came a short time after he came back and told her that brandin had sent for solores anger flamed wildly within her it exploded like like the head of isolla of ygrath in the audience chamber dianora could scarcely draw breath so fierce was her sudden rage never in her life had she felt anything like this this white hot caldron in her heart after tigana fell after her brother was driven away her hatred had been a shaped thing controlled channeled driven by purpose a guarded flame that shed known would have to burn a long time this was an inferno a caldron boiling over inside her prodigious overmastering sweeping all before it like a lava flow had brandin been in her room at that moment she could have ripped his heart out with her nails and teeth as the women tore adaon on the mountainside she saw scelto take an involuntary backwards step away from her she had never known him to fear her or anyone else before it was not an observation that mattered now what mattered all that mattered the only thing was that she had saved the life of brandin of ygrath today trampling into muck and spattered blood the clear unsullied memory of her home and the oath shed sworn in coming here so long ago she had violated the essence of everything she once had been violated herself more cruelly than had any man whod ever lain with her for a coin in that upstairs room in certando and in return in return brandin had just sent for solores di corte leaving her to spend tonight alone not not a thing he should have done it did not matter that even within the fiery heat of her own blazing dianora could understand why he might have done this thing understand how little need he would have tonight for wit or intelligence for sparkle for questions or suggestions or desire his need would be for the soft unthinking reflexive gentleness that solores gave that she herself apparently did not the cradling worship tenderness the soothing voice he would need shelter tonight she could understand it was what she needed too needed desperately after what had happened but she needed it from him and so it came to be that alone in her bed that night sheltered by no one and by nothing dianora found herself naked and unable to hide from what came when the fires of rage finally died she lay unsleeping through the first and then through the second chiming of the bells that marked off the triads of the dark hours but before the third chiming that heralded the coming of grey dawn two things had happened within her the first was the inexorable return of the single strand of memory shed always been careful to block out from among all the myriad griefs of the year tigana was occupied but she truly was unsheltered and exposed in the dark of that ember night drifting terribly far from whatever moorings her soul had found while brandin on the far wing of the palace sought what comfort he could in solores di corte dianora lay as in an open space and alone unable to deflect any of the images that now came sweeping back from years ago images of love and pain and the loss of love in pain that were far too keen too icy keen a wind in the heart to be allowed at any normal time but the finger of death had rested on brandin of ygrath that day and she alone had guided it away steering the king past the darkest portal of morian and tonight was an ember night a night of ghosts and shadows it could not be anything like a normal time and it was not what came to dianora terribly one after another in unceasing progression like waves of the dark sea were her last memories of her brother before he went away he had been too young to fight by the deisa no one under fifteen prince valentin had proclaimed before riding sternly north to war alessan the princes youngest child had been taken away south in hiding by danoleon the high priest of eanna when word came that brandin was coming down upon them that was after stevan had been slain after the one victory they had all known the weary men who had fought and survived and the women and the aged and the children left behind that brandins coming would mark the end of the world they had lived in and loved they hadnt known then how literally true that was what the sorcererking of ygrath could do and what he did this they were to learn in the days and months that followed as a hard and brutal thing that grew like a tumor and then festered in the souls of those who survived the dead of deisa are the lucky ones so it was said more and more often in whispers and in pain in the year tigana died by those who endured the dying dianora and her brother were left with a mother whose mind had snapped like a bowstring with the tidings of second deisa even as the vanguard of the ygrathens entered the city itself occupying the streets and squares of tigana the noble houses and the delicately colored palace by the sea she seemed to let slip her last awareness of the world to wander mute and gentle through a space neither of her children could travel to with her sometimes she would smile and nod at invisible things as she sat amid the rubble of their courtyard that summer with smashed marble all around her and her daughters heart would ache like an old wound in the rains of winter dianora set herself to run the household as best she could though three of the servants and apprentices had died with her father two others ran away not long after the ygrathens came and the destruction began she couldnt even blame them only one of the women and the youngest of the apprentices stayed with them her brother and the apprentice waited until the long wave of burnings and demolition had passed then they sought work clearing away rubble or repairing walls as a limited rebuilding started under ygrathen orders life began to return towards a normality or what passed for normality in a city now called lower corte in a province of that name in a world where the very word tigana could not be heard by anyone other than themselves soon they stopped using it in public places the pain was too great the twisting feeling inside that came with the blank look of incomprehension on the faces of the ygrathens or the traders and bankers from corte who had swarmed quickly down to seek what profit they could among the rubble and the slow rebuilding of a city it was a hurt for which truly there was no name dianora could remember with jagged sharpedged clarity the first time shed called her home lower corte they all could all the survivors it was for each of them a moment embedded like a fish hook in the soul the dead of deisa first or second were the lucky ones so the phrase went that year she watched her brother come into a bitter maturity that first summer and fall grieving for his vanished smile laughter lost the childhood too soon gone not knowing how deeply the same hard lessons and absences were etched in her own hollow unlovely face she was sixteen in the late summer he turned fifteen in the fall she made a cake on his naming day for the apprentice the one old woman her mother her brother and herself they had no guests assembly of any kind was forbidden throughout that year her mother had smiled when dianora gave her a slice of the dark cake but dianora had known the smile had nothing to do with any of them her brother had known it too preternaturally grave he had kissed his mother on the forehead and then his sister and had gone out into the night it was of course illegal to be abroad after nightfall but something kept driving him out to walk the streets past the random fires that still smoldered on almost every corner it was as if he was daring the ygrathen patrols to catch him to punish him for having been fourteen in the season of war two soldiers were knifed in the dark that fall twenty deathwheels were hoisted in swift response six women and five children were among those bound aloft to die dianora knew most of them there werent so very many people left in the city they all knew each other the screaming of the children then their diminishing cries were things she needed shelter from in her nights forever after no more soldiers were killed her brother continued to go out at night she would lie awake until she heard him come in he always made a sound deliberately so she would hear him and be able to fall asleep somehow he knew she would be awake though she had never said a word he would have been handsome with his dark hair and deep brown eyes if he hadnt been so thin and if the eyes were not shadowed and ringed by sleeplessness and grief there was not a great deal of food that first winter most of the harvest had been burned and the rest confiscated but dianora did the best she could to feed the five of them about the look in his eyes there was nothing she could do everyone had that look that year she could see it in her mirror the following spring the ygrathen soldiers discovered a new form of sport it had probably been inevitable that they would one of the evil growths that sprang from the deepsown seeds of brandins vengeance dianora remembered being at an upstairs window the day it began she was watching her brother and the apprentice no longer an apprentice of course walking through a sunbrightened early morning across the square on their way to the site where they were laboring white clouds had been drifting by overhead scudding with the wind a small cluster of soldiers came from the opposite side and accosted the two boys her window was open to air the room and catch the freshness of the breeze she heard it all help us one of the soldiers bleated with a smirk she could see from her window were lost he moaned as the others quickly surrounded the boys he drew sly chuckles from his fellows one of them elbowed another in the ribs where are we the soldier begged eyes carefully lowered her brother named the square and the streets leading from it thats no good the soldier complained what good are street names to me i dont even know what cursed town im in there was laughter dianora winced at what she heard in it lower corte the apprentice muttered quickly as her brother kept silent they noticed the silence though what town you tell me the spokesman said more sharply prodding her brother in the shoulder i just told you lower corte the apprentice intervened loudly one of the soldiers cuffed him on the side of the head the boy staggered and almost fell he refused to lift a hand to touch his head her pulse pounding with fright dianora saw her brother look up then his dark hair gleamed in the morning sunlight she thought he was going to strike the soldier who had dealt that blow she thought he was going to die she stood up at her window her hands clenched on the ledge there was a terrible silence in the square below the sun was very bright lower corte her brother said as though he were choking on the words laughing raucously the soldiers let them go for that morning the two boys became the favorite victims of that company which patrolled their district between the palace by the sea and the center of town where the three temples stood none of the temples of the triad had been smashed only the statuary that stood outside and within them two had been her fathers work a young seductively graceful morian and a huge primal figure of eanna stretching forth her hands to make the stars the boys began leaving the house earlier and earlier as spring wore on taking roundabout routes in an attempt to avoid the soldiers most mornings though they were still found the ygrathens were bored by then the boys very efforts to elude them offered sport dianora used to go to that same upstairs window at the front of the house when they left by way of the square as if by watching whatever happened sharing it she could somehow spread the pain among three not two and so ease it for them the soldiers almost always accosted them just as they reached the square she was watching on the day the game changed to something worse it was afternoon that time a halfday of work only because of a triad holiday part of the aftermath to the springtime ember days the ygrathens like the barbadians to the east had been scrupulous not to tamper with the triad and their clergy after their lunch the two boys went out to do an afternoons work the soldiers surrounded them in the middle of the square they never seemed to tire of their sport but that afternoon just as the leader began his familiar litany of being lost a group of four merchants came trudging up the hill from the harbor and one of the soldiers had an inspiration born of sheerest malice stop he rasped the merchants did very abruptly one obeyed ygrathen commands in lower corte wherever one might be from come here the soldier added his fellows made way for the merchants to stand in front of the boys a premonition of something evil touched dianora in that moment like a cold finger on her spine the four traders reported that they were from asoli it was obvious from their clothing good the soldier said i know how grasping you lot are now listen to me these brats are going to name their city and their province to you if you can tell me what they say on my honor and in the name of brandin king of ygrath ill give the first man who says the name back to me twenty gold ygras it was a fortune even from where she sat high up and screened behind her window dianora could see the asoli traders react that was before she closed her eyes she knew what was coming and how it was going to hurt she wanted her father alive in that moment with a longing so acute she almost wept her brother was down there though among soldiers who hated them she forced back her tears and opened her eyes she watched you said the soldier to the apprentice they always started with him your province had another name once tell them what it was she saw the boy naddo was his name go white with fear or anger or both the four merchants oblivious to that irrelevance leaned forward straining with anticipation dianora saw naddo look at her brother for guidance or perhaps for dispensation the soldier saw the glance none of that he snapped then he drew his sword for your life say the name naddo very clearly said tigana and of course not one of the merchants could say back the word he spoke not for twenty golden ygras or twenty times so many dianora could read the bafflement the balked greed in their eyes and the fear that confronting sorcery always brought the soldiers laughed and jostled each other one of them had a shrill cackle like a rooster they turned to her brother no he said flatly before they could even command him you have had your sport they cannot hear the name we all know it what is left to prove he was fifteen and much too thin and his darkbrown hair was too long over his eyes it had been over a month since shed cut it for him shed been meaning to do so all week one of her hands was squeezing the windowledge so tightly that all the blood had rushed away it was white as ice she would have cut it off to change what was happening she noticed other faces at other windows along the street and across the square some people had stopped down below as well seeing the large clustering of men sensing the sudden tension that had taken shape which was bad because with an audience the soldiers would now have to clearly establish their authority what had been a game when done in private was something else now dianora wanted to turn away she wanted her father back from the deisa she wanted prince valentin back and alive her mother back from whatever country she wandered through she watched to share it to bear witness and remember knowing even then that such things were going to matter if anything mattered in the days and years to come the soldier with the drawn blade placed the tip of it very carefully against her brothers breast the afternoon sunlight glinted from it it was a working blade a soldiers sword there came a small sound from the people gathered around the edges of the square her brother said a little desperately they cannot hold the name you know they cannot you have destroyed us is it necessary to go on causing pain is it necessary he is only fifteen dianora prayed gripping the ledge like death her hand a claw he was too young to fight he was not allowed forgive him this please the four asolini traders as one man stepped quickly out of range one of the soldiers the one with the high laugh shifted uncomfortably as if regretting what this had come to but there was a crowd gathered the boy had had his fair chance there was really no choice now the sword pushed delicately forward a short way and then withdrew through a torn blue tunic a welling of blood appeared and hung a moment bright in the springtime light as if yearning towards the blade before it broke and slid downwards staining the blue the name said the soldier quietly there was no levity in his voice now he was a professional and he was preparing himself to kill dianora realized a witness a memory she saw her younger brother spread his feet then as if to anchor himself in the ground of the square she saw his hands clench into fists at his sides she saw his head go back lifting towards the sky and then she heard his cry he gave them what they demanded of him he obeyed the command but not sullenly or diffidently and not in shame rooted in the land of his fathers standing before the home of his family he looked towards the sun and let a name burst forth from his soul tigana he cried that all should hear all of them everyone in the square and again louder yet tigana and then a third a last time at the very summit of his voice with pride with love with a lasting unredeemed defiance of the heart tigana through the square that cry rang along the streets up to the windows where people watched over the roofs of houses running westward to the sea or eastward to the temples and far beyond all of these a sound a name a hurled sorrow in the brightness of the air and though the four merchants could not cling to the name though the soldiers could not hold it the women at the windows and the children with them and the men riveted stonestill in street and square could hear it clearly and clutch it to themselves and they could gather and remember the pride at the base of that spiraling cry and that much looking around the soldiers could see plainly and understand it was written in the faces gathered around them he had done only what they themselves had ordered him to do but the game had been turned inside out it had turned out wrong in some way they could but dimly comprehend they beat him of course with their fists and feet and with the flats of their caredfor blades naddo too for being there and so a part of it the crowd did not disperse though which would have been the usual thing when a beating took place they watched in a silence unnatural for so many people the only sound was that of the blows falling for neither boy cried out and the soldiers did not speak when it was over they scattered the crowd with oaths and imprecations crowds were illegal even though they themselves had caused this one to form in a few moments everyone was gone there were only faces behind halfdrawn curtains at upstairs windows looking down on a square empty save for two boys lying in the settling dust blood bright on their clothing in the clear light there had been birds singing all around and all through what had happened dianora could remember she forced herself to remain where she was not to run down to them to let them do this alone as was their right and at length she saw her brother rise with the slow meditated movements of a very old man she saw him speak to naddo and then carefully help him to his feet and then as she had known would happen she saw him begrimed and bleeding and hobbling very badly lead naddo east without a backwards looks towards the site where they were assigned to work that day she watched them go her eyes were dry only when the two of them turned the corner at the far end of the square and so were gone from sight did she leave her window only then did she loosen her whiteclawed hold on the wood of the windowledge and only then invisible to everyone with her curtains drawn did she allow her tears to fall in love and for his hurts and terrible pride when they came home that night she and the servantwoman heated water and drew baths for them and afterwards they dealt with the wounds and the black and purpling bruises as best they could later over dinner naddo told them he was leaving that same night he said it was too much he said awkwardly twisting in his seat speaking to dianora for her brother had turned his face away at naddos first announcement there was no life to be made here naddo said with passionate urgency through a torn and swollen mouth not with the viciousness of the soldiers and the even more vicious taxes if a young man a young man such as himself was to have any hope of doing something with his life naddo said he had to get away desperately his eyes besought her understanding he kept glancing nervously over to where her brother had now fully turned his back on both of them where will you go dianora had asked him asoli hed told her it was a hard wet land unbearably hot and humid in summer everyone knew that but there was room there for new blood the asolini made people welcome hed heard more so than in the barbadian lands to the east he would never ever go to corte or chiara people from tigana did not go there he said her brother made a small sound at that but did not turn naddo glanced over at him again and swallowed his adams apple bobbing in his throat three other young men had made plans he said to dianora plans to slip out from the city tonight and make their way north hed known about it for some time he said he hadnt been sure he hadnt known what to do what had happened this morning had made up his mind for him eanna light your path dianora had said meaning it he had been a good apprentice and then a brave and loyal friend people were leaving all the time the province of lower corte was a bad place in a very bad time naddos left eye was completely swollen shut he might easily have been killed that afternoon later when hed packed his few belongings and was ready to leave she gave him some silver from her fathers hidden store she kissed him in farewell hed begun weeping then he commended himself to her mother and opened the front door on the threshold hed turned back again still crying goodbye hed said in anguish to the figure staring stonily into the fire on the frontroom hearth seeing the look on naddos face dianora silently willed her brother to turn around he did not deliberately he knelt and laid another log on the fire naddo stared at him a moment longer then he turned to look at dianora failed to achieve a tremulous tearful smile and slipped out into the dark and away much later when the fire had been allowed to die her brother went out as well dianora sat and watched the embers slowly fade then she looked in on her mother and went to bed when she lay down it seemed to her that a weight was pressing upon her body far heavier than the quilted comforter she was awake when he came in she always was she heard him step loudly on the landing as was his habit to let her know he was safely home but she didnt hear the next sound which should have been the opening and closing of his bedroom door it was very late she lay still for another moment surrounded and mastered by all the griefs of the day then moving heavily as if drugged or in a waking dream she rose and lit a candle she went to her door and opened it he was standing in the hallway outside and by the flickering of the light she bore she saw the river of tears that was pouring without surcease down his bruised distorted face her hands began to shake she could not speak why didnt i say goodbye to him she heard him say in a strangled voice why didnt you make me say goodbye to him she had never heard so much hurt in him not even when word had come that their father had died by the river her heart aching dianora put the candle down on a ledge that once had held a portrait bust of her mother by her father she crossed the narrow distance and took her brother in her arms absorbing the hard racking of his sobs he had never cried before or never so that she could see she guided him into her room and lay down beside him on her bed holding him close they wept together thus for a very long time she could not have said how long her window was open she could hear the breeze sigh through the young leaves outside a bird sang and another answered it from across the lane the world was a place of dreaming or of sorrow one or both of those one or both in the sanctuary of night she slowly pulled his tunic over his head careful of his wounds and then she slipped free of her own robe her heart was beating like the heart of a captured forest creature she could feel the race of his pulse when her fingers touched his throat both of the moons had set the wind was in all the leaves outside and so and so in all that darkness dark over and about and closegathered around them the full dark of moonless night and the darkness of their days the two of them sought a pitiful illicit shelter in each other from the ruin of their world what are we doing her brother whispered once and then a space of time later when pulsebeats had slowed again leaving them clinging to each other in the aftermath of a headlong terrifying need he had said one hand gentle in her hair what have we done and all these long years later alone in the saishan on the island as this most hidden memory came back dianora could remember her reply oh baerd shed said what has been done to us it lasted from that first night through the whole of spring and into the summer the sin of the gods it was named what they did for adaon and eanna were said to have been brother and sister at the beginning of time and morian was their child dianora didnt feel like a goddess and her mirror offered no illusions only a too thin face with enormous staring eyes she knew only that her happiness terrified her and consumed her with guilt and that her love for baerd was the whole of her world and what frightened her almost as much was seeing the same depth of love the same astonished passion in him her heart misgave her constantly even as they reached for their fugitive joy too bright this forbidden flame in a land where any kind of brightness was lost or not allowed he came to her every night the woman slept downstairs their mother slept and woke in her own world in the dark of dianoras room they escaped into each other reaching through loss and the knowledge of wrong in search of innocence he was still driven to go out some nights to walk the empty streets not as often as before for which she gave thanks and sought a kind of justification for herself a number of young men had been caught after curfew and killed on the wheels that spring if what she was doing kept him alive she would face whatever judgment lay in wait for her in morians halls she couldnt keep him every night though sometimes a need she could not share or truly understand would drive him forth he tried to explain how the city was different under the two moons or one of them or the stars how softer light and shadow let him see it as tigana again how he could walk silently down towards the sea and come upon the darkened palace and how the rubble and ruin of it could somehow be rebuilt in his mind in darkness towards what it had been before he had a need for that he said he never baited the soldiers and promised her he never would he didnt even want to see them he said they crashed into the illusions he wanted he just needed to be abroad inside his memory of the city that had gone sometimes baerd told her he would slip through gaps he knew in the harbor walls and walk along the beach listening to the sea by day he labored a thin boy at a strong mans job helping to rebuild what they were permitted to rebuild rich merchants from corte their ancient enemies had been allowed to settle in the city to buy up the smashed buildings and residential palaces very inexpensively and to set about restoring them for their own purposes baerd would come home at the end of a day sometimes with gashes and fresh bruises and once the mark of a whip across his shoulders she knew that if one company of soldiers had ended their sport with him there were others to pick it up it was only happening here shed heard everywhere else the soldiers restrained themselves and the king of ygrath was governing with care to consolidate his provinces against barbadior in lower corte they were special though they had killed his son she would see those marks on baerd and she had not the heart to ask him to deny himself his lost city at night when the need rose in him even though she lived a hundred terrors and died half a hundred deaths every time the front door closed behind him after dark until she heard it open again and heard his loved familiar footstep on the stairs and then the landing and then he came into her room to take and hold her in his arms it went on into summer and then it ended it all ended as her knowing heart had forewarned her from that first time in darkness listening to the birds singing and the wind in the trees outside he came home no later than he usually did from walking abroad one night when blue ilarion had been riding alone through a high lacework of clouds it had been a beautiful night she had sat up late by her window watching the moonlight falling on the rooftops shed been in bed when he came home though and her heart had quickened with the familiar intermingling of relief and guilt and need he had come into her room he didnt come to bed instead he sank into the chair shed sat in by the window with a queer numb feeling of dread she had struck tinder and lit her candle she sat up and looked at him his face was very white she could see that even by candlelight she said nothing she waited i was on the beach baerd said quietly i saw a riselka there she had always known it would end that it had to end she asked the instinctive question did anyone else see her he shook his head they looked at each other in silence she was amazed at how calm she was how steady her hands were upon the comforter and in that silence a truth came home to her one she had probably known for a long time you have only been staying for me in any case she said a statement no reproach in it he had seen a riselka he closed his eyes you knew yes she lied im sorry he said looking at her but she knew that this would be easier for him if she were able to hide how new and deathly cold this actually was for her a gift perhaps the last gift she would give him dont be sorry she murmured her hands lying still where he could see them truly i understand truly she did though her heart was a wounded thing a bird with one wing only fluttering in small circles to the ground the riselka he began and halted it was an enormous frightening thing she knew she makes it clear he went on earnestly the fork of the prophecy that i have to go away she saw the love for her in his eyes she willed herself to be strong enough strong enough to help him go away from her oh my brother she was thinking and will you leave me now she said i know she makes it clear baerd i know you have to leave it will be marked on the lines of your palm she swallowed this was harder than she could ever have imagined she said where will you go my love she added but not aloud only inside in her heart ive thought about that he said he sat up straighter now she could see him taking strength from her calm she clung to that with everything she had im going to look for the prince he said what alessan we dont even know if hes alive she said in spite of herself theres word he is baerd said that his mother is in hiding with the priests of eanna and that the prince has been sent away if there is any hope any dream for us for tigana it will lie with alessan hes fifteen years old she said could not stop herself from saying and so are you she thought baerd where did our childhood go by candlelight his dark eyes were not those of a boy i dont think age matters he said this is not going to be a quick or an easy thing if it can ever be done at all he will be older than fifteen when the time comes so will you she said and so will you baerd echoed oh dia what will you do no one else but her father ever called her that stupidly it was the name that nearly broke her control she shook her head i dont know she said honestly look after mother marry there is money for a while yet if im careful she saw his stricken look and moved to quell it you are not to worry about it baerd listen to me you have just seen a riselka will you fight your fate to clear rubble in this city for the rest of your days no one has easy choices anymore and mine will not be as hard as most i may she had added tilting her head defiantly try to think of some way to chase the same dream as you it astonished her looking back that she had actually said this on that very night as if she herself had seen the riselka and her own path had been made clear even as baerds forked away from her lonely and cold in the saishan she was not half so cold or alone as she had been that night he had not lingered once shed given her dispensation she had risen and dressed and helped him pack a very few things he had flatly refused any of the silver she assembled a small satchel of food for his first sunrise on the long road alone at the doorway in the darkness of the summer night they had held each other close clinging without words neither wept as if both knew the time for tears had passed if the goddesses love us and the god baerd said we will surely meet again i will think of you each and every day of my life i love you dianora and i you shed said to him i think you know how much eanna light your path and bring you home that was all shed said all she could think to say after hed gone she had sat in the front room wrapped in an old shawl of her mothers gazing sightlessly at the ashes of last nights fire until the sun came up by then the hard kernel of her own plan had been formed the plan that had brought her here all these years after to this other lonely bed on an ember night of ghosts when she should not have had to be alone alone with all her memories with the reawakening they carried and the awareness of what she had allowed to happen to her here on the island here in brandins court here with brandin and so it was that two things came to dianora that ember night in the saishan the memories of her brother had been the first sweeping over her in waves image after image until they ended with the ashes of that dead fire the second following inexorably born of that same longago year born of memory of guilt of the whirlwind hurts that came with lying here alone and so terribly exposed on this night of all nights the second thing spun forth from all these interwoven things was finally the shaping of a resolution a decision after so many years a course of action she now knew she was going to take had to take whatever might follow she lay there chilled hopelessly awake and she was aware that the cold she felt came far more from within than without somewhere in the palace she knew the torturers would be attending to camena di chiara who had tried to kill a tyrant and free his home who had done so knowing he would die and how he would die even now they would be with him administering their precise measures of pain with a professional pride in their skill they would be breaking his fingers one by one his wrists and his arms his toes and ankles and legs they would be doing it carefully even tenderly solicitously guarding the beat of his heart so that after they had broken his back which was always the last they could strap him alive on a wheel and take him out to the harbor square to die in the sight of his people she would never have dreamt camena had such courage or so much passion in his heart she had derided him as a poseur a wearer of threelayered cloaks a minor trivial artist angling for ascension at court not anymore yesterday afternoon had compelled a new shape to her image of him now that he had done what he had done now that his body had been given to the torturers and then the wheel there was a question that could no more be buried than could her memories of baerd not tonight not unsheltered as she was and so awake what the thought came knifing home like a winter wind in the soul did camenas act make her what did it make of that longago quest a sixteenyearold girl had so proudly set herself the night her brother went away the night hed seen a riselka under moonlight by the sea and gone in search of his prince she knew the answers of course she did she knew the names that belonged to her the names she had earned here on the island they burned like sour wine in a wound and burning inside even as she shivered dianora strove one more time to school her heart to begin the deathly hard never yet successful journey back to her own dominion from that room on the far wing of the palace where lay the king of ygrath that night was different though something had changed that night because of what had happened because of the finality the absoluteness of what she herself had done in the audience chamber acknowledging that trying to deal with it dianora began to sense as if from a very great distance her hearts slow painful retreat from the fires of love a returning and then a turning back to the memory of other fires at home fields burning a city burning a palace set aflame no comfort there of course no comfort anywhere at all only an absolute reminder of who she was and why she was here and lying very still in darkness on an ember night when country doors and windows were all closed against the dead and the magic in the fields dianora told over softly to herself the whole of the old foretelling verse one man sees a riselka his life forks there two men see a riselka one of them shall die three men see a riselka one is blessed one forks one shall die one woman sees a riselka her path comes clear to her two women see a riselka one of them shall bear a child three women see a riselka one is blessed one is clear one shall bear a child in the morning she said to herself amid cold and fire and all the myriad confusions of the heart in the morning it will begin as it should have begun and ended long ago the triad knew how bitter how impossible all choices had seemed to her how faint and elusive had been her dream within these walls of making it all come right for all of them but of one truth she was now finally certain she had needed something to be made clear along the twisting paths to betrayal that seemed to have become her life and from brandins own lips she had learned how that clear path might be offered her in the morning she would begin until then she could lie here achingly awake and alone as on another night at home so many years ago and she could remember part three ember to ember chapter it was cold in the gully by the side of the road there was a thin sheltering line of birch trees between them and the gates of the nievolene estate but even so the wind was a knife whenever it picked up there had been snow last night a rare thing this far north even in midwinter it had made for a white chilled second night of riding from ferraut town where they had started but alessan had refused to slow their pace he had said increasingly little as the night wore on and baerd said little at the best of times devin had swallowed his questions and concentrated on keeping up they had crossed the astibar border in darkness and arrived at the nievolene lands just after dawn the horses were tethered in a grove about a half mile to the southwest and the three men had made their way to this gully on foot devin dozed off at intervals through the morning the snow made the landscape strange and crisp and lovely when the sun was out but around midafternoon the grey clouds had gathered heavily overhead and it was only cold now not beautiful at all it had snowed again briefly about an hour before when devin heard the jingle of horses approaching through the greyness he realized that the triad for once were holding open palms toward them or that alternatively the goddesses and the god had decided to give them a chance to do something fatally rash he pressed himself as flat as he could to the wet ground of the gully he thought of catriana and the duke warm and sheltered with taccio in ferraut a company of about a dozen barbadian mercenaries materialized out of the grey landscape they were laughing and singing in boisterous exuberance their horses breath and their own made white puffs of smoke in the cold flat in the gully devin watched them go by he heard baerds soft breathing beside him the barbadians stopped at the gates of what had once been nievolene lands they werent anymore of course not since the confiscations of the fall the company leader dismounted and strode to the locked gates with a flourish that drew cheers and laughter from his men he unlocked the iron gates with two keys on an ornate chain first company alessan murmured under his breath his first words in hours he chose karalius sandre said he would they watched the gates swing open and saw the horses canter through the last man locked the iron gates behind him baerd and alessan waited another few moments then rose to their feet devin stood up as well wincing at how stiff he felt well need to find the tavern in the village baerd said his voice so unusually grim that devin glanced sharply at him in the growing gloom the other mans features were unreadable not to go inside though alessan said what we do here we do unknown baerd nodded he pulled a muchcreased paper from an inner pocket of his sheepskin vest shall we start with rovigos man rovigos man turned out to be a retired mariner who lived in the village a mile to the east he told them where the tavern was he also for a fairly significant sum of money gave them a name that of a known informer for grancial and his second company of barbadians the old sailor counted his money spat once meaningfully then told them where the man lived and something of his habits baerd killed the informer strangling him two hours later as he walked along a country lane from his small farm towards the village tavern it was fulldark by then devin helped him carry the body back towards the nievolene gates and hide it in the gully baerd didnt speak and devin could think of nothing to say the informer was a paunchy balding man of middle years he didnt look especially evil he looked like a man surprised on the way to his favorite tavern devin wondered if hed had a wife and children they hadnt asked rovigos man about that he was just as happy they hadnt they rejoined alessan at the edge of the village he was keeping watch on the tavern from there without speaking he pointed to a large duncolored horse among those tethered outside the inn a soldiers horse the three of them doubled back west half a mile and lay down to wait again prone and watchful by the side of the road devin realized he wasnt cold anymore or tired he hadnt had time to think about such things later that night under the cold white gaze of vidomni in the clearing winter sky alessan killed the man theyd been waiting for by the time devin heard the soft jingle of the soldiers horse the prince was no longer by his side and it had been mostly accomplished devin heard a soft sound more like a cough than a cry the horse snorted in alarm and devin belatedly rose up to try to deal with the animal by then though he realized that baerd wasnt beside him either when he finally clambered out of the ditch to the road the soldier wearing the insignia of the second company was dead and baerd had the horse under control the man obviously off duty from the casual look of his uniform had evidently been on his way back to the border fort the barbadian was a big man they all were but this ones face seemed very young under the moonlight they threw the body across his horse and made their way back to the nievolene gates they could hear the men of the first company singing loudly from the manorhouse along the curving drive the sound carried a long way in the stillness of the wintry air there were stars out now beside the moon the clouds were breaking up baerd pulled the barbadian off the horse and leaned him against one of the gate pillars alessan and devin claimed the other dead man from where they had left him in the gully baerd tethered the barbadians horse some distance off the road some distance but not too far this one was meant to be found later alessan touched devin briefly on the shoulder using the skills marra had taught him it seemed several lifetimes ago devin picked the two elaborate locks he was glad to be able to make a contribution the locks were showy but not difficult the arrogant nievolene had not had much fear of trespassers alessan and baerd each shouldered a body and carried them through devin swung the gates silently shut and they entered the grounds not toward the manor though they let the pale moonlight lead them over the snow to the barns there they found trouble the largest barn was locked from the inside and baerd pointed silently with a grimace to a spill of torchlight that showed from under the double doors he mimed the presence of a guard the three of them looked up there was clearly illuminated by vidomnis glow a single small window open high up on the eastern side devin looked from alessan to baerd and then back to the prince he looked at the bodies of the two men already dead he pointed to the window and then to himself after a long moment alessan nodded his head in silence listening to the ragged singing from over in the manorhouse devin climbed the outer wall of the nievolene barn by moonlight and by feel he deciphered hand and footholds in the cold when he reached the window he looked over his shoulder and saw ilarion just rising in the east he slipped through and into the upper loft below a horse whickered softly and devin caught his breath his heart thudding he froze where he was listening there was no other response in the sudden seductive warmth of the barn he crawled cautiously forward and looked down the guard was comprehensively asleep his uniform was unbuttoned and the lantern on the floor by his side illuminated an empty flask of wine he must have lost a dice roll devin thought to have been posted so boringly on guard against nothing here among the horses and the straw he went down the ladder without a sound and in the flickering light of that barn amid the smell of hay and animals and spilled red wine devin killed his first man plunging his dagger into the barbadians throat as the man slept it was not the way his dreams of valiant deeds had ever had him doing this it took him a moment to fight back the churning nausea that followed its the smell of the wine he tried to tell himself there was also more blood than hed thought there would be he wiped his blade clean before he opened the door for the other two well done baerd said taking in the scene he briefly laid a hand on devins shoulder alessan said nothing but by the wavering light devin read a disquieting compassion in his eyes baerd had already set about doing what they had to do they left the guard where he was to be burned the informer and the soldier from the second company they dragged towards one of the outbuildings baerd studied the situation carefully for a few moments refusing to be rushed then he placed the two bodies in a particular way and wedged the door in front of them convincingly shut with what devin assumed would later appear to be a dislodged beam the singing from the manor had gradually been fading away now it had come down to a single voice drunkenly caroling a melancholy refrain about love lost long ago finally that voice too fell silent which was alessans cue at his signal they simultaneously set fire to the dry straw and wood in the guarded barn and two of the adjacent outbuildings including the one where the dead men were trapped then they fled by the time they were off the property the nievolene barns were an inferno of flame horses were screaming there was no pursuit they hadnt expected any alessan and sandre had worked it out very carefully back in ferraut the charred bodies of the informer and the second company soldier would be found by karaliuss men the mercenaries of the first company would draw the obvious conclusion they reclaimed their horses and headed west they spent the night outside again in the cold taking turns on watch it had gone very well it seemed to have gone exactly as planned devin wished theyd been able to free the horses though their screaming ran through his fitful dreams in the snow in the morning alessan bought a cart from a farmer near the border of ferraut and baerd bargained with a woodcutter for a load of freshcut logs they paid the new transit duty and sold the wood at the first fort across the border they also bought some winter wool to carry to ferraut town where they were to rejoin the others there was no point alessan said in missing a chance at a profit they did have responsibilities to their partners in fact a disconcerting number of untoward events had ruffled the eastern palm in the autumn and winter that followed the unmasking of the sandreni conspiracy in themselves none of them amounted to very much collectively they unsettled and irritated alberico of barbadior to the point where his aides and messengers began finding their employment physically hazardous in so far as their duties brought them into proximity with the tyrant for a man noted for his composure and equanimity even back in barbadior when hed been only the leader of a middleranking family of nobility albericos temper was shockingly close to the surface all winter long it had begun his aides agreed amongst each other after the sandreni traitor tomasso had been found dead in the dungeons when they came to bring him to the professionals alberico waiting in the room of the implements had been terrifyingly enraged each of the guards from sifervals third company had been summarily executed including the new captain of the guard the previous one had killed himself the night before siferval himself was summoned back to astibar from certando for a private session with his employer that left him limp and shaking for hours afterwards albericos fury had seemed to border on the irrational he had clearly his aides decided been radically unsettled by whatever had happened in the forest certainly he didnt look well there was something odd about one of his eyes and his walk was peculiar then in the days and weeks that followed it became manifest as the local informers for each of the three companies began to bring in their reports that astibar town simply did not believe or chose not to believe that anything had happened in the forest that there had been any sandreni conspiracy at all certainly not with the lords scalvaia and nievole and most certainly not led by tomasso bar sandre people were commenting cynically all over the city the word came too many of them knew of the bonedeep hatreds that divided those three families too many knew the stories about sandres middle son the alleged leader of this alleged plot he might kidnap a boy from a temple of morian astibar was saying but plot against a tyrant with nievole and scalvaia no the city was simply too sophisticated to fall for that anyone with the slightest sense of geography or economics could see what was really going on how by trumping up this threat from three of the five largest landowners in the distrada alberico was merely creating a sleek cover for an otherwise naked land grab it was only sheerest coincidence of course that the sandreni estates were central the nievolene farms lay to the southwest along the ferraut border and scalvaias vineyards were in the richest belt in the north where the best grapes for the blue wine were grown an immensely convenient conspiracy all the taverns and khav rooms agreed and every single conspirator was dead overnight as well such swift justice such an accumulation of evidence against them there had been an informer among the sandreni it was proclaimed he was dead of course tomasso bar sandre had led the conspiracy they were told he too most unfortunately was dead led by astibar itself all four provinces of the eastern palm reacted with bitter sardonic disbelief they may have been conquered ground under the heavy barbadian heel but they had not been deprived of their intelligence or rendered blind they knew a tyrants scheming when they saw it tomasso bar sandre as a skilled deadly plotter astibar reeling under the economic impact of the confiscations and the horror of the executions still found itself able to mock and then there arrived the first of the viciously funny verses from the west from chiara itself written by brandin himself some said though rather more likely commissioned from one of the poets who hovered about that court verses lampooning alberico as seeing plots hatching in every barnyard and using them as an excuse to seize fowls and vegetable gardens all over the eastern palm there were also a few not very subtle sexual innuendos thrown in for good measure the poems posted on walls all over the city and then in tregea and certando and ferraut were torn down by the barbadians almost as fast as they went up unfortunately they were memorable rhymes and people didnt need to read or hear them more than once alberico would later acknowledge to himself that hed lost control a little he would also admit inwardly that a great deal of his rage stemmed from a fierce indignation and the aftermath of fear there had been a conspiracy led by that mincing sandreni they had very nearly killed him in that cursed cabin in the woods this once he was telling the absolute truth there was no pretense or deception he had every claim of justice on his side what he didnt have was a confession or a witness or any evidence at all hed needed his informer alive or tomasso hed wanted tomasso alive his dreams that first night had been shot through with vivid images of sandres son bound and stripped and curved invitingly backwards on one of the machines in the aftermath of the perverts inexplicable death and the unanimous word from all four provinces that no one believed a word of what had happened alberico had abandoned his original carefully measured response to the plot the lands were seized of course but in addition all the living members of all three families were searched out and deathwheeled in astibar he hadnt expected there to be quite so many actually when he gave that order the stench had been deplorable and some of the children lived an unconscionably long time on the wheels it made it difficult to concentrate on business in the state offices above the grand square he raised taxes in astibar and introduced for the first time transit duties for merchants crossing from one of his provinces to another along the lines of the existing tariff levied for crossing from the eastern to the western palm let them pay literally if they chose not to believe what had happened to him in that cabin he did more half the massive nievolene grain harvest was promptly shipped home to barbadior for an action conceived in anger he considered that one to be inspired it had pushed the price of grain down back home in the empire which hurt his familys two most ancient rivals while making him exceptionally popular with the people in so far as the people mattered in barbadior at the same time here in the palm astibar was forced to bring in more grain than ever from certando and ferraut and with the new duties alberico was going to rake a healthy cut of that inflated price as well he could almost have slaked his anger almost have made himself happy watching the effects of all this ripple through if it wasnt that small things kept happening for one his soldiers began to grow restless with an increase in hardship came an increase in tension more incidents of confrontation occurred especially in tregea where there were always more incidents of confrontation under greater stress the mercenaries demanded predictably higher pay which if he gave it to them was going to soak up virtually everything he might gain from the confiscations and the new duties he sent a letter home to the emperor his first request in over two years along with a case of astibar blue wine from what were now his own estates in the north he conveyed an urgent reiteration of his plea to be brought under the imperial aegis which would have meant a subsidy for his mercenaries from the treasury in barbadior or even imperial troops under his command as always he stressed the role he alone played in blocking ygrathen expansion in this dangerous halfway peninsula he might have begun his career here as an independent adventurer he conceded with what he saw as a nice turn of phrase but as an older wiser man he wished to bind himself more tightly and more usefully to his emperor than ever before as for wanting to be emperor and wanting the cloak of imperial sanction thrown over him however belatedly well such things surely did not have to be put into a letter he received by way of reply an elegant wallhanging from the emperors palace commendations on his loyal sentiments and polite regret that circumstances at home precluded the granting of his request for financing as usual he was cordially invited to sail home to all suitable honors and leave the tiresome problems of that far land overseas to a colonial expert appointed by the emperor that too was as usual turn your new territory over to the empire surrender your army come home to a parade or two then spend your days hunting and your money on bribes and hunting gear wait for the emperor to die without naming a successor then knife and be knifed in the brawl to succeed him alberico sent back sincerest thanks deep regrets and another case of wine shortly thereafter at the end of the fall a number of men in the disgruntled outoffavor third company withdrew from service and took lateseason ship for home the commanders of the first and second used that same week to formally present purely coincidence of course their new wage demands and to casually remind him of past promises of land for the mercenaries starting it was suggested delicately with their commanders hed wanted to order the two of them throttled hed wanted to fry their greedy winesodden brains with a blast of his own magic but he couldnt afford to do it added to which exercising his powers was still a process of some real strain so soon after the encounter in the woods that had nearly killed him the encounter that no one in this peninsula even believed had taken place what he had done was smile at the two commanders and confide that he had already marked off in his mind a significant portion of the newly claimed nievolene lands for one of them siferval he said more in sorrow than in anger had been put out of the running by the conduct of his own men but these two well it would be a hard choice he would be watching them closely over the next while and would announce his decision in due course how long a while exactly had pursued karalius of the first truly he could have killed the man even as he stood there helmet under his arm eyes hypocritically lowered in a show of deference oh spring perhaps hed said airily as if such matters should not be of great moment to men of good will sooner would be better had said grancial of the second softly alberico had chosen to let his eyes show just a little of what he felt there were limits sooner would let whichever of us you choose have time to see to the proper handling of the land before spring planting grancial explained hastily a little ruffled as he should be perhaps it is so alberico had said noncommittally i will give thought to this by the way he added as they reached the door karalius would you be good enough to send me that very competent young captain of yours the one with the forked black beard i have a special confidential task that needs a man of his evident qualities karalius had blinked and nodded it was important very important not to let them grow too confident he reflected after they had gone and hed managed to calm himself at the same time only a genuine fool antagonized his troops the more so if he had ultimate plans to lead them home by invitation of the emperor preferably but not necessarily not to be sure necessarily on further reflection triggered by that line of thought he did raise taxes in tregea certando and ferraut to match the new levels in astibar he also sent a courier to siferval of the third in the certandan highlands praising his recent work in keeping that province quiet you lashed them then enticed them you made them fear you and know that their fortunes could be made if you liked them enough it was all a matter of balance unfortunately small things continued to go wrong with the balancing of the eastern palm as autumn turned into winter in the unusually cold weeks that followed some cursed poet in astibar chose that dank and rainy season to begin posting a series of elegies to the dead duke of astibar the duke had died in exile the head of a scheming family most of whom had been executed by then verses lauding him were manifestly treasonous it was difficult though every single writer brought in during the first sweep of the khav rooms denied authorship and then with time to prepare every writer in the second sweep claimed to have written the verses some advisers suggested peremptory wheels for the lot of them but alberico had been giving thought to a larger issue to the marked difference between his court and the ygrathens on chiara the poets vied for access to brandin quivering like puppies at the slightest word of praise from him they wrote paeans of exaltation to the tyrant and obscene scathing attacks on alberico at request here every writer in the eastern palm seemed to be a potential rabblerouser an enemy of the state alberico swallowed his anger lauded the technical skill of the verses and let both sets of poets go free not before suggesting however as benignly as he could manage that he would enjoy reading verses as wellcrafted on one of the many possible themes of rich satiric possibility having to do with brandin of ygrath he had managed a smile he would be very pleased to read such verses hed said wondering if one of these cursed writers with their lofty airs could take a hint none did instead a new poem appeared on walls all over the city two mornings later it was about tomasso bar sandre a lament about his death and claiming unbelievably that his perverse sexuality had been a deliberately chosen path a living metaphor for his conquered subjugated land for the perverse situation of astibar under tyranny hed had no choice after that once hed understood what the poet was saying not bothering with inquiries again hed had a dozen writers pulled at random out of the khav rooms that same afternoon and then broken wristed and skywheeled among the stillcrowded bodies of the families of the conspirators before sundown he closed all khav rooms for a month no more verses appeared in astibar but the same evening his new taxes were proclaimed in the market square in tregea a blackhaired woman elected to leap to her death from one of the seven bridges in protest against the measures she made a speech before she jumped and she left behind the gods alone knew how shed come into possession of them a complete sheaf of the sandreni elegies from astibar no one knew who she was they dragged the icy river for her body but it was never found rivers ran swiftly in tregea out of the mountains to the eastern sea the verses were all over that province within a fortnight and had crossed to certando and southern ferraut before the first heavy snows of the winter began to fall brandin of ygrath sent an elegantly furclad courier to astibar with an elegantly phrased note lauding the elegies as the first decent creative work hed seen emanating from barbadian territory he offered alberico his sincerest congratulations alberico sent a polite acknowledgment of the sentiments and offered to commission one of his newly competent versemakers to do a work on the glorious life and deeds in battle of prince valentin di tigana because of the ygrathens spell he knew only brandin himself would be able to read that last word but only brandin mattered he thought hed won that one but for some reason the womans suicide in tregea left him feeling too edgy to be pleased it was too intense an action harking back to the violence of the first year after hed landed here things had been quiet for so long and this level of intensity of very public intensity never boded well briefly he even considered rolling back the new taxes but that would look too much like a giving in rather than a gesture of benevolence besides he still needed the money for the army back home the word was that the emperor was sinking more rapidly now that he was seen in public less and less often alberico knew he had to keep his mercenaries happy in the dead of winter he made the decision to reward karalius with fully half of the former nievolene lands the night after the announcement was made public among the troops first then cried in the grand square of astibar the horse barn and several of the outbuildings of the nievolene family estate were burned to the ground he ordered an immediate investigation by karalius then wished a day later that he hadnt it seemed that they had found two bodies in the smoldering ruins trapped by a fallen beam that had barred a door one was that of an informer linked to grancial and the second company the other was a barbadian soldier from the second company karalius promptly challenged grancial to a duel at any time and place of the latters choosing grancial immediately named a date and place alberico quickly made it clear that the survivor of any such combat would be deathwheeled he succeeded in halting the fight but the two commanders stopped speaking to each other from that point on there were a number of small skirmishes among men of the two companies and one in tregea that was not so small leaving fifteen soldiers slain and twice as many wounded three local informers were found dead in ferrauts distrada stretched on farmers wagonwheels in a savage parody of the tyrants justice they couldnt even retaliate that would involve an admission that the men had been informers in certando two of sifervas third company went absent from duty disappearing into the snowwhite countryside the first time that had ever happened siferval reported that local women did not appear to be involved the men had been extremely close friends the third company commander offered the obvious disagreeable hypothesis late in the winter brandin of ygrath sent another suave envoy with another letter in it he profusely thanked alberico for his offer of verses and said hed be delighted to read them he also formally requested six certandan women as young and comely as the one alberico had so kindly allowed him to take from the eastern palm some years ago to be added to his saishan unforgivably the letter somehow became public information laughter was deadly to quell it alberico had six old women seized by siferval in southwestern certando he ordered them blinded and hamstrung and set down under a couriers flag on the snowclad border of lower corte between the forts at sinave and forese he had siferval attach a letter to one of them asking brandin to acknowledge receipt of his new mistresses let them hate him so long as they feared on the way back east from the border siferval said in his report he had followed an informers tip and found the two runaway soldiers living together at an abandoned farm they had been executed on the site with one of them the appropriate one siferval had reported castrated first so that he could die as hed lived alberico sent his commendations it was an unsettling winter though things seemed to be happening to him instead of moving to a measure he dictated late at night and then at other times as well more and more as the palm gradually turned towards a distant rumor of spring alberico found himself thinking about the ninth province that no one yet controlled the one just across the bay senzio the greyeyed merchant was making a great deal of sense even as he found himself reluctantly agreeing with the man ettocio wished the fellow had chosen someone elses roadside tavern for his midday repast the talk in the room was veering in dangerous directions and triad knew enough barbadian mercenaries used the main highway between astibar and ferraut towns if one of them stopped in here now he would be unlikely in the extreme to indulge the current tenor of the conversation as merely an excess of springtime energy ettocios license would probably be gone for a month he kept glancing nervously towards the door double taxation now the lean man was saying bitterly as he pushed a hand through his hair after the kind of winter weve just had after what he did to the price of grain so we pay at the border and now we pay at the gates of a town and where in the name of morian is profit there were truculent murmurs of agreement all around the room in a tavern full of merchants on the road agreement was predictable it was also dangerous ettocio pouring drinks was not the only man keeping an eye on the door the young fellow leaning on the bar looked up from his crusty roll and wedge of country cheese to give him an unexpectedly sympathetic look profit a woolmerchant from northern ferraut said sarcastically why should barbadior care if we make a profit exactly the grey eyes flashed in vigorous agreement the way i hear it all he wants to do is soak the palm for everything he can in preparation for a grab at the emperors tiara back in barbadior shush ettocio muttered under his breath unable to stop himself he took a quick rare pull at a mug of his own beer and moved along the bar to close the window it was a shame because the spring day was glorious outside but this was getting out of hand next thing you know the lean trader was saying now hell just go right ahead and seize the rest of our land like hes already started to do in astibar any wagers were servants or slaves within five years one mans contemptuous laughter rode over the snarling chorus of response triggered by that the room fell abruptly silent as everyone turned to confront the person who appeared to find this observation diverting expressions were grim ettocio nervously wiped down the already clean bartop in front of him the warrior from khardhun continued laughing for a long time seemingly oblivious to the stares he was receiving his sculpted black features registered genuine amusement what said the greyeyed one coldly is so very funny old man you are said the old khardhu cheerfully he grinned like a deaths head all of you never seen so many blind men in one room before you care to explain exactly what that means the ferraut woolmerchant rasped you need it explained the khardhu murmured his eyes wide in mock surprise well now why in the name of your gods or mine or his should alberico bother trying to enslave you he jabbed a bony finger towards the trader whod started all this if he tried that my guess is theres still enough manhood in the eastern palm barely that you might take offense might even rise up he said that last in an exaggerated parody of a secretive whisper he leaned back laughing again at his own wit no one else did ettocio looked nervously at the door on the other side of the coin the khardhu went on still chuckling if he just slowly squeezes you dry with taxes and duties and confiscations he can get to exactly the same place without making anyone mad enough to do anything about it i tell you gentlemen he took a long pull at his beer alberico of barbadiors a smart man and you said the greyeyed man leaning across his own table bristling with anger are an arrogant insolent foreigner the khardhus smile faded his eyes locked on those of the other man and ettocio was suddenly very glad the warriors curved sword was checked with all the other weapons behind the bar ive been here some thirty years the black man said softly about as long as youve been alive id wager i was guarding merchant trains on this road when you were wetting your bed at night and if lam a foreigner well last time i inquired khardhun was a free country we beat back our invader which is more than anyone here in the palm can say you had magic the young fellow at the bar suddenly burst out over the outraged din that ensued we didnt thats the only reason the only reason the khardhu turned to face the boy his lip curling in contempt you want to rock yourself to sleep at night thinking thats the only reason you go right ahead little man maybe itll make you feel better about paying your taxes this spring or about going hungry because theres no grain here in the fall but if you want to know the truth ill give it to you free of charge the noise level had abated as he spoke but a number of men were on their feet glaring at the khardhu looking around the room as if dismissing the boy at the bar as unworthy of his attention he said very clearly we beat back brandin of ygrath when he invaded us because khardhun fought as a country as a whole you people got whipped by alberico and brandin both because you were too busy worrying about your border spats with each other or which duke or prince would lead your army or which priest or priestess would bless it or who would fight on the center and who on the right and where the battlefield would be and who the gods loved best your nine provinces ended up going at the sorcerers one by one finger by finger and they got snapped to pieces like chickenbones i always used to think he drawled into what had become a quiet room that a hand fought best when it made a fist he lazily signaled ettocio for another drink damn your insolent khardhu hide the greyeyed man said in a strangled voice ettocio turned from the bar to look at him damn you forever to morians darkness for being right ettocio hadnt expected that and neither had the others in the room the mood grew grimly introspective and ettocio realized more dangerous as well entirely at odds with the brightness of the spring outside the cheerful warmth of the returned sun but what can we do the young fellow at the bar said plaintively to no one in particular curse and drink and pay our taxes said the woolmerchant bitterly i must say i do sympathize with the rest of you said the lone trader from senzio smugly it was an illadvised remark even ettocio notoriously slow to rouse was irritated the young man at the bar was positively enraged why you you i dont believe it what right do you have he hammered the bar in incoherent fury the plump senzian smiled in the superior manner all of them seemed to have what right indeed the grey eyes were icy as they returned to the fray last time i looked senzio traders all had their hands jammed so deep in their pockets paying tribute money east and west that they couldnt even get their equipment out to please their wives a raucous bawdy shout of laughter greeted that even the old khardhu smiled thinly last looked said the senzian redfaced the governor of senzio was one of our own not someone shipped in from ygrath or barbadior what happened to the duke the ferraut merchant snapped senzio was so cowardly your duke demoted himself to governor so as not to upset the tyrants are you proud of that proud the lean merchant mocked hes got no time to be proud of anything hes too busy looking both ways to see which emissary from which tyrant he should offer his wife to again coarse bitter laughter youve a mean tongue for a conquered man the senzian said coldly the laughter stopped where are you from that youre so quick to cut at other mens courage tregea said the other quietly occupied tregea the senzian corrected viciously conquered tregea with its barbadian governor we were the last to fall the tregean said a little too defiantly borifort held out longer than anywhere else but it fell the senzian said bluntly sure of his advantage now i wouldnt be so quick to talk about other mens wives not after the stories we all heard about what the barbadians did there and i also heard that most of your women werent that unwilling to be shut your filthy mouth the tregean snarled leaping to his feet shut it or ill close it for you permanently you lying senzian scum a babble of noise erupted louder than any before furiously clanging the bell over the bar ettocio fought to restore order enough he roared enough of this or youre all out of here right now a dire threat and it quelled them enough for the khardhu warriors sardonic laughter to be audible again the man was on his feet he dropped coins on the table to pay his account and surveyed the room still chuckling from his great height see what i mean he murmured all these sticklike little fingers jabbing and poking away at each other youve always done that havent you guess you always will until theres nothing left here but barbadior and ygrath he swaggered to the bar to claim his sword you said the greyeyed tregean suddenly as ettocio handed over the curved sheathed blade the khardhu turned slowly you know how to use that thing as well as you use your mouth the tregean asked the khardhus lips parted in a mirthless smile its been reddened once or twice are you working for anyone right now insolently appraisingly the khardhu looked down on the other man where are you going ive just changed my plans the other replied theres no money to be made up in ferraut town not with double duties to be paid i reckon ill have to go farther afield ill give you going rates to guard me south to the certandan highlands rough country there the khardhu murmured reflectively the tregeans face twitched with amusement why do you think i want you he asked after a moment the smile was returned when do we go the warrior said were gone the tregean replied rising and paying his own account he claimed his own short sword and the two of them walked out together when the door opened there was a brief dazzling flash of sunlight ettocio had hoped the talk would settle down after that it didnt the youngster at the bar mumbled something about uniting in a common front a remark that would have been merely insane if it wasnt so dangerous unfortunately from ettocios point of view at any rate the comment was overheard by the ferraut wooltrader and the mood of the room was so aroused by then that the subject wouldnt die it went on all afternoon even after the boy left as well and that night with an entirely different crowd ettocio shocked himself by speaking up during an argument about ancestral primacy between an astibarian winedealer and another senzian he made the same point the tall khardhu had made about nine spindly fingers that had been broken one by one because they never formed a fist the argument made sense to him it sounded intelligent in his own mouth he noticed men nodding slowly even as he spoke it was an unusual flattering response men had seldom paid any attention to ettocio except when he called time in the tavern he rather liked the new sensation in the days that followed he found himself raising the point whenever the opportunity arose for the first time in his life ettocio began to get a reputation as a thoughtful man unfortunately one evening in summer he was overheard by a barbadian mercenary standing outside the open window they didnt take away his license there was a very high level of tension across the whole of the palm by then they arrested ettocio and executed him on a wheel outside his own tavern with his severed hands stuffed in his mouth a great many men had heard the argument by then though a great many had nodded hearing it devin joined the other four about a mile south of the crossroads inn on the dusty road leading to certando they were waiting for him catriana was alone in the first cart but devin climbed up beside baerd in the second bubbling like a pot of khav he said cheerfully in response to a quizzical eyebrow alessan rode up on one side hed buckled on his sword devin saw baerds bow was on the cart just behind the seat and within very quick reach devin had had occasion several times in six months to see just how quick baerds reach could be alessan smiled over at him riding bareheaded in the bright afternoon i take it you stirred the pot a little after we left devin grinned didnt need much stirring the two of you have that routine down like professional players by now so do you said the duke cantering up on the other side of the cart i particularly admired your spluttering anger this time i thought you were about to throw something at me devin smiled up at him sandres teeth flashed white through the improbable black of his skin dont expect to recognize us baerd had said when theyd parted in the sandreni woods half a year ago so devin had been prepared somewhat but not enough baerds own transformation had been disconcerting but relatively mild hed grown a short beard and removed the padding from the shoulders of his doublet he wasnt as big a man as devin had first thought hed also somehow changed his hair from bright yellow to what he said was his natural dark brown his eyes were brown now as well not the bright blue of before what he had done to sandre dastibar was something else entirely even alessan whod evidently had years to get used to this sort of thing gave a low whistle when he first saw the duke sandre had become amazingly an aging black fighting man from khardhun across the northern sea one of a type that devin knew had been common on the roads of the palm twenty or thirty years ago in the days when merchants went nowhere except in company with each other and khardhu warriors with their wickedly curved blades were much in demand as insurance against outlaws somehow and this was the uncanny thing with his own beard shaven and his white hair tinted a dark grey sandres gaunt black face and deepset fierce eyes were exactly those of a khardhu mercenary which baerd had explained had been almost the first thing hed noticed about the duke when hed seen him in daylight it was what had suggested the rather comprehensive disguise but how devin remembered gasping lotions and potions alessan had laughed it turned out as baerd explained later that he and the prince had spent a number of years in quileia after tiganas fall disguises of this sort colorings for skin and hair even tints for eyes were a perfected important art south of the mountains they assumed a central role in the mysteries of the mother goddess and in the less secret rites of the formal theater and they had played pivotal complex parts in the tumultuous religiontorn history of quileia baerd did not say what he and alessan had been doing there or how he had come to learn this secret craft or possess the implements of it catriana didnt know either which made devin feel somewhat better theyd asked alessan one afternoon and had received for the first time an answer that was to become routine through the fall and winter in the spring alessan told them in the spring a great deal would be made clearer one way or another they were moving towards something of importance but they would have to wait until then he was not going to discuss it now before the ember days of spring they would leave their current astibar tregea ferraut loop and head south across the wide grainlands of certando and at that point alessan had said a great many things might change one way or another hed repeated he hadnt smiled saying any of this though he was a man with an easy smile devin remembered how catriana had tossed her hair then with a knowing almost an angry look in her blue eyes its alienor isnt it she demanded virtually an accusation its that woman at castle borso alessans mouth had twisted in surprise and then amusement not so my dear hed said well stop at borso but this has nothing to do with her at all if i didnt know better if i didnt know your heart belonged only to devin id say you sounded jealous my darling the gibe had entirely the desired effect catriana had stormed off and devin almost as embarrassed himself had quickly changed the subject alessan had a way of doing that to you behind the deep effortless courtesy and the genuine camaraderie there existed a line they learned not to try to cross if he was seldom harsh his jests always the first measure of control could sting memorably even the duke had discovered that it was best not to press alessan on certain subjects including this one it emerged when asked sandre said he knew as little as they did about what would happen come spring thinking about it as fall gave way to winter and the rains and then the snows came devin was deeply aware that alessan was the prince of a land that was dying a little more with each passing day under the circumstances he decided the wonder wasnt that there were places they could not trespass upon but rather how far they could actually go before reaching the guarded regions that lay within one of the things devin began to learn during that long winter was patience he taught himself to hold his questions for the right time or to restrain them entirely and try to work the answers for himself if fuller knowledge had to wait for spring then he would wait in the meantime he threw himself with an unleashed even an unsuspected passion into what they were doing a blade had been planted in his own soul that starry autumn night in the sandreni woods hed had no idea what to expect when theyd set out five days later with rovigos horsedrawn cart and three other horses bound for ferraut town with a bed and a number of wooden carvings of the triad taccio had written rovigo that he could sell astibarian religious carvings at a serious profit to merchants from the western palm especially because as devin learned duty was not levied on triadrelated artifacts part of a successful attempt by both sorcerers to keep the clergy placated and neutralized devin learned a great deal about trade that fall and winter and about certain other things as well with his new hardwon patience he would listen in silence as alessan and the duke tossed ideas back and forth on the long roads turning the rough coals of a concept into the diamonds of polished plans and even though his own dreams at night were of raising a surging army to liberate tigana and storm the fabled harbor walls of chiara he quickly came to understand on the cold paths of day that theirs would have to be a wholly different approach which was in fact why they were still in the east not the west and doing all they could with the small glittering diamonds of alessan and sandres plans to unsettle things in albericos realm once catriana confided to him on one of the days when for whatever reason she deemed him worth speaking to that alessan was in fact moving much more aggressively than he had the year before when shed first joined them devin suggested it might be sandres influence catriana had shaken her head she thought that was a part of it but that there was something else a new urgency from a source she didnt understand well find out in the spring devin had shrugged shed glared at him as if personally affronted by his equanimity it had been catriana though whod suggested the most aggressive thing of all as winter began the faked suicide in tregea along with the idea of leaving behind her a sheaf of the poems that that young poet had written about the sandreni adreano was his name alessan had informed them unwontedly subdued the name was on the list of the twelve poets rovigo had reported as being randomly deathwheeled during albericos retaliation for the verses alessan had been unexpectedly disturbed by that news there was other information in the letter from rovigo aside from the usual covering business details it had been held for them in a tavern in north tregea that served as a mail drop for many of the merchants in the northeast they had been heading south spreading what rumors they could about unrest among the soldiers rovigos latest report suggested for the second time that an increase in taxes might be imminent to cover the mercenaries newest pay demands sandre who seemed to know the tyrants mind astonishingly well agreed after dinner when they were alone around the fire catriana had made her proposal devin had been incredulous hed seen the height of the bridges of tregea and the speed of the river waters below and it was winter by then growing colder every day alessan still upset by the news from astibar and evidently of the same mind as devin vetoed the idea bluntly catriana pointed out two things one was that she had been brought up by the sea she was a better swimmer than any of them and better than any of them knew the second thing was that as alessan knew perfectly well she said a leap such as this a suicide especially in tregea would fit seamlessly into everything they were trying to achieve in the eastern palm that devin remembered sandre saying after a silence is true im sorry to say alessan had reluctantly agreed to go to tregea itself for a closer look at the river and the bridges four evenings later devin and baerd had found themselves crouched amid twilight shadows along the riverbank in tregea town at a point that seemed to devin terribly far away from the bridge catriana had chosen especially in the windy cold of winter in the swiftly gathering dark beside the even more swiftly racing waters that were rushing past them deep and black and cold while they waited he had tried unsuccessfully to sort out his complex mixture of feelings about catriana he was too anxious though and too cold he only knew that his heart had leaped moved by some odd tripled conjunction of relief and admiration and envy when she swam up to the bank exactly where they were she even had the wig in one hand so it would not be tangled up somewhere and found devin stuffed it into the satchel he carried while baerd was vigorously chafing catrianas shivering body and bundling her into the layers of clothing theyd carried as devin looked at her shaking uncontrollably almost blue with the cold her teeth chattering he had felt his envy slipping away what replaced it was pride she was from tigana and so was he the world might not know it yet but they were working together however elliptically to bring it back the following morning their two carts had slowly rattled out of town going north and west to ferraut again with a full load of mountain khav a light snow had been falling behind them the city was in a state of massive ferment and turmoil because of the unknown darkhaired girl from the distrada who had killed herself after that incident devin had found it increasingly hard to be sharp or petty with catriana most of the time she did continue to indulge herself in the custom of deciding that he was invisible every once in a while it had become difficult for him to convince himself that they had actually made love together that he had really felt her mouth soft on his or her hands in his hair as she gathered him into her they never spoke of it of course he didnt avoid her but he didnt seek her out her moods swung too unpredictably he never knew what response hed get a newly patient man he let her come to ride a cart or sit before a tavern fire with him when she wanted to she did sometimes in ferraut town that winter for the third time after the leap in tregea they had all been wonderfully fed by ingonida still in raptures over the bed theyd brought her taccios wife continued to display a particularly solicitous affection for the duke in his dark disguise a detail which alessan took some pleasure in teasing sandre about when they were alone in the meantime the rotund redfaced taccio copiously wined them all there had been another mail packet waiting from rovigo in astibar which when opened proved to contain two letters this time one of which gave off even after its time in transit an extraordinary effusion of scent alessan his eyebrows elaborately arched presented this paleblue emanation to devin with infinite suggestiveness ingonida crowed and clasped her hands together in a gesture doubtless meant to signify romantic rapture taccio beaming poured devin another drink the perfume unmistakably was selvenas devins expression as he took cautious possession of the envelope must have been revealing because he heard catriana giggle suddenly he was careful not to look at her selvenas missive was a single headlong sentence much like the girl herself she did however make one vivid suggestion that induced him to decline when the others asked innocently if they might peruse his communication in fact though devin was forced to admit that his interest was rather more caught by the five neat lines alais had attached to her fathers letter in a small businesslike hand she simply reported that shed found and copied another variant of the lament for adaon at one of the gods temples in astibar and that she looked forward to sharing it with all of them when they next came east she signed it with her initial only in the body of the letter rovigo reported that astibar was very quiet since the twelve poets had been executed among the families of the conspirators in the grand square that the price of grain was still going up that he could usefully receive as much green senzian wine as they could obtain at current prices that alberico was widely expected to announce very soon a beneficiary among his commanders for the greater part of the confiscated nievolene lands and that his best information was that senzian linens were still underpriced in astibar but might be due to rise it was the news about the nievolene lands that triggered the next stage of sparktospark discussion between alessan and the duke and those sparks had led to the blaze the five of them did a fast run along the wellmaintained highway north to senzio with more of the religious artifacts they bought green wine with their profit on the statuettes bargained successfully for a quantity of linens baerd somewhat surprisingly had emerged as their best negotiator in such matters and doubled quickly back to taccio paying the huge new duties at both the provincial border forts and the citywalls there had been another letter waiting among the various masking pieces of business news rovigo reported that an announcement on the nievolene lands was expected by the end of the week his source was reliable he added the letter had been written five days before that night alessan baerd and devin had borrowed a third horse from taccio who was deeply happy to be told nothing on their intentions and had set out on the long ride to the astibar border and then across to a gully by the road that led to the nievolene gates they were back seven days later with a new cart and a load of unspun country wool for taccio to sell word of the fire had preceded them word of the fire was everywhere sandre reported there had already been a number of tavern brawls in ferraut town between men of the first and second companies they left the new cart with taccio and departed heading slowly back towards tregea they didnt need three carts they were partners in a modest commercial venture they made what slight profit they could given the taxes and duties that trammeled them they talked about those taxes and duties a great deal often in public sometimes more frankly than their listeners were accustomed to hearing alessan quarreled with the sardonic khardhu warrior in a dozen different inns and taverns on the road and hired him a dozen different times sometimes devin played a role sometimes baerd did they were careful not to repeat the performance anywhere catriana kept a precise log of where they had been and what they had said and done there devin had assured her they could rely on his memory but she kept her notes nonetheless in public the duke now called himself tomaz sandre was an uncommonenough name in the palm and for a mercenary from khardhun it would be sufficiently odd to be a risk devin remembered growing thoughtful when the duke had told them his new name back in the fall hed wondered what it was like to have had to kill his son even to outlive his sons to know that the bodies of everyone even distantly related to himself were being spreadeagled alive on the deathwheels of barbadior he tried to imagine how all of that would feel life the processes of living and what it did to you seemed to devin to grow more painfully complex all through that fall and winter often he thought of marra arbitrarily cut off on the way to her maturity to whatever she had been about to become he missed her with a dull ache that could grow into something heavy and difficult at times she would have been someone to talk to about such things the others had their own concerns and he didnt want to burden them he wondered about alais bren rovigo if she would have understood these things he was wrestling with he didnt think so she had lived too sheltered too secluded a life for such thoughts to trouble her he dreamt of her one night though an unexpectedly intense series of images the next morning he rode beside catriana in the lead cart unwontedly quiet stirred and unsettled by the nearness of her the crimson fall of her hair in the pale winter landscape sometimes he thought about the soldier in the nievolene barn who had lost a roll of dice and carried a jug of wine to a lonely place away from the singing and had had his throat slit there while he slept had that soldier been born into the world only to become a rite of passage for devin di tigana that was a terrible thought eventually mulling it over through the long cold winter rides devin worked his way through to deciding it was untrue the man had interacted with other people through his days had caused pleasure and sorrow doubtless and had surely known both things the moment of his ending was not what denned his journey under eannas lights or however that journey was named in the empire of barbadior it was difficult to sort out though had stevan of ygrath lived and died so that his fathers grief might work the destruction of a small province and its people and their memories had prince valentin di tigana been born only to swing the killing blade that caused this to happen and what about his youngest son then and what about the youngest son of the asolini farmer who had fled from avalle when it became stevanien truly it was hard to puzzle through in senzio one morning with the first elusive hints of spring softening the northern air baerd had come back from the celebrated weapons market with a bright beautifully balanced sword for devin there was a black jewel in the hilt he offered no explanation but devin knew it had to do with what had happened in the nievolene barn the gift did nothing to answer any of his new questions but it helped him nonetheless baerd began giving him lessons during their midday breaks on the road devin worried about baerd in part because he knew that alessan did his first impression in the cabin had been mostly wrong a big blond man intimidatingly cool and competent but baerd was darkhaired and not actually large at all and though his competence ran to such an astonishing number of things that it could still be intimidating after six months he wasnt really cool only guarded careful closed tightly around the kernel of the hurt he had lived with for a long time in some ways devin realized alessan had it easier than baerd the prince could find a temporary release in talk in laughter and most of all and almost always in music baerd seemed to have no release at all he walked through a world shaped and reshaped every single moment around the knowledge that tigana was gone it would drive him out at night sometimes away from sleep or from a fire theyd built up by a road he would rise without warning neatly quietly and go out into the darkness alone devin would watch alessan watching baerd as he went away i knew a man like him once sandre said gravely one night after baerd had left a warm room in a tavern for a fogshrouded winter night in the tregean hills near borifort he used to have to go away by himself to fight off a need to kill that would be a part of it alessan had said thoughts of winter mood of a winters night but it was spring now and as the sap of the earth rose greengold to the warming light so did devin feel his own mood lifting to the stir and quickening of the world through which they rode wait for springtime alessan had said amid the browns and reds of autumn trees and the bare harvested vines and spring was upon them now with the ember days approaching fast and at last at long last they were on the road for certando and whatever answers lay there devin could not quell and did not want to quell the sense rising within him like sap in the green woods that whatever was going to happen was going to begin to happen soon in the second cart beside baerd he felt gloriously importantly alive ahead of them the glint of afternoon sunlight in catrianas hair was doing something strange and wonderful to his blood he was aware of baerd giving him a curious scrutiny and caught a halfsmile playing across the others face he didnt care he was even glad baerd was his friend devin began a song a very old ballad of the road the song of the wayfarer im a long way from the house where i was born and this is just another winding trail but when the sun goes down both of the moons will rise and eannas stars will hear me tell my tale alessan whatever his mood might be was almost always ready to join in a song and sure enough devin had the tregean pipes with him by the second verse he looked over and caught a wink from the prince riding beside them catriana glanced back at them reprovingly devin grinned at her and shrugged and alessans pipes suddenly spun into a wilder dance of invitation catriana tried and failed to suppress a smile she joined them on the third verse and then led them into the next song later in the summer devin would revive that image of the five of them in the first hour of the long ride south and the memory would make him feel very old he was young that day in a way they all were briefly even sandre joining in on the choruses he knew in a passable baritone voice reborn into his new identity with a new hope to his long unfading dream devin took the third song back from catriana and sent his high clear voice along the road before them to lead the way down the sunlit winding trail to certando to the lady of castle borso whoever she might be and to whatever it was that alessan had to find in the highlands first though nearing sundown they overtook a traveler on the road in itself that wasnt unusual they were still in ferraut in the populated country north of fort ciorone where busy highways from tregea and corte met the northsouth road they were on solitary travelers on the other hand were sufficiently rare for devin to join baerd in scanning the sides of the road to see if others were hidden in ambush a routine precaution but they were in country where thieves would not survive long and in any case it was still daylight then as they drew nearer devin saw the small harp slung over the mans back a troubadour devin grinned they were almost always good company the man had turned and was waiting for them to catch up the deep bow he offered catriana as she pulled the lead cart to a halt beside him was of such courtly grace it almost looked like a parody on the lonely road ive been enjoying the sound of you for the last mile he said straightening i must say im enjoying the sight of you even more he was tall no longer young with long greying hair and quick eyes he gave catriana the sort of smile for which the troubadours of the palm were notorious his teeth were white and even in a leathery face heading south with the spring she asked smiling politely at his flattery the old route i am indeed he replied the old route at the usual time and id hate to tell someone as young and beautiful as you how many years ive been doing it devin jumped down from beside baerd and strolled closer to the man to confirm something i could probably guess he said grinning because i think i remember you we did a wedding season in certando together did you play harp for burnet di corte two years ago the sharp eyes looked him up and down i did the troubadour admitted after a moment im erlein di senzio and i was with damned burnet for a season all right then he cheated me of my wages and i decided i was happier on my own again i thought those were professional voices behind me you are devin dasoli the lie came easily i was with menico di ferraut for a few years and have clearly moved on to other better things erlein said glancing at their laden carts is menico still on the road is he any fatter than he was yes to both devin said concealing the guilt that still assailed him when he thought of his former troupeleader so is burnet last i heard rot him erlein said mildly he owes me money well alessan said looking down from his horse we cant do anything about that but if you like we can run you up to ciorone and a bed before curfew you can ride with baerd he added quickly as erlein glanced at the empty seat beside catriana i would be most profoundly grateful erlein began i dont like fort ciorone sandre broke in suddenly they cheat you there and too many people learn what youre carrying and where youre going too many of the wrong kind of people its a mild night coming i think were better off out here devin glanced over at the duke in surprise this was the first time hed offered any such opinion well really tomaz i dont see why alessan began you hired me merchant sandre growled you wanted me to do a job for you and im doing it you dont want to listen pay me now and ill find someone who will his eyes were fierce within the hollows of his blackened face and his tone was one that none of them could mistake whatever it was sandre had a reason for what he was doing a little courtesy if you please alessan snapped turning his horse to face the dukes or i will indeed turn you away and let you carry your old bones back to find someone else idiot enough to put up with you i have managed he said swinging back to erlein to find the most arrogant khardhu on the roads of the palm they are all arrogant the troubadour replied with a shake of his head comes with the curved swords alessan laughed so too following his lead did devin theres a good hour of daylight left baerd said in a complaining voice we can make the fort easy why sleep on the ground alessan sighed i know he said but im sorry were new to this run and tomaz isnt i suppose we ought to listen to him or were wasting his fee arent we he looked back at erlein and shrugged there goes your ride to ciorone cant lose what you never had the troubadour smiled ill manage youre welcome to share our fire devin interjected trusting that hed read the dukes brief glance correctly he still wasnt sure what sandre was doing surprisingly erlein flushed he looked somewhat embarrassed as to that i thank you but ive nothing with me to bring to table or hearth you have been on the road a long time sandre said in a quieter voice i havent heard a palmborn use that phrase in years its a lost tradition that one you have a harp dont you catriana said at just the right moment and in her sweetest voice she glanced directly at erlein for an instant then demurely lowered her eyes again i do said the troubadour after a moment affirming the obvious he was devouring catriana with his gaze then you are far from emptyhanded alessan said crisply devin and my sister both sing as youve heard and i can manage these pipes a little bit a harp will go gentle after dinner under the stars say no more said erlein youll be better company by a long go than my mouth talking wisdom with only my own ears to hear alessan laughed again theres trees over west and a stream beyond them if i remember rightly sandre said a good place to camp before anyone else could say a word erlein di senzio had jumped up and settled himself at catrianas side devin his mouth agape closed it quickly at sandres hidden urgent gesture catriana pulled west off the road to lead them toward the trees the duke had pointed out devin heard her giggle at something the troubadour said he was looking at sandre though so were baerd and alessan the duke glanced at erlein whose back was to the four of them then very briefly he held up his left hand with the third and fourth fingers carefully curled down he gazed at alessan deliberately and then back to the man beside catriana devin didnt understand an oath he thought confused sandre lowered his hand but his eyes remained locked on the princes there was an odd challenging expression in them alessan had suddenly gone pale and in that moment devin understood oh adaon baerd whispered on a rising note as devin leaped up on the cart beside him i do not believe this neither did devin what sandre was telling them quite plainly was that erlein di senzio was a wizard one who had cut two fingers in his linking to the magic of the palm and alessan bar valentin was a prince of the blood of tigana which meant if the old tale of adaon and micaela was true that he could bind a wizard to his service sandre had not believed it back in the cabin in the fall devin remembered that but now he was giving alessan his chance which explained the challenge in his gaze a chance or at least the beginnings of a chance thinking as fast as he ever had in his life devin turned to baerd follow my lead when we get there he said softly i have an idea only later would he have time to reflect what a change six months had made only six months one ember season to another for him to speak so to baerd speak and be listened to there was indeed a stream as sandre had known or guessed not far from its banks they halted the carts the usual twilight routine began catriana seeing to the horses devin to wood for the fire alessan and the duke laid out the sleepingrolls and organized the cooking gear and the food they carried baerd took his bow and disappeared into the trees he was back in twenty minutes no more than that with three rabbits and a plump wingless grele im impressed erlein said from beside catriana and the horses his eyes were wide im very impressed im buying your music for later baerd said with a rare smile the one he usually reserved for bargaining sessions at town fairs devin had been watching erlein as unobtrusively as he could when he could manage to focus on the troubadours left hand which never seemed to be still for more than an instant there did seem to be an odd blurring an occluding of air around it he had been waiting for baerd to come back now he waited no longer you he said grinning at the returning hunter look like something that should be hunted yourself you are going to terrify every civilized merchant we meet you need a haircut before you are fit for society my friend baerd was very quick i wouldnt talk scamp he shot back tossing his prey over to sandre by the wood gathered for the fire not the way you look yourself or are you deliberately trying to be scruffy to scare away alienor at borso alessan laughed so did erlein nothing scares away alienor the troubadour chuckled and that one is exactly the right age for her what right age alessan grinned slyly over twelve and not yet buried suits her fine i dont like that catriana said primly as the five men laughed sorry alessan said trying to keep a straight face as she stepped in front of him hands firmly on her hips you are not at all sorry but you should be catriana snapped you know very well i dont like that kind of talk how do you think it makes me look and you only do it when youre idle do something useful cut devins hair he does look awful even worse than usual me devin squeaked in protest my hair what do you mean its baerd not me what about him hes the one who you all need a haircut catriana pronounced with a blunt finality that admitted of no rebuttal her cold scrutiny rested critically on erleins shaggy mane for a second she opened her mouth hesitated then closed it in a brilliant miming of polite restraint erlein flushed his right hand went uneasily to tug at his shoulderlength strands his left hand never stopped playing restlessly with some pebbles hed gathered by the stream i think devin said spitefully that youve just insulted our guest that should make him feel properly welcome here i didnt say a word devin she flared you didnt have to erlein said ruefully those magnificent eyes were somewhat less than pleased with what they saw my sisters eyes are almost never pleased with what they see alessan grunted he was crouched beside one of the packs and after a moments rummaging pulled out a scissors and a comb i am fairly obviously being ordered to duty here theres half an hour of light left whos first victim me said baerd quickly you arent touching me in twilight ill tell you that much erlein watched with interest as alessan led baerd over to a rock by the stream and proceeded quite competently in fact to trim the other mans hair catriana went back to the horses though not before offering erlein another quick enigmatic glance sandre stacked the wood for the fire and began skinning the rabbits and the grele humming tunelessly to himself more wood lad he said abruptly to devin without looking up which was perfect of course oh marian devin thought a heady blend of excitement and pride racing through him they are all so good later was all he said lounging casually on the ground weve got enough for now and im next with alessan no youre not alessan called from by the river picking up sandres gambit get the wood devin there isnt enough light to do three of you ill cut yours tomorrow and erleins now if he wants catriana will just have to endure you looking fearsome for one more night as if a haircuts going to change that she called from the other side of the clearing erlein and baerd laughed grumbling devin stood up and ambled off toward the trees behind him he heard erleins voice id be grateful to you the troubadour was saying to alessan id hate to have another woman look at me the way your sister just did ignore her devin heard baerd laugh as he strode back toward the fire she is impossible to ignore erlein said in a voice pitched to carry to where the horses were tethered he stood up and walked over to the riverbank he sat down on the rock in front of alessan the sun was a red disk westering beyond the stream carrying an armful of wood devin looped quietly around in the growing shadows to where catriana stood among the horses she heard him come up but continued brushing the brown mare her eyes never left the two men by the river neither did devins squinting into the setting sun it seemed to him as if alessan and the troubadour had become figures in some timeless landscape their voices carried with an unnatural clarity in the quiet of the gathering twilight when was this last done for you he heard alessan ask casually his scissors busy in the long grey tangles of erleins hair i dont even remember the troubadour confessed well alessan laughed bending to wet his comb in the stream on the road we dont exactly have to keep up with court fashions tilt a little this way yes good do you brush it across in front or straight back back by preference fine alessans hands moved up to the crown of erleins head the scissors flashing as they caught the last of the sun thats an oldfashioned look but troubadours are supposed to look oldfashioned arent they part of the charm you are bound by adaon s name and my own i am alessan prince of tigana and wizard you are mine devin took an involuntary step forward he saw erlein try reflexively to jerk away but the hand of binding held his head and the scissors so busy a moment before were now sharp against his throat they froze him for an instant and an instant was enough rot your flesh erlein screamed as alessan released him and stepped back the wizard sprang from the stone as if scalded and wheeled to face the prince his face was contorted with rage fearing for alessan devin began moving toward the river reaching for his blade then he saw that baerd had an arrow already notched to his bow and trained on erleins heart devin slowed his rush and then stopped sandre was right beside him the curved sword drawn he caught a glimpse of the dukes dark face and in it though he couldnt be absolutely sure in the uncertain light he thought he read fear he turned back to the two men by the river alessan had laid down the scissors and comb neatly on the rock he stood still hands at his sides but his breath was coming quickly erlein was literally shaking with fury devin looked at him and it was as if a curtain had been drawn back in the wizards eyes hatred and terror vied for domination his mouth worked spasmodically he raised his left hand and pointed it at alessan in a gesture of violent negation and devin saw quite clearly now that his third and fourth fingers had indeed been chopped off the ancient mark of a wizards binding to his magic and the palm alessan baerd said it is all right he cannot do anything with his power now against my will alessans voice was quiet almost detached as if this was all happening to someone else entirely only then did devin realize that the wizards gesture had been an attempt to cast a spell magic he had never thought to be so near it in his life the skin prickled at the back of his neck and not because of the twilight breeze slowly erlein lowered his hand and slowly his trembling stopped triad curse you he said low and cold and curse the bones of your ancestors and blight the lives of your children and your childrens children for what you have done to me it was the voice of someone wronged brutally grievously alessan did not flinch or turn away i was cursed almost nineteen years ago and my ancestors were and whatever children i or any of my people might have it is a curse i have set my life to undo while time yet allows for no other reason have i bound you to me there was something terrible in erleins face every true prince of tigana the wizard said with bitter intensity has known since the beginning how awful a gift the god gave them how savage a power over a free a living soul do you even know he was forced to stop whitefaced his hands clenched to regain control of himself do you even know how seldom this gift has been used twice alessan said calmly twice to my knowledge the old books recorded it so though i fear all the books have been burned now twice erlein echoed his voice skirling upwards twice in how many generations stretching back to the dawn of records in this peninsula and you a puling princeling without even a land to rule have just casually viciously set your hands upon my life not casually and only because i have no home because tigana is dying and will be lost if i do not do something and what part of that little speech gives you rights over my life and death i have a duty alessan replied gravely i must use what tools come to hand i am not a tool erlein cried from the heart i am a free and living soul with my own destiny watching alessans face devin saw how that cry shafted into him for a long moment there was silence by the river devin saw the prince draw air into his lungs carefully as if steadying himself under yet another burden a new weight joined to those he already carried another part added to the price of his blood i will not lie and say that i am sorry alessan said finally choosing his words with care i have dreamt of finding a wizard for too many years i will say and this is true that i understand what you have said and why you will hate me and i can tell you that i grieve for what necessity demands it demands nothing erlein replied shrill and unrelenting in his righteousness we are free men there is always a choice some choices are closed to some of us it was surprisingly sandre he moved forward to stand a little in front of devin and some men must make choices for those who cannot whether through lack of will or lack of power he walked nearer to the other two by the dark quiet rushing of the stream just as we may choose not to slay the man who is trying to kill our child so alessan may have chosen not to bind a wizard who might be needed by his people his children neither refusal erlein di senzio is a true alternative for anyone with honor honor erlein spat the word and how does honor bind a man of senzio to tiganas fate what prince compels a free man to a sure death at his side and then speaks of honor he shook his head call it naked power and have done i will not the duke replied in his deep voice it was quite dark now devin could no longer see his hooded eyes from behind them all he heard the sounds of baerd beginning to light the fire overhead the first stars were emerging in the blueblack cloak of the sky away west across the stream there was a last hint of crimson along the line of the horizon i will not sandre said again the honor of a ruler and his duty lies in his care for his land and his people that is the only true measure and the price part of the price of that comes when he must go against his own souls needs and do such things that will grieve him to the very bones of his hands such things he added softly as the prince of tigana has just done to you but erleins voice shot back unpersuaded contemptuous and how he snarled does a bought sword from khardhun presume to use the word honor or to speak about the burdens of a prince he wanted the words to hurt devin could see but what came through in the inflections of his voice was the sound of someone lost and afraid there was a silence behind them the fire caught with a rush and the orange glow spun outward illuminating erleins taut rage and sandres gaunt dark face the bones showing in high relief beyond them both devin saw alessan had not moved at all sandre said the khardhu warriors i have known were deeply versed in honor but i will claim no credit for that be not deceived i am no khardhu my name is sandre dastibar once duke of that province i know a little about power erleins mouth fell open i am also a wizard sandre added matteroffactly which is how you were known by the thin spell you use to mask your hand erlein closed his mouth he stared fixedly at the duke as if seeking to penetrate his disguise or find confirmation in the deephooded eyes then he glanced downwards almost against his will sandre already had the fingers of his left hand spread wide all five fingers i never made the final binding he said i was twelve years old when my magic found me i was also the son and heir of tellani duke of astibar i made my choice i turned my back on magic and embraced the rule of men i used my very small power perhaps five times in my life or six he amended once very recently then there was a conspiracy against the barbadian erlein murmured his rage temporarily set aside as he wrestled with this and then yes of course what did you do kill your son in the dungeon i did the voice was level giving nothing away at all you could have cut two fingers and brought him out perhaps devin looked over sharply at that startled i dont know i made my choice long ago erlein di senzio and with those quiet words another shape of pain seemed to enter the clearing almost visible at the edges of the firelight erlein forced a corrosive laugh and a fine choice it was he mocked now your dukedom is gone and your family as well and youve been bound as a slave wizard to an arrogant tiganese how happy you must be not so said alessan quickly from by the river i am here by my own choice sandre said softly because tiganas cause is astibars and senzios and chiaras it is the same for all of us do we die as willing victims or while trying to be free do we skulk as you have done all these years hiding from the sorcerers or can we not join palm to palm for once in this follyridden peninsula of warring provinces locked into their pride and drive the two of them away devin was deeply stirred the dukes words rang in the firelit dark like a challenge to the night but when he ended the sound they heard was erlein di senzio clapping sardonically wonderful he said contemptuously you really must remember that for when you find an army of simpletons to rally you will forgive me if i remain unmoved by speeches about freedom tonight before the sun went down i was a free man on an open road i am now a slave you were not free devin burst out and i say i was erlein snapped rounding fiercely on him there may have been laws that constrained me and one government ruling where i might have wished for another but the roads are safer now than they ever were when this man ruled in astibar or that ones father in tigana and i carried my life where i wanted to go you will all have to forgive my insensitivity if i say that brandin of ygraths spell on the name of tigana was not the first and last thought of my days we will alessan said then in an unnaturally flat voice we will all forgive you for that nor will we seek to persuade you to change your views now i will tell you this though the freedom you speak of will be yours again when tiganas name is heard in the world once more it is my hope vain perhaps that you will work with us willingly in time but until then i can say that the compulsion of adaons gift will suffice me my father died and my brothers died by the deisa and the flower of a generation with them fighting for freedom i have not lived so bitterly or striven so long to hear a coward belittle the shattering of a people and their heritage coward erlein exclaimed rot you you arrogant princeling what would you know about it only what you have told us yourself alessan replied grimly now safer roads you said one government where you might have wished for another he took a step toward erlein as if he would strike the man his composure finally beginning to break you have been the worst thing i know a willing subject of two tyrants your idea of freedom is exactly what has let them conquer us and then hold us you called yourself free you were only free to hide and to soil your breeches if a sorcerer or one of their trackers came within ten miles of your little screening spell you were free to walk past deathwheels with your fellow wizards rotting on them and free to turn your back and continue on your way not anymore erlein di senzio by the triad you are in it now you are in it as deep as any man in the palm hear my first command you are to use your magic to conceal your fingers exactly as before no said erlein flatly alessan said nothing more he waited devin saw the duke take a halfstep towards the two of them and then stop himself he remembered that sandre had not believed that this was possible now he saw they all saw by the light of the stars and the fire baerd had made erlein fought understanding next to nothing unnerved by almost all that was happening devin gradually became aware that a horrible struggle was taking place within the wizard it could be read in his rigid straining stance and his gritted teeth heard in the rasp and wheeze of his shortening breath seen in tightly closed eyes and the suddenly clenched fingers at his sides no erlein gasped once and then again and again with more effort each time no no no he dropped to his knees as if felled like a tree his head bent slowly downward his shoulders hunched as if resisting some overmastering assault they began to shake with erratic spasms his whole body was trembling no he said again in a high cracked whisper his hands spread open pressing flat against the ground in the red firelight his face was a mask of staring agony sweat poured down it in the chill of night his mouth suddenly gaped open devin looked away in pity and terror just before the wizards scream ripped the night apart in the same moment catriana took two quick running steps and buried her head against devins shoulder that cry of pain the scream of a tormented animal hung in the air between fire and stars for what seemed an appallingly long time afterwards devin became aware of the intensity of the silence broken only by the occasional crackle of the fire the rivers soft murmur and erlein di senzios choked ragged breathing without speaking catriana straightened and released her grip on devins arm he glanced at her but she didnt meet his eye he turned back to the wizard erlein was still on his knees before alessan in the new spring grass by the riverbank his body still shook but with weeping now when he lifted his head devin could see the tracks of tears and sweat and the staining mud from his hands slowly erlein raised his left hand and stared at it as if it was something alien that didnt even belong to him they all saw what had happened or the illusion of what had happened five fingers he had cast the spell an owl suddenly called short and clear from north along the river nearer to the trees devin became aware of a change in the sky he looked up blue ilarion waning back to a crescent had risen in the east ghostlight devin thought and wished he hadnt honor erlein di senzio said scarcely audible alessan had not moved since giving his command he looked down on the wizard he had bound and said quietly i did not enjoy that but i suppose we needed to go through it once will be enough i hope shall we eat he walked past devin and the duke and catriana to where baerd was waiting by the fire the meat was already cooking caught in a vortex of emotion devin saw the searching look baerd gave alessan he turned back in time to see sandre reaching out a hand to help erlein rise for a long moment erlein ignored him then with a sigh he grasped the dukes forearm and pulled himself erect devin followed catriana back toward the fire he heard the two wizards coming after them dinner passed in near silence erlein took his plate and glass and went to sit alone on the rock by the stream at the very farthest extent of the fires glow looking over at his dark outline sandre murmured that a younger man would very likely have refused to eat hes a survivor that one the duke added any wizard whos lasted this long has to be will he be all right then catriana asked softly with us i think so sandre answered sipping his wine he turned to alessan hell try to run away tonight though i know the prince said do we stop him it was baerd alessan shook his head not you i will he cannot leave me unless i let him if i call he must return i have him tethered to my mind it is a queer feeling queer indeed devin thought he looked from the prince to the dark figure by the river he couldnt even imagine what this must feel like or rather he could almost imagine it and the sensation disturbed him he became aware that catriana was looking at him and he turned to her this time she didnt look away her expression too was strange devin realized she must be feeling the same edginess and sense of unreality that he was he suddenly remembered vividly the feel of her head against his shoulder an hour ago at the time hed hardly registered the fact so intent had he been on erlein he tried to smile reassuringly but he didnt think he managed it troubadour you promised us harp music sandre called out abruptly the wizard in the darkness didnt respond devin had forgotten about that he didnt feel much like singing and he didnt think catriana did either so in the event what happened was that alessan expressionlessly claimed his tregean pipes and began to make music alone beside the fire he played beautifully with a pareddown economy of sound melodies so sweetly offered that devin in his current mood could almost imagine eannas stars and the blue crescent of the one moon pausing in their movements overhead so as not to have to wheel inexorably away from the grace of that music then a short while later devin realized what alessan was doing and he felt abruptly as if he was going to cry he held himself very still to keep control and he looked at the prince across the red and orange of the flames alessans eyes were closed as he played his lean face seemed almost hollowed out the cheekbones showing clearly and into the sounds he made he seemed to pour as from a votive temple bowl both the yearning that drove him and the decency and care that devin knew lay at the root of him but that wasnt it that wasnt what was making devin want to cry every song that alessan was playing every single tune achingly high and sweet heartbreakingly clear one after another was a song from senzio a song for erlein di senzio cloaked in bitterness and the shadows of night by the riverbank alone i will not say i am sorry alessan had told the wizard as the sun had set but i can tell you that i grieve and the night listening to the music the prince of tigana made upon his pipes devin learned the diiference between the two he watched alessan and then he watched the others as they looked at the prince and it was when he was gazing at baerd that the need to weep did grow too strong his own griefs rose to the call of the mountain pipes grief for alessan and overmastered erlein for baerd and his haunted night walking for sandre and his ten fingers and his dead son for catriana and himself all their generation rootless and cut off from what they were in a world without a home for all the myriad accumulations of loss and what men and women had to do in order to seek redress catriana went to the baggage and she opened and poured another bottle of wine the third glass and as always it was blue she filled devins glass in silence shed scarcely spoken a word all night but he felt closer to her than he had in a long time he drank slowly watching the cold smoke rise from his glass and drift away in the cool night the stars overhead were like icy points of fire and the moon was as blue as the wine and as far away as freedom or a home devin finished his glass and put it down he reached for his blanket and lay down himself wrapping it around him he found himself thinking about his father and of the twins for the first time in a long time a few moments later catriana lay down not far away usually she spread her sleepingroll and blanket on the far side of the fire from where he was next to the duke devin was wise enough now to know that there was a certain kind of reaching out in what she did and that tonight might even mark a chance to begin the healing of what lay badly between them but he was too drained to know what to do or say among all these complicated sorrows he said goodnight to her softly but she did not reply he wasnt sure if shed heard him but he didnt say it again he closed his eyes a moment later he opened them again to look at sandre across the fire the duke was gazing steadily into the flames devin wondered what he saw there he wondered but he didnt really want to know erlein was a shadow a darker place in the world against the dark by the riverbank devin lifted himself on one elbow to look for baerd but baerd had gone away to walk alone in the night alessan hadnt moved or opened his eyes he was still playing lonely and high and sorrowful when devin fell asleep he woke to baerds firm hand on his shoulder it was still dark and quite cold now the fire had been allowed to die to ember and ash catriana and the duke were still asleep but alessan was standing behind baerd he looked pale but composed devin wondered if hed gone to bed at all i need your help baerd murmured come shivering devin rolled out of his blankets and began pulling on his boots the moon was down he looked east but there was no sign of dawn along the horizon it was very still sleepily he shrugged into the woolen vest alais had sent him by way of taccio in ferraut he had no idea how long hed been asleep or what time it was he finished dressing and went to relieve himself in the trees by the river his breath smoked in the frosty air spring was coming but it wasnt quite here yet not in the middle of the night the sky was brilliantly clear and full of stars it would be a beautiful day later when the sun came right now he shivered and did up the drawstrings of his breeches then he realized that he hadnt seen erlein anywhere what happened he whispered to alessan as he returned to the camp you said you could call him back i did the prince said shortly standing closer devin could see now how weary he looked he fought it so hard that he passed out just now somewhere out there he gestured south and west come on baerd said again bring your sword they had to cross the stream the icy cold water drove all the sleep out of devin he gasped with the shock of it im sorry baerd said id have done it alone but i dont know how far away he is or what else is out here in this country alessan wants him back in camp before he revives it made sense to have two men no no thats fine devin protested his teeth were chattering i suppose i could have woken the old duke from his rest or catriana could have helped me what no really baerd im fine im he stopped because baerd was laughing at him belatedly devin caught on to the teasing it warmed him in a curious way this way in fact the first time hed ever been out alone in the night with baerd he chose to see it as another level of trust of welcoming little by little he was beginning to feel more of a part of what alessan and baerd had been trying to achieve for so many years he straightened his shoulders and walking as tall as he could followed baerd west into the darkness they found erlein di senzio at the edge of a cluster of olive trees on a slope about an hours walk from the camp devin swallowed awkwardly when he saw what had happened baerd whistled softly between his teeth it wasnt a pretty sight erlein was unconscious he had tied himself to one of the treetrunks and appeared to have knotted the rope at least a dozen times bending down baerd held up the wizards waterflask it was empty erlein had soaked the knots to tighten them his pack and his knife lay together on the ground a deliberate distance out of reach the rope was frayed and tangled it looked as if a number of knots had been undone but five or six still held look at his fingers baerd said grimly he drew his dagger and began cutting the rope erleins hands were shredded into raw strips dried blood covered both of them it was brutally clear what had happened he had tried to make it impossible for himself to yield to alessans summons what had he hoped for devin wondered that the prince would assume he had somehow escaped and would therefore forget about him devin doubted in fact if what erlein had done carried any such weight of rational thought it was defiance pure and simple and one had to acknowledge not even grudgingly the ferocity of it he helped baerd cut through the last of the bonds erlein was breathing but showed no signs of consciousness his pain must have been devastating devin realized with a flashing memory of the wizard beaten to his knees and screaming by the river he wondered what screams the night had heard here in this wild and lonely place he felt an awkward mixture of respect and pity and anger as he gazed down at the greyhaired troubadour why was he making this so hard for them why forcing alessan to shoulder so much more pain of his own unfortunately he knew some of the answers to that and they were not comforting will he try to kill himself he asked baerd abruptly i dont think so as sandre said this one is a survivor i dont think hell do this again he had to run once to test the limits of what would happen to him i would have done the same thing he hesitated i didnt expect the rope though devin took erleins pack and gear and baerds bow and quiver and sword baerd slung the unconscious wizard over his shoulder with a grunt and they started back east it was slower going back on the horizon in front of them when they reached the stream the first grey of false dawn was showing dimming the glow of the laterising stars the others were up and waiting for them beard laid erlein down by the fire sandre had it burning again devin dropped the gear and weapons and went back to the river with a basin for water when he returned catriana and the duke began cleaning and wrapping erleins mangled hands they had opened his shirt and turned up the sleeves revealing angry weals where he had writhed against the ropes in his struggle to be free or is that backwards devin thought grimly wasnt the binding of the rope his real struggle to be free he looked over and saw alessan gazing down at erlein he could read absolutely nothing in the princes expression the sun rose and shortly after that erlein woke they could see him register where he was khav sandre asked him casually the five of them were sitting by the fire eating breakfast drinking from steaming mugs the light from the east was a pale delicate hue a promise it glinted and sparkled on the water of the stream and turned the budding leaves greengold on the trees the air was filled with birdsong and the leap and splash of trout in the stream erlein sat up slowly and looked at them devin saw him become aware of the bandages on his hands erlein glanced over at the saddled horses and the two carts packed and ready for the road his gaze swung back and steadied on alessans face the two men so improbably bound looked at each other without speaking then alessan smiled a smile devin knew it opened his stern face to warmth and lit the slategrey of his eyes had i known alessan said that you hated tregean pipes quite that much i honestly wouldnt have played them a moment later horribly erlein di senzio began to laugh there was no joy in that sound nothing infectious nothing to be shared his eyes were squeezed shut and tears welled out of them pouring down his face no one else spoke or moved it lasted for a long time when erlein had finally composed himself he wiped his face on his sleeve careful of his bandaged hands and looked at alessan again he opened his mouth about to speak and then closed it again i know alessan said quietly to him i do know khav sandre said again after a moment this time erlein accepted a mug cradling it awkwardly in both muffled hands not long after they broke camp and started south again chapter five days later on the eve of the ember days of spring they came to castle borso all that last afternoon as they moved south devin had been watching the mountains any child raised in the watery lowlands of asoli could not help but be awed by the towering southland ranges the braccio here in certando the parravi east towards tregea and though hed never seen them the rumor of the snowclad sfaroni highest of all over west where tigana once had been it was late in the day far to the north on that same afternoon isolla of ygrath lay dead and dismembered under a bloody sheet in the audience chamber of the palace on chiara the sun setting behind a thrust spur of the mountains dyed the peaks to burgundy and red and a somber purple hue on the very highest summits the snow still shone and dazzled in the last of the light devin could just make out the line of the braccio pass as it came down one of the three fabled passes that had linked in some seasons and never easily the peninsula of the palm with quileia to the south in the old days before the matriarchy had taken deep root in quileia there had been trade across the mountains and the brooding piety of the springtime ember days had also presaged a quickening and stir of commercial life with the promise of the passes opening again the towns and fortresscastles here in the southern highlands had been vibrant and vital then welldefended too because where a trade caravan could cross so could an army but no king of quileia had ever been secure enough on his throne to lead an army north not with the high priestesses standing by at home to see him fail or fall here in certando the private armies had mostly bloodied their blades and arrows against each other in savage southland feuds that ranged over generations and became the stuff of legend and then the quileian matriarchy had come to power after all in the time of achis and pasitheia several hundred years ago quileia under the priestesses had folded inward upon itself like a flower at dusk and the caravans ended the southland cities dwindled into villages or if flexible and energetic enough they changed their character and turned their faces northward and to other things as avalle of the towers had done in tigana here in the certandan highlands the mighty lords who had once held glittering court in their huge warlike castles became living anachronisms their forays and battles with each other once integral to the flow of events in the palm became more and more inconsequential though not the less bitter or vicious for that to devin touring with menico di ferraut it had sometimes seemed that every second ballad they sang was of some lord or younger son pursued by enemies among these crags or of illfated southland lovers divided by the hatred of their fathers or of the bloody deeds of those fathers untamed as hawks in their stern high castles among these foothills of the braccio and of those ballads whether wild with battle and blood and villages set afire or lamenting parted lovers drowning themselves in silent pools hidden in the misty hills of all those songs half again it seemed to devin were of the borso clan and set in and around the massive piled grim splendor of castle borso hard under braccio pass there hadnt been any new ballads for a long time very few in fact since the quileian caravans had stopped but of fresh stories and rumors there had been many in the past two decades a great many in her own particular way and in her own lifetime alienor of castle borso had already become a legend among the men and women of the road and if these newer stories were about love as so many of the older songs had been they had little to do with anguished youth bewailing fate on windswept crags and rather more to tell about certain changes within castle borso itself about deep woven carpets and tapestries about imported silk and lace and velvet and profoundly disconcerting works of art in rooms that had once seen hard men plan midnight raids at trestletables while unruly hunting dogs had fought for flung bones among the rushes of the floor riding beside erlein in the second cart devin dragged his gaze away from the last shining of light on the peaks and looked at the castle they were nearing tucked into a fold of hills with a moat around it and a small village just beyond borso was already in shadow even as he watched devin saw lights being lit in the windows the last lights until the end of the ember days alienor is a friend was all that alessan had volunteered an old friend that much at least was evident from the greeting she gave him when her seneschal tall and stooped with a magnificent white beard ushered them gravely into the firelit warmth of the great hall alessans color was unusually high when the lady of the castle unlaced her long fingers from his hair and withdrew her lips from his own she hadnt hurried the encounter neither even more interestingly had he alienor stepped back smiling a little to survey his companions she favored erlein with a nod of recognition welcome back troubadour two years is it even so my lady i am honored that you remember erleins bow harkened back to an earlier age to the manner theyd seen before alessan had bound him you were alone then i remember i am pleased to see you now in such splendid company erlein opened his mouth and then closed it without replying alienor glanced at alessan a fleeting inquiry in her very dark eyes receiving no response she turned to the duke and the curiosity in her face sharpened thoughtfully she laid a finger against her cheek and tilted her head slightly to one side the disguised sandre endured her scrutiny impassively very well done said alienor of borso softly so the servants and the seneschal by the doors could not hear i imagine that baerd has the whole palm taking you for a khardhu i wonder who you really are under all of that her smile was quite ravishing devin didnt know whether to be impressed or unsettled an instant later that particular dilemma was rendered irrelevant you dont know said erlein di senzio loudly a terrible oversight allow me the introduction my lady may i present to you the he got no further devin was the first to react which surprised him thinking about it afterwards hed always been quick though and he was closest to the wizard what he did the only thing he could think of to do was pivot sharply and bury his fist as hard as he could in erleins belly as it was he was only a fraction of a second ahead of catriana on erleins other side she had leaped to clap her hand over the wizards mouth the force of devins blow doubled erlein over with a grunt of pain this in turn had the unintended effect of throwing catriana off balance and stumbling forward to be smoothly caught and braced by alienor the whole thing had taken perhaps three seconds erlein sank to his knees on the opulent carpet devin knelt beside him he heard alienor dismissing her servants from the room you are a fool baerd snarled at the wizard he certainly is alienor agreed in a rather different tone all exaggerated petulance and flounce why would anyone think id want the burden of knowing the true identity of a disguised khardhu warrior she was still holding catriana around the waist quite unnecessarily now she let her go with an amused expression at the girls rapid retreat you are an impetuous creature arent you she murmured silkily not especially said catriana hardily stopping a few feet away alienors mouth quirked she looked catriana up and down with an expert eye i am horribly jealous of you she pronounced at length and i would be even if you had that hair chopped off and those eyes sewn shut what magnificent men you are traveling with are they catrianas voice was indifferent but her color was suddenly high are they alienor echoed sharply you mean you havent established that for yourself dear child what have you been doing with your nights of course they are dont waste your youth my dear catriana looked at her levelly i dont think i am she said but i doubt wed have the same thoughts on that subject devin winced but alienors answer was mild perhaps not she agreed unruffled but in truth i think the overlap would actually be greater than you imagine she paused you may also find as you get older that ice is for deaths and endings not for beginnings any kind of beginnings on the other hand i will ensure she added with a smile that was all kindness that you have a sufficiency of blankets to keep you warm tonight erlein groaned dragging devins attention away from the two women he heard catriana say i thank you for your solicitude but he missed her expression from the tone he could hazard a guess at what it would be he supported erleins head as the wizard labored to get his wind back alienor simply ignored them she was greeting baerd now with a friendly civility a tone that was cheerfully matched devin noted instinctively by baerds own manner towards her im sorry he whispered to erlein i couldnt think of anything else erlein waved a feeble stillunhealed hand hed insisted on removing the bandages before theyd entered the castle im sorry he wheezed surprising devin considerably i forgot about the servants he wiped his lips with the back of one hand i wont achieve much for myself if i get us all killed not my idea of freedom that nor frankly is this posture my notion of middleaged dignity since you knocked me down you can kindly help me up for the first time devin heard a faint note of amusement in the troubadours voice a survivor sandre had said as tactfully as he could he helped the other man stand the extremely violent one alessan was saying drily is devin dasoli he also sings if you are very good he may sing for you devin turned away from erlein but perhaps because hed been distracted by what had just happened he was quite unprepared to deal with the gaze he now encountered there is no possible way he found himself thinking that this woman is forty years old he reflexively sketched the performers bow menico had taught him to cover his confusion she was almost forty and he knew it alienor had been widowed two years after shed been wed when cornaro of borso had died in the barbadian invasion of certando the stories and descriptions of the beautiful widow in her southland castle had begun very shortly after that they didnt come even near to catching what she was what he saw standing before him in a long gown of a blue so deep it was nearly black her hair was black worn high upon her head and held by a diadem of white gold studded with gems a few tendrils of hair had been artlessly allowed to fall free framing the perfect oval of her face her eyes were indigo almost violet under the long lashes and her mouth was full and red and smiling a private smile as she looked at devin he forced himself to meet that look doing so he felt as though all the sluicegates in his veins had been hurled open and his blood was a river in flood racing through a steep wild course at an everincreasing speed her smile grew deeper more private as if she could actually see that happening inside him and the dark eyes grew wider for an instant i suppose said alienor di certando before turning back to alessan that i shall have to try to be very good then if that will induce you to sing for me her breasts were full and high devin saw could not help but see the gown was cut very low and a diamond pendant hung against her skin drawing the eye like a bluewhite fire he shook his head fighting to clear it a little shocked at his own reaction this was ridiculous he told himself sternly he had been overheated by the stories told his imagination rendered unruly by the opulent sensuous furnishings in the room he looked upwards for distraction and then wished he hadnt on the ceiling someone not a stranger to the act of love had painted adaons primal coupling with eanna the face of the goddess was very clearly that of alienor and the painting showed just as clearly that she was in the very moment of rapture when the stars had streamed into being from her ecstasy there were indeed stars streaming all across the background of the ceiling fresco it was however difficult to look at the background of the fresco devin forced his eyes down what helped him reclaim his composure was meeting catrianas glance just then a mingled look of caustic irony and a second thing he couldnt quite recognize for all her own splendor and the wild crimson glory of her hair catriana looked exceptionally young just then almost a child devin thought sagely not yet fully realized or accomplished in her womanhood the lady of castle borso was complete in what she was from her sandaled feet to the band in her lustrous hair her nails devin noticed belatedly were painted the same blueblack dangerous color as her gown he swallowed and looked away again i expected you yesterday alienor was saying to alessan i was waiting for you and id made myself beautiful for you but you didnt come just as well then alessan murmured smiling had i seen you any more beautiful than you are now i might never have found the strength to leave her mouth curled mischievously she turned to the others you see how the man torments me not a quarter of an hour in my home and he speaks of leaving am i well served in such a friend the question was addressed as it happened directly to devin his throat was dry her glance did disruptive things to the orderly flow of messages from brain to tongue he essayed a smile suspecting rather that the expression produced fell somewhere between the fatuous and the imbecilic wine devin thought desperately he was in serious need of an effective glass of something as if summoned by an art of timing more subtle than wizardry three servants in blue livery reappeared each bearing seven glasses on a tray two of the trays devin saw bore a red wine that was almost certainly certandan the wine in the third set of glasses was blue devin turned to alessan the prince was looking at alienor with an expression that spoke to something private and shared far in the past for a moment her own expression and demeanor altered as if she had laid aside for an instant the reflexive spinning of her webs of enticement and devin a far more perceptive man than he had been six months before thought he saw the hint of a sadness in her eyes then she spoke and he was certain that hed seen it in some subtle way it calmed him and shed a different milder light on the mood in the room it is not a thing i am likely to forget she said softly to alessan gesturing towards the blue wine nor i he replied since it began here she was silent a moment eyelids lowered then the moment passed alienors eyes were sparkling again when they lifted i have the usual collection of letters for you but one is very recent she said brought two days ago by a very young priest of eanna who was terrified of me the whole time he was here he wouldnt even stay the night though he only arrived at sunset i swear he rode out so fast he must have feared id have his robe off if he lingered for a meal and would you have alessan grinned she made a face unlikely eannas sort are seldom worth the trouble though he was pretty almost as pretty as baerd come to think of it baerd quite unperturbed simply smiled alienors glance lingered flirtatiously on him there too devin noted an exchange that spoke to events and things shared a long way back he felt young suddenly and out of his depth where is the new message from alessan asked alienor hesitated west was all she said she glanced at the rest of them with a veiled question in her eyes alessan noted it you may speak freely i trust every man and woman here he was careful not to even look at erlein devin did look but if hed expected a reaction from the wizard he was disappointed with a gesture alienor dismissed her servants the old seneschal had already withdrawn to see to the preparation of their rooms when they were alone alienor walked over to a writingtable by one of the four blazing fireplaces and claimed a sealed envelope from a drawer she came back and gave it to alessan it is from danoleon himself she said from your own province whose name i cannot yet hear or say and that devin had not expected at all forgive me alessan murmured he strode quickly toward the nearest fire tearing the letter open as he went alienor became very busy offering glasses of the red wine devin took a long drink from his then he noticed that baerd had not touched his wine and that his gaze was fixed on alessan across the room devin followed the look the prince had finished reading he was standing rigidly staring into the fire alessan baerd said alienor turned swiftly at that alessan did not move seemed not to have even heard alessan baerd said again more urgently what is it slowly the prince of tigana turned from the flames to look at them or not really at them devin amended inwardly at baerd there was something bleak and cold in his face ice is for endings devin thought involuntarily it is from danoleon im afraid from the sanctuary alessans voice was flat my mother is dying i will have to start home tomorrow baerds face had gone as white as alessans the meeting he said the meeting tomorrow that first alessan said after the meeting whatever happens i must ride home given the shock of that news and the impact alessans words and manner had on all of them the knock on devins chamber door late that night came as a disorienting surprise he had not been asleep wait he called softly and struggled quickly into his breeches he pulled a loose shirt on over his head and padded in his stockings across the floor wincing at the cold of the stones where the carpeting ended his hair disordered feeling rumpled and confused he opened the door in the hallway outside holding a single candle that cast weird flickering shadows along the corridor wall was alienor herself come was all she said she did not smile and he could not see her eyes behind the flame her robe was a creamy white lined with fur it was fastened at the throat but devin could discern the swell of her breasts beneath her hair had been loosened tumbling over her shoulders and down her back in a black cascade devin hesitated his mouth dry again his mind scattered and lagging he put up a hand to try to straighten the hopeless tangle of his hair she shook her head leave it like that she said her free hand with the long dark nails came up and pushed through his brown curls leave it she said again and turned he followed her her and the single candle and the unleashed chaos of his blood down a long corridor then a shorter one through an angled sequence of empty public rooms then up a curving flight of stairs at the top of the stairs an orange spill of light came from beyond a pair of open doors devin passed through those doors behind the lady of castle borso he had time to register the blaze of the fire the rich intricate hangings on the walls the profusion of extravagant carpets on the floor and the huge canopied bed strewn with pillows of all colors and sizes a lean hunting dog grey and graceful regarded him from by the fire but did not rise alienor laid her candle down she closed the two doors and turned to him leaning back against the polished wood her eyes were enormous uncannily black devin felt his pulse like a hammer the rush of his blood seemed loud in his veins i am burning up alienor said somewhere a part of him where proportion lived and irony took shape wanted to protest even to be amused at such a pronouncement but as he looked at her he saw the quickening draw of her breathing and how shallow it was saw the deep flush of her coloring one of his hands as if of its own will came up and touched her cheek it was burning hot with a sound deep in her throat alienor trapped his hand with one of her own and sank her teeth in the flesh of his palm and with that pain desire was loosed in devin as it never had been in his life he heard an oddly distorted sound and realized it had come from him he took a halfstep toward her and she was in his arms her fingers locked and twisted in his hair and her mouth met his with an avidness a hunger that raked the rising fires of his own need to a point where awareness fled and drifted far away everything was gone or going tigana alessan alais catriana his memories memory itself that was his most sure anchor and his pride even the memory of the hallways to this room the roads and years and rooms all the other rooms that led to this one and her he tore at the fastenings of her robe and buried his face between her breasts as they spilled free she gasped and her hands clawed at his shirt until it came away he felt her nails tear the skin along his back he twisted his head and bit her then and tasted blood he heard her laugh never ever had he done such a thing before somehow they seemed to be on the bed among the colored splay of the pillows and then alienor was naked above him impaled on his sex her mouth descending to his own as the two of them surged together through the arc of an act that strove to cast the world away as far away as it could be hurled for an instant devin thought he understood in some unthinking flash of visceral illumination he thought he grasped why alienor did this the nature of her need which was not what it seemed to be given another moment a still place in the firmament he could have reached out to put a name to it a frame for the blurred awareness he reached she cried out with her climax her hands slid along his skin curving down desire obliterated thought any straining towards thought with a racking twist he virtually threw her to one side and swung himself above her never leaving the warm shelter between her thighs cushions scattered around them fell on the floor her eyes were tightly shut her mouth forming soundless words devin began to drive himself into her as if to drive away all the demons and the hurts all the brutal deadening truths that were the world of the palm in their day his own climax when it came left him shuddering and limp lost to where he was only dimly clinging to what he knew to be his name he heard her whispering it softly over and over she moved gently out from under him he rolled over on his back eyes closed he felt her fingers glide along his skin he could not move she was playing with his hands caressing and guiding them out from his sides her lips and fingers danced down his chest and belly over his satiated sex and further down exploring along his thighs and legs and down by the time he was aware of what shed done he was bound hand and foot to the four posts of her bed spreadeagled beneath her his eyes flew open startled and alarmed he struggled uselessly he was held in bonds of silk looped and knotted that said alienor in a husky voice was a wonderful beginning to a night shall i teach you something now she reached naked and magnificent flushed and scored with his marks upon her and brought something up from the floor beside the bed his eyes grew wide when he saw what it was she held you are binding me against my will devin said a little desperately this is not my idea of how to come together in love he twisted hard again at shoulder and hip the silken bonds held firm alienors answering smile was luminous she was more beautiful in that moment than he could ever have imagined a woman being in the huge dark pools of her eyes something stirred primal and dangerous and terrifyingly arousing he felt improbably soon a quickening in his sex she saw it her smile deepened one long fingernail stroked lightly almost meditatively along his gathering tumescence it will be murmured his dark lady the lady of castle borso her lips parted showing the sharp white teeth behind he registered the taut firmness of her nipples as she opened her legs to straddle him again he saw her caress what she had claimed from the carpet by the bed beyond her by the fire the wolfhound had its handsome head raised watching them it will be alienor said again trust me let me teach you now and show you this and then this and soon it will be your idea of how to come together oh yes devin it will be very soon she moved upon his body and the candlelight was deflected and then hidden as she came down over him he struggled but only for a moment for his heart was pounding again and desire was overwhelmingly upon him just as alienor was just as her own complex needs could be seen rising in her again in the darkness of her eyes before they closed in her movements above him and in the ragged reaching upward straining of her breath and before the night was over before the half of it had passed with the last candles of winter burning down she had proven herself right terribly over and over again and at the end even she was the one who lay bound and open between the four pillars of the world that was her bed and devin was no longer quite sure of who he was that he should be doing to her the things he was the things that made her whisper and then cry aloud his name as she did over and again but he did know that she had changed him and had found a place within him where his need to seek oblivion was equal to her own the candle on his side of the bed burned out some time later there was a small scented drifting of smoke the pattern of light and shade in the room changed neither of them was asleep they both noticed it the fire was down to its embers the dog still lay before it its magnificent head stretched out on its paws you had better go alienor said stroking his near shoulder absently while theres a candle for you to carry it is easy to lose your way in the dark you observe the ember days he asked a little surprised at such piety no fires no fires she said ruefully half my household staff would leave me and i dont even want to guess at what the tenant farmers or the villagers would do storm the castle call down some ancient curse with ears of corn soaked in blood these are the southern highlands devin they take their rites seriously up here as seriously as you take yours she smiled at that and stretched like a cat i suppose so the fanners will do things tonight and tomorrow that i prefer not to know about with a sinuous motion she curled downwards towards the foot of the bed and reached for something on the carpet by the bedposts her body was a smooth candlelit curve of white flesh with the marks he had made on her still showing red she straightened and handed him his breeches it felt abrupt a dismissal and devin gave her a long stare not moving she met the look but her eyes were neither hard nor dismissive dont be angry alienor said softly you were too splendid to be leaving in anger im telling you truths i do observe the ember rites and it is hard to find your way back without a light she hesitated a moment then added and i have always slept alone since my husband died devin said nothing he rose and dressed his shirt he found halfway between the bed and the doors it was shredded so badly it should have been amusing he wasnt amused though in fact he was angry or some feeling beyond anger or beside it a more complex thing lying naked and uncovered among the scattered pillows of her bed alienor watched him clothe himself he looked at her marveling still at her feline magnificence and even despite the change of mood even aware of how easy it would be for her to stir his desire again but as he gazed at her a dormant thought surfaced from wherever thought had been driven in the primitive frenzy of the last few hours he arranged the shirt as best he could and walked over to claim one of the candles in a brass holder she had turned on her side to follow his movements her head now resting on one hand the black hair tumbling about her her body offered to his sight as a gift a glory in the shifting light her eyes were wide and direct her smile generous even kind goodnight she said i dont know whether you know it but you are welcome back should you choose to come one day he hadnt expected that he knew without having to be told that she was honoring him with this but his thought his disquiet from before was strong now and intermingled with other images so that although he smiled in return and nodded it was neither pride nor honor that he felt goodnight he said and turned to go at the doors he stopped and as much because he had remembered alessan saying that the blue wine had begun with her as for any other single reason that he knew then or later devin turned back to her she had not moved he looked drinking in the opulence of the chamber and the proffered beauty of the woman on the bed even as he stood there another candle died on the far side of the room is this what happens to us devin said then quietly reaching for words to frame this new hard thought when we are no longer free is this what happens to our love he could see her eyes change even from this distance and in this wavering of light and dark for a long time she looked back at him you are clever she said finally alessan has chosen well in you he waited ah said alienor throatily simulating astonishment he actually wants an answer a true answer from a lady in her castle at the edge of the world it may have been a trick of the uncertain light but she seemed to look away then beyond where devin stood even beyond the tapestried walls of her room it is one of the things that happens to us she said at last a kind of insurrection in the dark that somehow stands against the laws of day that bind us and cannot be broken now devin thought about it possibly that he agreed softly working it through or else an admission somewhere in the soul that we deserve no more than this nothing that goes deeper since we are not free and have accepted that he saw her flinch then and close her eyes did i deserve that she asked a terrible sadness passed over devin he swallowed with some difficulty no he said no you didnt her eyes were still closed when he left the room he felt heavy and burdened beyond merely tired laden with the weight of his thoughts slowed by them he stumbled going down the stairwell and had to fling out his free hand to brace himself against the stone wall the motion left the candle unguarded and it went out it was very dark then the castle was utterly still moving carefully devin reached the bottom of the stairs and he put the spent flame down on a ledge there at intervals high in the walls tall thin windows let slanting moonlight fall across the corridor but the angle and the hour did not allow for any real illumination briefly he considered going back for another candle but then after standing still a moment to let his eyes adjust devin set out along what he thought to be the way they had come he was lost very soon though not really alarmed in his present mood there seemed to be something apposite about padding thus silently down the darkened hallways of this ancient highland castle in the dead of night the stones cold against his feet there are no wrong turnings only paths we had not known we were meant to walk who had told him that the words had come unbidden to his mind from some recess of memory he turned into an unfamiliar corridor and passed through a long room hung with paintings part of the way through he found a voice for the words it had been the old priest of morian at the goddesss temple by his familys farm in asoli he had taught the twins and then devin how to read and do sums and when it appeared that the youngest boy the small one could sing he had given devin his first lessons in the rudiments of harmony no wrong turnings devin thought again and then with a shiver he could not suppress he remembered that this was not just the nadir of a night it was the end of winter the first of the ember days when the dead were said to walk abroad the dead who were his dead marra his mother whom he had never known tigana could a country a province be said to have died could it be lost and mourned like a living soul he thought of the barbadian he had slain in the nievolene barn he did quicken his pace then over the dark sporadically moonlit stones of the vast and silent castle it seemed to devin that he walked for an endless time or a time outside of time passing no one hearing nothing save for his own breathing or the soft tread of his feet before he finally recognized a statue in an alcove he had admired it by torchlight earlier in the evening he knew his room was just ahead and around a corner to the right somehow he had come entirely the wrong way along the whole far wing of castle borso he also knew from earlier in the evening that the room directly opposite the small fine statue of the bearded archer drawing a bow was catrianas he looked up and down the corridor but saw only greater and lesser shadows among the bands of white moonlight falling from above he listened and heard no sound if the dead were abroad they were silent no wrong turnings ploto the priest had told him long ago he thought of alienor lying with her eyes closed among her bright cushions and all her candles and he was sorry for what hed said to her at the end he was sorry for many things alessans mother was dying his own was dead ice is for deaths and endings alienor had said to catriana in the hall he was cold and very sad he moved forward and ended the silence knocking gently on catrianas door shed had a restless night for many reasons alienor had disturbed her both the unbridled sensuousness that emanated from the woman and the obviously close unknown past she shared with alessan and baerd catriana hated unknown things information hidden from her she still didnt know what alessan was going to do tomorrow what this mysterious meeting in the highlands was all about and ignorance made her uneasy and even on a less acknowledged level afraid she wished she could be more like devin sometimes matching his seemingly tranquil acceptance of what he could or could not know she has seen him storing away the pieces of what he did learn and patiently waiting to receive another piece and then putting them together like the tiles of a childrens puzzle game sometimes she admired that sometimes it made her wild and contemptuous to see him so accepting of alessans occasional reticence or baerds chronic reserve catriana needed to know she had been ignorant for so much of her life shielded from her own history in that tiny fishing village in astibar she felt that there was so much lost time to be regained sometimes it made her want to weep that was how shed been feeling this evening before drifting into a shallow uneasy sleep and a dream of home she often dreamt of home since shed left especially of her mother this time she saw herself walking through the village just after sunrise passing the last house tendos she even saw his dog and then rounding the familiar curve of the shore to where her father had bought a derelict cottage and repaired it and raised a family in her dream she saw the boat already far out trawling among the earlymorning swell of the sea it seemed to be springtime her mother was in the doorway of the cottage mending nets in the good light of the sunrise her eyes had been going bad for years and it was hard for her to work with her needle in the evenings catriana had gradually taken over the nighttime needlework in her last year at home it was a beautiful morning in the dream the stones of the beach gleamed and the breeze was fresh and light off the water all the other boats were out as well taking advantage of the morning but it was easy to tell which one was their own catriana walked up the path and stood by the newly mended porch waiting for her mother to look up and see her and leap to her feet with a cry and fold her daughter in her arms her mother did glance up from her work but only to gaze seaward squinting toward the light to check the position of their boat an old habit a nervous one and one that had probably done much to hurt her eyes shed a husband and three sons in that small boat though she didnt see her daughter at all catriana realized with a queer pain that she was invisible here because she had gone because she had left them and wasnt there any longer there was more grey she saw in her mothers hair and her heart ached as she stood there in mild sunlight to see how worn and hard her mothers hands were and how tired the kind face was she had always thought of her mother as a young woman until tiena the baby had died in the plague six years ago things had changed after that it isnt fair she thought and in the dream she cried aloud and was not heard her mother sat on a wooden chair on the porch in the early light working on the nets occasionally looking up to check the position of one small boat among so many bobbing on this alien eastern sea so far from the one shed loved catriana woke her body twisting violently away from all the hurts embedded in that image she opened her eyes waiting for her heartbeat to slow lying under several blankets in a room in castle borso alienors castle alienor who was the same age as catrianas worn tired mother it truly was not fair why should she be carrying such guilt seeing such sad hurtful images in her sleep for having gone away why when it was her mother who had given her the ring when she was fourteen in the year the baby died the ring that marked her as from tigana and by the sea for anyone who knew the ancient symbols and for no one else the ring that had so marked her for alessan bar valentin two years ago when he and baerd had seen her selling eels and freshcaught telanquy in ardin town just up the coast from the village she had not been a trusting person at eighteen she could not have said then or now why shed trusted the two of them and joined them for that walk upriver out of town when the market was done if pushed to an answer she would have said that there was something about baerd that had reassured her it was on that walk that they had told her about her ring and about tigana and the axis of her life had tilted another way a new running of time had begun from that moment and with it the need to know at home that evening after dinner after the boys had gone to bed she told her parents that she now knew where they were from and what her ring meant and she asked her father what he was going to do to help her bring tigana back and what he had been doing all these years it was the only time in her life shed ever seen her mild innocuous father in a rage and the only time hed ever struck her her mother wept her father stormed about the house in the awkward manner of a man unused to raging and he swore upon the triad that hed not taken his wife and daughter away before the ygrathen invasion and the fall only to be sucked back into that ancient grief now and thus had catriana learned the second thing that had changed her life the youngest of the boys had begun crying her father had stomped out then slamming the door rattling the windows catriana and her mother had looked at each other in silence a long time while a frightened child gradually subsided in the loft above their heads catriana held up her hand and showed the ring shed worn for the past four years she had looked a question with her eyes and her mother had nodded once not weeping now the embrace they exchanged was one they both expected to be their last catriana had found alessan and baerd at the bestknown of the inns in ardin town it had been a bright night she remembered both moons high and nearly full the night watchman at the inn had leered at her and groped when she sidled by him up the stairs toward the room hed identified she had knocked and alessan had opened to her name his grey eyes even before she spoke had been curiously dark as if anticipating a burden or a grief i am coming with you she had said my father was a coward we fled before the invasion i intend to make that up i will not sleep with you though ive never slept with any man can i trust you both awake in castle borso she blushed in the darkness remembering that how impossibly young she must have sounded to them neither man had laughed though or even smiled she would never forget that can you sing was all that alessan had said she fell asleep again thinking about music about all the songs shed sung with him crossing the palm for two years this time when she dreamt it was about water about swimming in the sea at home her greatest sweetest joy diving for shells at summer twilight among the startled flashing fish feeling the water wrap her like a second skin then without warning or transition the dream changed and she was on the bridge in tregea again in a gathering of winter dark and wind more terrified than she had imagined a soul could be only herself to blame her own pride her gnawing consuming unslaked need to make redress for the fact that they had fled she saw herself mount and balance on the railing again saw the racing black tumultuous water far below heard even over the loud rush of the river the pounding of her heart and woke a second time just before the nightmare of her leap woke because what she had heard as the beat of her heart was a knocking at her door who is it she called devin will you let me come in abruptly she sat up in bed and pulled the topmost blanket to her chin what is it she called im not sure actually may i come in the door isnt locked she said finally she made sure the blankets were covering her but the room was so dark it didnt really matter she heard him enter but saw only the outline of his form thank you he said you should lock your door you know she wondered if he had any idea how much she hated being told things like that the only person likely to be roaming tonight was our hostess and she was unlikely to be coming for me theres a chair to your left she heard him reach for it and sink back with a sigh into the deep armchair i suppose thats true enough he said in a drained voice and im sorry you dont really need me to be telling you how to take care of yourself she listened for irony but heard none i seem to have managed tolerably well without your guidance she said mildly he was silent then catriana i honestly dont know why im here im in such a strange mood tonight i feel ridiculously sad there was something extremely odd in his voice she hesitated a moment then carefully adjusting the blankets reached over to strike a flint you light fires on the ember days he asked evidently she lit the candle by her bed then somewhat regretting the waspishness of that reply added my mother used to light one just one as a reminder to the triad she used to say though i only understood what she meant after i met alessan thats strange so did my father devin said wonderingly ive never thought about that i never knew why he did it my father was not a man who explained things she turned to look at him but he was deep in the chair and the wings hid his face a reminder of tigana she said it would have to have been as if as if the triad didnt deserve full devotion or observance because of what theyd allowed he paused then in a meditative tone added its another example of our pride isnt it of that tiganese arrogance sandre always talks about we make bargains with the triad we balance scales with them they take away our name we take away a part of their rites i suppose so she said though it didnt really strike her that way devin talked like this sometimes she didnt see the action as one of pride or bargaining just as a reminder to the self of how great a wrong had come to pass a reminder like alessans blue wine my mother is not a proud woman she said surprising herself i dont know what mine was like he said in that tightened voice i dont even know if i could say that my father is proud i guess i dont know very much about him either he really did sound peculiar devin she said sharply lean forward let me look at you she checked her blankets they covered her to the chin slowly he shifted forward the candlelight spilled across his wildly disheveled hair the torn shirt and the visible scratches and marks of teeth she felt a quick surge of anger and then a slower deeper anxiety that had nothing to do with him or not directly she masked both reactions behind a sardonic laugh she was roaming i see you look like youve been to war with an effort he managed a brief smile but there was something somber in his eyes she could read it even by candlelight it unsettled her what is it then she pursued with broad sarcasm you tired her out and came here wanting more i can tell you no he said quickly no it isnt that it is hardly that catriana it has been a difficult night you certainly look as if it was she retorted her hands gripping the blankets he pushed on doggedly not that way its so strange so complicated i think i learned something there i think devin i really dont want the details she was angry with herself for how edgy this sort of thing made her feel no no not like that though yes there was that at the beginning but he drew a breath i think what i learned was something about what the tyrants have done to us not just brandin and not just in tigana alberico too both of them and to all of us such insight she mocked reflexively she must be even more skillful than you imagined which silenced him he leaned back in the chair again and she couldnt see his face in the quiet that followed her breathing grew calmer im sorry she said at length i didnt mean that im tired ive had some bad dreams tonight what do you want from me devin im not sure he said i guess to be a friend again she felt pushed and uneasy she resisted an instinctive nervous urge to suggest he go write a letter to one of rovigos daughters she said ive never been good at that even as a child nor i he said shifting forward again he had pushed his hair into a semblance of order he said it is more than that between you and i though you hate me sometimes dont you she felt her heart thump we do not have to discuss this devin i dont hate you sometimes you do he pursued in that strange dogged tone because of what happened in the sandreni palace he paused and drew a shaky breath because i was the first man you ever made love with she closed her eyes tried unsuccessfully to will that last sentence not to have been spoken you knew not then i figured it out later pieces of another puzzle patiently putting it together figuring her out she opened her eyes and gazed bleakly at him and is it your idea that discussing this interesting subject will make us friends he winced probably not i dont know i thought id tell you i want to be there was a silence i honestly dont know catriana im sorry surprisingly her shock and anger had both passed she saw him slump back again exhausted and she did the same reclining against the wooden headboard of her bed she thought for a while marveling at how calm she felt i dont hate you devin she said finally truly i dont nothing like that it is an awkward memory i wont deny that but i dont think it has ever hindered us in what we have to do which is what really matters isnt it i suppose so he said she couldnt see his face if that is all that matters i mean its true what i said before ive always been bad at making friends why pieces of the puzzle again but she said as a girl im not sure maybe i was shy perhaps proud i never felt easy in our village even though it was the only home id ever known but since baerd named tigana for me since i heard the name that has been all there is in the world for me all that counts for anything at all she could almost hear him thinking about that he said ice is for endings which is exactly what alienor had said to her he went on you are still a living person catriana with a heart a life to live access to friendship even to love why are you sealing yourself down to the one thing only and she heard herself reply because my father never fought he fled tigana like a coward before the battles at the river she could have ripped her tongue bleeding from her mouth out at the very root the moment she had spoken oh he said not a word devin dont say a word he obeyed sitting very still almost invisible in the depths of his chair abruptly she blew out the candle she didnt want light now and then because it was dark and because he was so obligingly silent she was gradually able to regain control of herself to move past the meaning of this moment without weeping it took a long time in the darkness but eventually she was able to draw a long steady breath and know she was all right thank you she said not entirely sure what she was thanking him for mostly the silence there was no reply she waited a moment then softly called his name again no answer she listened and eventually was able to make out the steady rise and fall of his breathing in sleep she had enough of a sense of irony to find that amusing he had evidently had a difficult night though and not just in the obvious ways she thought about waking him and sending him back to his own room it would most certainly raise eyebrows if they were seen leaving here together in the morning she discovered though that she didnt really care she also realized that she minded less than shed expected that hed figured out the one truth about her and had just learned another about her father but really more about herself she wondered about that why it didnt bother her more she considered putting one of the blankets over him but resisted the impulse for some reason she didnt really want him waking in the morning and knowing shed done that rovigos daughters did that sort of thing not she or no the younger daughter would have had him in this bed and inside her by now strange moods and exhaustion notwithstanding the older would have woven a new quilt at miraculous speed and tucked it around him with a note attached as to the lineage of the sheep that had given the wool and the history of the pattern shed chosen catriana smiled to herself in the darkness and settled back to sleep her restlessness seemed to have passed and she did not dream again when she woke just after dawn he was gone she didnt learn until later just how far chapter elena stood by the open door of mattios house looking up the dark road to the moat and the raised drawbridge watching the candles flicker and go out one by one in the windows of castle borso at intervals people walked past her into the house offering only a nod or a brief greeting if anything at all it was a night of battle that lay ahead of them and everyone arriving was aware of that from the village behind her there came no sound at all and no light all the candles were long snuffed out fires banked windows covered over even the chinks at the base of doors blocked by cloth or rags the dead walked on the first of the ember nights everyone knew that there was little noise from within the house behind her though fifteen or twenty people must have arrived by now crowding into mattios home at the edge of the village elena didnt know how many more walkers were yet to join them here or later at the meetingplace she did know that there would be too few there hadnt been enough last year or the year before that and they had lost those battles very badly the ember night wars were killing the walkers faster than young ones like elena herself were growing up to replace them which is why they were losing each spring why they would almost certainly lose tonight it was a starry night with only the one moon risen the white crescent of vidomni as she waned it was cold as well here in the highlands at the very beginning of spring elena wrapped her arms about herself gripping her elbows with her hands it would be a different sky a different feel to the night entirely in only a few hours when the battle began carenna walked in giving her quick warm smile but not stopping to talk it was not a time for talking elena was worried about carenna tonight she had just had a child two weeks before it was too soon for her to be doing this but she was needed they were all needed and the ember night wars did not tarry for any man or woman or for anything that happened in the world of day she nodded in response to a couple she didnt know they followed carenna past her into the house there was dust on their clothing they had probably come from a long way east timing their arrival here for after the sundown closing of the doors and windows in the town and in all the lonely farmhouses out in the night of the fields behind all those doors and windows elena knew the people of the southern highlands would be waiting in darkness and praying praying for rain and then sun for the earth to be fruitful through spring and summer to the tall harvest of fall for the seedlings of grain of corn to nourish when sown take root and then rise yellow and full of ripened promise from the dark moist giving soil praying though they knew nothing within their wrapped dark homes of what would actually happen tonight for the night walkers to save the fields the season the grain save and succor all their lives elena instinctively reached up to finger the small leather ornament she wore about her neck the ornament that held the shriveled remnant of the caul in which she had been born as all the walkers had been sheathed in the transparent birthing sac as they came crying from the womb a symbol of good fortune birthwomen named the caul elsewhere in the palm children born sheathed in that sac were said to be destined for a life blessed by the triad here at the remote southern edges of the peninsula in these wild highlands beneath the mountains the teachings and the lore were different here the ancient rites went deeper further back were passed from hand to hand from mouth to mouth down from their beginnings long ago in the highlands of certando a child born with a caul was not said to be guarded from death at sea or naively named for fortune it was marked for war for this war fought each year on the first of the ember nights that began the spring and so began the year fought in the fields and for the fields for the not yet risen seedlings that were hope and life and the offered promise of earth renewed fought for those in the great cities cut off from the truths of the land ignorant of such things and fought for all the living here in certando huddled behind their walls who knew only enough to pray and to be afraid of sounds in the night that might be the dead abroad from behind elena a hand touched her shoulder she turned to see mattio looking quizzically at her she shook her head pushing her hair back with one hand nothing yet she said mattio did not speak but the pale moonlight showed his eyes bleak above the full black beard he squeezed her shoulder out of a habit of reassurance more than anything else before turning to go back inside elena watched him go heavystriding solid and capable through the open doorway she saw him sit down again at the long trestletable across from donar she gazed at the two of them for a moment thinking about verzar about love and then desire she turned away again to look out into the night toward the huge brooding outline of the castle in whose shadow she had spent her whole life she felt old suddenly far older than her years she had two small children sleeping with her mother and father tonight in one of those shutup cottages where no lights burned she also had a husband sleeping in the burying field a casualty one of so many of the terrible battle a year ago when the numbers of the others seemed to have grown so much larger than ever before and so cruelly malevolently triumphant verzar had died a few days after that defeat as all the victims of the night battles did those touched by death in the ember night wars did not fall in the fields they acknowledged that cold final touch in their souls like a finger on the heart verzar had said to her and they came home to sleep and wake and walk through a day or a week or a month before yielding to the ending that had claimed them for its own in the north in the cities they spoke of the last portal of morian of longedfor grace in her dark halls of priestly intercessions invoked with candles and tears those born with the caul in the southern highlands those who fought in the ember wars and saw the shapes of the others who came to battle there did not speak in such a way not that they would ever be so foolish as to deny morian of portals or eanna or adaon only that they knew that there were powers older and darker than the triad powers that went beyond this peninsula beyond even donar had once told her this very world with its two moons and its sun once a year the night walkers of certando would have would be forced to have a glimpse of these truths under a sky that was not their own elena shivered there would be more claimed for death tonight she knew and so fewer to fight the next year and fewer the next and where it would end she did not know she was not educated in such things she was twentytwo a mother and a widow and a wheelwrights daughter in the highlands she was also a child born with the caul of the night walkers into a time when all the battles were being lost year by year she was also known to have the best eyesight in the dark of all of them which is why mattio had placed her here by the door watching the road for the one donar had said might come it was a dry season the moat as hed expected was shallow once long ago the lords of castle borso had been pleased to keep their moat stocked with creatures that could kill a man baerd didnt expect to find such things not now not for a long time now he waded across hipdeep under the high stars and the thin light of vidomni in the sky it was cold but it had been many years since the elements bothered him much nor did it disturb him to be abroad on an ember night indeed it had become a ritual of his own over the years knowing that all across the palm the holy days were observed and marked by people waiting in silent darkness behind their walls offered him a deepened sense of the solitude his soul seemed to need he was profoundly drawn to this sense of moving through a scarcely breathing world that lay as if crouched in primitive darkness under the stars with no mortal fires cast back at the sky only whatever flames the triad created for themselves with lightning out of the heavens if there were ghosts and spirits awake in the night he wanted to see them if the dead of his past were walking abroad he wanted to beg their forgiveness his own pain was spun of images that would not let him go images of vanished serenity of pale marble under moonlight such as this of graceful porticos shaped of harmonies a man might spend a lifetime studying to understand of quiet voices heard and almost understood by a drowsy child in another room of sure confident laughter following then morning sunlight in a known courtyard and a steady strong sculptors hand upon his shoulder a fathers hand then fire and blood and ashes on the wind turning the noon sun red smoke and death and marble hammered into fragments the head of the god flying free to bounce like a boulder on scorched earth and then be ground remorselessly down into powder like fine sand like the sand on the beaches walked in the dark later that year infinite and meaningless by the cold uncaring sea these were the bleak visitants the companions of his nights these and more endlessly through almost nineteen years he carried like baggage like a cart yoked to his shoulders like a round stone in his heart images of his people their world destroyed their name obliterated truly obliterated a sound that was drifting year by year further away from the shores of the world of men like some tide withdrawing in the grey hour of a winter dawn very like such a tide but different as well because tides came back he had learned to live with the images because he had no choice unless it was a choice to surrender to die or retreat into madness as his mother had he defined himself by his griefs he knew them as other men knew the shape of their own hands but the one thing that could drive him awake barred utterly from the chambers of sleep or any kind of rest what could force him abroad now as he had been driven abroad as a boy in a ruined place was in the end none of these things neither a flash of splendor gone nor an image of death and loss it was instead over and above everything else the remembrance of love among those ashes of ruin against the memory of a spring and summer with dianora with his sister his barriers could not hold in the dark and so baerd would go out into the nights across the palm doubly moonlit or singly or dark with only stars among the heathered summer hills of ferraut or through the laden vineyards of autumn in astibar or senzio along snowmantled mountain slopes in tregea or here on an ember night at the beginning of spring in the highlands he would go out to walk in the enveloping dark to smell the earth feel the soil listen to the voice of winters wind taste grapes and moonlit water lie motionless in a forest tree to watch the night predators at their hunt and once in a great while when waylaid or challenged by brigand or mercenary baerd would kill a night predator in his own incarnation restless and soon gone another kind of ghost a part of him dead with the dead of the river deisa in every corner of the mainland palm except his own which was gone he had done these things for years upon years feeling the slow turning of the seasons learning the meaning of night in this forest and that field by this dark river or on that mountain ridge reaching out or back or inward all the time toward a release that was ever and again denied he had been here in the highlands many times before on this same ember night he and alessan went back a long way and had shared a great deal with alienor of borso and there was the other larger reason why they came south to the mountains at the beginning of every second year he thought of the news from the west from home he remembered the look on alessans face reading danoleons letter and his heart misgave him but that was for tomorrow and more alessans burden than his own however much he might want as he always wanted to ease or share the weight tonight was his own and it called to him alone in the darkness but hand in hand with a dream of dianora he walked away from the castle always before he had gone west and then south from borso curving his way into the hills themselves below the braccio pass tonight for no reason he knew his footsteps led him the other way southeast they carried him along the road to the edge of the village that lay beneath the castle walls and there as he passed a house with an unexpectedly open door baerd saw a fairhaired woman standing in the moonlight as if she had been waiting for him and he stopped sitting at the table resisting the temptation to count their numbers one more time trying to appear as if all were as normal as it could be on this night of war mattio heard elena call his name and then donars from outside the house her voice was soft as it always was but his senses were pitched toward her as they had been for years even before poor verzar had died he glanced across the table at donar but the older man was already reaching for his crutches and rising to swing on his one leg toward the door mattio followed a number of the others looked over at them edgy and apprehensive mattio forced himself to smile reassuringly carenna caught his eye and began speaking soothingly to a few of the more visibly nervous people not at all easy himself mattio stepped outside with donar and saw that someone had come a darkhaired man neatly bearded and of middle height stood motionless before elena glancing from her to the two of them not speaking he had a sword slung in a scabbard on his back in the tregean fashion mattio looked over at donar whose face was quite impassive for all his experience of ember night wars and of donars gift he could not repress a shiver someone may come their onelegged leader had said yesterday and now someone was indeed here in the moonlight in the very hour before battle mattio looked over at elena her eyes had not left the stranger she was standing very straight slender and motionless hands holding her elbows hiding fear and wonder as best she could but mattio had spent years watching her and he could see that her breathing was shallow and fast he loved her for her stillness and for wanting to hide her fear he glanced at donar again and then stepped forward extending two open palms to the stranger calmly he said be welcome though it is not to be abroad the other man nodded his feet were planted wide and solid on the earth he looked as though he knew how to use his sword he said nor as i understand the highlands is it a night to have doors and windows open why would you think you understand the highlands mattio said too quickly elena still had not looked away from this man there was an odd expression on her face moving a little nearer to stand beside her mattio realized that he had seen this man before this was one who had come several times to the ladys castle a musician he seemed to remember or a merchant of some sort one of those landless men who endlessly crossed and recrossed the roads of the palm his heart which had lifted to see the sword sank a little the stranger had not responded to his sharp retort he appeared as much as the moonight revealed to be giving the matter thought then he surprised mattio im sorry he said if i am trespassing upon a custom in ignorance forgive me i walk for reasons of my own i will leave you to your peace he actually turned away then clearly intending to leave no elena said urgently and in the same moment donar spoke for the first time there is no peace tonight he said in the deep voice they all trusted so much and you are not trespassing i thought someone might come along this road elena was watching for you and at that the stranger turned his eyes seemed wider in the dark and something new cooler more appraising gleamed in them now come for what he asked there was a silence donar shifted his crutches and swung forward elena moved to one side to let him stand in front of the stranger mattio looked across at her her hair was falling over one shoulder whitegold in the moonlight she never took her eyes from the darkhaired man who was gazing steadily at donar come for what he repeated mildly enough still donar hesitated and in that moment mattio realized with a shock that the miller their elder was afraid a sickening lurch of apprehension rose in mattio for he suddenly understood what donar was about to do and then donar did it he gave them away to one from the north we are the night walkers of certando he said his voice steady and deep and this is the first of the ember nights of spring this is our night i must ask you wherever you were born was there a mark did the birthwomen who attended declare a blessing found and slowly he reached a hand inside his shirt and drew forth the leather sac he wore there holding the caul that had marked him at his birth out of the side of his eye mattio saw elena biting her lower lip he looked at the stranger watched him absorb what donar had said and he began gauging his chances of killing the man if it should come to that this time the silence stretched the muted sounds from the house behind them seemed loud the darkhaired mans eyes had grown wide now and his head was lifted high mattio could see that he was weighing what lay behind what had just been revealed then still not speaking the stranger moved one hand to his throat and reaching inside his shirt he brought out so that the three of them could see by starlight and moonlight the small leather sac he too wore mattio heard a small sound a release of breath and realized belatedly that he had made it himself earth be praised elena murmured unable to stop herself she had closed her eyes earth and all that springs from it and returns donar added his voice amazingly trembled they left it for mattio to finish returns to spring forth again in the cycle that has no end he said looking at the stranger at the sac he bore almost identical to mattios own to elenas to donars to the one they all carried every one of them it was with the words of invocation spoken in sequence by the three of them that baerd finally understood what he had stumbled upon two hundred years ago in a time of seemingly unending plagues a time of harvest failures of violence and blood the carlozzini heresy had taken root here in the south and from the highlands it had begun to spread throughout the palm gaining momentum and adherents with frightening speed and against carlozzis central teaching that the triad were younger deities subject to and agents of an older darker set of powers the priesthood of the palm had grimly and in concert set their hands faced with such rare and absolute unity among the clergy and caught up in the panic of a decade of plague and starvation the dukes and grand dukes and even valcanti prince of tigana had seen themselves as having no choice the carlozzini had been hunted down and tried and executed all across the peninsula by whatever means executions were conducted in each province in that time a time of violence and blood two hundred years ago and now he was standing here showing the leather that held the caul of his birth and speaking to three who had just declared themselves to be carlozzini and more night walkers the onelegged old man had said the vanguard the secret army of the sect chosen in some way that no one knew but now he did know they had shown him it occurred to him that he might be in danger now having been granted this knowledge and indeed the bigger bearded man seemed to be holding himself carefully as if prepared for violence the woman who had stood watch was weeping though she was very beautiful though not in the way of alienor whose every movement every spoken word might hint at a feline undercurrent of danger this woman was too young too shy he could not make himself believe in a threat from her not weeping as she was and all three of them had spoken words of thanks of praise his instincts were on guard but not in a way that warned of immediate danger deliberately baerd forced his muscles to relax he said what have you to tell me then elena wiped the tears from her face she looked at the stranger again absorbing his square neat quiet solidity his reality the improbable fact that he was here she swallowed with difficulty painfully aware of the racing of her heart trying to move past the moment when she had seen this man emerge from night and shadow to stand before her and then the long interval when they had faced each other in the moonlight before she had impulsively reached out to touch his hand to be sure that he was real and had only then called for mattio and donar something odd seemed to be happening to her she made herself concentrate on what donar was saying what i tell you now gives you power of life and death over a great many people he said softly for the priesthood still want us destroyed and the tyrant in astibar will bide by what the clergy say in such things i think you know this i know this the darkhaired one echoed equally quietly will you say why you are confiding in me because tonight is a night of battle donar said tonight i lead the night walkers into war and yesterday at sunset i fell into a sleep and dreamt of a stranger coming to us i have learned to trust my dreams though not to know when they will come elena saw the stranger nod calm unruffled acknowledging this as easily as he had acknowledged her presence in the road she saw that his arms were ridged with muscle under his shirt and that he held himself as a man who had known fighting in his days there seemed to be a sadness in his face but it was really too dark to tell so much and she chided herself for letting her imagination run free at such a time on the other hand he was abroad and alone on an ember night men without griefs of their own would never do such a thing she was certain she wondered where he was from she was afraid to ask you are the leader then of this company he said to donar he is mattio cut in sharply and you would do well not to dwell upon his infirmity from the defiance of his tone it was clear he had misinterpreted the question elena knew how protective he was of donar it was one of the things she most respected in him but this was too huge too important a moment for misunderstandings she turned to him and shook her head urgently mattio she began but donar had already laid a hand on the blacksmiths arm and in that moment the stranger smiled for the first time you leap at a slight that is not meant he said i have known others as badly injured or worse who led armies and governed men i seek only to find my bearings it is darker here for me than it is for you mattio opened his mouth and then closed it he made a small awkward gesture of apology with his shoulders and hands it was donar who replied i am elder of the walkers yes he said and so mine with mattios aid is leadership in battle but you must know that the war we are to fight tonight is not like any battle you might know when we come out again from this house it will be under a different sky entirely than the one above us now and under that sky in that challenging world of ghosts and shadows few of us will appear as we do here the darkhaired man shifted uneasily for the first time he glanced downward almost reluctantly to look at donars hands donar smiled and held out his left hand five fingers spread wide i am not a wizard he said softly there is magic here yes but we step into it and are marked for it we do not shape it this is not wizardry the stranger nodded at length then said with careful courtesy i can see that i do not understand it but i can only assume you are telling me these things to a purpose will it please you now to tell me what that is and so donar said then finally because we would ask aid of you in our battle tonight in the silence that followed mattio spoke and elena had an idea how much pride he swallowed in saying we have need very great need who do you fight the other man said we call them the others elena said herself as neither donar nor mattio spoke they come to us year by year generation after generation they come to ruin the fields and blight the seedlings and the harvest donar said for two hundred years the night walkers of certando would battle them on this ember night and for all this time we were able to hold them in check as they come upon us from the west mattio said for almost twenty years now though it has grown worse and worse for us and on the last three ember nights we have been very badly beaten many of us have died and certandos droughts have grown worse you will know about that and about the plagues here they have but the stranger had flung up a hand suddenly a sharp unexpected gesture almost twenty years and from the west he said harshly he came a step nearer and turned to donar the tyrants came almost twenty years ago and brandin of ygrath landed in the west donars gaze was steady as he leaned on his crutches looking at the other man this is true he said and it is a thought that has occurred to some of us but i do not think it signifies our battles on this night each year go far beyond the daily concerns of who governs in the palm in a given generation and how they govern and from where they come but still the stranger began but still donar said nodding his head there are mysteries to this that are beyond my power to grasp if you discern a pattern that i do not who am i to question or deny that it might be true he reached up to his neck and touched the leather sac you carry the mark we all bear and i dreamt your presence here tonight notwithstanding that we have no claim upon you none at all and i must tell you that death will be there to meet us in the fields when the others come but i can also tell you that our need goes beyond these fields beyond certando and even i think beyond this peninsula of the palm will you fight with us tonight the stranger was silent a long time he turned away and looked upwards then at the thin moon and stars but elena had a sense that his truer vision was inwards that he was not really looking up at the lights please she heard herself say will you please he made no sign that he had even heard her when he turned back it was to look at donar once more he said i understand little of this i have my own battles to fight and people to whom i owe a sworn allegiance but i hear no evil in you and no untruth and i would see for myself the shape these others take if you dreamt my coming here i will let myself be guided by your dream and then as her eyes began brimming with tears again elena saw him turn to her yes i will he said levelly not smiling his dark eyes grave i will fight with you tonight my name is baerd and so it seemed that he had heard her after all elena mastered her tears standing as straight as she could there was a tumult a terrible chaos rising within her though and in the midst of that chaos it seemed to elena that she heard a sound as of a single note plucked on her heart beyond donar mattio said something but she didnt hear what it was she was looking at this stranger and realizing as his gaze met her own that she had been right before that her instincts had not misled there was so deep a sadness in him it could not possibly be missed by any man or woman with eyes to see even in night and shadow she looked away and then closed her eyes tightly for a moment trying to hold back something of her heart for herself before it all went seeking in the magic and the strangeness of this night oh verzar she thought oh my dead love she opened her eyes again and took a careful breath i am elena she said will you come in and meet the others yes said mattio gruffly come in with us baerd be welcome in my home this time she heard the hurt that came through in his voice though he tried to mask it she winced inwardly at that sound caring for him for his strength and his generosity hating so much to give sorrow but this was an ember night and the tides of the heart could scarcely be ruled even by the light of day besides she had a very grave doubt already as the four of them turned to go into the house whether there would be any joy for her to find in what had just happened to her any joy in this stranger who had come to her out of darkness in answer to or called by donars dream baerd looked at the cup that the woman named carenna had just placed in his hands it was of earthenware rough to the touch chipped at one edge the unpainted color of red soil he looked from carenna to donar the older maimed man the elder they called him to the bearded one to the other girl elena there was a kind of light in her face as she looked back at him even in the shadows of this house and he turned away from that as something perhaps the one thing he could not deal with not now perhaps not ever in his life he cast his gaze out over the company assembled there seventeen of them nine men eight women all holding their own cups waiting for him there would be more at the meetingplace mattio had said how many more they could not tell he was being reckless he knew swept away by the power of an ember night by the undeniable truth of donars dream the fact that they had been waiting for him by if he were honest with himself the look in elenas eyes when he had first come up to her a complex tempting of fate that aspect of it something he seldom did but he was doing it now or about to do it he thought of alessan and of all the times hed chided or derided the prince his brother of the soul for letting his passion for music take him down one dangerous path or another what would alessan say now or quicktongued catriana or devin no devin would say nothing he would watch with that careful focused attention and come to his own conclusions in his own time sandre would call him a fool and perhaps he was but something had responded deep within him to the words donar had spoken he had borne the caul of his birth in leather all his life a minor a trivial superstition a charm against drowning he had been told as a child but it was more here and the cup he held in his hands would mark his acceptance of that almost twenty years mattio had said the others from the west donar had said there might be little in it or a great deal or nothing at all or everything he looked at the woman elena and he drained the cup to the lees it was bitter deathly bitter for one panicked irrational moment he feared he was undone poisoned a blood sacrifice in some unknown carlozzini rite of spring then he saw the sour face carenna made as she drank from her own cup and saw mattio wince ruefully at the taste of his and the panic passed the long table had been put away lifted from its trestles pallets had been spread about the room for them to lie upon elena moved towards him and gestured and it would have been ungracious to hold back he walked with her toward one wall and took the pallet she offered him she sat down unspeaking on the one beside it baerd thought of his sister of that clear image of walking hand in hand with dianora down a dark and silent road only the two of them abroad in the wide world donar the miller swung himself towards the pallet on baerds other side he leaned his crutches against the wall and subsided on the mat leave your sword here he said baerd raised his eyebrows donar smiled a hieratic expression devoid of mirth it will be useless where we are going we will find our weapons in the fields baerd hesitated a moment longer then aware of even greater recklessness of a mystic folly he could not have explained he slipped the backscabbard over his head and laid it against the wall beside donars crutches close your eyes he heard elena saying from beside him it is easier that way her voice sounded oddly distant whatever he had drunk was beginning to act upon him it will feel like sleep she said but it will not be earth grant us grace and the sky her light it was the last thing he heard it was not sleep whatever it was it was not sleep for no dream could be this vivid no dreamwind this keen in his face he was in an open field wide and fallow and dark with the smell of spring soil and he had no memory at all of coming here there were a great many people two hundred perhaps or more in the field with him and he had no memory of any of them either they must have come from other villages in the highlands from gatherings in other homes like mattios the light was strange he looked up and baerd saw that the moon in the sky was round and large and full and it was green like the first greengold of spring it shone with that green and golden light among stars in constellations he had never seen he wheeled around dizzied disoriented his heart pounding searching for a pattern that he knew in the heavens he looked south to where the mountains should be but as far as his eyes could track in the green light he saw level fields stretching away some fallow some fully ripe with summer grain in a season that should only be spring no mountains at all no snowclad peaks no braccio pass with quileia beyond he spun again no castle borso to north or east or west west with a sudden premonition he turned to look there low hills rose and fell in seemingly endless progression and baerd saw that the hills were bare of trees of grass bare of flower and shrub and bush bleak and waste and barren yes look there donars deep voice said from behind him and understand why we are here if we lose tonight the field in which we stand will be desolate as those hills next year when we come back the others are down into these grainlands now we have lost the battles of those hills over the past years we are fighting in the plain now and if this goes on one ember night not far from now our children or their children will stand with their backs to the sea and lose the last battle of our war and baerds eyes were still on the west on the grey stony ruin of the hills and all the crops will fail not just here in certando and people will die of hunger or of plague all over the palm he could not look away from the desolation that he saw he had a vision of a lifeless world looking like that he shivered it was sickening the palm and beyond baerd make no mistake this is no local skirmish no battle for a small peninsula all over this world and perhaps beyond for it is said that ours is not the only world scattered by the powers among time and the stars carlozzi taught this carlozzi taught this if i understand his teaching rightly our own troubles here are bound up with even graver dangers elsewhere in worlds we have never seen or will see except perhaps in dream baerd shook his head still looking out at the hills in the west that is too remote for me too difficult i am a worker in stone and a sometime merchant and i have learned how to fight against my will and inclination over many years i live in a peninsula overrun by enemies from overseas that is the level of evil i can grasp he turned away from the western hills then and looked at donar and despite the warning theyd given him his eyes widened with amazement the miller stood on two sound legs his grey thinning hair had become a thick dark brown like baerds own and he stood with his broad shoulders straight and his head held high a man in his prime a woman came up to them and baerd knew elena for she was not greatly changed she seemed older here though less frail her hair was shorter though still whitegold despite the strangeness of the light her eyes he saw were a very deep blue were your eyes that same color an hour ago he asked she smiled pleased and shy it was more than an hour and i dont know what i look like this year it changes a little for me every time what color are they now blue extremely blue well then yes they have always been blue perhaps not extremely blue but blue her smile deepened shall i tell you what you look like there was an incongruity a lightness in her voice even donar had an amused expression playing about his lips tell me you look like a boy she said with a little laugh a fourteenor fifteenyearold boy beardless now and much too thin and with a shock of brown hair i would love to cut if we had but half a chance baerd felt his heart thud like a mallet in his breast it actually seemed to stop for an instant before beginning again laboriously to beat he turned sharply away from the others looking down at his hands they did seem different smoother less lined and a knife scar hed got in tregea five years ago was not there he closed his eyes feeling suddenly weak baerd elena said behind him concerned im sorry i did not mean to he shook his head he tried to speak but found that he could not he wanted to reassure her her and donar that it was all right but he seemed unbelievably to be weeping for the first time in almost twenty years for the first time since the year he had been a fourteenyearold boy forbidden to go to war by his princes orders and his fathers forbidden to fight and die with them by the red banks of the river deisa when all the shining had come to an end be easy baerd he heard donar saying deep and gentle be easy there is always a strangeness here then a womans hands were briefly upon his shoulders and then reaching around him from behind to meet and clasp at his chest her cheek rested against his back and she held him so strong and sharing and generous while he brought his hands up to cover his face as he cried above them on the ember night the full moon was greengold and around them the strange fields were fallow or newly sown or full with ripened grain before the plantingtime or utterly bare and desolate and lost in the west they are coming someone said walking up to them look we had best claim our weapons he recognized mattios voice elena released him and stepped back baerd wiped his eyes and looked to the west again and he saw then that the ember war was giving him another chance a chance to make right what had gone so bitterly wrong in the world the summer he was fourteen over the hills from the west far off yet but unnaturally clear in the unnatural light the others were coming and they were clad all of them in the livery of ygrath oh morian he whispered on a sharply taken breath what do you see mattio said baerd turned the man was leaner and his black beard was differently trimmed but he was recognizably the same ygrathens he said on a rising note of excitement soldiers of the king of ygrath you may never have seen them here this far east but that is exactly what they are your others mattio looked suddenly thoughtful he shook his head but it was donar who spoke be not deceived baerd remember where we are what i have told you you are not in our peninsula this is no battle of the day against your invaders from overseas i see them donar i know what i see and shall i tell you that what i see out there are hideous shapes in grey and dun naked and hairless dancing and coupling with each other as they mock us with their numbers and the others for me are different again mattio said bluntly almost angrily they are large larger than men with fur on their spines running down into a tail like the mountain cats they walk upon two legs but they have claws on their hands and razored teeth in their mouths baerd wheeled again his heart hammering looking west in the eerily lucid green light of wherever they were but still in the middle distance pouring down out of the hills he saw soldiers with weapons swords and pikes and the undulating knives of ygrath he turned to elena a little desperate i do not like to name what i see she murmured lowering her eyes they frighten me too much they are creatures of my childhood fears but it is not what you are seeing baerd believe me believe us you may see the others in the shape of your hearts hate but this is not the battle of your daytime world he shook his head in fierce denial there was a deep surging in his spirit a rushing of blood in his veins the others were nearer now hundreds of them streaming out of the hills i am always fighting the same battle he said to her to her and the two men all my life wherever i am and i know what i see out there i can tell you that i am fifteen years old now not fourteen or i could not be here they would not have allowed me a thought struck him tell me is there a stream west of us a river below where they are descending now there is donar said do you want to join battle there a red fierce joy was running through baerd wild and uncontrollable i do he said oh i do mattio where do we claim our weapons there mattio pointed southeast to a small nearby field where tall stalks of corn were growing in defiance of what should have been the season come they will be at your stream very soon baerd did not speak he followed mattios lead elena and donar went with them other men and women were in that field of corn already and baerd saw that they were reaching down to pluck a stalk to be their weapon in the night it was uncanny incredible but he was beginning to take a part of the measure of this place to understand the magic that was at work here and a corner of his mind which worked outside and around the stern logic of day grasped that the tall yellow grain that was so endangered was the only weapon possible tonight they would fight for the fields with grain in their hands he stepped in among the others in that cornfield careful of where he walked and he bent down and grasped a stalk for himself it came free easily even willingly to his hand in that green night he walked out on to fallow ground again and hefted it in his hand and swung it cautiously and he saw that already the stalk had stiffened like metal forged it sliced through the air with a keen whistling sound he tested it with a finger and drew blood the stalk had grown as sharp as any blade hed ever held and as true to his hand and it was manyedged like the fabled blades of quileia centuries ago he looked away to the west the ygrathens were descending the nearest of the hills he could see the glint of their weapons under the moon this is not a dream he told himself not a dream donar was beside him grim and unwavering mattio stood beyond a passionate defiance in his face men and women were gathering behind them and all around and all of them held corn swords in their hands and all of them looked the same stern and resolute and unafraid shall we go donar said then turning to look out upon them all shall we go and fight them for the fields and for our people will you come with me now to the ember war for the fields the night walkers cried and raised their living swords aloft to the sky what baerd di tigana bar saevar cried he cried only in his heart and not aloud but he went forward with all of them a stalk of corn like a long blade in his hand to do battle under the pale green moon of that enchanted place when the others fell scaly and grey blind and crawling with maggots there was never any blood elena understood why that was so donar had told her years ago blood meant life and their foes tonight were the enemies the opposite of any kind of life when they fell to the corn swords nothing flowed from them nothing seeped away into the earth there were so many of them there always were swirling in a grey mass like slugs pouring down out of the hills and swarming into the stream where donar and mattio and baerd had come to make their stand elena prepared herself to fight amid the loud whirling greentinted chaos of the night she was frightened but she knew she could deal with that she remembered how deathly afraid shed been in her first ember war wondering how she she who could scarcely have even lifted a sword in the daytime world could possibly battle such hideous creatures as the nightmare ones she saw but donar and verzar had assuaged her fears here in this green night of magic it was the soul and the spirit that mattered here it was courage and desire that shaped and drove the bodies in which they found themselves elena felt so much stronger on the ember nights so much more lithe and quick that had frightened her too the first time and even afterward under this green moon she was someone who could kill it was a realization she had to deal with an adjustment to be made they all did to one degree or another none of them were exactly what they were under the sun or the two moons of home donars body on this night of war reached backwards further every year toward a lost image of what he once had been just as baerds very clearly reached back as well more than one might have guessed or expected fifteen he had said not fourteen or he would not have been allowed she didnt understand that but she had no time to puzzle such things out not now the others were in the stream and now they were trying to clamber out clad in the hideous shapes her mind gave them she dodged a scything axeblow from a creature dripping with water as it scrambled up the bank towards her and as she did she gritted her teeth and slashed downward with an instinctive deadliness she would have never known was hers she felt her blade her living sword crunch hard through scaly armor and bury itself in the maggotinfested body of her foe she pulled the weapon free with an effort hating what she had done but hating the others more infinitely more she turned barely in time to block another ascending blow and withdraw a step before two new gapejawed assailants on her right she lifted her blade in a desperate attempt to ward then suddenly only one of the others was standing there then neither of them she lowered her sword and looked at baerd at her stranger on the road her promise given by the night he smiled grimly at her tightlipped standing over the bodies of the others he had just killed he smiled and he had saved her life but he said nothing to her at all he turned and went forward to the edge of the river she watched him go saw his boys body stride into the thickness of battle and she wasnt sure whether to give way to a rush of hope because of his deadly skill or to grieve for the look in his too young eyes again no time for such thoughts the river seethed and boiled now with the churning of the others as they waded into it screams of pain cries of rage and fury cut the green night like blades of sound she saw donar along the bank to the south swinging his sword twohanded in wheeling circles of denial saw mattio beside him slashing and stabbing neatfooted among the fallen bodies absolute in his courage all about her the night walkers of certando plunged into the caldron of their war she saw a woman fall then another swarmed over and hacked down by the creatures from the west she cried out herself then in fury and revulsion and she moved back up to the edge of the river running to where carenna was her sword swinging forward her blood her blood which was life and the promise of life raging with the need to drive them back back now tonight and then again a year from now and after that and again and again on each of these ember nights that the spring sowing might be fruitful that the earth be allowed to bear its bounty in the fall this year and the next year and the next in the midst of that chaos of noise and motion elena glanced up she checked the height of the stillclimbing moon and then she could not stop herself she looked to the nearest of the devastated hills beyond the stream apprehension clutching at her heart there was no one there not yet there would be though she was almost certain there would be and then she pulled herself back from that what would happen would happen around her there was war here and now and more than enough terror in the others massed before her surging up out of the river on either side she tore her thoughts from the hill and struck downwards hard feeling her blade bite into a scabrous shoulder she heard the other make a wet bubbly sound she jerked her sword free and spun left barely in time to block a sideways blow scrambling to keep her footing carennas free hand braced her from behind she didnt even have time to look but she knew who it was it was wild under the unknown stars under the green light of that moon it was frenzy and chaos there was screaming and shouting everywhere now and the riverbank was muddy slippery and treacherous elenas others were wet and grey dark with their parasites and open sores she clenched her teeth and fought letting this ember night bodys grace be guided by her soul the stalk that was her sword dancing with a life that seemed to come from within itself as much as it did from her she was splashed with mud and water and she was sure there must be blood but there was no time to check no time now to do anything at all but parry and hammer and slash and fight to keep ones footing on the slope of the riverbank for to fall would be to die she was aware in scattered hallucinatory flashes of donar beside her and carenna for a time then she saw him stride away with a handful of others to quell a movement to the south baerd came up on her left at one point guarding her open side but when she glanced over again and now the moon was very high she saw he was gone then she saw where he was in the river not waiting for the others to come to him he was attacking them in the water screaming incoherent words she could not understand he was slim and young and very beautiful and deadly she saw bodies of the others piling before his feet like grey sludge blocking the stream he would be seeing them differently she knew he had told them what he saw he would be seeing soldiers of ygrath of brandin the tyrant in the west his blade seemed almost to vanish in a blur it moved so fast kneedeep in the stream he stood rooted like a tree and they could not force him back or survive in front of him the others were falling back from him there scrambling to withdraw trying to work their way around their own dead to get further down the stream he was driving them away battling alone in the water the moonlight strange on his face and strange on the living stalk that was his sword and he was a fifteenyearold boy only that elenas heart ached for him even as she fought an overwhelming weariness she willed herself to hold her own ground north of where he was up on the muddy bank carenna was further south along the river now fighting beside donar two men and a woman from another village came up beside elena and together the four of them fought for their stretch of slippery ground trying to move in concert to be of one mind they were not fighters not trained for battle they were farmers and farmers wives millers and blacksmiths and weavers masons and servinggirls goatherds in the hills of the braccio range but each and every one of them had been born with a caul in the highlands and named in childhood for carlozzis teachings and for the ember war and under the green moon which had passed its apex and would be setting now the passion of their souls taught their hands to speak for life with the blades the tall grain had become so the night walkers of certando did battle by that river fighting for the deepest oldest dream of the widespreading country fields beyond all the high city walls a dream of earth of the lifegiving soil rich and moist and flourishing in its cycle of seasons and years a dream of the others driven back and farther back and finally away one bright year none of them would live to see and there came a time amid the tumult and the frenzy the loud blurred spinning violence by the river when elena and her three companions forged a respite for themselves she had a moment to look up and she saw that the stream was thinning of foes that the others were milling about disorganized and confused west of the river she saw baerd splash further into the water hipdeep now crying for the enemy to come to him cursing them in a voice so tormented it was scarcely knowable as his own elena could barely stand she leaned on her sword sucking in air with heaving sobs utterly spent she looked over and saw that one of the men who had fought beside her was down on one knee clutching his right shoulder he bled from an ugly ragged wound she knelt beside him tearing weakly at her clothing for a strip to bind it with he stopped her though he stopped her and touched her shoulder and mutely he pointed across the stream she looked where he pointed away to the west fear rising in her again and hi that moment of seeming victory elena saw that the crown of the nearest hill was not empty anymore that there was something standing there look a man cried just then from further down the river he is with them again we are undone other voices took up that cry along the riverbank in grief and horror and cold fear for they saw they all saw now that the shadow figure had come within the darkest spaces of her heart elena had known that he would just as he almost always had these last years fifteen years twenty though never before that donar had said when the moon began to set green and full just when so much of the time it seemed as if they might have a chance to force the others back that dark figure would appear to stand wrapped in fog and mist as hi a shroud at the back of the enemy ranks and it was this figure the walkers would see come forward in the years of their defeats when they were retreating having been driven back it was he who would step onto the bitterly contested places of battle the lost fields and claim them for his own and blight and disease and desolation spread where he passed wherever he walked upon the earth he stood now on the nearest of the wasted hills west of the river clouds of obscuring mist rising and flowing all around him elena could not discern his face none of them ever had but from within that smoke and darkness she saw him raise his hands and stretch them out toward them reaching reaching for the walkers on the riverbank and as he did elena felt a sudden shaft of coldness come into her heart a terrible numbing chill her legs began to tremble she saw that her hands were shaking and it seemed that there was nothing she could do nothing at all to hold her courage to her across the stream the others his army or his allies or the amorphous projections of his spirit saw him stretch his arms toward the battlefield elena heard a sudden savage exultation in their cries she saw them massing west of the river to come at them again and she remembered weary and spent with a grim despair reaching into her heart that this was exactly how it had been last year and the spring before that and the spring before as well her spirit ached with the knowledge of loss to come even as she fought to find a way to ready her exhausted body to face another charge mattio was beside her no she heard him gasp with a dull hopeless insistence blindly fighting the power of that figure on the hill not this time not let them kill me not retreat again he could scarcely speak and he was bleeding she saw there was a gash in his right side another along his leg when he straightened to move to the river she saw that he was limping he was doing it though he was moving forward even into the face of what was being leveled at them elena felt a sob escape her dry throat and now the others were coming again the wounded man beside her struggled gamely up from his knees holding his sword in his left hand his useless right arm dangling at his side further along the bank she saw men and women as badly wounded or worse they were all standing though and lifting their blades with love with a shafting of pride that was akin to pain elena saw that the night walkers were not retreating none of them they were ready to hold this ground or to try and some of them were going to die now she knew many of them would die then donar was beside her and elena flinched at what she saw in his white face no he said this is folly we must fall back we have no choice if we lose too many tonight it will be even worse next spring i have to play for time to hope for something that will make a change the words sounded as if they were scraped from his throat elena felt herself beginning to cry from exhaustion as much as anything else and even as she was nodding from within the abyss of her weariness trying to let donar see her understanding her support wanting to ease the rawness of his pain even as the others drew near again triumphant hideous unwearied she abruptly realized that baerd wasnt with them on the bank she wheeled toward the river looking for him and so she saw the miracle begin he was never in any doubt none at all from the moment the mistwrapped figure appeared on the black hill baerd knew what it was in an odd way he had known this even before the shadowfigure came it was why he was here baerd realized donar might not know it but this was why the elder had had a dream of someone coming why baerds steps that night had taken him to the place where elena was watching in the dark it seemed to have been a long time ago he couldnt see the figure clearly but that didnt matter it really didnt he knew what this was about it was as if all the sorrows and the lessons and the labors of his life his and alessans together had brought him to this river under this green moon that someone here might know exactly what the figure on the black hill was the nature of its power the power the night walkers had not been able to withstand because they could not understand he heard a splash behind him and knew instinctively that it would be mattio without turning he handed him his strange sword the others the ygrathens of his dreams and hate were massing again on the western bank he ignored them they were tools right now they did not matter at all they had been beaten by the courage of donar and the walkers only the shadowfigure signified now and baerd knew what was needed to deal with that not a prowess of blades not even with these swords of grain they were past that now he drew a deep breath and he raised his hands from his sides and pointed up at that shrouded figure on the hill exactly as the figure was pointing down at them and with his heart full to overflowing with old grief and a young certainty conscious that alessan would say it better but knowing that this had become his task and knowing also what had to be done baerd cried aloud in the strangeness of that night be gone we do not fear you i know what you are and where your power lies be gone or i shall name you now and cut your strength apart we both know the power of names tonight gradually the raucous cries subsided on the other side of the river and the murmurs of the walkers faded it grew very still deathly still baerd could hear mattios labored painful breathing just behind him he didnt look back he waited straining to penetrate the mist that wrapped the figure on the hill and as he stared it seemed to him with a surge in his heart that the upraised arms were lowered slightly that the concealing mist dissipated a very little he waited no longer be gone he cried again more loudly yet a ringing sureness in his voice now i have said i know you and i do you are the spirit of the violators here the presence of ygrath in this peninsula and of barbadior both of them you are tyranny in a land that has been free you are the blight and the ruin in these fields you have used your magic in the west to shape a desecration to obliterate a name yours is a power of darkness and shadow under this moon but i know you and can name you and so all your shadows are gone he looked and even as he was speaking the words that came to him he saw that they were true it was happening he could see the mist drifting apart as if taken by a wind but even in the midst of joy something checked him a knowledge that the victory was only here only in this unreal place his heart was full and empty at one and the same time he thought of his father dying by the deisa of his mother of dianora and baerds hands went flat and rigid at his sides even as he heard the murmurs of disbelieving hope rising at his back mattio whispered something in a choked voice baerd knew it would be a prayer the others were milling about in disarray west of the stream even as baerd watched motionless his hands held outwards his heart in turmoil more of the shadows cloaking their leader lifted and spread beginning to blow away over the brow of the hill for one moment baerd thought he saw the figure clearly he thought he saw it bearded and slim and of medium height and he knew which of the tyrants that one would be which one had come from the west and something rose within him at that sight crashing through to the surface like a wave breaking against his soul my sword he rasped quickly he reached back mattio placed it in his hand in front of them the others were starting to fall back slowly at first then faster and suddenly they were running but that didnt even matter that didnt matter at all baerd looked up at the figure on the hill he saw the last of the shadows blowing away and he lifted his voice once more crying aloud the passion of his soul stay for me if you are ygrath if you are truly the sorcerer of ygrath i want you now stay for me i am coming in the name of my home and of my father i am coming for you now i am baerd di tigana bar saevar wildly still screaming his challenge he splashed forward and clambered out of the stream scrambling up the other bank the ruined earth felt cold as ice through his wet boots he realized that he had entered a terrain that had no real place for life but tonight now with that figure before him on the hill that didnt matter either it didnt matter if he died the army of the others was in flight they were throwing down their weapons as they ran there was no one to gainsay him he glanced up again the moon seemed to be setting unnaturally fast it looked as if it was resting now round and huge on the very crown of the black hill baerd saw the figure standing there silhouetted against that green moon the shadows were gone almost he saw it clearly again across the dead lands between then he heard a long laugh of mockery as if in response to his crying of his name it was the laughter of his dreams the laughter of the soldiers in the year of the fall still laughing not hurrying at all the shadowfigure turned and stepped down from the crown of the hill and away to the west baerd began to run baerd wait he heard the woman carenna cry from behind him you must not be on the wastelands when the moon goes down come back we have won they had won but he had not whatever the walkers of the highlands might think or say his battle his and alessans was no nearer resolution than it had been before tonight whatever he had done for the night walkers of certando this nights victory was not his it could not be he knew that in his heart and his enemy the image of his souls hate knew that as well as he and was laughing at him even now just out of sight beyond the brow of that low hill stay for me baerd screamed again his young lost voice ripping through the night he ran flashing over the dead earth his heart bursting with the need for speed he overtook stragglers among the army and he killed them as he ran not even breaking stride it hardly mattered it was only for the walkers in their war for next year the others scattered north and south away from him from the line that led to the hill baerd reached the slope and went straight up scrabbling for a foothold on the cold waste ground then he breasted the hill with a surge and a gasp and he stood upon the summit exactly where the shadowfigure had stood and he looked away to the west toward all the empty valleys and ruined hills beyond and saw nothing there was no one there at all he turned quickly north and then south his chest heaving and saw that the army of the others too seemed to have entirely melted away he spun back to the west and then he understood the green moon had set he was alone in this wasteland under a clear high dome of brilliant alien stars and tigana was no nearer to coming back than it had ever been and his father was still dead and would never come back to him and his mother and sister were dead or lost somewhere in the world baerd sank to his knees on the ruined hill the ground was cold as winter it was colder his sword slipped from his suddenly nerveless fingers he looked at his hands by starlight at the slim hands of the boy he had been and then he covered his face with those hands for the second time in that ember night and he wept as though his heart were breaking now and not broken long ago elena reached the hill and began to climb she was breathless from running but the slope was not steep mattio had grabbed her arm when she started to enter the river he had said it might mean death to be among the ruined lands after moonset but donar had told her it would be all right now donar had been unable to stop smiling since baerd had made the shadowfigure withdraw there was a stunned incredulous glory in his face most of the walkers had gone back wounded and weary intoxicated with triumph to the field where they had claimed their weapons from there they would be drawn home before sunrise so it had always happened carefully avoiding mattios eyes elena had crossed the river and come after baerd behind her as she went she could hear the singing begin she knew what would follow in the sheltering hollows and the darkness of that field after an ember victory elena felt her pulse accelerate with the very thought she could guess what mattios face would have revealed as she walked away from him into the river and then across in her heart she offered him an apology but her stride as she went did not falter and then halfway to the hill she began to run suddenly afraid for the man she sought and for herself alone in all this wide dark emptiness baerd was sitting on the crown of the hill where the shadowfigure had stood in front of the setting moon just before he fled he glanced up as she approached and a queer frightened expression flickered for an instant across his face in the starlit dark elena stopped uncertain it is only me she said trying to catch her breath he was silent a moment im sorry he said i wasnt expecting anyone for a moment for a moment you looked almost exactly like a like something i saw once as a boy something that changed my life elena didnt know what to say to that she had thought no further than getting here now that she had found him she was suddenly unsure of herself again she sat down on the dead earth facing him he watched her but said nothing else she took a deep breath and said bravely you should have expected someone you should have known that i would come she swallowed hard her heart pounding for a long moment baerd was very still his head tilted a little to one side as if listening to the echo of her words then he smiled it lit up his young too thin face and the hollow wounded eyes thank you he said thank you for that elena it was the first time hed used her name in the distance they could hear the singing from the cornfield overhead the stars were almost impossibly bright in the black arch of the sky elena felt herself flushing she glanced down and away from his direct gaze she said awkwardly after all it is dangerous here in the dead lands and you wouldnt have known not having been here before with us i mean you wouldnt even know how to get back home i have an idea he said gravely i imagine we have until sunrise and in any case these arent the dead lands anymore we won them back tonight elena look at the ground where you walked she turned to look back and caught her breath in wonder and delight to see that along the path shed taken to this hill white flowers were blooming in what had been barren earth even as she watched she saw that the flowers were spreading in all directions from where she had passed tears sprang to her eyes and spilled over gliding unheeded down her cheeks making her vision blur she had seen enough though she understood this was the earths response to what they had done tonight those delicate white flowers coming to life under the stars were the most beautiful things she had seen in all her days quietly baerd said you have caused this elena your being here you must teach donar and carenna and the others this when you win the ember war it is not only a matter of holding the line of battle you must follow the others and drive them back elena it is possible to regain lands lost in battle years before she was nodding hearing in his words an echo of something known and forgotten long ago she spoke the memory the land is never truly dead it can always come back or what is the meaning of the cycle of seasons and years she wiped her tears away and looked at him his expression in the darkness was much too sad for a moment such as this she wished she knew a way to dispel that sorrow and not only for tonight he said that is mostly true i suppose or true for the largest things smaller things can die people dreams a home impulsively elena reached forward and took his hand it was fine and slender and it lay in hers quietly but without response in the distance east of the river the night walkers were singing songs to celebrate and welcome the spring to cry the blessing of the season on the crops that summer would see elena wished with all her heart that she were wiser that she might have an answer to what lay so deeply and hurtfully inside this man she said if we die that is part of the cycle we come back in another form but that was donars thought his way of speaking not her own baerd was silent she looked at him but she could find nothing within her to say that wouldnt sound wrong or be someone elses words so instead thinking it might somehow help him to speak she asked you said you knew the shadowfigure how baerd can you tell me it was a strange almost an illicit pleasure to speak his name he smiled at her then gently he had a gentle face especially young as it was now donar had all the clues himself and mattio all of you you had been losing for twenty years or so they told me donar said i was too much tied to the transitory battles of day do you remember elena nodded he wasnt wholly wrong baerd went on i saw ygrathen soldiers here and they were not truly so of course i understand that now dearly as i might have wished them to be but i wasnt wholly wrong either for the first time his hand put an answering pressure on her own elena evil feeds on itself and the evils of day however transitory must add to the power of what you face here on the ember nights they must elena it cannot but be so everything connects we cannot afford to look only at our own goals that is the lesson the dearest friend of my life has taught me the tyrants in our peninsula have shaped a wrong that goes deeper than who governs in a given year and that evil has spilled over into this battlefield where you fight darkness in the name of light darkness adding to darkness she said she wasnt certain what had led her to say that exactly baerd said exactly so i understand your battles here now how far they go beyond my own war in the daylight world but going far beyond doesnt mean there is no connection that was donars mistake it was before him all along if only he could have seen and the naming elena asked what did the naming have to do with it naming has everything to do with it baerd said quietly he withdrew his hand from hers and rubbed it across his eyes names matter even more here in this place of magic than they do at home where we mortals live and die he hesitated and after a silence made deeper by the singing far away he whispered did you hear me name myself it seemed almost a silly question he had cried it at the top of his voice all of them had heard but his expression was too intense for her to do anything but answer i did she said you named yourself baerd di tigana bar saevar and moving very slowly then very deliberately baerd reached for and claimed her hand and brought it to his lips as though she were the lady of one of the highland castles and not only the wheelwrights widowed daughter from the village below borso thank you he said in a queer voice thank you so much i thought i thought it might possibly be different tonight here the back of her hand was tingling where his lips had touched her and her pulse was suddenly erratically fast fighting for composure elena asked i dont understand what did i do his sorrow was still there but somehow it seemed gentler now less naked in his face he said quite calmly tigana is the name of a land that was taken away its loss is part of the evil that brought the shadowfigure to this hill and to all your other battlefields for twenty years now elena you wont understand this completely you cant but believe me when i tell you that you could not have heard the name of that land back in your village whether by the light of day or under the two moons not even if i spoke it to you from as near as we are now or cried it louder than i did within the stream and now finally she did understand not the difficult sum of what he was trying to convey but the thing that mattered more for her the source of his grief of that look in the dark of his eyes and tigana is your home she said not a question she knew he nodded very calm he was still holding her hand she realized tigana is my home he echoed men call it lower corte now she was silent a long moment thinking hard then you must speak of this to donar she said before morning takes us back there may be something he knows about such matters something he can do to help and he will want to help something flickered in his face ill do that he said ill speak to him before i go they were both silent then before i go elena pushed that away as best she could she became aware that her mouth was dry and her heart was still pounding almost as it had in battle baerd did not move he looked so young fifteen he had said she glanced away uncertain again and saw that all around them now the hill itself was covered with a carpet of white flowers look she said delighted and awed he looked around and smiled then from the heart you brought them with you he said below them and east in the field of corn across the river only a few voices were still singing elena knew what that would mean this was the first of the ember nights of spring the beginning of the year of the cycle of sowing and harvest and tonight they had won the ember war she knew what would be happening among the men and women in that field overhead the stars seemed to have come nearer to be almost as close to them as the flowers she swallowed and summoned her courage again she said there are other things that are different about tonight here i know baerd said softly and then he moved finally and was on his knees before her among all the young white flowers he released her palm then but only to take her face between his two hands so carefully it seemed as if he feared she might break or bruise to his touch over the rapidly growing thunder of her pulse elena heard him whisper her name once as if it were a kind of prayer and she had time to answer with his with all of his name as a gift before he lowered his mouth to hers she could not have spoken after that for desire and need crashed over her and bore her away as something a chip of wood a fragment of bark carried by a huge and rushing wave baerd was with her though they were together here in this place and then they were naked among the newly sprung white flowers of that hill and as she drew him down and into her feeling the keenness of longing and an aching tenderness elena looked up for a moment past his shoulder at all the circling luminous stars of the ember night and it came to her as a wonderful and joyous thought that every single diamond of those stars would have a name then baerds rhythm changed above her and her own awakened desire with it and all thoughts scattered from her like dust strewn between those stars she moved her head so her mouth could seek and find his own and she closed her arms around him and gathered him to her and closed her eyes and they let that high wave carry them into the beginning of spring chapter the cold and a cramped stiffness woke devin about an hour before sunrise it took him a moment to remember where he was it was still dark in the room he massaged his neck and listened to catrianas quiet breathing from under her blankets in the bed a rueful expression crossed his face it was strange he reflected twisting his head from side to side to try to ease the soreness how only a few hours in a soft armchair could leave one feeling more knotted and uncomfortable than a whole night out on cold ground he felt surprisingly awake though given the night hed just had and the fact that he couldnt have been asleep for more than three hours or so he considered going back to his own bed but realized that he wasnt going to be able to sleep any more that night he decided to go down to the kitchens and see if any of the household staff could be induced to make him a pot of khav he left the room concentrating on closing the door silently behind him so much so that when he saw alessan standing in the hallway watching him from in front of his own door he jumped involuntarily the prince walked over eyebrows arched devin shook his head firmly we just talked i slept in the chair got a kink in my neck to show for it im sure alessan murmured no really devin insisted im sure alessan repeated he smiled i believe you if you had essayed more i would have heard screaming yours with an unpleasant injury most likely very likely devin agreed they walked away from catrianas door how was alienor though devin felt himself going red how he began then gradually became aware of the condition of his clothing and the amused scrutiny alessan was giving him interesting he offered alessan smiled again come downstairs with me and help solve a problem i need some khav for the road anyhow i was on the way to the kitchens myself give me two minutes to change my clothes not a bad idea alessan murmured eyeing the torn shirt ill meet you down there devin ducked into his own chamber and quickly changed for good measure he pulled on the vest alais had sent him thinking of her of her sheltered quiet innocence took him back by polarity to what had happened last night he stood stockstill in the middle of his room for a moment and tried to properly grasp what he had done and had done to him interesting he had just called it language the process of sharing with words seemed such a futile exercise sometimes a remnant of the sadness hed felt leaving alienor washed back over him and it picked up catrianas sorrows too he felt as if hed been washed up by the sea on some grey beach at a bleak hour khav devin said aloud or ill never get out of this mood on the way downstairs he realized belatedly what alessan had meant by for the road his meeting wherever it was was today the encounter theyd been pointing toward for half a year and after that he would be riding west to tigana where his mother lay dying in a sanctuary of eanna wide awake his mind snapping from night reflections into the sharper agitations of the day devin followed a glow of light to the huge kitchens of castle borso and he paused in the arched doorway looking within sitting by the roaring fire alessan was carefully sipping steaming khav from an oversized mug in a chair beside him erlein di senzio was doing the same the two men were both gazing into the flames while all around them there was already a purposeful stir and bustle in the kitchen devin stood in the doorway a moment unnoticed and found himself looking closely at the two men in their silent gravity they seemed to him to be a part of a frieze a tableau emblematic in some complex way of all such predawn hours for those on the long roads neither man was a stranger to this hour devin knew to sitting thus before a castle kitchen fire among the servants in the last dark hour before dawn easing into wakefulness and a fugitive warmth preparing for the road again and whatever turnings it might offer in the day that had not yet begun it seemed to devin that alessan and erlein sitting together as they were were bonded in some way that went beyond the harsh thing that had happened by that twilit stream in ferraut it was a linkage that had nothing to do with prince and wizard it was shaped of the things they each had done the same things done memories they would each have and could share if these two men could truly share anything after what had happened between them for years they had each been traveling there had to be so many images that overlapped and could evoke the same mood emotions the same sounds and smells like this one darkness outside the edge of grey dawn and the castle stir the sun would bring chill of the corridors and knowledge of wind outside the walls cut by the crackle and roar of the kitchen fire the reassuring steam and smell rising from their cradled mugs sleep and dream receding the mind slowly turning forward to the day that lay ahead swathed in ground mist looking at their stillness amid the bustle of the kitchen devin felt another return of the sadness that seemed to be his legacy from this long strange night in the highlands sadness and a distinct stir of longing devin realized that he wanted that shared history for himself wanted to be a part of that selfcontained accomplished fraternity of men who knew this scene so well he was young enough to savor the romance of it but old enough especially after this past winter and his time with menico to guess at the price demanded for those memories and the contained solitary competent look of the two men in front of him he stepped through the doorway a pretty servant noticed him and smiled shyly without a word she brought him a scalding mug of khav alessan glanced over at him and hooked a third chair with his long leg pulling it into a position near him by the fire devin walked over and sank gratefully down near the warmth his stiffened neck was still bothering him i didnt even have to be charming alessan reported cheerfully erlein was already here and had started in on a fresh pot of khav there were people in the kitchen all night to keep the fires going couldnt have lit new ones on an ember day devin nodded sipping carefully and with intense gratitude from his steaming mug and the other question you mentioned he asked guardedly with a glance at erlein solved the prince said promptly he seemed unnaturally bright brittle as kindling erleins going to have to come with me weve established that i cant let him get too far away or my summons wont work and if thats the case well he simply has to go where i go all the way west we really do seem to be tied together dont we he flashed his teeth in a smile at the wizard erlein didnt bother to respond he continued to sip his drink gazing expressionlessly into the fire why were you up so early devin asked him after a moment erlein made a sour face slavery doesnt agree with my rest he mumbled into his khav devin elected to ignore that there were times when he really did feel sorry for the wizard but not when erlein trotted out his reflexive selfpity a thought struck devin he turned to alessan is he going to your meeting this morning too i suppose alessan said with apparent carelessness a small reward for his loyalty and the long ride hell have afterward i expect to travel without stopping very much his tone was genuinely odd too deliberately casual as if denying the very possibility of strain i see devin said as neutrally as he could manage he turned his gaze to the fire and kept it there there was a silence when it stretched devin looked back and saw alessan looking at him do you want to come the prince asked did he want to come for half a year from the moment devin and sandre had joined the other three alessan had been telling them that everything they wanted to achieve would point toward and wait upon a meeting in these southern highlands on the first of the ember days did he want to come devin coughed spilling some khav on the stone floor well he said not if im in the way naturally only if you think i could be useful and if maybe i could he trailed off because alessan was laughing at him even erlein had been roused from his sulk to a faint reluctant snort of amusement the two older men exchanged a glance you are a terrible liar the wizard said to devin hes right alessan said still chuckling but never mind i dont actually think you can be useful it isnt in the nature of what i have to do but im certain you wont do any harm and you and erlein can keep each other entertained itll be a very long ride what to the meeting devin asked startled alessan shook his head only two or three hours there depending on the state of the pass this morning no devin im inviting you west with me his voice altered home pigeon the balding burlychested man cried though they were still some distance away he sat in a massive oak chair set squarely down in the middle of the braccio pass there had been early spring flowers blooming on the lower slopes but not very many this far up on either side of the path piled rock and stone yielded to forest further up to the south there was only rock and snow carryingpoles were attached to the oak chair and six men stood behind it in burgundy livery devin thought they were servants but when he came nearer he saw from their weapons that he was wrong these were soldiers and guards pigeon the man in the chair repeated loudly you have risen in the world you bring companions this time it was with a genuine sense of disorientation that devin realized that the childish name and the raucous carrying words were addressed to alessan who had the oddest look to his face all of a sudden he said nothing by way of reply though as they rode up to the seven men in the pass alessan dismounted behind him devin and erlein did the same the man in the chair did not rise to greet them but his bright small eyes followed every move that alessan made his enormous hands were motionless on the carved arms of the chair he wore at least six rings they sparkled in the light of the morning sun he had a hooked muchbroken nose in a leathery weatherbeaten face that showed two livid scars one was an old wound slanting down his right cheek in a white line the other much more recent raked redly across his forehead to the greying receding hairline above his left ear company for the ride alessan said mildly i wasnt sure if youd come they both sing could have consoled me on the way back the young one is devin the other is erlein youve grown monstrous fat in a year and why should i not grow fat the other roared in delight and how dare you doubt that i would come have i ever not kept faith with you the tone was boisterous in the extreme but devin saw that the small eyes were alert and very watchful not ever alessan agreed calmly his own febrile manner had gone to be replaced by an almost preternatural calm but things have changed since two years ago you dont need me anymore not since last summer not need you the big man cried pigeon of course i need you you are my youth my memory of what i was and my talisman of fortune in battle no more battles though said alessan quietly will you allow me to offer my humblest congratulations no the other growled no i will not allow you no such mewling courtly claptrap from you what i want is for you to come here and hug me and stop this imbecilic maundering who are we to be cluttering like this the two of us and with the last words he propelled himself upright with a ferocious push of his two muscled arms the huge oak chair rocked backwards three of the liveried guards sprang to balance it the big man took two awkward crippled hopping steps forward as alessan strode to meet him and in that moment devin abruptly realized a bucket of ice down the length of his spine who this scarred maimed man had to be bear said alessan laughter catching in his throat he threw his arms fiercely about the other man oh marius i truly didnt know if you would come marius stupefied by more than altitude and a sleepless night devin saw the selfcrowned king of quileia the crippled man whod killed seven armed challengers barehanded hi the sacred grove lift the prince of tigana clean off his feet and kiss him loudly on both cheeks he lowered a redfaced alessan to the path and held him at arms length for a close scrutiny it is true he said at length as alessans grin faded i can see it you really did doubt me i should be outraged pigeon i should be wounded and hurt what did pigeon two say baerd was sure you would be here alessan admitted ruefully im afraid i owe him money at least one of you has grown up enough to have some sense marius growled then something seemed to register with him what you two young scamps were wagering on me how dare you he was laughing but the blow he suddenly clapped on alessans shoulder made the other man stagger marius hobbled back to his chair and sat down again devin was struck by the allembracing nature of the glance he turned on them only for an instant did it flit over devin himself but he had the uncanny sense that marius had in that one second sized him up quite comprehensively that he would be recognized and remembered should they meet by chance even a decade hence he experienced a weird fleeting moment of pity for the seven warriors who had had to battle this man bringing merely swords or spears and armor and two good legs to meet him in a night grove those arms like treetrunks and the message in those eyes told devin all he needed to know about which way the balance would have tilted in those battles despite the ritual maiming the severed ankle tendons of the consort who was supposed to die in the grove to the greater glory of the mother goddess and her high priestess marius had not died for anyones greater glory seven times he had not died and now since that seventh time there was a true king in quileia again and the last high priestess was dead it had been rovigo devin remembered suddenly who had first given him that news in a rancid tavern called the bird either half a year or half a lifetime ago you must have been slipping or lazy or already fat last summer in the grove alessan was saying he gestured toward the scar on mariuss forehead tonalius should never have been able to get that close to you with a blade the smile on the face of the king of quileia was not in truth a pleasant thing to see he didnt marius said grimly i used our kickdrop from the twentyseven tree and he was dead before we both hit the ground the scar is a farewell token from my late wife in our last encounter may the sacred mother of us all guard her everblessed spirit will you take wine and a midday meal alessans grey eyes blinked we would be pleased to he said good said marius he gestured to his guards in that case while my men attend to laying things out for us you can tell me pigeon and i hope you will tell me why you hesitated just now before accepting that invitation it was devins turn to blink he hadnt even registered the pause alessan was smiling though i wish he said with a wry twist of his mouth that you would miss something once in a while marius smiled thinly but did not speak i have a long ride ahead of me at least three days flat out someone i must get to as soon as i can more important than me pigeon i am desolated alessan shook his head not more important or i wouldnt be here now more compelling perhaps there was a message from danoleon waiting for me at borso last night my mother is dying mariuss expression changed swiftly i am deeply sorry he said alessan truly i am he paused it could not have been easy for you to come here first knowing that alessan gave his small characteristic shrug his eyes moved away from marius gazing past him up the pass toward the high peaks beyond the soldiers had finished spreading a quite extravagant golden cloth over the level ground in front of the chair now they began laying out multicolored cushions upon it and putting down baskets and dishes of food we will break bread together marius said crisply and discuss what we are here to discuss then you must go you trust this message is there danger for you in returning devin hadnt even thought about that i suppose there is alessan said indifferently but yes i trust danoleon of course i do he took me to you in the first place i am aware of that marius said mildly i remember him i also know that unless things have greatly changed he is not the only priest in that sanctuary of eanna and your clergy in the palm have not been noted for their reliability alessan gave his shrug again what can i do my mother is dying ive not seen her in almost two decades bear his mouth crooked i dont think i am likely to be recognized by many people even without baerds disguises would you not say i have changed somewhat since i was fourteen there was a slight challenge in the words somewhat marius said quietly not so much as one might think you were a grown man even then in many ways so was baerd when he came to join you again alessans eyes seemed to drift away up the line of the pass as if chasing a memory or a faroff image to the south devin had an acute sense that there was much more being said here than he was hearing come marius said levering his hands on the chair arms will you join me on our carpet in the meadow stay in the chair alessan rapped sharply his expression remained incongruously benign and untroubled how many men came here with you bear marius had not moved a company to the foothills these six through the pass why moving easily smiling carelessly alessan sat down on the cloth at the kings feet hardly wise to bring so few up here there is little enough danger my enemies are too superstitious to venture into the mountains you know that pigeon the passes were named as taboo long ago when they shut down trade with the palm in that case alessan said still smiling i am at a loss to explain the bowman i just saw behind a rock up the trail you are certain mariuss voice was as casual as alessans but there was suddenly ice in his eyes twice now i am deeply distressed said the king of quileia such a person is unlikely to be here for any reason other than to kill me and if they are breaking the mountain taboo i am going to be forced to rethink a number of assumptions will you take some wine he gestured and one of the men in burgundy poured with a hand that trembled slightly thank you alessan murmured erlein can you do anything here without it being known the wizards face went pale but he too kept his voice level not any sort of attack it would take too much power and there is nothing here to screen it from any tracker in the highlands a shield for the king erlein hesitated my friend alessan said gravely i need you and i am going to continue to need you i know there is danger in using your magic for all of us i must have honest answers though to make intelligent decisions pour him some wine he said to the quileian soldier erlein accepted a glass and drank i can do a lowlevel screen behind him against arrows he stopped do you want it there is some risk i think i do alessan said put up the shield as unobtrusively as you can erleins mouth tightened but he said nothing his left hand moved very slightly from side to side devin could see the two missing fingers now but nothing else happened so far as he could tell it is done erlein said grimly the risk will increase the longer i hold it up he drank again from his wine alessan nodded accepting a wedge of bread and a plateful of meat and cheese from one of the quileians devin devin had been waiting i see the rock he said quietly up the path on the right side arrow range send me home take my horse theres a bow in the saddle devin shook his head he may notice and im not good enough with the bow anyhow ill do what i can can you arrange to be noisy in about twenty minutes we can be very noisy said marius of quileia the climb back up and around will be easier to your left as you go down just past the point where this path bends id very much like this person alive by the way devin smiled marius suddenly roared with laughter and alessan followed suit erlein was silent as alessan swept an imperious hand out toward devin if you forgot it then you can fetch it thimblebrain well be here enjoying our meal we may leave something for you it wasnt my fault devin protested loudly letting his smile fade to petulance he turned back to where the horses were tethered shaking his head visibly disconsolate he mounted his grey and rode down the path along which they had come as far as the bend in the trail he dismounted and tethered the horse after a moments thought he left his sword where it was hanging from the saddle he was aware that it was a decision that might cost him his life hed seen the wooded slopes beside the pass though a sword would be awkward and noisy when he began to climb cutting to the west he soon found himself among the trees he doubled back south and up as far off the line of the pass as the terrain allowed it was hard sweaty going and he had to hurry but devin was fit and hed always been quick and agile compensations for a lack of size he scrambled up the steep slopes weaving among mountain trees and dark serrano bushes grasping roots wedged deep into the slanting soil part of the way up the trees briefly gave out before a short steep cliff to the south and west he could go up or he could go around angling back toward the pass devin tried to guess his bearings but it was difficult no sounds reached him this far off the trail he couldnt be sure if he was already above the place where the quileian cloth was spread for lunch twenty minutes hed told them he gritted his teeth offered a quick prayer to adaon and began to climb the rock it occurred to him that there was something profoundly incongruous about an asolini farmers son from the northern marshes struggling up a cliffface in the braccio range he wasnt an asolini farmers son though he was from tigana and his father was and his prince had asked him to do this thing devin skittered sideways along the rockface trying not to dislodge any pebbles he reached an outcrop of stone changed grip hung free for a second and then boosted himself straight up and onto it he scrambled quickly across some level ground dropped flat on his stomach and breathing hard looked up to the south and then straight down he caught his breath realizing how lucky hed been there was a single figure hiding behind a boulder almost directly below him devin had quite certainly been visible on the last part of his climb where the cliffface broke clear of the trees his silence had served him well though for the figure below was oblivious to him avidly intent on the group feasting on the path devin couldnt see them but their voices carried to him now the sun moved behind a cloud and devin instinctively flattened himself just as the assassin glanced up to gauge the change in the light for an archer it would matter devin knew it was a long shot downhill and partly screened by the guards there would also be time most likely for only one arrow he wondered if the tips were poisoned probably he decided very carefully he started crawling uphill trying to work his way further around behind the assassin his brain was racing as he slipped into a higher stand of trees how was he going to get close enough to deal with an archer just then he heard the sound of alessans pipes followed a measure later by erleins harp a moment after that a number of voices started in on one of the oldest most rollicking highland ballads of all about a legendary band of mountain outlaws who had ruled these hills and crags with arrogant impunity until they were surprised and defeated by quileia and certando together thirty brave men rode apace from the north and forty quileians met them side by side there in the mountains each pledged to the other and gan burdash high in his roost defied the booming voice of marius led the others into the refrain by then devin had remembered something and he knew what he was going to try to do he was aware that there was more than an element of lunacy in his planning but he also knew he didnt have much time or many options his heart was pounding he wiped his hands dry on his breeches and began moving more quickly through the trees along the line of the ridge hed climbed behind him was the singing beneath him now perhaps fifteen feet east of this higher ridge and twenty feet below was an assassin with a bow the sun came out from behind the clouds devin was above and behind the quileian now had he been carrying a bow and been at all accomplished with one he would have had the other at his mercy instead what he had was a knife and a certain pride and trust in his own coordination and a tall giant of a mountain pine tree rising all the way up to his ridge from just behind the boulder that sheltered the archer he could see the other clearly now clad in a masking green for the mountain trail with a strung bow and half a dozen arrows to hand devin knew what he had to do he also knew because there had been woods at home if not mountain passes that he could not climb down that tree with any hope of silence not even with the loud seriously offkey voices screening his sounds from below which left so far as he could judge only the one option others might have planned it better but others werent on this ridge devin wiped his damp palms very carefully dry again and began concentrating on a large branch that stretched out and away from the others the only one that might do him any good he tried to calculate angle and distance as best he could given an almost total lack of experience at this particular maneuver what he was about to try was not a thing one did for practice anywhere he checked the hang of the dagger in his belt wiped his hands one last time and stood up absurdly the flash of memory that came to him then was of the day his brothers had surprised him hanging upside down from a tree trying to stretch his height devin smiled tightly and stepped to the edge of the cliff the branch looked absurdly far away and it was only half of the way down to the level of the pass he swore an inward oath that if he survived this baerd was going to teach him how to use a bow properly from the path below he heard the ragged voices swirling erratically towards the climax of the ballad gan burdash ruled in the mountain heights and with his band he ranged from crag to glen but seventy brave men tracked him to his lair and when the moons had set the peaks were free again devin jumped air whistled past his face the branch flew up to meet him blurred very fast he stretched his hands clutched it swung only a little only enough to change his angle of descent cut his momentum bring him directly down upon the killer behind the rock the branch held but the leaves crackled loudly as he pivoted hed known they would the quileian flung a startled glance skyward and grappled for the bow not nearly fast enough screaming at the top of his lungs devin plummeted like some hunting bird of these high places by the time his target began to move devin was already there our kickdrop from the twentyseven tree he thought falling he tilted his torso so that it angled sideways across the upper body of the quileian and he kicked out hard with both feet as he did the impact was sickening he felt his legs make jarring contact even as he crashed into the other driving all the air from his own lungs they smashed into the ground together tumbling and rolling away from the base of the boulder devin gasped agonizingly for breath he felt the world sway and rock wildly in his sight he gritted his teeth and groped for his dagger then he realized it was not necessary dead before we both hit the ground marius had said with a shuddering heave devin forced air into his tortured lungs there was an odd knifing pain running up his right leg he forced himself to ignore it he rolled free of the unconscious quileian and struggled gasping and wheezing for another breath of precious air and then he looked the assassin was a woman under all the circumstances not a great surprise she was not dead her forehead appeared to have glanced off the rock under the impact of his sprawling descent she was lying on her side bleeding heavily from a scalp wound he had probably broken a number of her ribs with his kick she had a profusion of cuts and scrapes from their tumble down the slope so devin noted did he his shirt was torn and he was badly scratched again for the second time in half a day there was a joke something that ought to be amusing in that but he couldnt reach to it not yet he seemed to have survived though and to have done what hed been asked to do he managed to draw one full steadying breath just as alessan and one of the quileian soldiers came sprinting up the path erlein was just behind them devin saw with surprise he started to stand but the world spun erratically and he had to be braced by alessan the quileian guard flipped the assassin over on her back he stood staring down upon her and then spat very deliberately into her bleeding face devin looked away his eyes met alessans we saw you jump from down there youre really supposed to have wings before trying that sort of thing the prince said didnt anyone ever tell you the expression in the grey eyes belied the lightness of his tone i feared for you he added softly i couldnt think of anything else to do devin said apologetically he was aware of a deep pride beginning to well up within him he shrugged the singing was driving me mad i had to do something to stop it alessans smile widened he reached an arm around and squeezed devins shoulder baerd had done that too in the nievolene barn it was erlein who laughed at the joke come back down the wizard said ill have to clean out those cuts for you they helped him descend the slope the quileian carried the woman and her bow devin saw that it was made of a very dark wood almost black and was carved into a semblance of a crescent moon from one end of it there hung a gathered and twisted lock of greying hair he shivered he had a fair idea of whose it would be marius was on his feet one hand on the back of his chair as he watched them come down his eyes barely flicked over the four men and the carried assassin they locked cold and grim on the black curve of the moon bow he looked frightening and the more so devin thought because not at all afraid i think we are past the need to dance in words around each other alessan said i would like to tell you what i need and you will tell me if you can do it and that will be all we need say marius held up a hand to stop him he had now joined the three of them among the cushions on the golden cloth the dishes and baskets had been cleared away two of the quileians had taken the woman back up over the pass to where the rest of their company waited the other four were posted some distance away the sun was high as high as it would get at noon this far south this early in the spring it had turned into a mild generous day this bear is a very bad worddancer pigeon the king of quileia said soberly you know that you probably know something else how much it will grieve me to deny you any request at all i would like to do this differently i would like to tell you what i cannot do so you will not ask it and force me to refuse alessan nodded he remained silent watching the king i cannot give you an army marius said flatly not yet and perhaps never i am too green in power too far from the stability i need at home to lead or even order troops over these mountains there are several hundreds of years of tradition i have to set about changing in very little time i am not a young man anymore pigeon devin felt a leap of excitement within himself and struggled to master it this was too serious an occasion for childlike feelings he could hardly believe he was here though so close to at the very heart of something of this magnitude he stole a sidelong glance at erlein and then looked more closely the same quick spark of interest was in the others face for all his years and his long travels devin seriously doubted if the troubadourwizard had ever been so near to great events alessan was shaking his head bear he said i would never ask you for that for our sake as much as for your own i will not have my name remembered as the man who first invited the newly awakened might of quileia north into the palm if an army ever ventures from quileia through these passes and i hope we are both long dead before such a day the wish of my heart will be for it to be slaughtered and driven back with losses so bloody that no king in the south ever tries again if there is a king in the south and not another four hundred years of the mother and her priestesses very well marius said then tell me what it is you do need alessans legs were neatly crossed his long fingers laced in his lap he looked for all the world as if he was discussing nothing of greater moment than perhaps the sequence of songs for an evenings performance except that his fingers devin saw were so tightly squeezed together they were white a question first alessan said controlling his voice have you received letters offering to open trade marius nodded from both of your tyrants gifts messages of felicitation and generous offers to reopen the old trade routes by sea and land and each urged you to scorn the other as being untrustworthy and unstable in his power marius was smiling faintly now are you intercepting my mail pigeon each did exactly that and what alessan asked direct as an arrow have you replied for the first time unmistakably there was a taut cord of tension in his voice marius heard it too nothing yet he said his smile fading i want a few more messages from each of them before i move alessan looked down and seemed to notice his clenched fingers for the first time he unlaced them and ran a hand predictably through his hair you will have to move though he said with some difficulty you will obviously need trade in your position you have to begin showing quileia some of the benefits you can offer traffic north will be the quickest way wont it there was an awkward kind of challenge in his tone of course marius said simply i have to do it why else am i king it is only a question of timing and with what happened this morning i think my timing has just been moved up alessan nodded as if hed known all this already what will you do then he asked open the passes for both of them no preferences no tariffs for either i will let alberico and brandin send me all the gifts and goods and envoys they want ill let their trade make me truly a king a king who brings new prosperity to his people and i need to start doing it soon immediately i now suspect i have to put quileia so firmly on a new path that the old one recedes as fast as i can make it otherwise ill die having done nothing but live somewhat longer than most year kings and the priestesses will be in power again before my bones are picked clean underground alessan closed his eyes devin became aware of the rustling of leaves all around them and the sporadic calling of birds then alessan looked up at marius again the grey eyes wide and calm and he said bluntly my request that you give me six months before deciding on trade and something else in that interval the time alone is a great deal marius said very softly but tell me the rest pigeon the something else three letters bear i need three letters sent north first letter you say yes to brandin conditionally you ask for time to consolidate your own position before exposing quileia to outside influences you make it clear that your inclination toward him is based on his appearing stronger than alberico more likely to endure second letter you reject sorrowfully all overtures from astibar you write alberico that you are intimidated by brandins threats that you would dearly love to trade with the empire of barbadior need to trade with them but the ygrathen seems too strong in the palm for you to risk offending him you wish alberico all good fortune you ask him to keep in contact with you discreetly you say you will be watching events in the north with close interest you have not yet given brandin a final decision and will delay as long as you can you send your warmest regards to the emperor devin was lost he reverted to his trick of the winter listen remember think about it later mariuss eyes were bright though and the cold unsettling smile was back and my third letter he asked is to the governor of the province of senzio offering immediate trade no tariffs first choice of prime goods secure anchorage in your harbors for their ships expressing deep admiration for senzios brave independence and enterprise in the face of adversity alessan paused and this third letter naturally will be intercepted by alberico of barbadior pigeon do you know what you would be setting in motion how incredibly dangerous a game this is wait a minute erlein di senzio suddenly interjected starting to rise you be silent alessan literally snarled the command in a voice devin had never heard him use erleins mouth snapped shut he subsided breathing harshly his eyes coals of anger and burgeoning understanding alessan didnt even look at him neither did marius the two of them sat on a golden carpet high in the mountains seemingly oblivious to the existence of anything in the world but each other you do know dont you marius said finally you know exactly there was a certain wonder in his voice alessan nodded ive had enough time to think about it triad knows once the trade routes open i think my province and its name are lost with what you can offer him brandin will be a hero in the west not a tyrant he will be so secure that there will be nothing i can do bear your kingship may be my undoing and my homes are you sorry you helped me to it devin watched alessan wrestle with that there were currents of emotion running here far beneath the surface of what he could see and understand he listened and remembered i should be sorry alessan murmured at length in a way it is a kind of treachery that i am not but no how can i possibly regret what we worked so hard to achieve his smile was wistful marius said you know i love you pigeon both of you i know we both know you know what i am facing back home i do i have reason to remember in the silence that followed devin felt a sadness come over him an echo of his mood at the end of the night a sense of the terrible spaces that always seemed to lie between people the gulfs that had to be crossed for even a simple touching and how much wider those gulfs must be for men such as these two with their long dreams and the burdens of being who they were and what how hard it seemed how brutally hard for hands to reach out across so much history and such a weight of responsibility and loss oh pigeon said marius of quileia his voice little more than a whisper you may have been an arrow shot from the white moon into my heart eighteen years ago i love you as my son alessan bar valentin i will give you six months and your three letters build a bonfire to my memory if you hear that i have died even with what little he understood on the uttermost edges of this devin felt a lump gather in his throat making it difficult to swallow he looked at the two of them and he couldnt have said which man he admired more in that moment the one who had asked knowing what he asked or the one who had given knowing what he gave he had an awareness though humbling inescapable of how far yet he had to travel a distance he might never traverse before he could name himself a man after the fashion of these two does either of you have any idea erlein di senzio broke into the stillness his voice grim as death how many innocent men and women may be butchered because of what you are about to do marius said nothing alessan wheeled on the wizard though have you any idea he said his eyes like chips of grey ice how close i am to killing you for saying that erlein paled but did not draw back nor did his own eyes flinch away i did not ask to be born into this time charged by my birth with trying to set it right alessan said his voice held tightly again as if under a leash i was the youngest child this should have been my brothers burden either or both of them they died by the deisa among the lucky ones bitterness cracked through for a moment and was beaten back i am trying to act for the whole of the palm not just for tigana and her lost name i have been reviled as a traitor and a fool for doing so my mother has cursed me because of this i will accept that from her to her i will hold myself accountable for blood and death and the destruction of what tigana was if i fail i will not hold myself subject to your judgment erlein di senzio i do not need you to tell me who or what is at risk in this i need you to do what i tell you nothing more if you are going to die a slave you might as well be mine as anyone elses you are going to fight with me senzian whether through your will or against it you are going to fight with me for freedom he fell silent devin felt himself trembling as if a titanic thunderstorm had shaken the sky above the mountains and gone why do you let him live marius of quileia asked alessan fought to collect himself he seemed to consider the matter because he is a brave man in his own way he answered at length because it is true that his people will be placed in great danger by this because i have wronged him by his lights and by my own and because i have need of him marius shook his large head it is bad to have need of a man i know bear he may come back to you even years later and ask you for something very large something your heart will not let you refuse i know bear said alessan the two men looked at each other sitting motionless on the golden carpet devin turned away feeling like an intruder on that exchange of glances in the stillness of that pass below the heights of the braccio range birdsong rang out with piercing sweetness and looking up to the south devin saw that the last of the high white clouds had drifted apart revealing the dazzle of sunlit snow on the peaks the world seemed to be a place of more beauty and more pain than he could ever have imagined it to be when they rode back down from the pass baerd was waiting for them a few miles south of the castle alone on his horse among the green of the foothills his eyes widened when he saw devin and erlein and a rare amusement was visible even behind his beard as alessan pulled to a halt in front of him you said baerd are even worse at these things than i am despite everything you say not worse as bad perhaps alessan said ruefully ducking his head after all your only reason for refusing to come was so that he wouldnt feel any extra pressure to and after lashing me verbally for that you go and take two complete strangers to reduce the pressure even more i stand my ground you are worse than i am lash me verbally alessan said baerd shook his head how is he well enough under strain devin stopped an assassination attempt up there what baerd glanced quickly at devin noting the torn shirt and hose and the scrapes and cuts you are going to have to teach me how to use a bow devin said theres less wear and tear baerd smiled i will first chance we have then something seemed to occur to him an assassination he said to alessan in the mountains surely not alessans expression was grim im afraid so she carried a moon bow with a lock of his hair the mountain taboo has obviously been lifted at least for the purposes of murder baerds features creased with concern he sat on his horse quietly a moment then so he had no option really he needs to act immediately he said no he said yes we have six months and he will send the letters alessan hesitated he asked us to build a bonfire to his memory if he dies baerd suddenly turned his horse away he sat staring fixedly off to the west the lateafternoon sun was shedding an amber glow over the heather and bracken of the hills i love that man baerd said still gazing into the distance i know said alessan slowly baerd turned back to him they exchanged a look in silence senzio said baerd alessan nodded you will have to explain to alienor how to set up in the interception these two will come west with me you and catriana and the duke go north and then into tregea we start reaping what weve sown baerd you know the timing as well as i do and youll know what to do until we meet again who well want from the east im not sure about rovigo ill leave that to you im not happy about separate roads baerd murmured neither am i if you must know if you have an alternative id be grateful to hear it baerd shook his head what will you do speak to some people on the way see my mother after that it depends on what i find my own reaping in the west before summer comes baerd glanced briefly at devin and erlein try not to let yourself be hurt he said alessan gave his shrug shes dying baerd and ive hurt her enough in eighteen years you have not the other replied with sudden anger you only wound yourself if you think that way alessan sighed she is dying unknown and alone in a sanctuary of eanna in a province called lower corte she is not in the palace by the sea in tigana do not say she has not been hurt but not by you baerd protested why do you do this to yourself again the shrug i have made certain choices in a dozen years since we came back from quileia i am willing to accept that others may disagree with those choices his eyes flicked to erlein leave it baerd i promise not to let this unbalance me even without you there devin will help if i need help baerd grimaced behind his beard and looked as if he would pursue the matter further but when he spoke again it was in a different voice you think this is it then you think it truly might happen now i think it has to happen this summer or it never will unless i suppose someone does kill marius in quileia and we go back to stasis here with nothing at all to work with which would mean that my mother and a great many other people were right in which case you and i will simply have to sail into chiara harbor and storm the palace walls alone and kill brandin of ygrath and watch the palm become an outpost of barbadiors empire and what price tigana then he checked himself then continued in a lower voice marius is the one wild card we have ever had the one thing ive been waiting for and working for all these years and hes just agreed to let us play him as we need we have a chance it may not hurt to do some praying all of us in the days to come this has been long enough in arriving baerd was very still long enough he echoed finally and something in his voice sent a chill into devin eanna light your path through the ember days and beyond he paused glanced at erlein all three of you alessans expression spoke a world of things and yours the three of you was all he said though before he turned his horse and started away to the west following him devin glanced back once and saw that baerd had not moved he sat astride his horse watching them and the sunlight fell on his hair and beard burnishing them back toward the golden color devin remembered from their first meeting he was too far away for his expression to be discerned devin raised a hand in farewell palm spread wide and then surprised and gladdened saw erlein abruptly do the same baerd lifted one arm high in salute to them then twitched his horses reins and turned north to ride away alessan setting a steady pace into the setting sun did not look back at all part four the price of blood chapter time before dawn she wasnt sure what hour it was dianora rose from bed and walked to the windows overlooking her balcony in the end she had not slept all night neither as it happened had her brother a very long way to the south fighting in the ember war and then sharing the beginning of spring on a hilltop won from the darkness she herself had shared nothing with anyone that night lying alone in her bed visited by ghosts and memories now she looked out upon a cold darkness that had little in it of springtime or the promise of growth to come the late stars still shone though the moon had long since set a wind blew in from off the sea she could just make out the banners flapping from the masts of the ships in the harbor beyond the ring dive pier one of those ships was newly in from ygrath it had carried isolla the singer here it would not carry her back khav my lady scelto said quietly from behind her she nodded without turning please and then come sit with me we have something to talk about if she moved quickly enough she thought if she set it all in motion without giving herself time for hesitation or fear she might possibly do this thing otherwise she was lost she could hear scelto bustling efficiently in the small kitchen that was a part of her suite of rooms the fire had been kept going all night ygrath might not observe the same spring and autumn rituals as the palm but brandin had seldom interfered with local customs or religion and dianora never lit a new flame on any of the ember days neither did most of the women in the saishan if it came to that the eastern wing of the palace would be a dark place after sunset for two more nights she thought about stepping out on the balcony but it looked much too cold there were no signs of life yet down below she thought about camena di chiara at sunrise they would probably bring him out his bones broken to die on a wheel in the sight of the people she turned her mind away from that image too here is the khav scelto said i made it very strong he added awkwardly she did turn at that and her heart ached a little to see the helpless worry in his eyes she knew how he would have grieved for her last night the marks of sleeplessness were in his face she supposed they were in her own as well she could guess how she must look this morning she forced a smile and accepted the mug he offered it was warm to her hand and comforting even before she drank she sat in one of the chairs by the window and motioned him to the other he hesitated a moment and then sat down she was silent weighing her words she realized abruptly that she had no idea how to do this subtly so much she thought wryly for the cynical manipulator of the court taking a deep breath she said scelto i need to be out on the mountain this morning alone i know all of the difficulties but i have my reasons and they are important how can we arrange it his smooth brow furrowed he said nothing though and she realized that he was thinking about an answer to her question not trying to judge or understand it she had feared a different sort of reaction but realized belatedly that she should not have never with him he said it will depend on whether they do the mountain run today her heart swelled with love for him he hadnt even asked her reasons why would they not run it she asked stupidly and realized the answer even as he replied camena he said i dont know if the king will allow the spring run on the same day as an execution if they are doing the race then you will be invited to come watch the ending from the kings pavilion in the meadow as you always are i have to be alone she repeated and up the mountain alone with me he modified it was almost a plea she sipped her khav this was the difficult part some of the way scelto she said there is a thing i must do there by myself i will have to leave you partway up she watched him wrestle with that before he could speak she added i would not say this if it were not necessary there is no one i would rather have by my side she did not say what it was necessary for and she saw him fighting to hold back the question he did hold it back though and she knew what it would have cost him he rose ill have to find out what is happening then ill be back soon if they are running we will at least have an excuse to be outside if they arent well have to think further on this she nodded gratefully and watched him go neat and trim infinitely reassuring in his competence she finished her khav looking out the window it was still dark outside she walked into the other room to wash and dress herself doing so with some care knowing it might matter today she chose a simple brown woolen robe and belted it at the waist this was an ember day not a time for splendor of apparel there was a hood to hide her hair that too might matter by the time she was done scelto had returned he had a queer expression on his face they are running he said and camena is not going to be executed on the wheel what happened to him she asked feeling an instinctive dread scelto hesitated the word is being put about that he has been granted a merciful death already because the actual conspiracy was from ygrath and camena was merely a victim a tool she nodded and what has really happened sceltos face was troubled this may be a thing you were better not to know my lady it probably was she thought but she had come too far in the night and had too far yet to go this was no morning for sheltering or trying to seek shelter perhaps was all she said but i would prefer you to tell me scelto he said after a moment i have been told that he is going to be altered rhun is growing old and the king must have a fool it is necessary to have one in readiness and it can take a long time depending on the circumstances the circumstances dianora thought sickened such as whether the foolinwaiting had been a healthy gifted normal young man with a love of his home even understanding what the fools of ygrath were to their kings even grasping that camena had forfeited his life by what he had done yesterday she still could not stop her stomach from turning at the implications of sceltos words she remembered rhun hacking at isollas body yesterday she remembered brandins face she forced her mind away from that she couldnt afford to think about brandin this morning in fact she was better off not thinking about anything at all have i been summoned yet she asked tersely not yet you will be she could hear tension in his voice the news about camena had evidently disturbed him as well i know i will she said i dont think we can wait though if i go out with the others it will be impossible to slip away what do you think would happen if we two tried to walk down together now her tone was steady and calm sceltos face grew thoughtful we can try he said after a moment then come her fear was very simple if she waited too long or considered this too much she would be paralyzed by doubt the thing was to move and to keep on moving until she reached a certain place what would happen then if anything she would leave to the triads grace her heart beating rapidly she followed scelto out of her rooms and into the main saishan corridor the first thin streaks of light were showing now through the windows at the eastern end the two of them went the other way passing two young castrates who were moving toward vencels rooms dianora looked straight at them she was pleased for the first time to see fear spark in the eyes of both of the boys today fear was a weapon a tool and she would need all the tools she could find scelto led her not hurrying down the wide stairway towards the double doors that led to the outside world she caught up to him just as he rapped when the guard outside opened she stepped through without waiting for his challenge or sceltos announcement she fixed him with a cool glance as she went by and saw his eyes widen as he recognized her she began walking down the long hallway as she went past the other guard she saw that he was the young one shed smiled at yesterday today she did not smile behind her she heard scelto speak one quick cryptic sentence and then another in answer to a question then she heard his footsteps coming down the corridor a moment later the door swung shut behind them scelto caught up to her i think it will take a brave man to stop you today he said quietly they all know what happened yesterday it is a good morning to be trying this it was the only morning she would ever be trying this dianora thought what did you tell them she asked continuing to walk the only thing i could think of you are going to a meeting with deymon about what happened yesterday she slowed a little considering that and as she did the glimmerings of a proper plan came to her like the first faint illumination of the sun rising in the east above the mountains good she said nodding her head very good scelto that is exactly what im doing two other guards walked past them taking no notice at all scelto she said when they were alone again i need you to find deymon say i want to speak with him alone before we all go out this afternoon for the end of the race tell him ill be waiting in the kings garden two hours from now two hours might or might not be enough she didnt know but somewhere in the vast expanse of the kings garden on the north side of the palace she knew there was a gate that led out to the meadows and then the slopes of sangarios beyond scelto stopped forcing her to do the same you are going to go without me arent you he said she would not lie to him i am she said i expect to be back in time for that meeting after you give him the message go back to the saishan he doesnt know were out already so hell have to send for me make sure the message goes directly to you i dont care how they usually do he said quietly clearly unhappy i know that when he does send well have our excuse for being out two hours from now come back down yourself i should be in the garden with him look for us there and if you arent she shrugged stall hope i have to do this scelto i told you he looked at her a moment longer and then nodded his head once they went on just before reaching the sweep of the grand staircase on their left scelto turned right and they went down a smaller stairwell to the ground level it brought them out into another eastwest corridor there was no one there the palace was only just beginning to stir she looked over at scelto their eyes met for a fleeting moment she was sorely tempted to confide in him to make an ally of a friend what could she say though how explain in the middle of a dawn corridor the dark night and the train of years that had led her here she put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed go now she said ill be all right without looking back she walked alone a little way down the hallway pushed open two glass doors leading to the labyrinth of the kings garden and went out into the grey cold beginning of dawn it hadnt always been known as the kings garden nor had it always been as wild as it was now the grand dukes of chiara had shaped this pleasure ground for themselves over successive generations and it had changed over the years as tastes and styles in the island court had changed when brandin of ygrath had first arrived it had been a glittering exercise in topiary hedges artfully trimmed in the shapes of birds and animals trees precisely spaced and arranged throughout the enormous walled expanse of the garden wide walks with sculpted benches at easy intervals each one under a sejoia planted for fragrance and shade there had been one tidy boxhedged maze with a lovers seat at the center and rows and rows of flowers carefully arrayed in complementary colors tame and boring the king of ygrath had labeled it the first time he walked through within two years the garden had changed again a great deal this time the walkways were less wide now dappled and overhung with leaves in summer and fall they twisted seemingly at random through the densely planted groves of trees brought down with some labor from the mountain slopes and the forests on the north side of the island some of the sculpted benches remained and the thick and fragrant flower beds but the bird hedges and the animal bushes had been the first things to go and the neat symmetrically pruned shrubs and serrano bushes had been allowed to grow out higher and darker like the trees the maze was gone the whole of the garden was a maze now an underground stream had been tapped and diverted and now the sound of running water was everywhere there were leafy pools one might stumble upon with overhanging trees for shade in the summers heat the kings garden was a strange place now not overgrown and most certainly not neglected but deliberately shaped to give a sense of stillness and isolation and even at times of danger times such as this with the dawn wind still cold and the scarcely risen sun just beginning to warm the air only the earliest buds were on the branches of the trees and only the first flowers of the season anemones and wild caiana roses adding flashes of color to the wan morning the winter trees stood tall and dark against the grey sky dianora shivered and closed the glass doors behind her she took a deep breath of the sharp air and looked up at the clouds piled high above the mountain hiding the peak of sangarios over to the east the clouds were beginning to break up it would be a mild day later not yet though she stood at the edge of the wildness of an endofwinter garden and tried to guide herself towards steadiness and calm she knew there was a gate in the northern wall but she wasnt sure she remembered where brandin had showed it to her one summers night years ago when they had walked for miles aimlessly amid fireflies and the drone of crickets and the sound of unseen water splashing in the darkness beyond the torchlit paths he had brought her to a gate hed stumbled upon one day halfhidden by climbing vines and a rose bush he had shown it to her in the darkness with torches behind them and blue ilarion overhead he had held her hand that night as they walked she remembered and talked to her about herbs and the properties of flowers he had told her an ygrathen fairy tale of a forest princess born in some far distant otherworld on an enchanted bed of snowwhite flowers that bloomed only in the dark dianora shook her head pushing the memory away and set off briskly down one of the smaller pebbly paths leading northeast through the trees after twenty strides she could no longer see the palace when she looked back overhead the birds were beginning to sing it was still cold she put up her hood feeling as she did so like the brownrobed priestess of some unknown sylvan god and thinking so she prayed to the god she did know and to morian and eanna that the triad might send her wisdom and the clear heart she had come out this ember morning to find she was intensely aware of what day this was at almost exactly the same moment alessan prince of tigana was riding out from castle borso in the certandan highland towards a meeting in the braccio pass that he thought might change the world dianora walked past a bed of anemones much too small and delicate yet to pick they were white which made them eannas the red ones were morians except in tregea where they were said to be stained by the blood of adaon on his mountain she stopped and looked down at the flowers their fragile petals shaken by the breeze but her thoughts were back with brandins fairy tale of the far away princess born under summer stars cradled on such flowers she closed her eyes then knowing that this would not do and slowly deliberately searching out pain as a spur a goad she built up a mental image of her father riding away and then of her mother and then of baerd among the soldiers in the square when she opened her eyes to go on there were no fairy tales in her heart the paths twisted hopelessly but the main cloud mass was to the north over the mountain and she kept that in front of her as best she could it was strange to be wandering like this almost lost among the trees and dianora realized with a start that it had been a great many years since shed last been so alone she had only two hours and a long way to go she quickened her pace a little later the sun came up on her right and the next time she looked up part of the sky was blue above her and gulls were wheeling against that blue she pushed back her hood and shook her long hair free and just then she saw the thick high grey stone of the northern wall through a screen of ohve trees vines and clumps of laren moss were growing along the wall purple and dark green the path ended at the olives forking east and west she stood a moment irresolute trying to orient herself within a memory of summer and torches at night then she shrugged and went west because her heart always did that ten minutes later winding past a pool and a ruffled reflection of white clouds within it dianora came to the gate she stopped suddenly cold again though the morning was warmer now with the sun she looked at the arched shape and the rusted iron hinges the gate was very old there seemed to have been something carved on it once but whatever image or symbol had been there was almost entirely worn away the gate was overgrown with ivy and vines the rose bush she remembered was bare yet on this first day of spring but the thorns were long and sharp she saw the heavy bolt as rusted as the hinges there was no lock but she was suddenly uncertain whether she would even be able to move the corroded bolt she wondered who had last gone through this gate into the meadows beyond who and when and why she thought about climbing and looked up the wall was ten feet high but she thought there might be hand and toeholds there she was about to move forward when she heard a sound behind her thinking about it afterwards she tried to understand why she hadnt been more frightened than she was somewhere in her mind she decided she must have thought that this might happen the grey rock on the mountainside had been only a starting point there was no reason in the world to expect that she might find that rock or find what she needed there she turned in the kings garden alone among the trees and the earliest flowers and saw the riselka combing her long green hair beside a pool they are only found when they want to be she remembered and then she had another thought and she looked quickly around to see if anyone else was there they were quite alone in the garden though or in this part of the garden the riselka smiled as if reading dianoras mind she was naked small and very slender but her hair was so long it almost served her as a robe her skin was as translucent as brandin had said it had been and the eyes were enormous almost frighteningly so pale as milk in the pale white face she looks like you brandin had said or no she reminded me of you was what hed said and in an eerie chilling fashion dianora had a sense of what he meant she had a memory of herself in the year tigana fell too thin and pale her eyes almost as huge as these in the hollows of her face brandin had never seen or known her then shivered the riselkas smile deepened there was nothing of warmth in her or comfort dianora didnt know if she had expected either of those she didnt really know what she had expected to find she had come for the clear path of the old foretelling verse and it seemed that if she was to find it it would be here among the intricately winding ways of the kings garden the riselka was beautiful heartbreakingly so in a fashion that had little to do with mortal beauty dianoras mouth was dry she didnt even try to speak she stood very still in her plain brown robe her owrx dark hair unbound and falling down her back and she watched the riselka lay a bonewhite comb down on the stone bench by the pool and motion to her slowly her hands beginning to tremble dianora walked off the path and under an arch of trees to stand before that pale elusive creature of legend she was so near she could see the green hair shine in the soft morning light the pale eyes had shadings to them and depth the riselka lifted one hand its fingers longer and more slender than any mortals could be and she brought it up to dianoras face and touched her the touch was cool but not so cold as she might have feared gently the riselka stroked her cheek and throat and then the hieratic alien smile deepening again she slipped her hand further down undid a button of dianoras robe and reached within to touch her breasts one and then the other not hurrying smiling that entirely secret smile all the while dianora was trembling she could not make herself stop incredulous and afraid she felt her body respond involuntarily to the exploration of that touch she could see the riselkas childlike breasts halfhidden beneath the curtain of hair her knees were weak suddenly the riselkas smile showed small sharp very white teeth dianora swallowed feeling a hurt inside her she could not even begin to understand she shook her head mutely unable to speak she felt herself beginning to weep the riselkas smile faded she withdrew her hand and almost apologetically it seemed did up the robe again she reached as gently as before and touched one of the tears on dianoras cheek then she brought her finger to her lips and tasted it she is a child dianora thought suddenly a thought cast up on the beach of her mind as if by a tide and even as it came to her she knew that this was true however many years this creature might have lived she wondered if this was the same slender numinous figure baerd had met under moonlight by the sea the night he went away the riselka touched and then tasted another tear her eyes were so large dianora had a sense that she could fall into them and never come out again it was a deeply seductive imagining a pathway to oblivion she looked for another moment and then slowly with an effort shook her head again please she said then whispered it needing and afraid of her need afraid that words or need or longing anything could drive a riselka away the greenhaired creature turned and dianoras hands clenched at her sides but the riselka looked back over her shoulder grave now unsmiling and dianora understood that she was to follow they came to the edge of the pool the riselka was looking down into the water and so dianora did the same she saw a reflection of blue sky overhead of a single white gull slicing across the space above the pool dark green cypresses like sentinels and the branches of other trees not yet in leaf and even as she looked she realized with a chill like winter come back too soon what was wrong the wind was blowing above them and all around she could hear it among the trees and feel it on her face and in her hair but the water of the pool was like the glass of her mirror absolutely calm unruffled by so much as a tendril of the breeze or any movement in its own depths dianora drew back from the edge and turned to the riselka the creature was looking at her the green hair lifted by the breeze and blown back from her small white face the eyes were darker now cloudy and she no longer looked like a child she looked like a power of the natural world or an emissary of such a power and not one with any warmth for mortal man or woman no kindness or shelter there but dianora fighting a rising fear reminded herself that she had not come here for shelter but for a signing of her road and she saw then that the riselka held a small white stone in her hand and she saw her throw that stone into the pool no ripples no movement at all the stone sank without a trace of its passage but the surface of the water changed soon after and darkened and then the reflections were gone no cypresses no morning circle of sky overhead no bare trees framing the slant of gulls the water had grown too dark it cast nothing back but dianora felt the riselka take her hand and draw her gently but inexorably back to the edge of the pool and she looked down having come out from the saishan to find this truth this signing and in the dark waters she saw a reflection not herself or the riselka nor anything at all of the kings garden on this first of the ember days instead an image of another season late spring or summer another place bright with color a great many people gathered and somehow she could even hear the sound of them in the image and beneath that sound constantly was the surge and sigh of waves and in the depths of the pool dianora saw an image of herself clad in a robe green as the riselkas hair moving alone between those gathered people and then she saw in the pool where her steps were leading her fear touched her in that moment with an icy hand for one second and then was gone she felt her racing heartbeat slow and then grow slower yet a deep calm came over her and a moment later not without its burden of sorrow came acceptance for years her nights had known dreams of such an ending this morning she had come out of the saishan looking for this certainty and now above this pool her path came clear to her at last and dianora saw that it led to the sea the sounds of gathered people faded away and then all the images the bright sun of summer the pool was dark again giving nothing back at all some time later it might have been moments or hours dianora looked up again the riselka was still beside her dianora looked into the pale eyes so much lighter than the enchanted waters but seemingly as deep and she saw herself as a child again so many years ago yet not so many a blink of an eye or the moment it took an autumn leaf to fall as this creature would measure time thank you she whispered and i understand and she stood very still not flinching at all as the riselka rose up on tiptoe and kissed her soft as the wing of a butterfly upon the lips there was no hint of desire this time in the giving or receiving this was the aftermath the consummation had come and gone the riselkas mouth tasted of salt the salt dianora knew of her own tears she no longer felt any fear at all only a quiet sadness like a smooth stone in the heart she heard a ripple of sound and turned back to the pool the cypresses were reflected again their images ruffled and broken now by the movement of the water in the wind when she looked away again pushing her hair back from her face she saw that she was alone when she came back out to the open space before the palace doors deymon was waiting for her dressed formally in grey his seal of office about his neck he was sitting on one of the stone benches his staff resting beside him scelto hovered by the doors and dianora saw the flash of relief he could not hide when she came out from among the trees she stopped and looked at the chancellor allowing a slight smile to show on her face it was artifice of course but an act she could do unconsciously by now in deymons normally inscrutable expression she read edginess and anger and other signs of what had happened yesterday he would probably be spoiling for a fight she guessed it was difficult amazingly difficult to switch back to the manners and affairs of state it was also something that had to be done you were late she said mildly walking towards him he had risen with perfect courtesy as she approached i went walking in the garden there are anemones beginning already i was precisely on time deymon said she might once have been intimidated but not now he would be wearing the seal as an attempt to reinforce his authority but she knew how badly yesterday would have unsettled him she was fairly certain he would have offered to kill himself last night he was a man for whom the old traditions mattered in any case she was armored against him she had seen a riselka this morning then i must have been early she said carelessly forgive me it is good to see you looking so well after yesterdays confusions have you been waiting long long enough you wanted to talk about yesterday i gather what is it dianora didnt think she had ever heard an inconsequential remark from deymon let alone a pleasantry refusing to be rushed she sat down on the bench he had just vacated and brushed her brown robe smooth over her knees she clasped her fingers in her lap and looked up letting her expression grow suddenly as cold as his own he almost died yesterday she said flatly deciding only in that moment what her tack would be he would have died do you know why chancellor she didnt wait for his answer the king almost died because your people were too complacent or too slovenly to bother searching a party of ygrathens what did you think that danger could only come from the palm i expect yesterdays guards to be dealt with deymon and soon the use of his name and not his title was deliberate he opened his mouth and closed it visibly biting back a swift retort she was pushing things triad knew how hard she was pushing with this but if ever there was going to be a chance for her to do so this would be it deymons face was white with anger and shock he took a deep breath to control himself they have been dealt with already he said they are dead she hadnt expected that she managed with an effort to keep her discomfiture out of her eyes there is more she went on pressing her advantage i want to know why camena di chiara was not watched when he went to ygrath last year he was watched what would you have had us do you know who was behind yesterdays attack you heard we all heard why did you not know about isolla and the queen this time the bite she put into the words was real not merely tactical for the first time she saw a flicker of hesitation in his eyes he fingered his seal then seemed to become aware that he was doing so and dropped his hand to his side there was a brief silence i did know he said finally his eyes met her own a question in them like an angry challenge i see said dianora a moment later and looked away the sun was higher now slanting across most of the clearing if she moved a little along the bench its warmth would fall upon her the harsh unspoken question in deymons eyes hung in the air would you have told the king knowing these things about his queen dianora was silent tracking implications to their endings with this admission she realized deymon was hers if he hadnt already been so after his failure yesterday and what she had done to save the king she was also she thought in fairly immediate danger as a consequence the chancellor was not a man to be treated lightly ever most of the saishan had their suspicions as to how chloese di chiara had died ten years ago and why she looked up and let her rising anger keep the anxiety from showing wonderful she said acidly such efficient security and now of course because of what i was forced to do your pet courtier neso simply has to receive the posting in asoli doesnt he with a wound of honor earned saving the life of the king how marvelously clever of you deymon she had miscalculated for the first time he smiled a narrow mirthless expression is that what this is about he asked softly she bit back a swift denial it was not inconvenient for him to think so she realized among other things she admitted as if grudgingly i want to know why you have been favoring him for the asoli posting i had been meaning to talk to you about this i thought as much he said a measure of his usual complacency returning i have also been keeping track of some not all i have no doubt of the gifts scelto has been receiving in your name these past weeks that was a splendid necklace yesterday by the way did nesos money pay for it in an attempt to have you win me over to his side he was immensely wellinformed and he was shrewd she had always known these things it was never wise to underestimate the chancellor it helped pay for it she said briefly you havent answered my question why do you favor him you must know what sort of man he is of course i know deymon replied impatiently why do you think i want him out of here i want him posted to asoli because i dont trust him at court i want him away from the king and in a place where he can be killed without undue inconvenience i trust that answers your question she swallowed never ever underestimate him she told herself again it does she said killed by whom that should be obvious it will be put about that the asolini did it themselves i expect it will not take neso long to give them cause of course and then and then the king will investigate and find that neso was guilty of gross corruption which we need not doubt he will be we execute some man or other for the murder but the king declares his firm renunciation of nesos methods and greed he appoints a new taxing master and promises fairer measures in the future i think that should quiet affairs in north asoli for a time good said dianora trying to ignore the casual indifference of that some man or other and very tidy i have only one thing to add the new officer will be rhamanus she was taking another risk she knew when it came down to bedrock she was a captive and a concubine and he was the chancellor of ygrath and of the western palm on the other hand there were other ways to measure the balance here and she fought to focus on those deymon looked coolly down at her she kept her gaze on his her eyes wide and disingenuous it has long amused me he said at length that you so favored the man who captured you one would think you hadnt minded that you wanted to come perilously uncannily near to the mark but she could see he was baiting her not serious in his thrust she forced herself to relax and smiled how could i mind being here id never have had a chance at pleasant meetings such as this and in any case she let her tone change i do favor him yes on behalf of the people of this peninsula i do and you know that that will always be my concern chancellor he is a decent man there are not many such ygrathens im afraid he was silent a moment then there are more than you think but before she could manage to interpret either his words or the surprising voice in which they were spoken he added i seriously thought of having you poisoned last night either that or suggesting you be freed and made a citizen of ygrath what extremes my dear she could feel herself growing cold though didnt you teach us all that balance is everything i did he said soberly not rising to her bait he never did have you any idea what youve done to the equilibrium at this court what she said with real asperity would you have preferred me to do yesterday that is not at all the point obviously there was a rare spot of color in his cheeks when he resumed though it was in his usual tones i was thinking of rhamanus for asoli myself it shall be as you suggest in the meantime i very nearly forgot to mention that the king has sent for you i intercepted the message before it reached the saishan he will be waiting in the library she shot to her feet as agitated as he must have known she would be how long ago she asked quickly not very why you dont seem to mind being late there are anemones in the garden you could tell him that i could tell him some other things as well deymon anger almost choked her she fought for control and so could i and so i suppose could solores we seldom do do we the balance as you have just pointed out is everything that is why i should still be very careful dianora despite what happened yesterday the balance is all do not forget it she tried to think of a response a last word but failed her mind was whirling he had spoken of killing her of freeing her had agreed with her choice for asoli and then threatened her again all in a span of minutes and all the while the king had been waiting for her and deymon had known she turned abruptly and dismally conscious of her nondescript robe and the fact that she had no time to go back up to the saishan and change she could feel herself flushing with anger and anxiety scelto had evidently overheard the chancellors last remarks his eyes above the broken nose were vividly concerned and apologetic though with deymon intercepting the message there was nothing he could have done she stopped by the palace doors and looked back the chancellor stood alone in the garden leaning upon his stick a tall gray thin figure against the bare trees the sky above him had turned overcast again of course it has dianora thought spitefully then she remembered the pool and her mood changed what did these court maneuvers matter in the end deymon was only doing what he had to do and so now would she she had seen her path she found herself able to smile letting that inner quiet descend upon her again though with a stone of sorrow at its center still she sank low in a very formal curtsey deymon taken aback sketched an awkward bow dianora turned and went through the doors that scelto was holding for her she went back down the corridor and up the stairs along a northsouth hallway and past two heavy doors she stopped in front of the third pair of doors out of reflex and habit more than anything else she checked her reflection in the bronze shield that hung on the wall she adjusted her robe and pushed both hands through her hopelessly windblown hair then she knocked on the library doors and entered holding hard to her calm and the vision of the pool a round stone of knowledge and sorrow in her heart that she hoped would anchor it in her breast and keep it from flying away brandin was standing with his back to the door looking at a very old map of the then known world that hung above the larger of the fires he did not turn she looked up at the map on it the peninsula of the palm and even the larger land mass of quileia beyond the mountains running all the way south to the ice were dwarfed by the size of barbadior and its empire to the east and by ygrath to the west overseas the velvet window curtains of the library were drawn against the morning light and a fire was blazing which bothered her she found it difficult to deal with flames on an ember day brandin held a fireiron in one hand he was dressed as carelessly as she in black riding clothes and boots his boots were muddy he must have been out riding very early she put the encounter with deymon behind her but not the riselka in the garden this man was the center of her life whatever else had changed that had not but the riselkas vision had offered her a path and brandin had let her lie alone and awake all last night she said forgive me my lord i was with the chancellor this morning and he chose to only just now tell me you were waiting here why were you meeting with him the nuanced familiar voice was only mildly interested he seemed engrossed in the map she did not lie to the king the taxing master question in asoli i wanted to know why he favored neso there was a faint hint of amusement in his voice im sure deymon told you something plausible he turned finally and gazed at her for the first time he looked exactly the same as he always did and she knew what always happened when their glances first met but she had seen a riselka an hour ago and something seemed to have changed her calm did not leave her her heart stayed home she closed her eyes for an instant but more to acknowledge the meaning of that change and the passing of a long truth than anything else she felt that she would weep for many reasons if she were not extremely careful now brandin sank into a chair by the fire he looked tired as much as anything it showed only in small ways but she had known him a long time i will have to give it to neso now he said i think you know that im sorry some things it seemed had not changed always that grave unexpected courtesy when he spoke to her of such things what need had the king of ygrath to apologize to her for choosing one of his courtiers over another she moved into the room clinging to her resolution and at his gesture she took the chair opposite his brandins eyes rested on her with an odd almost a detached scrutiny she wondered what he would see she heard a sound from the far end of the room and glancing over saw rhun sitting by the second fire aimlessly leafing through a picturebook his presence reminded her of something and she felt her anger suddenly come back of course you have to offer it to neso she said asoli is his prize for gallantry in the service of his king he scarcely responded briefly his mouth quirked his expression mildly ironic he still seemed preoccupied though only half attending to what she said gallantry courage theyll call it something of that sort he said absently not getting out of the way in time it really was deymon was already arranging last night to have word spread that it was neso who saved my life she would not rise to that she refused she didnt even understand why he was saying this to her she said instead looking across the room at rhun not at the king that makes sense and you must surely know that i dont care what i do not understand is why you are putting out lies about camenas fate she took a breath and then plunged ahead i know the truth it is such an ugly vicious thing to do if you must prepare a fool to follow rhun why mar a whole man and a healthy one why do such a thing he did not answer for a long time and she was afraid to look at him rhun too far away to hear and nonetheless stopped leafing through his book and was looking over at them as it happens there are precedents was what brandin said at length his tone still mild but then a moment later he added i should probably have taken scelto away from you a long time ago you both learn too much too quickly she opened her mouth but no words came out what could she say she had asked for this for exactly this but then glancing out of the corner of her eye she saw that brandin was smiling an odd smile and there was something strange about his eyes as he looked at her he said as it also happens scelto would have been right this morning but his tidings are wrong by now what do you mean she felt the stirrings of a genuine uneasiness there was a strangeness to his manner this morning that she could not lay a finger on it was more than tiredness though she knew that much i rescinded yesterdays orders after my ride brandin said quietly camena is probably dead by now an easy death exactly as word has been put about she discovered that her hands were clutching each other in her lap she said fatuously without thinking is this true he only raised his eyebrows but she felt herself flush deep red i have no need to deceive you dianora i told them to arrange for witnesses among the chiarans so there would be no doubt what would confirm it for you shall i have his head sent to your rooms she looked down again thinking of isollas head bursting like a smashed fruit she swallowed he had done that with a gesture of his hand she looked back at the king mutely she shook her head what happened on that ride what was happening here then abruptly she remembered what else had occurred to him yesterday on the mountainside at a place where a grey rock stood beside the runners track one man sees a riselka his path forks there brandin turned back towards the fire one leg crossed over the other he laid the point of the iron down on the hearthstone leaning it against his chair you havent asked me why i changed the orders thats unlike you dianora im afraid to she said truthfully he glanced over at that his dark brows level now the gray eyes intimidating with their intelligence thats unlike you as well you arent very like yourself either this morning fair enough he said quietly he looked at her for a moment in silence then seemed to consider something else tell me did deymon make things difficult for you just now did he warn you or threaten it wasnt sorcery she told herself fiercely not mindreading it was only brandin being what he was aware of all the nuances that affected those in their orbits around him not directly she said awkwardly once she might have seen this as an opportunity but the mood this morning was so strange he was upset about yesterday afraid i think of balances shifting here at the court once word is safely out that it was neso who saved your life i think the chancellor will be easier it wont be a difficult story for him to spread things happened very fast i doubt anyone saw it clearly this time brandins smile as he listened was one she knew and cherished equal to equal their minds sharing the track of a complex thought but when she finished his expression changed i did he said i saw it clearly she looked away and down again at her hands in her lap your path is clear now she told herself as sternly as she could remember that she had been offered a vision of herself in green beside the sea and her heart was her own now after last night there was a stone holding it there safe within her breast brandin said it would be easy to tell the neso story i agree but i did a great deal of thinking last night and then on my ride this morning ill be talking to deymon later today after we watch the runners come home the tale that goes around will be the true one dianora she wasnt sure she had heard him rightly and then she was sure and something seemed to reach a brim and then spill over a little like an overflowing wineglass inside her you should go riding more often she mumbled he heard he laughed softly but she didnt look up she had a very strong sense that she couldnt afford to look up why she asked intent on her interlocked fingers why to both things then camenas fate and now this he was silent so long that eventually she did glance up cautiously he had turned back to the fire though and was prodding it with the iron on the far side of the room rhun had closed his book and was now standing beside his table looking over at the two of them he was dressed in black of course exactly like the king did i ever tell you said brandin of ygrath very softly the legend my nurse used to tell me as a child about finavir her mouth was dry again something in his tone the way he was sitting the discontinuity of his reply no she said she tried to think of something witty to add but failed finavir or finvair he went on not really waiting for her response not looking over at her when i grew older and looked in the books of such tales it was written either way and hi one or two other fashions sometimes that often happens with the stories that come from before the days when we wrote things down he leaned the iron against the chair arm again and sat back still gazing into the flames rhun had walked a little nearer to them as if drawn by the story he was leaning against one of the heavy window draperies now kneading a bunched fold of it in both hands brandin said in ygrath the tale is sometimes told and sometimes believed that this world of ours both here in the southern lands and north beyond the deserts and the rain forests whatever lies there is but one of many worlds the gods sent into time the others are said to be far off scattered among the stars invisible to us there has been such a belief here as well dianora said quietly when he paused in certando in the highlands they once had a teaching that was much the same though the priests of the triad burned people for saying as much it was true there had been mass burnings for the carlozzini heresy in the plague years long ago brandin said we never burned or wheeled people for that thought they were laughed at sometimes but that is another thing what my nurse used to tell me was what her mother told her and her mothers mother before i have no doubt that some of us are born over and again into various of these worlds until at the last if we have earned it by the manner of our lives we are born a final time into finavir or finvair which is the nearest of all the worlds to where the true gods dwell and after that she asked his quiet words seemed to have become a part of the unfolding spell of this day after no one knew or would tell me nor did any of the parchments and books i read when i grew older he shifted in his seat his beautiful hands resting on the carved arms of the chair i never liked my nurses legend of finavir there are other kinds of stories some of them quite different and many of them i loved but for some reason that one stayed with me it bothered me it seemed to make our lives here merely a prelude inconsequential in themselves of importance only for where they would lead us next i have always needed to feel that what i am doing matters here and now i think i would agree with you she said her own hands were gentle in her lap now he had shaped a different mood but why are you telling me this if you have never liked the story the simplest of questions and brandin said because during the nights this past year and more i have had recurring dreams of being reborn far away from all of this in finavir he looked straight at her then for the first time since beginning the tale and his grey eyes were calm and his voice was steady as he said and in all of those dreams you have been at my side and nothing has held us apart and no one has come between she had had no warning none at all though perhaps the clues had been there all along and she too blind to see and suddenly she was blind now helpless tears of shock and wonder overflowing in her eyes and a desperate urgent hammering that she knew to be her heart brandin said dianora i needed you so much last night i frightened myself i did not send for you only because i had to somehow try to come to terms with what happened to me when you blocked camenas arrow solores was a court deception no more than that so they might not think me unmanned by danger i spent the whole night pacing or at my desk trying to riddle out where my life has now come what it means that my wife and only living son should try to kill me and fail only because of you and thinking about that consumed by it i only realized near dawn that i had left you alone all night my dear will you ever forgive me for that i want time to stop she was thinking wiping vainly at her tears trying to see him clearly i want never to leave this room i want to hear these words spoken over and over endlessly until i die i made a decision on my ride he said i was thinking about what isolla had said and i was finally able to accept that she was right since i will not since i cannot possibly change what i am committed to doing here i must be prepared to pay all of the price myself not through others in ygrath she was shaking quite unable to stop her tears he had not touched her or even moved towards her behind him rhuns face was a twisted mask of pain and need and something else the thing she sometimes saw there and could not face she closed her eyes what will you do she whispered it was hard to speak and then he told her all of it named for her the fork in the road he had chosen she listened her tears falling more slowly now welling up from an overfull heart and at length she came to understand that the wheel was coming full circle listening to brandins grave voice over the crackle of flames on an ember day dianora saw only images of water in her mind the dark waters of the pool in the garden and the vision of the sea shed been given there and though she had no gift of foreknowing she could see where his words were taking them taking them all and now she understood the showing of the pool she searched her heart and knew with an enormous grief that it was his it had not come back to her after all yet even so and most terribly of all she knew what was about to come what she was going to do she had dreamt on other nights alone through her years in the saishan of finding a path like the one that was opening for her now with the words he spoke at one point listening to him thinking thus she could bear the physical distance between them no longer she moved from her chair to the carpet at his feet and laid her head in his lap he touched her hair and began stroking it down and down ceaselessly as he spoke of what had come to him in the night and on his ride spoke of being willing finally to accept the price of what he was doing here in the palm and spoke to her about the one thing she could never have made herself ready for about love she wept quietly she could not stop weeping as his words continued to flow as the fire slowly died on the hearth she wept for love of him and for her family and her home for the innocence she had lost to the years and for all that he had lost and she wept most bitterly of all for the betrayals yet to come all the betrayals that lay waiting outside this room where time which would not stop was going to carry them chapter ride alessan cried pointing towards a gap in the hills theres a village beyond devin swore lowered his head over his horses neck and dug his heels into the animals flanks following erlein di senzio west towards the gap and the low red disk of the sun behind him thundering out of the brown twilight hills were at least eight possibly a dozen brigands of the highlands devin hadnt looked back after their first startled glimpse of the outlaws and the shouted command to halt he didnt think they had a chance however close this village might be they had been riding at a bonejarring pace for hours and the horses alienor had given them were tired if this was to be a flatout race against freshmounted outlaws they were probably dead he gritted his teeth and rode ignoring the ache in his leg and the sting of reopened cuts from his leap in the mountains earlier that day the wind whistled past him as they rode he saw alessan turn in his saddle an arrow notched to his fully drawn bow the prince fired backwards once and then again into the twilight his muscles ridged and corded with the effort an improbable desperate attempt at such speed in the wind two men screamed devin quickly looked back and saw one of them fall a handful of erratic arrows dropped well short of the three of them theyve slowed erlein rasped glancing back as well how far to this village through the gap and twenty minutes beyond ride alessan did not shoot again bending low to urge more speed from his own grey they fled into the wind along the track of the sun between the shadowy bulk of two heathery hills and into the gap between they didnt get out just where the path bent to follow the curve of the encroaching ridges eight riders were waiting in a line across the gap bows calmly leveled at the three of them they pulled their horses to rearing halts devin flung a glance back over his shoulder and saw the pursuing outlaws entering the pass behind them there was one riderless horse and another man clutched at his shoulder where an arrow was still embedded he looked at alessan saw the desperate defiant look in the princes eye dont be a fool erlein snapped you cant run through and you cant kill this many men i can try alessan said his eyes darting across the defile and up the steep hills on either side wild to find a way out he had stopped his horse though and did not raise the bow straight into a trap what a splendid ending to two decades of dreaming his voice was corrosively bitter raw with selflaceration it was true though devin realized rather too late this pass between the hills was a natural place for an ambush and the triad knew there were enough outlaws hi the wilds of southern certando where even the barbadian mercenaries seldom went and honest men were never abroad this close to the fall of night on the other hand they hadnt had much choice given how far they had to go and how fast it didnt seem as if they were going to get there or anywhere there was still enough light to make out the outlaws and their appearance did not reassure their clothing might be random and carelessly worn but the horses were far from the beatendown creatures most brigands rode the men in front of them looked disciplined and the weaponry leveled at the three of them was formidable this had also been very clearly a carefully laid trap one man rode a few paces forward from the silent line release your bows he said with easy authority i dont like talking with armed men neither do i alessan replied grimly staring at the man but a moment later he let his bow fall to the ground beside devin erlein did the same and the boy the outlaw leader said still softly he was a big man of middle years with a large face and a full beard that showed deep red in the waning light he wore a dark widebrimmed hat that hid his eyes i dont carry a bow devin said shortly letting fall his sword there was mocking laughter at that from the men in front of them magian why were your men in arrow range the bearded man said more loudly now he himself had not laughed you knew my instructions you know how we do this i didnt think we were came an angry voice behind them amid a clattering of hooves their pursuers had come up the trap was closed before and behind he fired a long way in halflight and wind he was lucky ducas he wouldnt have had a chance to be lucky if you had done your job properly wheres abhar took an arrow in the thigh and fell torres gone back to bring him waste the redbearded man scowled i dont like waste he was a dark bulky presence silhouetted against the low sun behind him the other seven riders kept their bows leveled alessan said if waste offends you you wont like this evenings work at all we have nothing to give you beyond our weapons or our lives if you are the sort who kill for pleasure sometimes the man named ducas said not raising his voice he sounded unsettlingly calm devin thought and very much in control of his band will my two men die do you use poisoned arrows alessans expression was contemptuous not even against the barbadians why do you sometimes the outlaw leader said again especially against the barbadians these are the highlands after all he smiled for the first time a cold wolfish grin devin had a sudden sense that he wouldnt want to have this mans memories or his dreams alessan said nothing it was growing darker in the pass devin saw him glance over at erlein a sharp query in his face the wizard shook his head a minute almost invisible gesture too many he whispered and besides the greyhaired one is a wizard came an emphatic voice from the line beyond ducas a chunky roundfaced man moved his horse forward beside the leaders dont even think of it he continued looking straight at erlein i could block anything you tried startled devin glanced at the mans hands but at this distance it was too dark for him to see if two fingers were missing they would have to be though they had come upon another wizard much good it would do them and precisely how long do you think it would take a tracker to find you then erlein was saying his voice silken with the backspill of magic from the both of us leading to this place there are a sufficiency of arrows trained on your heart and throat the leader interjected to ensure that such an event would not happen but i confess this grows more interesting every moment an archer and a wizard riding abroad on an ember day arent you afraid of the dead what does the boy do im a singer devin said grimly devin dasoli lately from the company of menico di ferraut if that means anything to you the thing obviously was to keep the talk going somehow and he had heard stories wishful thinking on the road perhaps of outlaw bands sparing musicians in exchange for a night of song something occurred to him you thought we were barbadians didnt you from a distance thats why you laid the trap a singer a clever singer ducas murmured if not clever enough to stay indoors on an ember day of course we thought you were barbadians who in the eastern peninsula but barbadians and outlaws would be abroad today and all of the outlaws for twenty miles around are part of my band there are outlaws and outlaws alessan said softly but if you were hunting barbadian mercenaries you are men with the same hearts as ours i can tell you and i do not lie ducas that if you hinder us here or kill us you will be giving such comfort to barbadior and to ygrath as they could not have ever dreamt of asking of you there was not surprisingly a silence the cold wind knifed into the pass stirring the young grasses in the growing dark you have a rather large opinion of yourself it appears ducas said at length thoughtfully perhaps i should know why i think it is time for you to tell me exactly who you are and where you are riding at dusk on an ember day and i will draw my own conclusions my name is alessan i am riding west my mother is dying and has summoned me to her side how devoted of you ducas said but one name tells me nothing and west is a big place my friend with the bow who are you and where are you riding the voice was an uncoiled whip this time devin jumped behind ducas seven bowstrings were drawn back devin his heart pounding saw alessan hesitate the sun was almost gone now a red disk cut in half by the horizon beyond the pass the wind seemed to be blowing harder promising a chilly night to come after this first day of spring there was a chill in devin as well he glanced at erlein and discovered that the wizard was staring at him as if waiting alessan had not yet spoken ducas shifted meaningfully in his saddle devin swallowed and knowing that however hard this was for him it had to be easier than it would be for alessan he said tigana he is from tigana and so am i he was careful to look straight at the outlaw wizard as he spoke not at ducas or the other riders he saw out of the corner of his eye that alessan was doing the same thing so as not to have to see the blank look of incomprehension they both knew would follow the wizard would be different wizards could hear the name a murmur rose from the gathered men before them and behind and then one man spoke aloud amid the shadows of falling dusk in that lonely place a voice from the line behind them by the blood of the god that voice cried from the heart devin wheeled around a man had dismounted and was striding quickly forward to stand in front of them devin saw that the man was small not much bigger than himself perhaps thirty years old or a little more and that he was moving awkwardly and clearly in pain with alessans arrow in his arm ducas was looking at his wizard sertino what is this he said with an edge in his voice i do not sorcery the wizard said bluntly what his ducas nodded towards erlein no not his it was the wounded man who spoke his eyes never leaving alessans face not this poor wizards it is real sorcery this it is the power of brandin of ygrath that keeps you from hearing the name with an angry motion ducas swept his hat off revealing a balding dome with a fringe of bright red hair and you naddo how do you hear it then the man on the ground swayed unsteadily on his feet before replying because i was born there too and so im immune to the spell or another victim of it whichever you prefer devin heard the tautness in his voice as of someone holding hard to his selfcontrol he heard the man called naddo say looking up at alessan you have been asked for your name and you only gave him a part will you tell us the rest will you tell me it was hard to see his eyes now but his voice told an old story alessan was sitting on his horse with an easiness even after a day in the saddle that seemed to deny even the possibility of weariness or the tension of where they were but then his right hand came up and pushed once unconsciously through his already tangled hair and devin seeing the familiar gesture knew that whatever he himself was feeling now it was doubled and redoubled in the man he followed and then in the stillness of that pass with the only other sounds the whistle of wind between the hills and the stirring of the horses on the young grass he heard my name is alessan di tigana bar valentin if you are as old as you appear to be naddo di tigana you will know who i am with a prickling of hairs on his neck and a shiver he could not control devin saw naddo drop to his knees on the cold ground even before the last words were spoken oh my prince the wounded man cried in a raw voice and covering his face with his one good hand he wept prince said ducas very softly there was a restive movement among the outlaws sertino you will explain this to me sertino the wizard looked from alessan to erlein and then down at the weeping man a curious almost a frightened expression crossed his pale round face he said they are from lower corte it had a different name before brandin of ygrath came he has used his sorcery to take that name away only people born there and wizards because of our own magic can hear the true name that is what is happening here and prince naddo called him that sertino was silent he looked over at erlein and there was still that odd uneasy look on his face he said is it true and erlein di senzio with an ironic halfsmile replied just dont let him cut your hair brother unless you like being bound into slavery sertinos mouth fell open ducas slapped his knee with his hat now that he snapped i do not understand at all there is too much of this i do not understand i want explanations from all of you his voice was harsh much louder than before he did not look at alessan though i understand it well enough ducas came a voice from behind them it was magian the captain of the group that had driven them into the gap he moved his horse forward as they turned to look at him i understand that we have made our fortunes tonight if this is the prince of a province brandin hates then all we need do is take him west to fort forese across the border and turn him over to the ygrathens there with a wizard to boot and who knows one of them probably likes boys in his bed too singing boys his smile was a wide loose thing in the shadows he said there will be rewards land perhaps even he said nothing more than that ever in rigid disbelief devin saw magians mouth fall open and his eyes grow briefly wide then the man slid slowly sideways off his horse to fall with a clatter of sword and bow on the ground beside erlein there was a longhandled dagger in his back one of the outlaws from the line behind him not hurrying at all dismounted and pulled the dagger free he wiped it carefully clean on the dead mans surcoat before sheathing it again at his belt not a good idea magians he said quietly straightening to look at ducas not a good idea at all we arent informers here and we dont serve the tyrants ducas slapped his hat back on his head visibly fighting for control he took a deep breath as it happens i agree but as it also happens arkin we have a rule here about weapons drawn against each other arkin was very tall almost gaunt and his long face was white devin saw even among the shadows of dusk he said i know that ducas it is wasteful i know you will have to forgive me ducas said nothing for a long time neither did anyone else devin looking past the dead man saw the two wizards gazing fixedly at each other in the shadows arkin was still looking at ducas who finally broke the silence you are fortunate that i agree with you he said arkin shook his head we would not have stayed together this long otherwise alessan neatly dismounted from his horse he walked over towards ducas ignoring the arrows still trained on him if you are hunting barbadians he said quietly i have some idea as to why i am doing the same thing in my own way he hesitated you can do as your dead man suggested turn me in to ygrath and yes i suspect there would be a reward or you can kill us here and have done with us you can also let us go our own way from this place but there is one other quite different thing you can do which is ducas seemed to have regained his selfcontrol his voice was calm again as it had been at the beginning join me in what i seek to do which is to drive both tyrants from the palm before this summer is out naddo looked up suddenly a brightness in his face really my lord we can do this even now there is a chance alessan said especially now for the first time there is a chance he looked back at ducas where were you born in tregea the other man said after a pause in the mountains devin had a moment to think about how completely things had shifted here that alessan should be asking the questions now he felt a stirring within him of hope renewed and of pride the prince was nodding his head i thought it might be so i have heard the stories of a redheaded captain ducas who was one of the leaders at borifort in tregea during the barbadian siege there they never found him after the fort fell he hesitated i could not help but notice the color of your hair for a moment the two men were motionless as in a tableau one on the ground the other on his horse then quite suddenly ducas di tregea smiled what is left of my hair he murmured wryly sweeping off his hat again with a wide gesture releasing his reins he swung down off his horse and striding forward held out an open palm to alessan who met both the smile and offered hand with his own devin found himself gasping with the rush of relief that swept over him and then cheering wildly at the top of his voice with twenty outlaws in that dark certandan pass what he noticed though even as the cheering reached a crescendo was that neither wizard was shouting erlein and sertino sat very still almost rigid on their horses as if concentrating on something they gazed at each other expressions identically grim and because he noticed because he seemed to be becoming the sort of man who saw things like this devin was the first to fall silent and he had even instinctively raised a hand to quiet the others alessan and ducas lowered their linked palms and gradually as silence returned to the pass everyone looked at the wizards what is it ducas said sertino turned to him tracker northeast of us quite close i just felt the probe hell not find me though ive done no magic for a long time i have said erlein di senzio earlier today in the braccio pass only a light spell a screen for someone evidently it was enough there must have been a tracker in one of the southern forts there almost always is sertino said flatly what ducas said were you doing in the braccio pass gathering flowers alessan said ill tell you later right now we have barbadians to deal with how many will be with the tracker not less than twenty probably more we have a camp in the hills south of here shall we run for it theyll follow erlein said hes got me traced the spill of my magic will mark me for another day at least i dont much feel like hiding in any case alessan said softly devin turned quickly to look at him so did ducas awkwardly naddo rose to his feet how good exactly are your men here alessan said a challenge in his tone and in the grey eyes and in the shadows of what was now almost fulldark devin saw the tregean outlaw leaders teeth suddenly flash they are good enough and to spare to deal with a score of barbadians this will be more than weve ever tackled but weve never fought beside a prince before i think he added in a meditative voice that i too am grown tired of hiding suddenly devin looked over at the wizards it was hard to make out their features in the dark but erlein said in a hardedged voice alessan the tracker will have to be killed immediately or hell send an image of this place back to alberico he will be said alessan quietly and in his voice too there was a new note the presence of something devin had never heard a second later he realized that it was death alessans cloak flapped in a gust of wind very deliberately he drew his hood over his face the hard thing for devin was that albericos tracker turned out to be twelve years old they sent erlein riding west out of the pass as the lure he was the one being followed he had sertino di certando the other wizard and two other men with them one of whom was the wounded naddo who insisted on being of use even though he could not fight they had taken the arrow from his arm and bandaged it as best they could it was clear that he was in difficulty but even more clear that in the presence of alessan he was not about to give way to that a short while later under the stars and the low eastward crescent of vidomni the barbadians entered the pass there were twentyfive of them and the tracker six carried torches which made things easier though not for them alessans arrow and ducass met in the trackers breast fired from slopes on opposite sides of the defile eleven of the mercenaries fell under that first rain of arrows before devin found himself galloping furiously down with alessan and half a dozen other men out of their concealment in hollows in the pass they angled to close the western exit even as ducas and nine men sealed off the eastern end the barbadians had entered from and so on that ember night in the company of outlaws in the highlands of certando far from his lost home alessan bar valentin prince of tigana fought the first true battle of his long war of return after the drawnout years of maneuvering a subtle gathering of intelligence and the delicate guiding of events he drew blade against the forces of a tyrant in that moonlit pass no subterfuge no hidden manipulation anymore from the wings of the stage this was battle for the time had come marius of quileia had made a promise to him that day against wisdom and experience and beyond hope and with mariuss promise everything had changed the waiting was over he could loosen the rigid bonds that had held his heart so tightly leashed all these years tonight in this pass he could kill in memory of his father and his brothers and all the dead of the river deisa and after in that year when he himself had not been permitted to die they had spirited him away and hidden him in quileia south of the mountains with marius then a captain of the high priestesss guard a man with his own reasons for fostering and concealing a young prince from the northlands that had been almost nineteen years ago when the hiding had begun he was tired of hiding the time of running was over now the season of war had begun true it was barbadior not ygrath whose soldiers drew blade against them now but in the end it was all the same both tyrants were the same he had been saying that for all the years since hed come back north to the peninsula with baerd it was a truth hammered into shape like metal on the hard forge of his heart they had to take them both or be no nearer freedom than before and in the braccio pass this morning the taking had begun the keystone had been set in the arch of his design and so tonight in this dark defile he could unbind his pentup passion his own long memories of loss and set his sword arm free devin laboring to keep up with the prince rode into his first combat with raw panic and exhilaration vying for mastery in his breast he did not shout as most of the outlaws did he was concentrating as much as anything else on ignoring the ache in his wounded leg he gripped the dark sword baerd had bought for him holding it with the blade curving upwards as he had been taught in wintry morning lessons that seemed unimaginably remote from this nights happenings he saw alessan drive straight into the circled ranks of the mercenaries unswerving as one of his arrows as if to put behind him in this one act of direct response all the years when such a thing was not allowed frantically gritting his teeth devin followed in alessans wake he was alone though and half a dozen lengths behind when a yellowbearded barbadian loomed up beside him enormous on his horse devin cried out in shock only some blind survival instinct and the reflexes he had been born with saved his life he pulled his horse hard to the left veering for a space he saw and then leaning back to his right as low to the ground as he could manage he cut upwards with all his strength he felt a searing pain in his wounded leg and almost fell the windrush of the barbadians blade sliced empty air where devins head had been a heartbeat later devin felt his own wickedly curved sword cleave through leathery armor and into flesh the barbadian screamed a liquid bubbling sound he swayed wildly on his mount as his sword fell from his grasp he brought one hand to his mouth in a curiously childlike gesture then like the slow toppling of a mountain tree he slid sideways in his saddle and crashed to the ground devin had already pulled his sword free wheeling his horse in a tight circle he looked for adversaries no one was coming though alessan and the others were ahead of him pounding against the mercenaries driving to meet ducas and arkins group pressing forward from the east it was almost over devin realized there was nothing really for him to do with a complex mixture of emotions that he didnt even try to understand just then he watched the princes blade rise and fall three times and he saw three barbadians die one by one the six torches dropped to the ground and were extinguished and then only moments after they had ridden into the pass it seemed to devin the last of the barbadians had been cut down and slain it was then that he saw what was left of the tracker and realized how young he had been the body had been hideously trampled in the melee it lay twisted and splayed unnaturally somehow the face had been spared though for devin looking down that was actually the worst thing the two arrows were still embedded in the childs body though the upper shaft of one of them had been broken off devin turned away he stroked the horse alienor had given him and whispered to it then he forced himself to ride back towards the man hed killed this was not the same as the sleeping soldier in the nievolene barn it was not he told himself this had been open warfare and the barbadian had been armed and armored and he had swung his massive blade seeking devins life had the barbadians and the tracker come upon him and alessan and erlein alone in the wilderness devin had no illusions none at all as to what their fate would have been it was not the same as in the barn he said it within himself once again as he gradually became aware of the eerie disorienting calm that seemed to have descended upon the pass the wind still blew as cold as before he glanced up and realized belatedly that alessan had quietly ridden to his side and was also looking down at the man devin had slain both horses stamped and snorted made restless by the frenzy just past and the smell of blood devin believe me i am sorry alessan murmured softly so that no one else would hear it is hardest the first time and i gave you no chance to prepare devin shook his head he felt drained almost numb you didnt have much choice maybe it was better this way he cleared his throat awkwardly alessan you have larger things to worry about i chose freely in the sandren woods last fall you arent responsible for me in a way i am not in a way that matters i made my own choice doesnt friendship matter devin was silent rendered suddenly diffident alessan had a way of doing that to you after a moment the prince added almost as an afterthought i was your age when i came back from quileia for a moment he seemed about to add something but in the end he did not devin had an idea of what he meant though and something kindled quietly within him like a candle for a moment longer they looked down at the dead man only a crescent vidomnis pale light was still bright enough to show the staring pain in his face devin said i chose freely and i understand the need but i dont think im ever going to get used to this i know i never have said alessan he hesitated either one of my brothers would have been so much better at what i was kept alive to do devin turned then trying to read the expression on the princes face in the shadows after a moment he said i never knew them but will you allow me to say that i doubt it truly i doubt it alessan after a moment the prince touched his shoulder thank you there are those who would disagree im afraid but thank you nonetheless and with those words he seemed to remember something or be recalled to something his voice changed we had better ride i must speak with ducas and then well have to catch up with erlein and go on weve a lot of ground to cover yet he looked at devin appraisingly you must be exhausted i should have asked before how is your leg can you ride im fine devin protested quickly of course i can ride someone behind them laughed sardonically they both turned to discover that erlein and the others had in fact returned to the pass tell me the wizard said to alessan sharp mockery in his voice what did you expect him to say of course hell tell you he can ride hed ride all night halfdead for you so would this one he gestured towards naddo behind him on barely an hours acquaintance i wonder prince alessan how does it feel to have such a power over the hearts of men ducas had ridden over while erlein was speaking he said nothing though and it was too dark now with the torches extinguished to make out anyones features clearly one had to judge by the words and the inflections given them alessan said quietly i think you know my answer to that in any case im unlikely to think too highly of myself with you around to point these things out to me he paused then added triad forfend you would ever volunteer to ride all night in any cause but your own i said erlein flatly have no choice in the matter anymore or have you forgotten i have not but ive no mind to repeat that quarrel now erlein ducas and his men have just put their lives at risk to save your own if you to save my own i would never have been at risk if you hadnt compelled me to erlein enough we have a great many things to do and i am not of a mind to debate in the darkness devin saw erlein sketch a mocking bow on horseback i most humbly cry your pardon he said in an exaggerated tone you really must let me know when you are of a mind to debate youll concede it is an issue of some importance to me alessan was silent for what seemed a long time then mildly he said i think i can guess what is behind this now i understand it is meeting another wizard isnt it with sertino here you feel what has happened to you the more dont pretend you understand me alessan said erlein furiously still calmly alessan said very well then i wont in some ways i may never understand you and how you have lived you life i told you that the evening we met but for now this issue is a closed one i will be prepared to discuss it the day the tyrants are gone from the palm not before you will be dead before that we will both be dead dont touch him alessan said sharply belatedly devin saw the naddo had raised his good hand to strike the wizard more quietly the prince added if we are both dead then our spirits can wrangle in morians halls erlein until then no more we will have a great deal to do together in the weeks to come ducas coughed as to that he said we two also had better speak there is a fair bit id like to know before i go further than this nights work much as it has pleased me i know said alessan turning to him in the dark he hesitated will you ride with us for a little only as far as the village you and naddo because of his arm why there and why because of the arm i dont understand ducas said you should know that we are not much welcome in the village for obvious reasons i can guess it wont matter not on an ember night you will understand when we get there come i want my good friend erlein di senzio to see something and i suppose sertino had better join us too i wouldnt miss this for all the blue wine in astibar said the pudgy certandan wizard it was interesting at another time it might even have been amusing to note what a healthy distance he continued to keep between himself and the prince the words he spoke were facetious but his tone was deadly serious come on then said alessan brusquely he turned his horse past erleins almost brushing against the other man and started west out of the pass the ones he had named began to follow ducas spoke a few terse commands to arkin too low for devin to hear arkin hesitated for a moment clearly torn wanting to come with his leader but then without speaking he turned his horse the other way when devin glanced back a moment later he saw that the outlaws were rifling the barbadians bodies for weapons he turned to look over his shoulder again a few moments later but they were in open country by then with the hills in shadow to the south and east and a grassy plain rolling north of them the entrance to the pass could no longer even be seen arkin and the others would be gone from within it soon devin knew leaving only the dead only the dead for the scavengers one of them killed by his own sword and another one a child the old man lay on his bed in the darkness of an ember night and the always darkness of his own affliction far from sleep he listened to the wind outside and to the woman in the other room clicking her prayer beads and intoning the same litany over and over eanna love us adaon preserve us morian guard our souls eanna love us adaon preserve us morian guard our souls eanna love us his hearing was very good it was a compensation most of the time but sometimes as tonight with the woman praying like a demented thing it was a curse of a particularly insidious kind she was using her old beads he could tell the thin quick sound even through the wall separating their chambers he had made her a new ring of beads of rare polished tanchwood three years ago for her naming day most of the time she used that ring but not on the ember days then she went back to her old beads and she prayed aloud for most of three days and nights in the earliest years here he had slept those three nights in the barn with the two boys who had brought him here so much did her unceasing litany disturb him but he was old now his bones creaked and ached on windy nights such as this so he kept to his own bed under piled blankets and endured her voice as best he could eanna love us always adaon preserve us from all perils morian guard our souls and shelter us eanna love us the ember days were a time of contrition and atonement but they were also a time when one was to count and give thanks for ones gifts he was a cynical man for sufficient and varied reasons but he would not have called himself unreligious and he would not in fact have said hed lived a life unblessed despite the blindness of almost two decades he had lived much of his life in wealth and near to power the length of his days was a blessing and so too was the lifelong grace of his hands with wood only a form of play at first a diversion it had become something more than that in the years since they had come here there was also his other gift of skill though few people knew of that had it been otherwise he would never have been able to shape a quiet life in this highland village and a quiet life was essential because he was hiding still the very fact of his survival on the long sightless journey all those years ago was a blessing of a special kind he was under no illusions he would never have survived without the loyalty of his two young servants the only ones they had allowed to stay with him the only ones who had wanted to stay they werent young nor were they servants any longer they were farmers on land they owned with him no longer sleeping on the frontroom floor in their first small farmhouse nor out in the barn as they had in the earliest years but in their own homes with wives beside them and children near by lying in darkness he offered thanks for that as gratefully as for anything he had ever been given himself either of them would have let him sleep in their home these three nights to escape the unending drone of the woman in the other room but he would not presume to ask so much not on the ember nights not on any night he had his own sense of what was appropriate and besides he liked his own bed more and more with the passing years eanna love us as her children adaon preserve us as his children he wasnt clearly going to be able to fall asleep he thought about getting up to polish a staff or a bow but he knew menna would hear him and he knew she would make him pay for profaning an ember night with labor watery porridge sour wine his slippers cruelly moved from where he laid them down they were in my way she would say when he complained then when fires were allowed again burnt meat undrinkable khav bitter bread for a week at least menna had her own ways of letting him know what mattered to her after all the years they had their tacit understandings much as any old couple did though of course he had never married her he knew who he was and what was appropriate even in this fallen state far from home from the memory of wealth or power here on this small farmholding bought with gold fearfully hidden on his person during that long blind journey seventeen years ago sure that a murderous pursuit was riding close behind he had survived though and the boys coming to this village on a day in autumn long ago strangers arriving in a dark time a time when so many people had died and so many others were brutally uprooted all across the palm in the wake of the tyrants coming but the three of them had somehow endured had even managed to make the land put forth a living for them in good years in certandos bad years latterly he had had to deplete his dwindled reserve of gold but what else was it for at this point really what else would it be for menna and the two boys they were no longer boys of course were his heirs they were all he could claim as family now they were all he had if one didnt count the dreams that still came in his nights he was a cynical man having seen a great deal in the days before his darkness came and after in a different way of seeing but he was not so burdened by irony as to defeat wisdom he knew that exiles always dreamt of home and that the sorely wronged never really forgot he had no illusions about being unique in this eanna love us adaon preserve us from triad save us menna fell silent very abruptly and for the same reason the old man sat suddenly upright in bed wincing at a sharp protest from his spine they had both heard it a sound outside in the night in the ember night when no one should be abroad listening carefully he caught it again the sound delicate and faint of pipes playing in the darkness outside passing by their walls concentrating the old man could make out footsteps he counted them then his heart beating dangerously fast he swung out of bed as quickly as he could and began to dress it is the dead menna wailed in the far room adaon preserve us from vengeful ghosts from all harm eanna love us the dead have come for us morian of portals guard our souls despite his agitation the old man paused to note that menna even in her fear still included him in prayers for a moment he was genuinely moved in the next moment he ruefully acknowledged the inescapable fact that the succeeding two weeks of his life at least were likely to be sheerest domestic torment he was going outside of course he knew exactly who this was he finished dressing and reached for his favorite stick by the door he moved as quietly as he could but the walls were thin and mennas hearing almost as good as his own there was no point in trying to slip out unheard she would know what he was doing and would make him pay the price because this had happened before on ember nights and other nights for almost ten years now sure of foot inside the house he went to the front door and used his stick to roll back the chinkblocker on the floor then he opened the door and went out menna was praying again already eanna love me adaon preserve me morian guard my soul the old man smiled a wintry smile two weeks at least watery porridge in the morning burnt tasteless khav bitter mahgoti tea he stood still for a moment still smiling faintly breathing the crisp cool air mercifully the wind had died down a little his bones felt fine lifting his face to the night breeze he could almost taste the spring to come he closed the door carefully behind him and began tapping his way with the stick along the path towards the barn he had carved this stick when he still had his sight many times he had carried it in the palace an affectation at a dissolute court he had never expected to need it in this way its head was the head of an eagle with the eyes lovingly detailed wide and fiercely defiant perhaps because he had killed for the second time in his life that night devin was remembering that other much larger barn from the winter just past in astibar this one was far more modest only two milk cows and a pair of plow horses stabled it was wellmade though and warm with the smell of the animals and clean straw the walls had no chinks to admit the knife of wind the straw was freshly piled the floor swept clean the tools along the walls neatly laid and stacked in fact if he wasnt careful the smell and the feel of this barn would take him much further back than last winter back to their own farm in asoli which he tried never to think about he was tired though bone tired after two sleepless nights and so he supposed he was vulnerable to such memories his right knee ached fiercely where he had twisted it on the mountain it was swollen to twice its normal size and sharply sensitive to touch hed had to walk slowly making a real effort not to limp no one spoke no one had spoken since they had reached the outskirts of this village of some twenty homes the only sound for the last few moments after they tethered the horses and began to walk had been alessans pipes softly playing playing and devin wondered if he alone knew this or if naddo recognized it too a certain nursery melody from avalle here in the barn alessan was still playing as gently as before the tune was one more thing that seemed to be trying to carry devin back to his family he resisted if he went that way in the condition he was in right now he would probably end up crying devin tried to imagine how the haunting elusive melody would sound to anyone huddled inside the walls of their lightless homes on this ember night a company of ghosts passing by that was what they would seem to be the dead abroad following a small forgotten tune he remembered catriana singing in the sandreni woods but wherever i wander by night or by day where water runs swiftly or high trees sway my heart will carry me back and away to a dream of the towers of avalle he wondered where she was tonight and sandre baerd he wondered if he would ever see any of them again earlier this evening pursued into the pass he had thought he was about to die and now two hours later they had killed twentyfive barbadians with those same outlaws who had pursued them and three of the outlaws were here with them in this unknown barn listening to alessan play a cradle song he didnt think he would understand the strangeness of life if he lived to be a hundred years old there was a sound outside and the door swung open devin stiffened involuntarily so did ducas di tregea a hand reaching for his sword alessan looked at the door but his fingers never faltered on the pipes and the music continued an old man slightly stooped but with a leonine combedback mane of white hair stood for a moment backlit by the sudden moonlight before he stepped inside and pushed the door closed behind him with a stick he carried after that it was dark again in the barn and hard to see for a few moments no one spoke alessan did not even look up again tenderly with feeling he finished the tune devin looked at him as he played and wondered if he was the only man here who understood what music meant to the prince he thought about what alessan had been through in this past day alone about what it was he was riding towards and something complicated and awkward stirred in his heart as he listened to the wistful ending of the song he saw the prince set his pipes aside with a motion of regret laying down his release taking up the burdens again all the burdens that seemed to be his legacy the price of his blood thank you for coming old friend he said now quietly to the man in the doorway you owe me alessan the old man said in a clear strong voice you have condemned me to sour milk and spoiled meat for a month i was afraid of that alessan said in the darkness devin could hear affection and an unexpected amusement in his voice menna has not changed then the other man snorted menna and change do not coexist he said you are with new people and a friend is missing what has happened is he all right he is fine a halfdays ride east there is much to tell i came with some reason rinaldo so much is clear to me one man with a leg that is torn inside another with an arrow wound the two wizards are not happy but i can do nothing about their missing fingers and neither is ill the sixth man is now afraid of me but he need not be devin gasped with astonishment beside him ducas swore aloud explain this he growled furiously explain everything alessan was laughing so more softly was the man he had called rinaldo you are a spoiled and petty old man the prince said still chuckling and you enjoy shocking people simply for the sake of doing it you should be ashamed of yourself there are so few pleasures left to me in my age the other retorted would you deny me this one too there is much to tell you say tell me alessans voice grew sober i had a meeting in the mountains this morning ah i was wondering about that and what follows everything rinaldo everything follows this summer he said yes we will have the letters one to alberico one to brandin and one to the governor of senzio ah said rinaldo again the governor of senzio he said it softly but could not quite disguise the excitement in his voice he took a step forward into the room i never dreamt i would live to see this day alessan we are going to act we have already begun ducas and his men joined with us tonight in battle we killed a number of barbadians and a tracker pursuing a wizard with us ducas that is who this is the old man gave a low whistle a curiously incongruous sound now i know why he is afraid you have your share of enemies in this village my friend i am aware of that said ducas drily rinaldo alessan said do you remember the siege of borifort when alberico first came the stories about a redbearded captain one of the leaders of the tregeans there the one who was never found ducas di tregea this is he again the whistle well met then captain though not as a matter of fact for the first time if i remember rightly you were in the company of the duke of tregea when i paid a formal visit there some twenty years ago a visit from where ducas asked visibly struggling to get his bearings devin sympathized he was doing the same thing and he knew rather more than the redbearded man did from from alessans province ducas hazarded tigana but of course erlein di senzio interjected harshly of course he is this is just another petty injured lordling from the west is that why you brought me here alessan to show how brave an old man can be you will forgive me if i choose to pass on this lesson i didnt hear the beginning of that it was rinaldo speaking softly to the wizard what did you say erlein fell silent turning from alessan to the man by the door even in darkness devin could see his sudden confusion he named my province alessan said they both think you are from my home an outrageous slander rinaldo said calmly he swung his large handsome head towards ducas and erlein i am vain enough to have thought you might know me by now my name is rinaldo di senzio what senzio erlein exclaimed shocked out of his own composure you cant be there was a silence who exactly is this presumptuous man rinaldo asked of no one in particular my wizard im afraid alessan replied i have bound him to me with adaons gift to the line of our princes i spoke to you of that once i think his name is erlein erlein di senzio ah said rinaldo letting his breath out slowly i see a bound wizard and a senzian that explains his anger he moved another few steps forward sweeping his stick over the ground in front of him it was in that moment that devin realized that rinaldo was blind ducas registered it in the same moment you have no eyes he said no rinaldo said equably i used to of course but they were judged inappropriate for me by my nephew at the suggestion of both tyrants seventeen years ago this spring i had the temerity to oppose casalias decision to lay down his ducal status and become a governor instead alessan was staring fixedly at erlein as rinaldo spoke devin followed his glance the wizard looked more confused than devin had ever seen him i do know who you are then he said almost stammering of course you do just as i know you and knew your father erlein bar alein i was brother to the last real duke of senzio and am uncle to the craven disgrace who styles himself casalia governor of senzio now and i was as proud to be the one as i am shamed to call myself the other visibly fighting for control erlein said but then you knew what alessan was planning you knew about those letters he told you you know what he intends to do with them you know what it will mean for our province and you are still with him you are helping him his voice rose erratically at the end you stupid petty little man rinaldo said slowly spacing the words for weight his own voice hard as stone of course i am helping him how else are we to deal with the tyrants what other battleground is possible in the palm today but our poor senzio where barbadior and ygrath circle each other like wolves and my crapulous nephew drowns himself in drink and spills his seed in the backsides of whores do you want freedom to be easy erlein bar alein do you think it drops like acorns from trees in the fall he thinks he is free alessan said bluntly or would be if it wasnt for me he thinks he was free until he met me by a river in ferraut last week then i have nothing more to say to him said rinaldo di senzio with contempt how did you how did you find this man it was sertino speaking to alessan the certandan wizard still kept to the far side of the room from the prince devin noted finding such men has been my labor for twelve years and more now alessan said men and women from my home or yours from astibar tregea all over the peninsula people i thought could be trusted and who might have reason to hate the tyrants as much as i and a desire to be free that matched my own truly free he said looking at erlein again masters of our own peninsula with a faint smile he turned to ducas as it happened you hid yourself well friend i thought you might be alive but had no idea where we lived in tregea on and off for more than a year but no one we spoke to knew or would say anything about your fate i had to be terribly clever tonight to lure you into finding me instead ducas laughed at that a deep sound in his chest then sobering he said i wish it had happened earlier so do i you have no idea how much i have a friend i think will take to you as much as you will to him shall i meet him in senzio later this spring if events fall right if we can make them fall right if that is so you had best start by telling us how you need them to fall rinaldo said prosaically let me tend to your two wounded while you tell what we should know he moved forward tapping the ground ahead of him as he came up to devin i am a healer he explained gravely the sharpness gone from his voice your leg is bad and needs dealing with will you let me try so that is how you knew us ducas said wonder in his voice again i have never known a true healer before there are not many of us and we tend not to announce ourselves rinaldo said the empty sockets of his eyes fixed on nothingness that was so even before the tyrants came it is a gift with limits and a price now we keep ourselves hidden for the same reason the wizards do or almost the same the tyrants are happy to seize us and force us serve them until they wear us out can they do that devin asked his voice was hoarse he realized that he hadnt spoken for a long time he cringed at the thought of what he would sound like if he tried to sing tonight he couldnt remember the last time he had been so exhausted of course they can said rinaldo simply unless we choose to die on their deathwheels instead which has been known to happen i will be happy to learn of any difference between that coercion and what this man has done to me erlein said coldly and i will be happy to tell you rinaldo shot back as soon as i finish my work to devin he said there should be straw behind you will you lie down and let me see what i can do in a few moments devin found himself prone on a bed of straw with an old mans gingerly caution rinaldo knelt beside him the healer began rubbing his palms slowly against each other over his shoulder rinaldo said alessan im serious talk while i work begin with baerd i would like to know why he isnt with you baerd a voice interrupted is that your friend baerd bar saevar it was naddo the wounded man he stumbled forward to the edge of the straw saevar was his father yes alessan said you knew him naddo was so distraught he could scarcely speak knew him of course i knew him i was i he swallowed hard i was his fathers last apprentice i loved baerd as as an older brother i we parted badly i went away in the year after the fall so did he alessan said gently laying a hand on naddos trembling shoulder not long after you did i know who you are now naddo he has often spoken to me of that parting i can tell you that he grieved for the manner of it that he still does i expect he will tell you himself when you meet this is the friend you mentioned ducas asked softly it is he has spoken to you of me naddos voice skirled high with wonder he has alessan was smiling again devin weary as he was found himself doing the same the man before them sounded remarkably like a young boy just then do you does he know what happened to his sister to dianora naddo asked alessans smile faded we do not we have searched for a dozen years and asked in a great many places wherever we find survivors of the fall there are so many women of that name she went away herself some time after he left in search of me no one knows why or where she went and the mother died not long after they are their loss is the deepest hurt i know in baerd naddo was silent a moment later they realized that he was fighting back tears i can understand that he said finally his voice husky she was the bravest girl i ever knew the bravest woman and if she wasnt really beautiful she was still so very he stopped for a moment struggling for composure and then said quietly i think i loved her i know i did i was thirteen years old that year if the goddesses love us and the god alessan said softly we will find her yet devin hadnt known any of this there seemed to be so many things he hadnt known he had questions to ask maybe even more than ducas had but just then rinaldo on his knees beside him stopped rubbing his palms together and leaned forward you need rest quite badly he murmured so softly none of the others could hear you need sleep as much as your leg needs care as he spoke he laid one hand gently on devins forehead and devin for all his questions and all his perturbation felt himself suddenly beginning to drift as on a wide calm sea towards the shores of sleep far from where men were speaking from their voices and their grief and their need and he heard nothing more at all of what was said in the barn that night chapter three days later at sunrise they crossed the border south of the two forts and devin entered tigana for the first time since his father had carried him away as a child only the most struggling musicians came into lower corte the companies down on their luck and desperate for engagements of any kind however slight the pay however grim the ambience even so long after the tyrants had conquered the itinerant performers of the palm knew that lower corte meant bad luck and worse wages and a serious risk of falling afoul of the ygrathens either inside the province or at the borders going in or out it wasnt as if the story wasnt known the lower corteans had killed brandins son and they were paying a price in blood and money and brutally heavy oppression for that it did not make for a congenial setting the artists of the roads agreed talking it over in taverns or hospices in ferraut or corte only the hungry or the newly begun ventured to take the illpaying riskladen jobs in that sad province in the southwest by the time devin had joined him menico di ferraut had been traveling for a very long time and had more than enough of a reputation to be able to eschew that particular one of the nine provinces there was sorcery involved there too no one really understood it but the travelers of the road were a superstitious lot and given an alternative few would willingly venture into a place where magic was known to be at work everyone knew the problems you could find in lower corte everyone knew the stories so this was the first time for devin through the last hours of riding in darkness he had been waiting for the moment of passage knowing that since they had glimpsed fort sinave north of them some time ago the border had to be near knowing what lay on the other side and now with the first pale light of dawn rising behind them they had come to the line of boundary cairns that stretched north and south between the two forts and he had looked up at the nearest of the old worn smooth monoliths and had ridden past it had crossed the border into tigana and he found to his dismay that he had no idea what to think how to respond he felt scattered and confused he had shivered uncontrollably a few hours ago when they saw the distant lights of sinave in darkness his imagination restlessly at work ill be home soon he had told himself in the land where i was born now riding west past the cairn devin looked around compulsively searching as the slow spread of light claimed the sky and then the tops of hills and trees and finally bathed the springtime world as far as he could see it was a landscape much like what they had been riding through for the past two days hilly with dense forests ranging in the south on the rising slopes and the mountains visible beyond he saw a deer lift its head from drinking at a stream it froze for a minute watching them and then remembered to flee they had seen deer in certando too this is home devin told himself again reaching for the response that should be flowing in this land his father had met and wooed his mother he and his brothers had been born and from here garin di tigana had fled northward a widower with infant sons escaping the killing anger of ygrath devin tried to picture it his father on a cart one of the twins on the seat beside him the other they must have taken turns in the back with what goods they had cradling devin in his arms as they rode through a red sunset darkened by smoke and fires on the horizon it seemed a false picture in some way devin could not have explained or if not exactly false it was unreal somehow too easy an image the thing was it might even be true it might be exactly true but devin didnt know he couldnt know he had no memories of that ride of this place no roots no history this was home but it wasnt it wasnt really even tigana through which they rode he had never even heard that name until half a year ago let alone any stories legends chronicles of its past this was the province of lower corte so he had known it all his life he shook his head edgy profoundly unsettled beside him erlein glanced over an ironic smile playing about his lips which made devin even more irritable ahead of them alessan was riding alone he hadnt said a word since the border he had memories devin knew and in a way that he was aware was odd or even twisted he envied the prince those images however painful they might be they would be rooted and absolute and shaped of this place which was truly his home whatever alessan was feeling or remembering now would have nothing of the unreal about it it would all be raw brutally actual the trampled fabric of his own life devin tried riding through the cheerful birdsong of a glorious spring morning to imagine how the prince might be feeling he thought that he could but only just a guess more than anything else among other things perhaps first of all things alessan was going to a place where his mother was dying no wonder he had urged his horse ahead no wonder he wasnt speaking now he is entitled devin thought watching the prince ride straightbacked and selfcontained in front of them hes entitled to whatever solitude whatever release he needs what he carries is the dream of a people and most of them dont even know it and thinking so he found himself drawn out of his own confusion his struggling adjustment to where they were focusing on alessan he found his avenue to passion again to the burning inward response to what had happened here and was still happening every hour of every day in the ransacked brokendown province named lower corte and somewhere in his mind and heart fruits of a long winter of thought and of listening in silence as older and wiser men spoke devin knew that he was not the first and would not be the last person to find in a single man the defining shape and lineaments for the so much harder love of an abstraction or a dream it was then looking all around at the sweep of land under the wide arch of a high blue sky that devin felt something pluck at the strings of his heart as if it were a harp as if he were he felt the drumming of his horses hooves on the hard earth following fast behind the prince and it seemed to devin that that drumming was with the harpstrings as they galloped their destiny was waiting for them brilliant in his mind like the colored pavilions on the plain of the triad games that took place every three years what they were doing now mattered it could make a difference they were riding at the very center of events in their time devin felt something pull him forward lifting and bearing him into the riptide the maelstrom of the future into what his life would have been about when it was over he saw erlein glance over again and this time devin smiled back at him a grim fierce smile he saw the habitual reflexive irony leave the wizards lean face replaced by a flicker of doubt devin almost felt sorry for the man again impulsively he guided his horse nearer to erleins brown and leaned over to squeeze the other mans shoulder were going to do it he said brightly almost gaily erleins face seemed to pinch itself together you are a fool he said tersely a young ignorant fool he said it without conviction though an instinctive response devin laughed aloud later he would remember this moment too his words erleins his laughter under the bright blue cloudless sky forests and the mountains on their left and in the distance before them now the first glimpse of the sperion a glinting ribbon flowing swiftly north before beginning its curve west to find the sea the sanctuary of eanna lay in a high valley set within a sheltering and isolating circle of hills south and west of the river sperion and of what had been avalle it was not far from the road that had once borne such a volume of trade back and forth from tigana and quileia through the high saddleback of the sfaroni pass in all nine provinces eannas priests and morians and the priestesses of adaon had such retreats founded in outofthe way parts of the peninsula sometimes dramatically so they served as centers of learning and teaching for the newly initiated clergy repositories of wisdom and of the canons of the triad and as places of withdrawal where priests and priestesses who chose might lay down the pace and burdens of the world outside for a time or for a lifetime and not just the clergy members of the laity would sometimes do the same if they could afford contributions that were judged as appropriate offerings for the privilege of sheltering for a space of days or years within the ambit of these retreats many were the reasons that led people to the sanctuaries it had long been a jest that the priestesses of adaon were the best birth doctors in the palm so numerous were the daughters of distinguished or merely wealthy houses that elected to sojourn at one of the gods retreats at times that might otherwise have been inconvenient for their families and of course it was well known that an indeterminately high percentage of the clergy were culled from the living offerings these same daughters left behind when they returned to their homes girl children stayed with adaon the boys went to morian the whiterobed priests of eanna had always claimed that they would have nothing to do with such goingson but there were stories belying that as well little of this had changed when the tyrants came neither brandin nor alberico was so reckless or illadvised as to stir up the clergy of the triad against their rule the priests and the priestesses were allowed to do as they had always done the people of the palm were granted their worship odd and even primitive as it might seem to the new rulers from overseas what both tyrants did do with greater or lesser success was play the rival temples against each other seeing for it was impossible not to see the tensions and hostilities that rippled and flared among the three orders of the triad there was nothing new in this every duke grand duke or prince in the peninsula had sought in each generation to turn this shifting threeway friction to his own account many patterns might have changed with the circling of years some things might change past all recognition and some might be lost or forgotten entirely but not this one not this delicate reciprocal dance of state and clergy and so the temples still stood and the most important ones still flourished their gold and machial their statuary and their clothofgold vestments for services save in one place only in lower corte where the statues and the gold were gone and the libraries looted and burned that was part of something else though and few spoke of it after the earliest years of the tyrants even in this benighted province the clergy were otherwise allowed to continue the precisely measured round of their days in city and town and in their sanctuaries and to these retreats came a great variety of men and women from time to time it was not only the awkwardly fecund who found reason to ride or be carried away from the turbulence of their lives in times of strife whether of the soul or the wider world the denizens of the palm always knew that the sanctuaries were there perched in snowbound precipitous eyries or halflost in their misty valleys and the people knew as well that for a price such a withdrawal into the regimen the carefully modulated hours of retreats such as this one of eanna in its valley could be theirs for a time for a lifetime whoever they might have been in the cities beyond the hills whoever they might have been for a time for a lifetime the old woman thought looking out the window of her room at the valley in sunlight at springs return she had never been able to keep her thoughts from going back there was so much waiting for her in the past and so little here now living through the agonizingly slow descent of the years season after season falling to the earth like shot birds arrows in their breasts through this lifetime that was her own and her only one a lifetime of remembering by curlews cry at dawn or call to prayer by candlelight at dusk by sight of chimney smoke rising straight and dark into winters wan gray light by the driving sound of rain on roof and window at winters end by the creak of her bed at night by call to prayer again by drone of priests at prayer by a star falling west in the summer sky by the stern cold dark of the ember days a memory within each and every motion of the self or of the world every sound each share of color each scent borne by the valley wind a remembrance of what had been lost to bring one to this place among the whiterobed priests with their unending rites and their unending pettiness and their acceptance of what had happened to them all which last is what had nearly killed her in the early years which indeed she would say had said last week to danoleon was killing her now whatever the priestphysician might say about growths in her breast they had found a healer in the fall he had come anxious febrile a lank sloppy man with nervous motions and a flushed brow but he had sat down beside her bed and looked at her and she had realized that he did have the gift for his agitation had settled and his brow had cleared and when he touched her here and here his hand had been steady and there had been no pain only a not unpleasant weariness he had shaken his head though in the end and she had read an unexpected grief in his pale eyes though he could not have known who she was his sorrow would be for simple loss for defeat not caring who it was who might be dying it would kill me he said quietly it has come too far i would die and i would not save you there is nothing i can do how long she had asked her only words he told her half a year perhaps less depending on how strong she was how strong she was very strong more so than any of them guessed save perhaps danoleon who had known her longest by far she sent the healer from the room and asked danoleon to leave and then the one slow servant the priests had allowed to the woman they knew only as a widow from an estate north of stevanien as it happened she had actually known the woman whose identity she had assumed had had her as one of the ladies of her court for a time a fairhaired girl green eyes and an easy manner quick to laugh melina bren tonaro a widow for a week less than that she had killed herself in the palace by the sea when word came of second deisa the deception was a necessary shielding of identity danoleons suggestion almost nineteen years ago they would be looking for her and for the boy the high priest had said the boy he was taking away he would soon be safely gone their dreams carried in his person a hope living so long as he lived she had been fairhaired herself in those days it had all happened such a long time ago she had become melina bren tonaro and had come to the sanctuary of eanna in its high valley above avalle above stevanien had come and had waited through the changing seasons and the unchanging years waited for that boy to grow into a man such as his father had been or his brothers and then do what a descendant in direct line of micaela and the god should know he had to do had waited season after season shot birds falling from the sky until last autumn when the healer had told her the cold large thing she had already guessed for herself half a year he had said if she was strong she had sent them from her room and lain in her iron bed and looked out at the leaves on the valley trees the change of colors had come she had loved that once her favorite season for riding as a girl as a woman it had occurred to her that these would be the last fall leaves she would ever see she had turned her mind from such thoughts and had begun to calculate days and months and the numbering of the years she had done the arithmetic twice and a third time to be sure of it she said nothing to danoleon not then it was too soon not until the end of winter with all the leaves gone and ice just beginning to melt from the eaves did she summon the high priest and instruct him as to the letter she wanted sent to the place where she knew as he knew alone of all the priests her son would be on the ember days that began this spring she had done the calculations many times she had also timed it very well and not by chance she could see danoleon wanting to protest to dissuade to speak of dangers and circumspection but the ground was out from under his feet she could see it in the way his large hands grew restless and the way his blue eyes moved about the room as if seeking an argument on the bare walls she waited patiently for him to meet her gaze at last as she knew he would and then she saw him slowly bow his head in acceptance how did one deny a mother dying a message to her only living child an entreaty to that child to come bid her farewell before she crossed over to morian especially when that child the boy he himself had guided south over the mountains so many years ago was her last link to what she had been to her own broken dreams and the lost dreams of her people danoleon promised to write the letter and have it sent she thanked him and lay back in her bed after he went out she was genuinely weary genuinely in pain hanging on it would be half a year just past the ember days of spring she had done the numbers she would be alive to see him if he came and he would come she knew he would come to her the window had been open a little though it was still cold that day outside the snow had lain in gentle drifting folds in the valley and up the slopes of the hills she had looked out upon it but her thoughts unexpectedly had been of the sea dryeyed for she had not wept since everything fell not once not ever she walked her memorypalaces of long ago and saw the waves come in to break and fall on the white sands of the shore leaving shells and pearls and other gifts along the curving beach so pasithea di tigana bren serazi once a princess in a palace by the sea mother of two dead sons and of one who yet lived waiting as winter near the mountains turned to spring in that year two things first we are musicians said alessan a newly formed company secondly do not use my name not here his voice had taken on the clipped hard cadences devin remembered from the first night in the sandreni lodge when this had all begun for him they were looking down on a valley running west in the clear light of afternoon the sperion lay behind them the uneven narrow road had wound its way for hours up around the shoulders of an ascending sequence of hills until this highest point and now the valley unrolled before them trees and grass touched by the earliest greengold of spring a tributary stream swiftrunning with the melting snows slanted northwest out of the foothills flashing with light the temple dome in the midst of the sanctuary gleamed silver in the middle distance what name then erlein asked quietly he seemed subdued whether because of alessans tone or the awareness of danger devin did not know adreano the prince said after a moment i am adreano dastibar today i will be a poet for this reunion for this triumphant joyous homecoming devin remembered the name the young poet deathwheeled by alberico last winter after the scandal of the sandreni elegies he looked closely at the prince for a moment and then away this was not a day to probe if he was here for any reason it was to try somehow to make things easier for alessan he didnt know how he was going to go about doing that though he felt badly out of his depth again his earlier rush of excitement fading before the grimness of the princes manner south of them towering above the valley the peaks of the sfaroni range loomed higher even than the mountains above castle borso there was snow on the peaks and even on the middle slopes winter did not retreat so swiftly this high up this far south below them though north of the contoured foothills in the sheltered eastwest running of the valley devin could see green buds swelling on the trees a grey hawk hung in an updraft for a moment almost motionless before wheeling south and down to be lost against the backdrop of the hills down on the valley floor the sanctuary seemed to lie within its walls like a promise of peace and serenity wrapped away from all the evils of the world devin knew it was not so they rode down not hurrying now for that would have been unusual in three musicians come here at midday devin was keenly anxiously aware of danger the man he was riding behind was the last heir to tigana he wondered what brandin of ygrath would do to alessan if the prince was betrayed and taken after so many years he remembered marius of quileia in the mountain pass do you trust this message devin had never trusted the priests of eanna in his whole life they were too shrewd by far the most subtle of the clergy by far the most apt to steer events to their own ends which might lie out of sight generations away servants of a goddess he supposed might find it easier to take the longer view of things but everyone knew that all across the peninsula the clergy of the triad had their own triple understanding with the tyrants from abroad their collective silence their tacit complicity bought in exchange for being allowed to preserve the rites that mattered more to them it seemed than freedom in the palm even before meeting alessan devin had had his own thoughts about that on the subject of the clergy his father had never been shy about speaking his mind and now devin remembered again garins single candle of defiance twice a year on the ember nights of his childhood in asoli now that he had begun to think about it there seemed to be a great many nuances to the flickering lights of those candles in the dark and more shadings to his own stolid father than he had ever guessed devin shook his head this was not the time to wander down that path when the hill track finally wound its way down to the valley floor a wider smoother road began slanting towards the sanctuary in the middle of the valley about half a mile away from the stone outer walls a double row of trees began on either side of the approach elms coming into early leaf beyond them on either side devin saw men working in the fields some lay servants and some of them priests clad not in the white of ceremony but in nondescript robes of beige beginning the labors that the soil demanded at winters end one man was singing a sweet clear tenor voice the eastern gates of the sanctuary complex were open before them simple and unadorned save for the starsymbol of eanna the gates were high though devin noted and of heavy wrought iron the walls that enclosed the sanctuary were high as well and the stone was thick there were also towers eight of them curving forward at intervals around the wide embrace of the walls this was clearly a place built however many hundreds of years ago to withstand adversity set within the complex rising serenely above everything else the dome of eannas temple shone in the sunlight as they rode up to the open gates and passed within just inside alessan pulled his horse to a halt from ahead of them and some distance over to the left they heard the unexpected sound of childrens laughter in an open grassy field set beyond a stable and a large residence hall a dozen young boys in blue tunics were playing maracco with sticks and a ball supervised by a young priest in the beige workrobes devin watched them with a sudden sharp sadness and nostalgia he could remember vividly going into the woods near their farm with povar and nico when he was five years old to cut and carry home his first maracco stick and then the hours minutes more often snatched from chores when the three of them would seize their sticks and one of the battered succession of balls nico had patiently wound together out of layers and layers of cloth to whoop and slash their way about in the mud at the end of the barnyard pretending they were the asolini team at the upcoming triad games i scored four times one game in my last year of temple schooling erlein di senzio said in a musing voice ive never forgotten it i doubt i ever will surprised and amused devin glanced over at the wizard alessan turned in his saddle to look back as well after a moment the three men exchanged a smile in the distance the childrens shouts and laughter gradually subsided the three of them had been seen it was unlikely that the appearance of strangers was a common event here especially so soon after the melting of the snow the young priest had left the playing field and was making his way over as was an older man with a full black leather apron over his robes of beige coming from where the sheep and goats and cows were kept in pens on the other side of the central avenue some distance in front of them lay the arched entrance to the temple and beside it on the right and a little behind the smaller dome of the observatory for in all her sanctuaries the priests of eanna tracked and observed the stars she had named the complex was enormous even more so than it had seemed from above on the hill slopes there were a great many priests and servants moving about the grounds entering and leaving the temple itself working among the animals or in the vegetable gardens devin could see beyond the observatory from that direction as well came the unmistakable clanging of a blacksmiths forge smoke rose up there to be caught and carried by the mild breeze overhead he saw the hawk again or a different one circling lazily against the blue alessan dismounted and devin and erlein did the same just as the two priests came up to them at almost exactly the same moment the younger one sandyhaired and small like devin laughed and gestured at himself and his colleague not much of a greeting party im afraid we werent expecting visitors this early in the year i must admit no one even noticed you riding down be welcome though be most welcome to eannas sanctuary whatever the reason you have come to us may the goddess know you and name you hers he had a cheerful manner and an easy smile alessan returned the smile may she know and surely name all who dwell within these walls to be honest we wouldnt have been certain how to deal with a more official greeting we havent actually worked out our entrance routines yet and as for early in the year well everyone knows newformed companies have to get moving sooner than the established ones or they are likely to starve you are musical performers the older priest asked heavily wiping his hands on the leather apron he wore he was balding and brown and grizzled and there was a gap where two of his front teeth ought to have been we are said alessan with some attempt at a grand manner my name is adreano dastibar i play the tregean pipes and with me is erlein di senzio the finest harp player in all of the peninsula and i must tell you truly you havent heard singing until youve listened to our young companion devin dasoli the younger priest laughed again oh well done i should bring you along to the outer school to give a lesson to my charges in rhetoric id do better to teach the pipes alessan smiled if music is part of your program here the priests mouth twitched formal music he said this is eanna not morian after all of course said alessan hastily very formal music for the young ones boarding here but for the servants of the goddess themselves he arched one of his dark eyebrows i will admit said the sandyhaired young priest smiling again to a preference for rauders early music myself and no one plays it better than we alessan said smoothly i can see we have come to the right place should we make our obeisance to the high priest you should said the older man not smiling he began untying the apronstrings at his back ill take you to him savandi your charges are about to commit assault upon each other or worse have you no control at all over them savandi spun to look swore feelingly in a quite unpriestly fashion and began running towards the games field shouting imprecations from this distance it did indeed seem to devin that the maracco sticks were being used by savandis young charges in a fashion distinctly at variance with the accepted rules of the game devin saw erlein grinning as he watched the boys the wizards lean face changed when he smiled when the smile was a true one not the ironic slippingsideways expression he so often used to indicate a sour superior disdain the older priest grimfaced pulled his leather apron over his head folded it neatly and draped it over one of the bars of the adjacent sheepfold he barked a name devin could not make out and another young man a servant this time hastily emerged from the stables on their left take their horses the priest ordered bluntly see that their goods are brought to the guest house ill keep my pipes alessan said quickly and i my harp erlein added no lack of trust you understand but a musician and his instrument this priest was somewhat lacking in savandis comfortable manner as you will was all he said come my name is torre i am the porter of this holy sanctuary you must be brought to the high priest he turned and set off without waiting for them on a path going around to the left of the temple devin and erlein looked at each other and exchanged a shrug they followed torre and alessan passing a number of other priests and lay servants most whom smiled at them somewhat making up for their dour selfappointed guide they caught up to the other two as they rounded the southern side of the temple torre had stopped alessan beside him the balding porter looked around quite casually then said almost as casually trust no one speak truth to none but danoleon or myself these are his words you have been expected we thought it would be another night perhaps two before you came but she said it would be today then i have proved her right how gratifying said alessan in an odd voice devin felt suddenly cold off to their left in the games field savandis boys were laughing again lithe shapes clad in blue running after a white ball from within the dome he could hear faintly the sound of chanting the end of the afternoon invocations two priests in formal white came along the path from the opposite direction arm in arm disputing animatedly this is the kitchen and this the bakehouse torre said clearly pointing as he spoke over there is the brewhouse you will have heard of the ale we make here i have no doubt of course we have murmured erlein politely as alessan said nothing the two priests slowed registered the presence of the strangers and their musical instruments and went on just over there is the high priests house torre continued beyond the kitchen and the outer school the other two priests resuming their argument swept briskly around the curve of the path that led to the front of the temple torre fell silent then very softly he said eanna be praised for her most gracious love may all tongues give her praise welcome home my prince oh in the name of love be welcome home at last devin swallowed awkwardly looking from torre to alessan an uncontrollable shiver ran along his spine there were tears brightsparkling in the brilliant sunlight in the porters eyes alessan made no reply he lowered his head and devin could not see his eyes they heard childrens laughter the final notes of a sung prayer she is still alive then alessan asked looking up at last she is said torre emotionally she is still alive she is very he could not finish the sentence there is no point in the three of us being careful if you are going to spill tears like a child alessan said sharply enough of that unless you want me dead torre gulped forgive me he whispered forgive me my lord no not my lord not even when we are alone i am adreano dastibar musician alessans voice was hard now take me to danoleon the porter wiped quickly at his eyes he straightened his shoulders where do you think we are going he snapped almost managing his earlier tone again he spun on his heel and strode up the path good alessan murmured to the priest from behind very good my friend trailing them both devin saw torres head lift at the words he glanced at erlein but this time the wizard his expression thoughtful did not return the look they passed the kitchens and then the outer school where savandis charges children of noblemen or wealthy merchants sent here to be educated would study and sleep all across the palm such teaching was a part of the role of the clergy and a source of a goodly portion of their wealth the sanctuaries vied with each other to draw student boarders and their fathers money it was silent within the large building now if the dozen or so boys on the gamesfield with savandi were all the students in the complex then eannas sanctuary in lower corte was not doing very well on the other hand devin thought who of those left in lower corte could afford sanctuary schooling for their children now and what shrewd businessman from corte or chiara having bought up cheap land here in the south would not send his son home to be educated lower corte was a place where a clever man from elsewhere could make money out of the ruin of the inhabitants but it was not a place to put down roots who wanted to be rooted in the soil of brandins hate torre led them up the steps of a covered portico and then through the open doorway of the high priests house all doors seemed to be open to the spring sunshine after the shuttered holiness of the ember days just past they stood in a large handsome highceilinged sittingroom a huge fireplace dominated the southwestern end and a number of comfortable chairs and small tables were arranged on a deeppiled carpet crystal decanters on a sideboard held a variety of wines devin saw two bookcases on the southern wall but no books the cases had been left to stand disconcertingly empty the books of tigana had been burned he had been told about that arched doorways in both the eastern and western walls led out to porches where the sunlight could be caught in the morning and at eve on the far side of the room there was a closed door almost certainly leading to the bedchamber there were four cleverly designed square recesses in the walls and another smaller one above the fire where statues would once have stood these too were gone only the ubiquitous silver stars of eanna served for painted decoration on the walls the door to the bedroom opened and two priests came out they seemed surprised but not unduly so to see the porter waiting with three visitors one man was of medium height and middle years with a sharp face and closecropped saltandpepper hair he carried a physicians tray of herbs and powders in front of him supported on a thong about his neck it was at the other man that devin stared though it was the other man who carried the high priests staff of office he would have commanded attention even without it devin thought gazing at the figure of what had to be danoleon the high priest was an enormous man broadshouldered with a chest like a barrel straightbacked despite his years his long hair and the beard that covered half his chest were both white as new snow even against the whiteness of his robe thick straight eyebrows met in the middle of a serene brow and above eyes as clear and blue as a childs the hand he wrapped about the massive staff of office held it as if it were no more than a cowherds hazel switch if they were like this devin thought awed looking up at the man who had been high priest of eanna in tigana when the ygrathens came if the leaders were all like this then there were truly great men here before the fall they couldnt have been so different from today he knew that rationally it was only twenty years ago however much might have changed and fallen away but even so it was hard not to feel daunted in the commanding presence of this man he turned from danoleon to alessan slight unprepossessing with his disorderly prematurely silvered hair and cool watchful eyes and the nondescript dusty roadstained riding clothes he wore but when he turned back to the high priest he saw that danoleon was squeezing his own eyes tightly shut as he drew a ragged breath and in that moment devin realized with a thrill that was oddly akin to pain where despite all appearances the truth of power lay between these men it was danoleon he remembered who had taken the boy alessan the last prince of tigana south and away in hiding across the mountains all those years ago and would not have seen him again since that time there was grey in the hair of the tired man who stood before the high priest now danoleon would be seeing that trying to deal with it devin found himself hurting for the two of them he thought about the years all the lost years that had tumbled and spun and drifted like leaves or snow between these two then and now he wished he were older a wiser man with a deeper understandbig there seemed to be so many truths or realizations of late hovering at the edge of his awareness waiting to be grasped and claimed just out of reach we have guests torre said in his brusque manner three musicians a newly formed company hah the priest with the medicinetray grunted with a sour expression newly formed theyd have to be to venture here and this early in the year i cant remember the last time someone of any talent showed up in this sanctuary can you three play anything that wont clear a room of people eh it depends on the people said alessan mildly danoleon smiled though he seemed to be trying not to he turned to the other priest idrisi it is just barely possible that if we offered a warmer welcome we might be graced with visitors happier to display their art the other man grunted what might or might not have been an apology under the scrutiny of that placid blue gaze danoleon turned back to the three of them you will forgive us he murmured his voice was deep and soothing we have had some disconcerting news recently and right now we have a patient in some pain idrisi di corte here our physician tends to be distressed when such is the case privately devin doubted if distress had much to do with the cortean priests rudeness but he kept his peace alessan accepted danoleons apology with a short bow i am sorry to hear that he said to idrisi is it possible we might be of aid music has long been known as a sovereign ease for pain we should be happy to play for any of your patients he was ignoring for the moment devin noted the news danoleon had mentioned it was unlikely to be an accident that danoleon had given them idrisis formal name making clear that he was from corte the physician shrugged as you please she is certainly not sleeping and it can do no harm she is almost out of my hands now in any case the high priest has had her brought here against my will not that i can do very much anymore in truth she belongs to morian now he turned to danoleon if they tire her out fine if she sleeps it is a blessing i will be in the infirmary or in my garden ill check in here tonight unless i have word from you before will you not stay to hear us play then alessan asked we might surprise you idrisi grimaced i have no leisure for such things tonight in the dining hall perhaps surprise me he flashed a small unexpected smile gone as quickly as it appeared and went past them with brisk irritated strides out the door there was a short silence he is a good man danoleon said softly almost apologetically he is a cortean torre muttered darkly the high priest shook his handsome head he is a good man he repeated it angers him when people die in his care his gaze went back to alessan his hand shifted a little on his staff he opened his mouth to speak my lord my name is adreano dastibar alessan said firmly this is devin dasoli whose father garin you may perhaps remember from stevanien he waited danoleons blue eyes widened looking at devin and this alessan finished is our friend erlein di senzio who plays harp among other gifts of his hands as he spoke those last words alessan held up his left palm with two fingers curled down danoleon looked quickly at erlein and then back to the prince he had grown pale and devin was suddenly made aware that the high priest was a very old man eanna guard us all torre whispered from behind them alessan looked pointedly around at the open archways to the porches this particular patient is near death then i take it danoleons gaze devin thought seemed to be devouring alessan there was an almost palpable hunger in it the need of a starving man im afraid she is he said keeping his tone steady only with an obvious effort i have given her my own chamber that she might be able to hear the prayers in the temple the infirmary and her own rooms are both too far away alessan nodded his head he seemed to have himself on a tightly held leash his movements and his words rigidly controlled he lifted the tregean pipes in their brown leather sheath and looked down at them then perhaps we should go in and make music for her it sounds as if the afternoon prayers are done they were the chanting had stopped in the fields behind the house the boys of the outer school were still running and laughing in the sunlight devin could hear them through the open doorways he hesitated unsure of himself then coughed awkwardly and said perhaps you might like to play alone for her the pipes are soothing they may help her fall asleep danoleon was nodding his head in anxious agreement but alessan turned back to look at devin and then at erlein his expression was veiled unreadable what he said at length would you abandon me so soon after our company is formed and then more softly there will be nothing said that you cannot know and some things perhaps that you should hear but she is dying devin protested feeling something wrong here something out of balance she is dying and she is he stopped himself alessans eyes were so strange she is dying and she is my mother he whispered i know that is why i want you there there seems to be some news as well we had better hear it he turned and walked towards the bedroom door danoleon was standing just before it alessan stopped before the high priest and they looked at each other the prince whispered something devin could not hear he leaned forward and kissed the old man on the cheek then he went past him at the door he paused for a moment and drew a long steadying breath he lifted a hand as if to run it through his hair but stopped himself a queer smile crossed his face as if chasing a memory a bad habit that he murmured to no one in particular then he opened the door and went in and they followed him the high priests bedchamber was almost as large as the sitting room in the front but its furnishings were starkly simple two armchairs a pair of rustic worn carpets a washstand a writing desk a trunk for storage a small privy set apart in the southeastern corner there was a fireplace in the northern wall twin to the one in the front room sharing the same chimney this side was lit despite the mildness of the day and so the room was wanner though both windows were open curtains drawn back to admit some slanting light from under the eaves of the porticoes to the west the bed on the back wall under the silver star of eanna was large for danoleon was a big man but it too was simple and unadorned no canopy plain pinewood posts in the four corners and a pine headboard it was also empty devin nervously following alessan and the high priest through the door had expected to see a dying woman there he looked more than a little embarrassed towards the door of the privy and almost jumped with shock when a voice spoke from the shadows by the fire where the light from the windows did not fall who are these strangers alessan himself had turned unerringly toward the fire the moment he entered the room guided by what sense devin never knew and so he appeared controlled and unsurprised when that cold voice spoke or when a woman moved forward from the shadows to stand by one of the armchairs and then sit down upon it her back very straight her head held high looking at him at all of them pasithea di tigana bren serazi wife to valentin the prince she must have been a woman of unsurpassed beauty in her youth for that beauty still showed even here even now at the threshold of the last portal of morian she was tall and very thin though part of that clearly was due to the illness wasting her from within it showed in her face which was pale almost to translucence the cheekbones thrust into too sharp relief her robe had a high stiff collar which covered her throat the robe itself was crimson accentuating her unnatural otherworldly pallor it was as if devin thought she had already crossed to morian and was looking back at them from a farther shore but there were golden rings very much of this world on her long fingers and one dazzling blue gem gleamed from a necklace that hung down over her robe her hair was gathered and bound up in a black net a style long out of fashion in the palm devin knew with absolute certainty that current fashion would mean nothing less than nothing to this woman her eyes looked at him just then with swift unsettling appraisal before moving on to erlein and then resting finally upon her son the son she had not seen since he was fourteen years old her eyes were grey like alessans but they were harder than his glittering and cold hiding their depths as if some semiprecious stone had been caught and set just below the surface they glinted fierce and challenging in the light of the room and just before she spoke again not even waiting for an answer to her first question devin realized that what they were seeing in those eyes was rage it was in the arrogant face in the high carriage and the fingers that held hard to the arms of her chair an inner fire of anger that had passed long ago beyond the realm of words or any other form of expression she was dying and in hiding while the man who had killed her husband ruled her land it was there it was all there for anyone who knew but half the tale devin swallowed and fought an urge to draw back toward the door out of range a moment later he realized that he neednt bother as far as the woman in the chair was concerned he was a cipher a nothing he wasnt even there her question had not been meant to be answered she didnt really care who they were she had someone else to deal with for a long time a sequence of moments that seemed to hang forever in the silence she looked alessan up and down without speaking her white imperious features quite unreadable at last slowly shaking her head she said your father was such a handsome man devin flinched at the words and the tone but alessan seemed scarcely to react at all he nodded in calm agreement i know he was i remember and so were my brothers he smiled a small ironic smile the strain must have run out just before it got to me his voice was mild but when he finished he glanced sharply at danoleon and the high priest read a message there he in turn murmured something to torre who quickly left the room to stand guard in front devin realized feeling a chill despite the fire words had just been spoken here that could kill them all he looked over at erlein and saw that the wizard had slipped his harp out of its case his expression grim the senzian took a position near the eastern window and quietly began tuning his instrument of course devin thought erlein knew what he was doing they had come in here ostensibly to play for a dying woman it would be odd if no music emerged from this room on the other hand he didnt much feel like singing just now musicians the woman in the chair said with contempt to her son how splendid have you come to play a jingle for me now to show me how skillful you are in such an important thing to ease a mothers soul before i die there was something almost unbearable in her tone alessan did not move though he too had gone pale now in no other way did he betray his tension though save perhaps in the almost too casual stance the exaggerated simulation of ease if it would please you my lady mother i will play for you he said quietly there was a time i can remember when the prospect of music would indeed have brought you pleasure the eyes of the woman in the chair glittered coldly there was a time for music when we ruled here when the men of our family were men in more than name oh i know said alessan a little sharply true men and wondrous proud all of them men who would have stormed the ramparts of chiara alone and killed brandin long ago if only through his abject terror at their ferocious determination mother can you not let it rest even now we are the last of our family and we have not spoken in nineteen years his voice changed softened grew unexpectedly awkward must we wrangle yet can our speech be no more than the letters were did you ask me here simply to say again what you have written so many times the old woman shook her head arrogant and grim implacable as the death that had come for her no not that she said i have not so much breath in me to waste i summoned you here to receive a mothers dying curse upon your blood no devin exclaimed before he could stop himself in the same second danoleon took a long stride forward my lady no indeed he said anguish in his deep voice this is not i am dying pasithea bren serazi interrupted harshly there were spots of bright unnatural color in her cheeks i do not have to listen to you anymore danoleon to anyone wait you told me all these years be patient you said well i have no more time for patience i will be dead in a day morian waits for me i have no more time to linger while my craven child gambols about the palm playing ditties at rustic weddings there came a discordant jangling of harpstrings that said erlein di senzio from the eastern window is ignorant and unfair he stopped as if startled by his own outburst triad knows i have no cause to love your son and it is now more than clear to me whence his arrogance comes and his lack of care for other lives for anything but his own goals but if you name him a coward simply for not trying to kill brandin of ygrath then you are dying a vain foolish woman which to be perfectly frank does not surprise me at all in this province he leaned back against the ledge breathing hard looking at no one in the silence that followed alessan finally moved his stillness had seemed inhuman unnatural now he sank to his knees beside his mothers chair you have cursed me before he said gravely remember i have lived much of my life in the shadow of that in many ways it would have been easier to die years ago baerd and i slain trying to kill the tyrant in chiara perhaps even killing him through some miracle of intervention do you know we used to speak of it at night every single night when we were in quileia still boys shaping half a hundred different plans for an assassination on the island dreaming of how we would be loved and honored after death in a province with its name restored because of us his voice was low almost hypnotic in its cadences devin saw danoleon his face working with emotion sink back into the other armchair pasithea was still as marble as expressionless and cold devin moved quietly toward the fire in a vain attempt to quell the shivering that had come over him erlein was still by the window he was playing his harp again softly single notes and random chords not quite a tune but we grew older alessan went on and an urgency a terrible need to be understood had come into his voice and one midsummers eve marius became year king in quileia with our aid after that when we three spoke the talk was different baerd and i began to learn some true things about power and the world and that was when it changed for me something new came to me in that time building and building a thought a dream larger and deeper than trying to kill a tyrant we came back to the palm and began to travel as musicians yes and as artisans merchants athletes one time in a triad game year as masons and builders guards to a senzian banker sailors on a dozen different merchantships but even before those journeys had begun mother even before we came back north over the mountains it had all changed for me i was finally clear about what my task in life was to be about what had to be done or tried you know it danoleon knows i wrote you years ago what my new understanding was and i begged your blessing for it it was such a simple truth we had to take both tyrants together that this whole peninsula might again be free his mothers voice overrode his steady passion then harsh implacable unforgiving i remember i remember the day that letter came and i will tell you again what i wrote you then to that harlots castle in certando you would buy cortes freedom and astibars and tregeas at the price of tiganas name of our very existence in the world at the cost of everything we ever had or were before brandin came at the price of vengeance and our pride our pride alessan echoed so softly now they could barely hear oh our pride i grew up knowing all about our pride mother you taught me even more than father did but i learned something else later as a man in my exile i learned about astibars pride about senzios and asolis and certandos i learned how pride had ruined the palm in the year the tyrants came the palm pasithea demanded her voice shrill what is the palm a spur of land rock and earth and water what is a peninsula that we should care for it what is tigana erlein di senzio asked bluntly his harp silent in his hands pasitheas glance was withering i would have thought a bound wizard should know that she said corrosively meaning to wound devin blinked at the speed of her perception no one had told her about erlein she had deduced it in minutes from a scattering of clues she said tigana is the land where adaon lay with micaela when the world was young and gave her his love and a child and a gods gift of power to that child and those who came after and now the world has spun a long way from that night and the last descendant of that union is in this room with the entire past of his people falling through his hands she leaned forward her grey eyes blazing her voice rising in indictment falling through his hands he is a fool and a coward both there is so much more than freedom in a peninsula in any single generation at stake in this she fell back coughing pulling a square of blue silk from a pocket in her robe devin saw alessan begin a movement up from his knees and then check himself his mother coughed rackingly and devin saw before he could turn his eyes away that the silk came away red when she was done on the carpet beside her alessan bowed his head erlein di senzio from the far side of the room perhaps too far to see the blood said and shall i now tell you the legends of senzios preeminence of astibars will you hear me sing the story of eanna on the island shaping the stars from the glory of her lovemaking with the god do you know certandos claim to be the heart and soul of the palm do you remember the carlozzini the night walkers in their highlands two hundred years ago the woman in the armchair pushed herself straight again glaring at him fearing her hating her words and manner and the terrible thing she was doing to her son devin nonetheless felt humbled in the face of so much courage and such a force of will but that is the point she said more softly sparing her strength that is the heart of this can you not see it i do remember those stories anyone with an education or a library any fool who has ever heard a troubadours sentimental wailing can remember them can hear twenty different songs of eanna and adaon on sangarios not us though dont you see not tigana anymore who will sing of micaela under the stars by the sea when we are gone who will be here to sing when one more generation has lived and died away in the world i will said devin his hands at his sides he saw alessans head come up as pasithea turned to fix him with her cold eyes we all will he said as firmly as he could he looked at the prince and then forcing himself back to the dying old woman raging in her pride the whole palm will hear that song again my lady because your son is not a coward nor some vain fool seeking a young death and shallow fame he is trying for the larger thing and he is going to do it something has happened this spring and because of it he is going to do what he has said he will do free this peninsula and bring back tiganas name into the world he finished breathing in hard gasps as if he had been running a race a moment later he felt himself go crimson with mortification pasithea bren serazi was laughing mocking him her frail thin body rocking in the chair her high laughter turned into another desperate fit of coughing the blue silk came up and when it was withdrawn there was a great deal of blood stain she clutched at the arms of her chair to steady herself you are a child she pronounced finally and my son is a child for all the grey in his hair and i have no doubt that baerd bar saevar is exactly the same with half the grace and the gifts his father had something has happened this spring she mimicked with cruel precision her voice grew hard and cold as midwinter ice do you infants have any idea what has really just happened in the palm slowly her son rose from his knees to stand before her we have been riding for a number of days and nights we have heard no tidings what is it i told you there was news danoleon said quickly but i had no chance to give you the i am pleased pasithea interrupted so very pleased it seems i still have something to tell my son before i leave him forever something he hasnt learned or thought out all by himself already she pushed herself erect again in the chair her eyes cold and bright like frost under blue moonlight there was something wild and lost in her voice though trying to break through some terrible fear and of more than death she said a messenger came yesterday at sunset at the end of the ember days an ygrathen riding from stevanien with news from chiara news so urgent brandin had sent it by his sorcerous link to all his governors with instructions to spread the tidings and the tidings are alessan had braced himself as if preparing to receive a blow the tidings the tidings my feckless child are that brandin has just abdicated as king of ygrath he is sending his army home and his governors all those who choose to stay with him must become citizens of this peninsula of a new dominion the kingdom of the western palm chiara corte asoli lower corte four provinces under brandin on the island he has announced that we are free of ygrath no longer a colony taxes are to be shared equally among us now and they have been cut in half beginning yesterday cut by considerably more than half here in lower corte our burden will now be equal with the others the messenger said that the people of this province the people your father ruled were singing brandins name in the streets of stevanien alessan moving very carefully as if he were carrying something large and heavy that might shift and fall turned toward danoleon who was nodding his head it seems that there was an assassination attempt on the island three days ago the high priest said originating in ygrath the queen and brandins son the regent it apparently failed only because of one of his tribute women the one from certando who almost started a war you may remember that twelve fourteen years ago it seems that in the wake of this brandin has changed his mind about what he has been doing not about staying in the palm or about tigana and his revenge but about what must be done in ygrath if he continues here and he is going to continue here pasithea said tigana will die still be lost forever to his vengeance but our people will be singing the tyrants name as it dies the name of the man who killed your father alessan was nodding his head reflexively he seemed in fact scarcely to be listening as if he had suddenly withdrawn entirely inside himself pasithea fell silent in the face of that looking at her son it grew deathly still in the room outside far away the uncontrolled shouts and laughter of the children in the field came to their ears again the louder for the silence within devin listened to that distant mirth and tried to slow the chaos of his heart to attempt to deal with what they had just heard he looked at erlein who had laid down his harp on the windowledge and walked a few steps into the room his expression troubled and wary devin tried desperately to think to gather his scattered thoughts but the news had caught him hopelessly unprepared free of ygrath which was what they wanted wasnt it except that it wasnt brandin was staying they were not free of him or the weight of his magic and tigana what of tigana now and then quite unexpectedly there was something else bothering him something different a distracting niggling awareness tugging at the corner of his mind telling him there was something he should know should remember then equally without warning the something slid forward and into place in fact in fact he knew exactly what was wrong devin closed his eyes for a moment fighting a sudden paralyzing fear then as quietly as he could he began working his way along the western wall away from the fireplace where he had been standing all this time alessan was speaking now almost to himself he said this changes things of course it changes a great deal im going to need time to think it through but i believe it may actually help us this may truly be a gift not a curse how are you genuinely simple his mother snapped they are singing the tyrants name in the streets of avalle devin winced at the old name the desperate pain at the heart of that cry but he forced himself to keep moving a terrifying certainty was rising within him i hear you i understand but dont you see alessan dropped to his knees on the carpet again close to his mothers chair the ygrathen army is going home if he has to fight a war it will have to be with an army of our people and what few ygrathens stay with him what oh mother what do you think the barbadian in astibar will do when he hears this he will do nothing pasithea said flatly alberico is a timorous man spun neckdeep in his own webs all of which lead back to the emperors tiara at least a quarter of the ygrathen army will stay with brandin and those people singing are the most oppressed people in the peninsula if they are joyous what do you think is happening elsewhere do you not imagine an army can be raised in chiara and corte and asoli to fight against barbadior for a man who has renounced his own kingdom for this peninsula she began coughing again her body rocking even more harshly than before devin didnt know the answer he couldnt even begin to guess he knew that the balance had completely shifted the balance alessan had spoken about and played with for so long he also knew something else he reached the window its ledge was about the height of his chest he was a small man not for the first time he regretted it then he gave thanks for his compensations offered a quick prayer to eanna and hands flat on the ledge for leverage pushed upward hard and swung himself like a gymnast through to the portico he heard pasithea still coughing behind him a hard painful sound danoleon cried out he stumbled and fell crashing into a pillar with his shoulder and hip he pushed up and off scrambling to his feet in time to see a figure in beige robes leap up from a crouch beside the window swearing furiously and sprint away devin grappled for the knife at his belt a blind thoughtobliterating rage rising in him it had been too uproarious in the games field the same sound as before when the priest had left them alone only this time the priest had left them alone while he spied on this room alessan was at the window erlein just behind him savandi devin gasped he was listening he spat the words over his shoulder because he was already running after the other man he spared a fleeting moment of thanks and wonder for whatever rinaldo the healer had done to his leg in that certandan barn then anger swept over him again and fear and the absolute need to catch the other man he vaulted the stone balustrade at the back end of the portico without breaking stride savandi sprinting for all he was worth had cut west toward the back of the sanctuary grounds in the distance on their left devin could see the children playing in the field he gritted his teeth and ran these cursed priests he was thinking fury almost choking him will they undo everything even now if alessans identity became known anywhere in this sanctuary devin had little doubt how swiftly that knowledge would reach brandin of ygrath he had no doubts at all about what would happen then and then he was assailed by another whirling thought one that terrified him he drove himself to even greater speed legs pumping his lungs sucking for air the mindlink what if savandi could link to the king what if brandins spy could directly contact him in chiara now devin cursed in the depths of his heart but not aloud sparing his breath for speed savandi lithe and quick himself raced down the path past a small building on the left and cut sharply right about twenty strides ahead of devin around the back part of the temple itself devin sped around the corner savandi was nowhere to be seen he froze for a moment seized by panic there was no door into the temple here and only a thick barrier of hedges just coming into green on the left then he saw where the hedges were quivering and he leaped for that spot there was a gap forced low down he dropped to his knees and scrambled through scratching his arms and face he was in a cloistered area large beautifully serene gracefully laid out with a splashing fountain at the center he had no time to value such things though at the northwest corner the cloister gave onto another portico and a long building with a small domed roof at the near end savandi was just now sprinting up the steps to the portico and then through a doorway into the building devin looked up at one secondstory window an old man could be seen white haired and hollowcheeked gazing down without expression on the sunlit cloister running flat out for the doorway devin realized where he was this was the infirmary and the small dome would be a temple for the sick who sought the comfort of eanna but could not venture down the path to her larger dome he took the three steps to the portico in one flying leap and burst through the doorway knife in hand he was aware that following so fast he was an easy target for an ambush if savandi chose to lie in wait he didnt think that would happen though which only increased his deeper fear the man seemed to be racing away from where his fellow priests might be found in the temple itself the kitchens the dormitory or the dining room which meant that he didnt expect help or aid that he couldnt really be hoping to escape which meant in turn that there was probably only one thing he was going to try to do if devin gave him enough time the doorway gave onto a long corridor and a stairway leading upward savandi was out of sight but devin glancing down gave a quick prayer of thanks to eanna running across the damp ground of the cloister the priest had picked up mud on his shoes the trail was unmistakable on the stone floor and it went down the corridor and not up the stairs devin sped in pursuit flying down the hallway skidding into a left turn around a corner at the far end there were rooms at intervals all along and an arched entrance to the infirmarys small temple at the opposite end most of the doors were open most of the rooms were empty but then in that short corridor he came to one closed door savandis trail led there and stopped devin clutched the handle and threw his shoulder hard against the heavy wood locked immovable sobbing for breath he dropped to his knees grappling in his pocket for the twist of wire he was never without not since marra had been alive since she had taught him all he knew about locks he untwisted and tried to shape the wire but his hands were trembling sweat streamed into his eyes he wiped it furiously away and fought for calm he had to get this door open before the man inside sent the message that would destroy them all an exterior door opened behind him steps thudded quickly down the hallway without looking up devin said the man who touches or hinders me dies savandi is a spy for the king of ygrath find me a key for this door it is done came a voice he knew it is open go devin flung a glance over his shoulder and saw erlein di senzio standing there with a sword in his hand springing to his feet devin twisted the handle again the door swung open he charged into the room there were jars and vials lining shelves around the walls and instruments on tables savandi was there on a bench in the middle of the room hands at his temples visibly straining to concentrate plague rot your soul devin screamed at the top of his voice savandi seemed to snap awake he rose with a feral snarl grabbing for a surgical blade on the table beside him he never reached it still screaming devin was upon him his left hand gouging at the priests eyes he slashed forward and up with his right in a hard and deadly arc plunging his blade in between savandis ribs once he stabbed and then again raking savagely upward feeling the blade twist grinding against bone with a sickening sensation the young priests mouth gaped open his eyes widened in astonishment he screamed high and short his hands flying outward from his sides and then he died devin released him and collapsed on the bench fighting for breath blood pounded in his head he could feel a vein pulsing at his temple his vision blurred for a moment and he closed his eyes when he opened them he saw that his hands were still shaking erlein had sheathed his sword he moved to stand beside devin did did he send devin found that he couldnt even speak properly no the wizard shook his head you came in time he didnt link no message went devin stared down at the blank staring eyes and the body of the young priest who had sought to betray them how long he wondered how long was he doing this how did you get here he asked erlein his voice hoarse his hands were still shaking he dropped the bloodied knife with a clatter on the tabletop i followed from the bedchamber saw which way you went until i lost you around the back of the temple then i needed magic i traced savandis aura here we came through the hedges and across the cloister he was trying to shake me i can see that youre bleeding again doesnt matter devin took a deep breath there were footsteps in the corridor outside why did you come why do this for us erlein looked defensive for an instant but quickly regained his sardonic expression for you dont be a fool devin i die if alessan does im bound remember this was selfpreservation nothing else devin looked up at him wanting to say something more something important but just then the footsteps reached the doorway and danoleon entered quickly with torre close behind neither of them said a word taking in the scene he was trying to mindlink with brandin devin said erlein and i got to him in time erlein made a dismissive sound devin did but i had to use a spell to follow them and another on the door i dont think they were strong enough to draw attention but in case there is a tracker anywhere around here we had better get moving before morning danoleon seemed not to have even heard he was looking down at savandis body there were tears on his face dont waste your grief on a carrion bird torre said harshly i must the high priest said softly leaning upon his staff i must dont you understand he was born in avalle he was one of us devin abruptly turned his head away he felt sick to his stomach hit by a resurgence of the raging white fury that had sped him here and had driven him to kill so violently one of us he remembered sandre dastibar in the cabin in the woods betrayed by his grandchild he was seriously afraid he was going to be ill one of us erlein di senzio laughed devin wheeled furiously around on him his hands clenched into fists and there must have been something murderous in his eyes for the wizard quickly sobered mockery leaving his face as if wiped away with a cloth there was a short silence danoleon drew himself up and straightened his massive shoulders he said this will have to be dealt with carefully or the story will spread we cant have savandis death traced to our guests torre when we leave lock this room with the body in it after dark when the others are asleep we will deal with him hell be missed at dinner torre said no he wont you are the porter you will see him ride through the gate late this afternoon he will be going to see his family it fits just after the ember days and in the wake of the news from chiara he has ridden out often enough and not always with my permission i think i have an idea why now i wonder if he ever really rode to his fathers house unfortunately for savandi this time he is going to be killed by someone on the road just outside our valley there was a hardness to the high priests voice that devin had not heard before one of us he looked down at the dead man again his third killing but this one was different the guard in the nievolene barn the soldier in the hill pass they had been doing what they had come to the palm to do loyal to the power they served hiding nothing of their nature true to their manifest cause he had grieved for their dying for the lines of life that had brought him together with them savandi was otherwise this death was different devin searched his soul and found that he could not grieve for what he had done it was all he could do he realized with a sense of real uneasiness to refrain from plunging his dagger again in the corpse it was as if the young priests corrosive treachery to his people his smiling deceit had tapped some violence of passion devin hadnt known lay within him almost exactly he thought suddenly the way that alienor of castle borso had done in a very different sphere of life or perhaps at the heart of things not so very different after all but that was too hard too dangerous a knot to try to untie just now in the staring presence of death which reminded him of something made him suddenly aware of an absence he looked quickly up at danoleon wheres alessan he said sharply why didnt he follow but even before he was answered he knew there could only be one reason in the world why the prince hadnt come the high priest looked down at him he is still in my chamber with his mother though i am afraid it may be over by now no devin said oh no and rose and went to the door and into the corridor and then out through the eastern doorway of the infirmary into the slanting light of late afternoon and began again to run along the back curve of the temple dome past the same small building as before and a little garden he hadnt noticed coming here then back flying down the path to the high priests house and up onto the portico between the pillars as if rewinding events like a ball of wool to the window through which he had leaped such a little while ago as if he could race back not only past savandi past their coming here but all the way back with a sudden incoherent longing to where the seeds of this grief had been planted when the tyrants came but time was not rewound neither in the heart nor in the world as they knew it it moved on and things changed for better or for worse seasons changed the hours of sunlit day went by darkness fell and lingered and gave way to light at dawn years spun after each other one by one people were born and lived by the triads grace and they died and they died alessan was still in the room still on his knees on the simple carpet but beside the bed now not by the heavy dark oak chair as before he had moved time had moved the sun was further west along the curving sky devin had wanted to somehow run his way back through the moments that had passed that alessan might not have been left alone not with this on his first day in tigana since he was a boy he was no longer a boy there was grey in his hair time had run twenty years worth of time had run and he was home again and his mother lay on the high priests bed alessans two hands were laced around one of her own cradling it gently as one might hold a small bird that would die of fright if clutched too fast but would fly away forever if released devin must have made some kind of sound at the window for the prince looked up their eyes met devin ached inside wordless with sorrow his heart felt bruised besieged he felt hopelessly inadequate to the needs of such a time as this now was he wished that baerd were here or sandre even catriana would know what to do better than he he said he is dead savandi we caught him in time alessan nodded acknowledging this then his gaze went down again to his mothers face serene now as it had not been before as it very likely had not been for the last long years of her life time moving inexorably forward for her taking memory taking pride taking love im sorry devin said alessan im so sorry the prince looked up again the grey eyes clear but terribly far away chasing images backward along a skein of years he looked as if he would speak but did not instead after another moment he gave his small shrug the calm reassuring motion of acceptance of shouldering another burden that they all knew so well devin suddenly felt as if he could not bear it anymore alessans quiet acquiescence was as a final blow in his own heart he felt torn open wounded by the hard truths of the world by the passing of things he lowered his head to the windowsill and wept like a child in the presence of something too large for his capacity in the room alessan knelt in silence by the bed holding his mothers hand between his own and the westering sun of afternoon sent light in a golden slant through the window and across the chamber floor to fall upon him upon the bed upon the woman lying there upon the golden coins that covered her grey eyes chapter spring came early in astibar town it almost always did along that sheltered northwestern side of the province overlooking the bay and the strungout islands of the archipelago east and south the unblocked winds from the sea pushed the start of the growing season back a few weeks and kept the smaller fishing boats close to shore this early in the year senzio was already flowering the traders in astibar harbor reported the white blossoms of the sejoia trees making the air fragrant with the promise of summer to come chiara was still cold it was said but that happened sometimes in early spring on the island it wouldnt be long before the breezes from khardhun gentled the air and the seas around her senzio and chiara alberico of barbadior lay down at night thinking about them and rose up in the morning doing the same after intense agitated nights of little rest shot through with lurid disturbing dreams if the winter had been unsettling rife with small incidents and rumors the events of early spring were something else entirely and there was nothing small nothing only marginally provocative about them everything seemed to be happening at once coming down from his bedchamber to his offices of state alberico would find his mood darkening with every step in the apprehensive anticipation of what might next be reported to him the windows of the palace were open now to let the mild breezes sweep through it had been some time since it had been warm enough to do that and for much of the autumn and winter there had been bodies rotting on deathwheels in the square sandreni bodies nievolene scalvaiane a dozen poets wheeled at random not conducive to opening windows that necessary though and lucrative after his confiscation of the conspirators lands he liked when necessity and gain came together it didnt happen often but when it did the marriage seemed to alberico of barbadior to represent almost the purest pleasure to be found in power this spring however his pleasures had been few and trivial in scope and the burgeoning of new troubles made those of the winter seem like minor ephemeral afflictions brief flurries of snow in a night what he was dealing with now were rivers in flood everywhere he looked at the very beginning of spring a wizard was detected using his magic in the southern highlands but the tracker and the twentyfive men siferval had immediately sent after him had been slaughtered in a pass by outlaws to the last man an act of arrogance and revolt almost impossible to believe and he couldnt even properly exact retribution the villages and farms scattered through the highlands hated the outlaws as much or more than the barbadians did and it had been an ember night with no decent man abroad to see who might have done this unprecedented deed siferval sent a hundred men from fort ortiz to hunt the brigands down they found no trace only long dead campfires in the hills it was as if the twentyfive men had been slain by ghosts which predictably is what the people of the highlands were already saying it had been an ember night after all and everyone knew the dead were abroad on such nights the dead hungry for retribution how clever of the dead to use newfletched arrows sifervals written report had offered sardonically when he sent two captains to carry the tidings north his men had retreated quickly in wheyfaced terror at the expression on albericos face it was after all the third company which had allowed twentyfive of its men to be killed and had then sent out another hundred incompetents to do no more than elicit laughter wandering about in the hills it was maddening alberico had been forced to fight back an urge to torch the certandan hamlet nearest to those hills but he knew how destructive that would be in the longer run it would undermine all the benefits of the focused restraint hed used in the affair of the sandreni plot that night his eyelid began to droop again the way it had in the early autumn then very shortly after came the news from quileia he had nourished such hopes there after the shocking fall of the matriarchy it was such an enormous ripe new market for trade an absolute harvest for the empire and one most importantly that would be brought into barbadiors aegis by that ever vigilant guardian of the western borders of the empire alberico of the eastern palm so much rich hope and promise there and so little actual prospect of difficulty even if this marius this crippled priestesskiller on his precarious throne chose to trade west with ygrath as well as east that was all right quileia was more than large enough to offer bounty both ways for a time soon enough it should be possible to make the uncouth fellow see the manyfaceted advantages of focusing his dealings towards barbadior in the evolution of the barbadian empire there had emerged a number of ways a great many timehonored ways some subtle some rather less so of causing men to see things in a particular light alberico had a few thoughts of his own about even newer means of persuading petty monarchs to view matters usefully he fully intended to explore them once he was home home as emperor for that after all was the point the point of absolutely everything except that the events of the spring utterly refused to cooperate marius of quileia sent a gratifyingly swift reply to albericos latest benevolent offer to trade an emissary delivered it directly into the hands of siferval in fort ortiz unfortunately that brief gratification had been smashed and annihilated when the letter reached astibar carried north this time in recognition of its importance by siferval himself couched in unexpectedly sophisticated language it contained a message that however politely and circuitously phrased was flat and clear the quileian regretfully judged that brandin of ygrath was the greater firmer power in the palm and as such and being but green in his own power he could not risk incurring the anger of the king of ygrath by trading with alberico a minor lord of the empire much as he might want to it was a letter that could easily drive a man into a killing rage fighting for selfcontrol alberico had seen cringing apprehension in his clerks and advisors and even a quickly veiled fear in the eyes of the captain of the third company then when siferval handed over the second letter the one he explained that he had so cleverly arranged to extract and copy from the saddle pouch of the overly garrulous quileian emissary alberico felt all control deserting him he had been forced to turn away to stride alone to the windows at the back of the offices of state and draw gasping breaths of air to calm his boiling mind he could feel the telltale tremor beginning again in his right eyelid the fluttering hed never been able to get rid of since that night hed almost died in the sandreni woods his huge hands grasping the windowledge with a grip of iron he struggled for the equanimity that would let him carefully weigh the implications of this intercepted message but calm was a swiftly receding illusion and his thoughts in the morning sunlight were black and foaming like the sea in storm senzio the quileian fool sought to link himself with those dissolute puppets in the ninth province it was almost impossible to credit that a man however new to the world stage could be such an imbecile his back to his advisors and his captains staring blindly out the window down upon the too bright grand square alberico abruptly began to consider how this was going to look to the wider world to the part of the world that mattered the emperor and those who had his ear and who saw themselves as rivals to alberico how would the tidings be read if brandin of ygrath was busily trading south if senzian merchants were blithely sailing past the archipelago and down the coast beyond tregea and the mountains to quileian ports and all the fabled goods of that land so long kept to themselves under the priestesses if the empire alone was denied access to this new market denied access because alberico of barbadior was judged too infirm in his power here as compared to the ygrathen in the west alberico felt himself beginning to sweat a cold trickle of moisture slid down his side there was a spasm of pain in his chest as a muscle clenched near his heart he forced himself to breathe slowly until it passed from the source of so much promise it suddenly seemed as if a dagger had materialized more sharp and deadly than any enemy of his back in barbadior might have fashioned senzio he had been thinking and dreaming about the ninth province all through the months of ice and snow seeking a way in his restless nights to break out to regain control of a situation that increasingly seemed to be operating upon him instead of he upon it as master of his destiny and that had been in the winter even before this news from beyond the mountains then shortly after even as the first flowers began blooming in the gardens of astibar there was more in the very same week word came from the west that someone had tried to kill brandin of ygrath had tried and failed for one blissful night alberico played out glorious scenarios of triumph in his sleep dreaming over and over again so keen was the pleasure that the assassin using a crossbow they had learned had succeeded in his purpose oh it would have been so perfect it would have been timed so flawlessly for him dovetailing so neatly with his needs it would have had to be seen as a gift a shining upon his face from the high gods of the empire the entire peninsula of the palm would have been his in a year in half a year quileias crippled monarch needing the outer world so desperately would have had to embrace whatever terms of trade alberico then chose to offer him and the empire his a year after all of that at the very worst with such an unchallenged power base here he would not have even needed to wait for the ailing emperor to finally die he could have sailed home with his armies as the champion and the hero of the people having first showered them with grain with gold with freely flowing wine from the palm and all the newly rediscovered wealth of quileia it would have been glorious for that one night alberico let himself dream smiling in his sleep then he woke and came down the stairs again to the offices of state and found all three of his captains waiting grimfaced a new messenger was there with them from the west again a single day after the first with news that smashed twenty years of balancing into tiny sharpedged fragments that would never again be reassembled as they had been brandin had abdicated in ygrath and named himself king of the western palm on chiara the messenger reported trembling at his lords visage they had begun celebrating within hours of the announcement and the ygrathens karalius of the first asked sharply though he had no real right to speak most will go home the messenger said if they stay they must become citizens only equal citizens of the new kingdom you say they will go home alberico said his gaze flat and heavy masking the feverish churning of his emotions do you know this have you been told this or do you only guess it to be so the messenger turned grey stammering some reply about logic and obvious consequences and what anyone could predict have this mans tongue cut out then have him killed alberico said i dont care how feed him to the animals my messengers bring me the news they learn i draw what conclusions are to be drawn the messenger fainted dead away toppling sideways to the floor it could be seen that he had soiled himself grancial of the second company signaled quickly for two men to carry him out alberico didnt bother to watch in a way he was glad the man had spoken as fatuously as he had he had needed an excuse to kill just then he gestured with two fingers and his steward hastily ushered everyone out of the room but the three captains not that any of the lesser officials seemed inclined to linger at that particular moment which was as it should be he didnt trust any of them very much he didnt entirely trust his captains either but he needed them and they needed him and he had been careful to keep them at odds and on edge with each other it was a workable arrangement or it had been until now but now was what mattered and brandin had just thrown the peninsula into chaos not that the palm actually mattered not in itself it was a gateway a steppingstone he had moved out of barbadior as a young man in order to rise in the world and return as a leader in his prime and there was no point no point at all to twenty years of exile if he could not sail home in triumph in more than triumph in mastery he turned his back on the captains and went to the window surreptitiously massaging his eye he waited to see who would speak first and what he would say there was a fear growing within him that he was at pains to hide nothing was falling right none of his caution and discretion seemed to have borne the fruit it should karalius said very softly from behind him my lord there is opportunity here there is great opportunity which is exactly what he was afraid the man would say afraid because he knew it was true and because it meant moving again and quickly committing himself to dangerous decisive action but action here and not in the empire not back home where he had been readying himself to return war far away in this savage obdurate peninsula where he could lose all a lifetimes sowing in striving for a conquest he hardly cared about we had best go carefully grancial said quickly more to oppose karalius than anything else alberico knew but he noted that we he turned and fixed the second company captain with a wintry glance i will indeed do nothing without thought he said placing clear emphasis on the first word grancial flicked his eyes away siferval smiled beneath his curling blond moustaches karalius did not his expression remained sober and thoughtful he was the best of the three alberico knew also the most dangerous for the two things went hand in hand in such a man alberico moved around behind his huge oak desk and sat down again he looked up at the first company leader and waited karalius said again there is opportunity now there will be turmoil in the west disruption ygrathens sailing home shall i tell you what i think his pale skin was flushed with a growing excitement alberico understood that the man saw chances of his own land and wealth for himself it would be a mistake to let karalius unfold too much he would end up thinking the planning was his alberico said i know exactly what you think to the very words you would speak be silent i know everything that will be happening in the west except one thing we dont yet know how many of the ygrathen army will stay my guess is that most will leave rather than be lowered to the level of people they have had mastery over all these years they did not come here to become inconsequential figures in the palm neither said siferval pointedly did we alberico suppressed his anger yet again it seemed he had been forced to do that so much of late with these three but they had their own purposes their own long drawnout plans and wealth and fame were at the heart of them as they had to be for all ambitious men in the empire toward what else should an ambitious man aspire i am aware of that he said as calmly as he could then what do we do grancial asked a real question not a challenge grancial was the weakest and the most loyal because of that weakness of the three alberico looked up at karalius not at grancial you gather my armies he said deliberately though his pulse was racing very fast this was dangerous and might be final every instinct within him told him that but he also knew that time and the gods had thrown a glittering gem down toward him from the heavens and if he did not move it would fall away you gather my armies in all four provinces and take them north i want them massed together as soon as possible where karaliuss eyes were almost shining with anticipation ferraut of course on the northern border with senzio senzio he was thinking the ninth the jewel the battleground how long will it take you he asked the three of them five weeks no more grancial said quickly four said siferval smiling the first company said karalius will be on the border three weeks from now count on it i will said alberico and dismissed them he sat alone at his desk for a long time after toying with a paperweight thinking upon all sides of this over and around and about but however he looked upon it all the pieces seemed to slide into place there was power to be grasped here and triumph he could almost see that shimmering jewel falling through the air over water over land into his reaching hand he was acting shaping events himself not being impacted upon his enemy would be vulnerable enormously so until this new chaos settled in the west quileias choice could be forced and be no choice at all the empire could be made to see on the eve of his final journey home just what his sorcery and his armies could do the time was offering a jewel truly falling from the heavens waiting to be clasped to be set upon his brow he was still uneasy though almost uncannily so sitting alone as the morning brightened trying to convince himself of the truth of all this shining promise he was more than uneasy his mouth was dry and the spring sunlight seemed strange to him almost painful he wondered if he was ill there was something gnawing away like a rat in darkness at the unlit corners of his thoughts he forced himself to turn towards it trying to make a torch of his careful rationality to look within himself and root out this anxiety and then indeed he did see it and understood in that same moment that it could not be rooted out not ever be acknowledged to a living soul for the truth the poisonous gall of truth was that he was afraid deathly afraid in the deepest inward places of his being of this other man of brandin of ygrath now brandin of the western palm the name had been changed the balance changed utterly the truth of fear was exactly as it had been for almost twenty years a short while later he left the room and went down the stairs and underground to see how they killed the messenger alais knew exactly why she was being granted this unprecedented gift of a journey in the sea maid with her father selvena was getting married at the end of summer catini bar edinio whose father owned a goodsized estate of olive trees and vineyards north of astibar and a modest but successful banking house in the city had asked rovigo for his second daughters hand early in the spring rovigo urgently forewarned by his second daughter had given his consent a decision calculated among other things to forestall selvenas oftproclaimed intention to do away with herself should she still be living at home and unwed by the autumn catini was earnest and pleasant if a little dull and rovigo had done business with edinio in the past and liked the man selvena was tempestuously ecstatic about plans for the wedding about the prospect of running her own home edinio had offered to set the young couple up in a small house on a hill above his vineyards and as rovigo overheard her telling the younger girls one evening about the anticipated pleasures of the marriage bed he was pleased for her happiness and rather looking forward to the celebration of the marriage if he had moments of sadness that he strove to mask he attributed it to the natural feelings of a man who saw that his girlchild had become a woman rather sooner than he had been prepared for the sight of selvena making a red glove for her bridal night affected rovigo more than he had thought it would he would turn from her bright feverish chatter to alais neat and quiet and watchful and something akin to sadness would touch his spirit amid the anticipatory bustle of the house alix seemed to understand perhaps even better than he did himself his wife had taken to patting his shoulder at sporadic unexpected moments as if gentling a restive creature he was restive this spring the news from the wider world was unpredictable and of seemingly enormous consequence barbadian troops were beginning to clog the roads as they moved up to northern ferraut on the border of senzio from the newly declared kingdom of the western palm had come no clear response as yet to this provocation or none that had reached astibar rovigo hadnt heard a word from alessan since well before the ember days but he had been told a long time ago that this spring might mark the beginning of something new and something was in the air a sense of quickening and of change that fit itself to the mood of burgeoning spring and then went beyond it into danger and the potential for violence he seemed to hear it and see it everywhere in the tramp of armies on the march in the lowered voices of men in taverns looking up too quickly whenever anyone came through the door one morning when he woke rovigo had an image that lingered in his mind of the great floods of solidly packed river ice he had glimpsed many years ago far to the south on a long voyage down the coast of quileia and in his mindpicture as he lay in bed suspended between asleep and fully awake he had seemed to see that ice breaking up and the river waters beginning to run again carrying the floes crashing and grinding down to the sea over khav that same morning standing in the kitchen he had announced that he was going into town to see about equipping the maid for her first run of the season down to tregea with goods perhaps wine perhaps edinios wine to trade for a ships holds worth of early spring wool and tregean goats cheese it was an impulsive decision but not an inappropriate one he usually made a run south in the spring if a little later in the season mostly for trade partly to learn what he could for alessan he had been doing it for years for both reasons ever since hed met alessan and baerd spending a long night in a southern tavern with them and coming away with the knowledge of a shared passion of the soul and a cause that might be a lifetime in the unfolding so this spring voyage was a part of his yearly routine what was not what was truly impulsive was his offer between one sip of early morning khav and the next to take alais with him his eldest his pride his clever one he thought her beautiful beyond words no one had asked for her hand and though he knew she was truly pleased for selvena and not grieving at all for herself this knowledge didnt stop him from feeling a difficult sorrow whenever he looked at her amid the already building excitement of selvenas wedding preparations so he asked her a little too casually if she wanted to come with him and alix glanced up quickly from her labors in the kitchen with a sharp worried look in her dark eyes and alais said even more quickly with a fervor rare for her oh triad yes i would love to come it happened to be her dream one of her oldest dreams never requested never even spoken aloud alais could feel how high her telltale color had suddenly become she watched her father and mother exchange a glance there were times when she envied them that communion of their eyes no words were spoken they didnt seem to need words much of the time then alais saw her mother nod and she turned in time to catch her fathers slow smile in response to that and she knew she was going to sea in the maid for the first time in her life she had wanted to do so for so long she couldnt even think back to a time when the desire hadnt been there she remembered being a small girl light enough to be lifted up by her father while her mother carried selvena going down to the harbor in astibar to see the new ship that was the key to their small fortune in the world and she had loved it so much the three masts they had seemed so tall to her then aspiring toward the sky the darkhaired figurehead of a maiden at the prow the brightblue coat of fresh paint along the railings the creak of the ropes and the timber and the harbor itself the smell of pitch and pine and fish and ale and cheese wool and spice and leather the rumble of carts laden with goods going away to some far part of the known world or coming in from distant places with names that were a kind of magic to her a sailor in red and green walked by with a monkey on his shoulder and her father called a familiar greeting to him her father seemed to be at home here he knew these men the wild exotic places from which they came and went she heard shouts and sudden raucous laughter and voices raised in profane dispute over the weight of this or the cost of that then someone cried out that there were dolphins in the bay that was when her father had lifted her up on his shoulders so she might see them selvena had begun to cry at all the fierce commotion alais remembered and they had gone back to their cart shortly after and ridden away past the watchful looming presence of the barbadians big fairhaired men on their big horses guarding the harbor of astibar she had been too young to understand what they were about but her fathers abrupt silence and expressionless face riding by them had told her something later she learned a great deal more growing up into the occupied reality of her world her love of the ships and the harbor had never gone away whenever she could she would go with rovigo down to the water it was easier in winter when they all moved to the town house in astibar but even in spring and summer and early fall she would find excuses reasons and ways to accompany him into town and down to where the maid was berthed she gloried in the scene and at night she dreamt her dreams of oceans opening before her and salt spray off the waves dreams she was a woman women did not go to sea and dutiful intelligent daughters never troubled their fathers by even asking to be allowed such a thing but it seemed that sometimes on some mornings completely unforeseen eanna could look down from among her lights in the sky and smile and something miraculous might be freely offered that would never have been sought it seemed she was a good sailor adjusting easily to the swing and roll of the ship on the waves as the coastline of astibar scrolled by on their right they sailed north along the bay and then threaded their way through the islands of the archipelago and into the wideness of the open sea rovigo and his five seamen handling the ship with an ease that seemed to her both relaxed and precise alais was exhilarated watching everything in this unknown world with an intensity that made them laugh and tease her for it there was no malice in the jests though she had known all five of these men for most of her life they swung around the northern tip of the province a cape of storms one of the men told her but that spring day it was an easy mild place and she stood at the railing as they turned back south and watched the green hills of her province pass by sloping down to the white sand of the shores and the fishing villages dotted along the coast a few nights later there was a storm off the cliffs of northern tregea rovigo had seen it coming at sunset or smelled it in the air but the coastline was rocky and forbidding here with no place to put in for shelter they braced for the squall a respectful distance off shore to keep clear of the rocks when it hit alais was down below in her cabin to keep out of the way even this weather she was grateful to discover didnt bother her very much there was nothing pleasant about it feeling the sea maid groan and shake buffeted in darkness by wind and rain but she told herself that her father had endured infinitely worse in thirty years at sea and she was not going to let herself be frightened or discomfited by a minor spring squall from the east she made a point of going back up on deck as soon as she felt the waves and the wind die down it was still raining and she covered her head with the hood of her cape careful to stay clear of where the men were laboring she stood at one rail and looked up east of them the swiftly scudding clouds revealed rifts of clear sky and briefly vidomnis light shone through later the wind died down even more the rain stopped and the clouds broke up and she saw eannas bright far stars come out above the sea like a promise like a gift she pushed back her hood and shook out her dark hair she took a deep breath of the fresh clean air and knew a moment of perfect happiness she looked over and saw that her father was watching her she smiled at him he did not return the smile but as he walked over she could see that his eyes were tender and grave he leaned on the rail beside her looking west at the coastline water glistened in his hair and in the short beard he was growing not far away a series of dark massive forms touched by the moonlight the cliffs of tregea moved slowly by it is in you her father said quietly over the slap and sigh of the waves in your heart and in your blood you have it more than i do from my father and from his he was silent a moment then slowly shook his head but alais my darling a woman cannot live a life at sea not in the world as it is her dream clear and bright as the glitter of white vidomnis light upon the waves laid out and then undone in such simple words she swallowed said a speech long rehearsed never spoken you have no sons i am eldest will you surrender the maid and all you have worked to achieve when you when you no longer wish to pursue this life when i die he said it gently but something heavy and hurtful took shape pressing upon her heart she looped her hand through the crook of his arm holding tight and moved nearer to him to lean her head on his shoulder they were silent watching the cliffs go by and the play of moonlight on the sea the ship was never quiet but she liked the noises it made she had fallen asleep the past few nights hearing the sea maids endless litany of sounds as a night song she said her head still on his shoulder could i be taught to help you in your business i mean even if not to actually sail on the journeys her father said nothing for a time leaning against him she could feel his steady breathing his hands were loosely clasped together over the rail he said that can be done alais if you want it it can be done women run businesses all over the palm widows most often but not only them he hesitated your mother could keep this going i think if she wanted to if she had good advisors he turned his head to look down at her but she did not lift hers from his shoulder it is a sharp cold life though my darling for a woman for a man without a hearth at the end of day for warmth without love to carry you outward and home she closed her eyes at that there was something here that went to the heart of things they had never pressed her never harried or urged though she was almost twenty years old and it was time it was well past time and she had had that one strange dream many nights through the dark of the winter just past herself and a shadowy figure against the moon a man in a high unknown place among flowers under the arch of stars his body lowered to her own her hands reaching to gather him she lifted her head withdrew her arm said carefully looking down at the waves i like catini im happy for selvena shes ready shes wanted this for so long and i think hell be good to her but father i need more than what she will have i dont know what it is but i need more her father stirred then she watched him draw a deep breath and then slowly let it out i know she heard him say i know you do my darling if i knew what or how and could give it it would be yours the world and the stars of eanna would all be yours she cried then which she seldom did but she loved him and had caused him grief and he had spoken just now twice of dying one day and the white moon on the cliffs and sea after the storm was like nothing she had ever known or was likely to know again catriana couldnt see the road as she climbed the slope from the dell but from the distant sounds and the way baerd and sandre were both standing rigidly watchful on the grass at the edge of the trees she could tell that something was wrong men she had long since concluded were significantly worse than women at hiding their feelings in situations such as this her hair still wet after bathing in the pond a favorite place of hers one they had passed every time they went back and forth between ferraut and certando she hurried up the slope to see what was happening the two men said nothing as she appeared beside them the cart had been pulled into the shade off the northsouth road and the two horses let free to graze baerds bow and quiver were lying in the grass beside the trees close to hand if he needed them she looked at the road and saw the barbadian troops passing by marching and riding raising a heavy cloud of dust all around them more of the third company sandre said a cold anger in his voice it looks like theyre all going doesnt it baerd murmured grimly which was good it was more than good it was exactly what they wanted the anger the grimness were almost wholly uncalled for they seemed to be some instinctive male response to the nearness of the enemy catriana felt like shaking them both it was clear really baerd himself had explained it to her and sandre and to alienor of borso on the day alessan met marius of quileia in the mountains and rode west with devin and erlein and listening that day forcing herself to be composed in alienors presence catriana had finally understood what alessan had meant all this time when hed said they would have to wait until spring they had been waiting for marius to say yes or no to say if he would risk his own unstable crown and his life for them and that day in the braccio pass hed said he would baerd told them a little a very little about why ten days later she and baerd and sandre had been on watch in the hills outside fort ortiz when the emissaries came riding along the road carrying the quileian flag and were met with ceremonious honor outside the walls and escorted within by the barbadians next morning the quileians had ridden on not hurrying down the road to the north two hours after their departure the gates of the fort had opened again and six men had ridden out in extreme haste one of them it was sandre who noted it was siferval himself captain of the third company it is done baerd had said a kind of awe in his voice i cannot believe it but i think we have done it a little more than a week later the first troops had begun to move and they knew he was right it wasnt until some days after that in an artisans village in northern certando trading for carvings and finished cloth that they learned belatedly what brandin of ygrath had done in chiara the kingdom of the western palm are you a gambling man sandre had said to baerd the dice are rolling now and no one will hold or control them until they stop baerd had said nothing in reply but something stunned near to shock in his expression made catriana go over and take his hand in hers which was not really like her at all but everything had changed or was changing baerd was not the same since the ember days and their stay at castle borso something had happened to him there too but this part he didnt explain alessan was gone and devin and though she hated to admit it she missed him almost as much as the prince even their role here in the east had completely altered now they had waited in the highlands for the emissaries in case something should go wrong but now baerd kept them moving at speed from town to town and he was stopping to speak to men and to some women catriana had never even heard about telling them to be ready that there might be a summer rising and with some of them not many only a select few his message was very specific senzio head north to senzio before midsummer have a weapon with you if you can and it was these last words that brought home to catriana most sharply most potently the fact that the time for action had truly come it was upon them no more oblique disruptions or hovering on the edge of events events had a center now which was or would soon be in senzio and they were going there what was to happen she didnt yet know if baerd did he wasnt telling what he did tell her and sandre too were the names of people scores of them names he had held in memory some for a dozen years people who were with them in this who could be trusted who needed to be told here in the provinces ruled by barbadior that the movement of albericos troops was their own signal to be ready at last to watch the unfolding of events and be prepared to respond they would sit together at night the three of them around a campfire under stars or in a secluded corner of an inn in some hamlet or village and baerd would recite for them the names they needed to know it was only on the third night falling asleep afterward that catriana belatedly realized that the reason they needed to be told this was if baerd were to die with alessan away in the west ricaso bar dellano baerd would say a cooper in marsilian the first village south of fort ciorone he was born in avalle could not go to war because of a lame foot speak to him he will not be able to come north but knows the others near by and will spread the word and lead our people in that district if the need for a rising comes ricaso bar dellano she would repeat in marsilian porrena bren cullion in delonghi just inside the tregean border on the main road from ferraut shes a little older than you catriana her father died at the deisa she knows who to speak to porrena sandre would murmur concentrating his bony gnarled hands clasped together in delonghi and catriana marveled at how many names there seemed to be how many lives baerd and alessan had touched in their travels through a dozen years since returning from quileia readying themselves and these unknown others for a time a season a moment in the future which was now which they had lived to see and her heart was filled with hope as she whispered the names over and over to herself like talismans of power they rode through the next weeks through the flowering of spring at an almost reckless pace barely simulating their role as merchants making bad hasty transactions where they stopped unwilling to linger to bargain for better ones pausing only long enough to find the man or woman who was the key in that village or this cluster of farms the one who knew the others and would carry the word they were losing money but they had astins to spare from alienor catriana being honest with herself realized that she was still reluctant to acknowledge the role that woman had played in alessans doings for so many years years in which she herself had been growing up in ignorance a child in a fishing village in astibar once baerd let her make the contact in a town the woman was a weaver widely known for her skill catriana had found her house at the edge of the village two dogs had barked at her approach and had been stilled by a mild voice from within inside catriana had found a woman only a little younger than her mother she had made certain they were alone and then as baerd had instructed had shown her dolphin ring and given alessans name and had spoken the message the same message of readiness as everywhere else then she carefully named two men and spoke baerds second message senzio midsummer tell them to be armed if they can the woman had gone pale standing up abruptly as catriana began to speak she was very tall even more so than catriana herself when the second message was done she had remained motionless a moment and then stepped forward to kiss catriana on the mouth triad bless you and keep you and the both of them she had said i did not think i would live to see this day she was crying catriana tasted salt on her lips she had walked out into the sunshine and back to baerd and sandre they had just finished a purchase of a dozen barrels of certandan ale a wretched transaction were going north you fools she had exclaimed exasperated her trade instincts taking over they dont like ale in ferraut you know that then well have to drink it ourselves sandre said swinging up on his horse and laughing baerd who so rarely used to laugh but who had changed since the ember days began to chuckle suddenly and then sitting beside him on the cart as they rode out of town so did she listening to the two of them feeling the clean freshness of the breeze blowing through her hair and as it seemed through her heart it was that same day early in the afternoon that they came to the dell she loved and baerd remembering pulled the cart off the road to let her go down to the pool and bathe when she climbed back up neither man was laughing or amused anymore watching the barbadians go by it was the way the two of them were standing that caused the trouble she was sure of it but by the time she came up beside them it was already too late it would have been mostly baerd whose look drew their attention sandre in his khardhu guise was a matter of almost complete indifference to the barbadians but a merchant a minor trader with a single cart and a second scrawny horse who stood gazing at an army passing in the way that this one did coldly his head arrogantly high not even remotely submissive or chastened let alone showing any of the fear proper to such a situation the language of the body catriana thought could be heard far too clearly sometimes she looked at baerd beside her his dark eyes fixed in stony appraisal of the company passing by it wasnt arrogance she decided not just a male pride it was something else something older a primitive response to this display of the tyrants power that he could no more hide than he could the dozen barrels of ale they carried on the cart stop it she whispered fiercely but even as she did she heard one of the barbadians bark a terse command and half a dozen of them detached from the moving column of men and horses and galloped over toward them catrianas mouth went dry she saw baerd glance over to where his bow lay in the grass he shifted his stance slightly to balance himself better sandre did the same what are you doing she hissed remember where we are she had time for no more the barbadians came up to them huge men on their horses looking down on a man and a woman of the palm and this gaunt greyhaired relic from khardhun i dont like the look of your face the leader said staring at baerd the mans hair was darker than most of the others but his eyes were pale and hard catriana swallowed this was the first time in a year theyd had a confrontation so direct with the barbadians she lowered her eyes willing baerd to be calm to say the right things what she did not know for no one who had not been there could know was what baerd was seeing in that moment not six barbadians on horses by a road in certando but as many ygrathen soldiers in the square before his fathers house long ago so many years and the memory still sharp as a wound from only yesterday all the normal measures of time seemed to fall apart and blow away in moments such as this baerd forced himself to avert his gaze before the barbadians glare he knew he had made a mistake knew this was a mistake he would always make if he wasnt careful he had been too euphoric though rushing too fast on a floodtide of emotion seeing this marching column as dancing to the tune he and alessan had called but it was early yet far too early so much lay unknown and uncontrollable in the future and they had to live to see that future or everything would have been wasted years and lives the patient conjuring of dream into reality he said eyes cast down voice low i am sorry if i have offended i was only marveling at you we have not seen so many soldiers on the road in years we moved aside to make way sandre added in his deep voice you be silent the barbadian leader rasped if i wish to converse with servants i will inform you one of the others sidled his horse toward sandre forcing him to step backward catriana behind him felt her legs grow weak she reached out and gripped the railing of the cart her palms were damp with fear she saw two of the barbadians staring at her with frank smirking appraisal and she was suddenly aware of how her clothing would be clinging to her body after her swim in the pond forgive us baerd repeated in a muffled tone we meant no harm no harm at all really why were you counting our numbers counting your numbers why would i do such a thing you tell me merchant it is not so baerd protested inwardly cursing himself as an amateur and a fool after twelve years something so clumsy as this the situation was careening out of control and the simple fact was that he had indeed been counting the barbadian numbers we are only traders he added only minor traders with a khardhu warrior for guard not so minor i would say baerd blinked and clutched his hands together deferentially he had made a terrible mistake this man was dangerously sharp i was afraid for my wife he said there have been rumors of outlaws in the south of great unrest which was true there were in fact more than rumors twentyfive barbadians had been slaughtered in a pass he was fairly certain alessan had been there your wife or your goods one of the other barbadians sneered we know which you people value more he looked past baerd to where catriana stood and there was a loose heavylidded look in his face the other soldiers laughed baerd quickly lowered his head again he didnt want them to see the death that was in his eyes he remembered that kind of laughter the resonance of it where it could lead had led in a square in tigana eighteen years ago he was silent eyes downcast murder in his heart bound close with memory what are you carrying the first barbadian rapped out his voice blunt as a trowel ale baerd said squeezing his hands together only barrels of ale for the north ale for ferraut you are a liar or a fool no no baerd said hastily not ferraut we got a very good price eleven astins the barrel good enough to be worth taking all the way north we are bound for astibar with this we can sell it for three times that which would have been true had he not paid twentythree astins for each of these at a gesture from the leader two of the barbadians dismounted they cracked open one of the barrels using their swords as levers the pungent earthy smell of certandan beer surrounded them all the leader looked over saw his men nod and turned back to baerd there was a malicious smile on his face eleven astins a barrel truly a good price so good that even a grasping merchant will not hesitate to donate them to the army of barbadior that defends you and your kind baerd had been half expecting this careful to stay in character he said if if it is your desire then yes would you would you care to buy it at only the price i paid there was a silence behind the six barbadians the army was still marching down the road it had almost passed them by he had a decent estimate of how many there were then the man on the horse in front of him drew his sword baerd heard catriana make a small sound behind him the barbadian leaned forward over the neck of his horse weapon extended and delicately touched baerd on his bearded cheek with the flat of his blade we do not bargain he said softly nor do we steal we accept gifts offer us a gift merchant he moved the blade a little baerd could feel it nicking and fretting against his face please accept please accept this ale from us as a gift to the men of the third company he said with an effort he kept his eyes averted from the mans face why thank you merchant the man said with lazy sarcasm slowly sliding it along baerds cheek like an evil caress he drew back his sword and since you have given us these barrels you will surely not begrudge us the horse and cart that carry them take the cart as well baerd heard himself saying he felt suddenly as if he had left his body as if he were floating above this scene looking down and it was as from that high detached vantage point that he seemed to see the barbadians move to claim their wagon they attached the carthorse to the traces again one of them younger than the others slung their packs and food out onto the ground he looked shyly back at catriana a little abashed then he mounted quickly up on the seat and clucked at the horse and the cart rolled slowly away to where the tail of the barbadian column was moving along the road the five other men leading his horse followed after him they were laughing the easy spilling laughter of men among each other sure of their place and of the shape of their lives baerd glanced over at his bow again he was fairly certain he could kill all six of them starting with the leader before anyone could intervene he didnt move none of them moved until the last of the column was out of sight their cart rumbling after it baerd turned then and looked at catriana she was trembling but he knew her well enough to know it was as much with anger as with fear im sorry he said reaching up a hand to touch her arm i could kill you baerd for giving me such a fright i know he said and i would deserve to be dead i underestimated them could have been worse sandre said prosaically oh somewhat catriana said tartly we could all be lying dead here now that would indeed have been worse sandre agreed gravely it took her a moment to realize he was teasing her she surprised herself by laughing a little wildly sandre his darkened face sober said something quite unexpected then you have no idea he murmured how dearly i wish you were of my blood my daughter granddaughter will you allow me to take pride in what you are she was so surprised she could think of nothing to say a moment later deeply moved she went forward and kissed him on the cheek he put his long bony arms around her and held her to his chest for a moment carefully as if she was fragile or very precious or both she couldnt remember the last time someone had held her that way he stepped back clearing his throat awkwardly she saw that baerds expression was unwontedly soft looking at the two of them this is all extremely lovely she said deliberately dry shall we spend the day here telling each other what splendid people we think we are baerd grinned not a bad idea but not the very best i think well have to double back to where we bought the ale we need another cart and horse good i could use a flask of ale sandre said catriana glanced quickly back at him caught the wry look in his eye and laughed she knew what he was doing but she would never have expected to be able to laugh so soon after seeing a sword against baerds face baerd collected his bow and quiver from the grass they shouldered their packs and made her ride the horse nothing else sandre said would look right she wanted to argue but couldnt and she was secretly grateful for the chance to ride her knees were still weak it was very dusty along the road for a mile or two because of the army and they kept to the grass beside it her horse startled a rabbit and before she could even register the fact baerd had notched an arrow and shot and the animal was dead they traded it a short while later at a farmhouse for a pitcher of ale and some bread and cheese and then went on late in the day by the time they had made their slow way back to the village catriana bad convinced herself that the incident had been unfortunate but not really important after all eight days later they were in tregea town they had seen no other soldiers in the intervening week their path having taken them far off the major roads they left the new cart and goods at their usual inn and walked down to the central market it was late in the afternoon a warm day for spring looking north between the buildings toward the docks catriana could see the masts of the first ships to come up the river after the winter sandre had stopped at a leather stall to have repairs done to the belt that held his sword as she and baerd moved through the crowded square a barbadian mercenary older than most moving with a limp and probably drunk on spring wine stumbled out of a tavern saw her and lurched over to grope clumsily at her breasts and between her legs she shrieked more startled than anything else and a moment later wished with all her heart that she had not done so baerd just ahead of her wheeled saw the man and with the same deadly reflexive speed that had killed the rabbit flattened the barbadian with a colossal blow to the side of his head and catriana knew knew in that moment with utter and absolute certainty that he was striking out not just against a drunken reserve guard but against the officer who had touched him with a sword by that grove in certando a week before there was a sudden frightened silence around them and then an immediate babble of sound they looked at each other for a blurred flashing second run baerd ordered harshly meet tonight by the place where you came up from the river last winter if i am not there go on by yourselves you know the names there are only a handful left eanna guard you all then he was gone sprinting through the square the way they had come as a cluster of mercenaries began fanning out quickly through the crowd toward them the man on the ground had not moved catriana didnt wait to see if he would she cut off the other way as fast as she could run out of the corner of her eye she saw sandre at the leather stall watching them his face loose with shock she was careful desperately careful not to look at him not to run that way that one of them oh triad please be willing one of them might make it from this place alive and free with the names known and the dream still carried toward midsummerss fires she darted down a crowded street and then sharply left at the first crossing into the warren of twisting lanes that made up the oldest quarter of tregea near the river over her head the second stories of houses leaned crazily out towards each other and what filtered through of the sunlight was completely blocked in places by the enclosed bridges that connected that ramshackle buildings on either side of the street she looked back and saw four of the mercenaries following her pounding loudly down the lane one of them shouted a command to halt if any of them had a bow catriana thought she was quite likely to die in the next few seconds dodging from side to side she cut to her right down an alleyway and then quickly right again at the first crossing doubling back the way she had come there were three names on baerds list here in tregea and she knew where two of them might be found but there was no way she could go to them for succor not with the barbadians so close behind she would have to lose the pursuit herself if she could and leave it to sandre to make the contact or baerd if he survived she ducked under the flapping ends of someones wash hanging above the street and knifed over to her left toward the water there were people milling about in the lanes glancing up with mild curiosity as she went by their glances would change in a moment she knew when the barbadians rumbled through after her the streets were a hopelessly jumbled maze she wasnt certain where she was only that the river was north of her at fleeting intervals she could glimpse the topmost masts of the ships the waterfront would be dangerous though much too open and exposed she doubled back south again her lungs sucking for air behind her she heard a crashing sound and then a cacophony of irate shouts and curses she stumbled going around another corner to her right every moment every turning she expected this chaos of lanes to lead her straight back into her pursuers if they fanned out she was probably finished a wheelwrights cart blocked the lane she flattened herself against the wall and sidled sideways past came to another crossing of roads sprinted straight through this time past half a dozen children playing a skipping game with ropes turned at the second crossing and was grabbed hard just above her right elbow she started to scream but a hand was quickly slapped over her mouth she bared her teeth to bite violently twisting to escape then suddenly she froze in disbelief quietly my heart and come this way said rovigo dastibar removing his palm from her mouth no running they are two streets over look as if youre walking with me hand on her arm he guided quickly into a tiny almost deserted lane looked back once over his shoulder and then propelled her through the doorway of a fabric shop now down behind the counter quickly how did you she gasped saw you in the square followed you here move girl she moved an old woman took her hand and squeezed it then lifted a hinged counter and catriana ducked through and dropped to the floor behind it a moment later the hinge swung up again and her heart stopped as a shadow appeared above her holding something long and sharp forgive me whispered alais bren rovigo kneeling beside her my father says your hair might give you away when we leave she held up the scissors she carried catriana went rigid for a moment then closing her eyes without a word she slowly turned her back on the other woman a moment later she felt her long red tresses gathered and pulled and then the long sharp clothcutters scissors rasped cleanly through in a line above her shoulders severing a decades growth in a moment in the shadows there was a burst of noise outside a clatter and hoarse shouting it approached reached them went loudly past catriana realized that she was shaking alais touched her shoulder and then diffidently withdrew her hand on the other side of the counter the old woman moved placidly about in the shadows of her shop rovigo was nowhere to be seen catrianas breath came in ragged scourings of air and her right side ached she must have crashed into something in her wild careen she had no memory of doing so there was something lying on the ground beside her feet she reached down and gathered the thick red curtain of her severed hair it had happened so fast shed hardly had time to realize what was being done catriana im so sorry alais whispered again there was real grief in her voice catriana shook her head nothing this is less than nothing she said it was difficult to speak only vanity what does it matter she seemed to be weeping her ribs hurt terribly she put a hand up and touched the shorn remains of her hair then she turned sideways a little on the floor of the shop down behind the counter and leaned her head wearily against the other womans shoulder alaiss arms came up and around her then holding her close while she cried on the other side of the counter the old woman hummed tunelessly to herself as she folded and sorted cloth of many colors and as many different textures working by the wan light of afternoon as it filtered down to the street in a quarter where the leaning houses mostly blocked the sun baerd lay in the mild darkness by the river remembering how cold it had been the last time he was here waiting with devin at winter twilight to see if catriana would come floating down to them he had lost the pursuit hours ago he knew tregea very well he and alessan had lived here for more than a year off and on after their return from quileia rightly judging this wild mountainous province as a good place to seek out and nurture any slow flames of revolution they had been principally looking for one man they had never found a captain from the siege of borifort but they had discovered others and spoken to them and bound them to their cause and they had been back here many times over the years in the city itself and in the mountains of its distrada finding in the harsh simple life of this province a strength and a clean directness that helped carry them both through the terribly slow twistingly indirect paths of their lives he had known the citys maze of streets infinitely better than the barbadians who were barracked here known which houses could be quickly climbed which roofs led to others and which to avoid as dangerous deadends it had been important in the life theyd led to know such things hed cut south and then east from the market and then scrambled up to the roof of the shepherds crook their old tavern here using the slanting cover of the adjacent woodpile as a springboard he remembered doing the same thing years ago dodging the night watch after curfew running low and quickly he crossed two roofs and then spanned a street by crawling along the top of one of the ramshackle covered bridges that linked houses on either side behind him far behind him very soon he heard the sounds of pursuit being balked by seemingly inadvertent things he could guess what those things might be a milkcart with a loose wheel a quickly gathered crowd watching two men brawl in the street a keg of wine spilled as it was wheeled into a tavern he knew tregea which meant knowing the spirit of its people too in a short time he was a long way from the market square having covered the distance entirely from roof to roof flitting lightfooted and unseen he could have almost enjoyed the chase had he not been so worried about catriana at the higher southern fringes of tregea the houses grew taller and the streets wider his memory did not fail him though he knew which ways to angle in order to continue working upward till he came to the house he sought and leaped to land on its roof he remained there for several moments listening carefully for sounds of alarm in the street below he heard only the ordinary traffic of late afternoon though and so baerd slipped the key out from its old hidingplace under the one burnt shingle unlocked the flat trapdoor and slipped down noiselessly into tremazzos attic he lowered the door behind him and waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness down below in the apothecarys shop itself he could hear voices quite clearly and he quickly made out the unmistakable rumble of tremazzos bass tones it had been a long time but some things seemed never to change around him he could smell soaps and perfumes and the odors astringent or sweet of various medications when he could see a little in the gloom he found the tattered armchair that tremazzo used to leave up here for them and sank down into it the very action brought back memories from years ago some things did not change eventually the voices below fell silent listening carefully he could make out only the one distinctive heavy tread in the shop leaning over baerd deliberately scratched the floor the sound a rat might make in an attic room but only a rat that could scratch three times quickly and then once again three for the triad as a whole and one more for the god alone tregea and tigana shared an ancient link to adaon and they had chosen to mark it when they devised their signal he heard the footsteps below stop and then a moment later resume their measured tread as if nothing had happened baerd leaned back in the chair to wait it didnt take long it was late in the day by now nearly time to close up shop in any case he heard tremazzo sweeping the counter and floor and then the bang of the front door being shut and the click of the bolt driven home a moment later the ladder was moved into place footsteps ascended the lower door swung back and tremazzo came into the attic carrying a candle he was puffing from exertion bulkier than ever he set the candle on a crate and stood hands on wide hips looking down at baerd his clothes were very fine and his black beard was neatly trimmed to a point and scented baerd realized a second later grinning he rose to his feet and gestured at tremazzos finery pretending to sniff the air the apothecary grimaced customers he grunted it is the fashion of the day what they expect now in a shop like this soon well be as bad as senzio was it you that caused all the hue and cry this afternoon no more than that no greeting no effusions tremazzo had always been thus cool and direct as a wind out of the mountains im afraid so baerd replied did the soldier die hardly tremazzo said in his familiar dismissive tones you arent strong enough for that was there word of a woman caught not that i heard who is she one of us tremazzo now listen there is real news and i need you to find a khardu warrior and give him a message from me tremazzos eyes widened briefly as baerd began then narrowed with concentration as the story unfolded it didnt take long to explain tremazzo was nothing if not quick the bulky apothecary was not a man to venture north to senzio himself but he could contact others who were and let them know and he should be able to find sandre at their inn he went down the ladder once more and returned puffing with a wheel of bread and some cold meat and a flask of good wine to go with them they touched palms briefly then he left in search of sandre sitting among the sundry items stored above an apothecarys shop baerd ate and drank waiting for darkness to fall when he was sure the sun had set he slipped out onto the roof again and started back north through the town after a while he worked his way down to the ground and careful of the torches of the watch threaded eastward through the winding streets to the place at the edge of the city where catriana had come ashore from her winter leap there he sat down in the grass by the river in the almost windless night and settled himself to wait he had never really feared he would be caught hed had too many years of living this way body honed and hardened senses sharpened mind quick to remember things to seize and act upon opportunity none of which explained or excused what hed done to get them into this in the first place his impulsive blow at the drunken barbadian had been an act of unthinking stupidity regardless of the fact that it was also something that most of the people in that square had longed to do themselves at one time or another in the palm of the tyrants today one suppressed such longings or died or watched people one cared for die which lead him back to catriana in the starry spring darkness he remembered her emerging like a ghost from winter water he lay silent in the grass thinking of her and then after a time perhaps predictably of elena and then always and forever certain as dawn or dusk or the turning of the seasons of dianora who was dead or lost to him somewhere in the world there was a rustle too small to be alarming in the leaves of a tree behind him a moment later a trialla began to sing he listened to it and to the river flowing alone and at home in the dark a man shaped and defined by his need for solitude and the silent play of memory his father as it happened had done the same thing by the deisa the night before he died a short time later an owl called from along the riverbank just west of him he hooted softly in reply silencing the triallas song sandre came up silently scarcely disturbing the grass he crouched down and then sat grunting slightly they looked at each other catriana baerd murmured i dont know not caught though i think i would have heard i lingered in the square and around it saw the guards come back the man you hit is all right they were laughing at him after i think this will pass baerd deliberately relaxed his tensed muscles he said conversationally i am a very great fool sometimes had you noticed not really youll have to tell me about it some time who was the extremely large man who accosted me tremazzo hes been with us for a long while we used his upper storage room for meetings when we lived here and after sandre grunted he came up to me outside the inn and offered to sell me a potion to ensure the lust of any woman or boy i desired baerd found himself grinning rumors of khardu habits precede you evidently sandres teeth flashed white in the darkness mind you it was a good price i bought two vials of the stuff laughing quietly baerd felt a curious sensation as if his heart were expanding outward toward the man here with him he remembered sandre the night they had met when all the plans of his old age had been undone when a final savage end had come for the whole sandreni family a night that had not come to an end until the duke had used his magic to go into albericos dungeons and kill his own son tomasso any woman or boy i desired baerd felt humbled by the strength of the old man with him not once in half a year and more of hard traveling through the bitter cold and rutted tracks of winter had sandre breathed so much as a request for a halt or an easier pace not once had he balked at a task shown weariness been slow to rise in the predawn dampness of the road not once given any sign of the rage or the grief that must have choked him whenever word reached them of more bodies deathwheeled in astibar he had given them a gift of all he had his knowledge of the palm the world and especially of alberico a lifetimes worth of subtlety and leadership offered without arrogance and without reserve nothing held back it was men such as this baerd thought who had been the glory and the grief of the palm in the days before it fell glory in the grandeur of their power and grief in their hatreds and their wars that had let the tyrants come and take the provinces one by one in their solitary pride and sitting there by the river in darkness baerd felt again with certainty in the deep core of his heart that what alessan was doing what he and alessan were doing was right that theirs was a goal worth the striving for this reaching out for wholeness in the palm with the tyrants driven away and the provinces bound together in a sharing of the years that would come a goal worth all the days and nights of a mans life whether or not it was ever reached could ever be made real a goal that lay beside and was bound together with the other vast and bitter thing which was tigana and her name certain things were hard for baerd bar saevar almost impossible in fact and had been since his youth had been torn away from him in the year tigana fell but he had lain with a woman on an ember night just past in a place of deepest magic and had felt in that green darkness as if the stern bindings that wrapped and held his heart were loosening and this was a dark place too a quiet one with the river flowing and things had begun to take shape in the palm that he had feared would never happen while he lived my lord he said softly to the old man sitting there with him do you know that i have come to love you in the time we have been together by the triad sandre said a little too quickly and i havent even given you the potion baerd smiled said nothing able to guess at the bindings the old duke must have within himself a moment later though he heard sandre murmur in a very different voice and i you my friend all of you you have given me a second life and a reason for living it even a hope that a future worth knowing might lie ahead of us for that you have my love until i die gravely he held out a palm and the two of them touched fingers in the darkness they were sitting thus motionless when they heard the sound of an oar splash gently in the water both men rose silently reaching for their swords then they heard an owl hoot from the river baerd called softly back and a moment later a small boat bumped gently against the sloping bank and catriana stepping lightly came ashore at the sight of her baerd drew a breath of pure relief he had been more afraid for her than he could ever have said there was a man behind her in the boat holding the oars but the moons had not yet risen and baerd couldnt see who it was catriana said that was quite a blow should i be flattered sandre behind him chuckled baerd felt as though his heart would overflow with pride in this woman in the calm matteroffactness of her courage matching her tone with an effort he said only you shouldnt have shrieked half of tregea thought you were being ravished yes well she said drily do forgive me i wasnt sure myself what happened to your hair sandre asked suddenly from behind and baerd moving sideways saw that it had indeed been cropped away in a ragged line above her shoulders she shrugged with exaggerated indifference it was in the way we decided to cut it off who is we baerd asked something within him was grieving for her for the assumed casualness of her manner who is in the boat i assume a friend given where we are a fair assumption the man in the boat answered for himself though i must say i could have picked a better place for our contraina to have a business meeting rovigo baerd murmured with astonishment and a swift surge of delight well met it has been too long rovigo dastibar sandre said suddenly coming forward is that who this is i thought i knew that voice rovigo said shipping his oars and standing up abruptly baerd moved quickly down to the bank to steady the boat rovigo took two precise strides and leaped past him to the shore i do know it but i cannot believe i am hearing it in the name of morian of portals have you come back from the dead my lord even as he spoke he knelt in the tall grass before sandre duke of astibar east of them beyond where the river found the sea ilarion rose sending her blue light along the water and over the waving grasses of the bank in a manner of speaking i have sandre said with my skin somewhat altered by baerds craft he reached down and pulled rovigo to his feet the two men looked at each other alessan wouldnt tell me last fall but he said i would be pleased when i learned who my other partner was rovigo whispered visibly moved he spoke more truly than he could have known how is this possible my lord i never died sandre said simply it was a deception part of a poor foolish old mans scheme if alessan and baerd had not returned to the lodge that night i would have killed myself after the barbadians came and went he paused which means i suppose that i have you to thank for my present state neighbor rovigo for various nights through the years outside my windows listening to the spinning of our feeble plots under the slanting blue moonlight there was a certain glint in his eye rovigo stepped back a little but his head was high and he did not avert his gaze it was in a cause that you now know my lord he said a cause you have joined i would have cut out my tongue before betraying you to barbadior i think you must know that i do know that sandre said after a moment which is a great deal more than i can say for my own kin only one of them rovigo said quickly and he is dead he is dead sandre repeated they are all dead i am the last of the sandreni and what shall we do about it rovigo what shall we do with alberico of barbadior rovigo said nothing it was baerd who answered from the waters edge destroy him he said destroy them both part five the memory of a flame chapter scelto woke her very early on the morning of the ritual she had spent the night alone as was proper and had made offerings the evening before at the temples of adaon and morian both brandin was careful now to be seen observing all rites and proprieties of the palm in the temples the priests and the priestesses had been almost fawning in their solicitude in what she was doing there was power for them and they knew it shed had a short and restless sleep and when scelto touched her awake gently and with a mug of khav already to hand she felt her last dream of the night slipping away from her closing her eyes only half conscious she tried to chase it sensing the dream receding as if down corridors of her mind she pursued trying to reclaim an image that would hold it and then just as it seemed about to fade and be lost she remembered she sat up slowly in bed and reached for the khav cradling it in both hands seeking warmth not that the room was cold but she had now remembered what day it was and there was a chill in her heart that went beyond foreboding and touched certainty when dianora had been a very small girl perhaps five years old a little less than that she had had a dream of drowning one night sea waters closing over her head and a vision of something dark a shape final and terrible approaching to draw her down into lightless depths she had come awake gasping and screaming thrashing about in bed uncertain of where she even was and then her mother had been there holding dianora to her heart murmuring rocking her back and forth until the frantic sobbing ceased when dianora had finally lifted her head from her mothers breast she had seen by candlelight that her father was there as well holding baerd in his arms in the doorway her little brother had been crying too she saw shocked awake in his own room across the hall by her screams her father had smiled and carried baerd over to her and the four of them had sat there in the middle of the night on dianoras bed while the candles cast light in circles around them shaping an island in the dark tell me about it she remembered her father saying afterward he had made shadow figures for them with his hands on the wall and baerd soothed and drowsy had fallen asleep again in his lap tell me the dream love tell me the dream love on chiara almost thirty years after dianora felt an ache of loss as if it had all been but a little while ago days weeks no time at all when had those candles in her room lost their power to hold back the dark she had told her mother and father softly so as not to wake baerd some of the fear coming back in the stumbling words the waters closing over her a shape in the depths drawing her down she remembered her mother making the sign against evil to unbind the truth of the dream and deflect it away the next morning before opening his studio and beginning his days work saevar had taken both his children past the harbor and the palace gates and south along the beach and he had begun to teach them to swim in a shallow cove sheltered from the waves and the west wind dianora had expected to be afraid when she realized where they were going but she was never really afraid of anything when her father was with her and she and baerd had both discovered with whoops of delight that they loved the water she remembered so strange the things one remembered that baerd bending over in the shallows that first morning had caught a small darting fish between his hands and had looked up eyes and mouth comically round with surprise at his own achievement and their father had shouted with laughter and pride every fine morning that summer the three of them had gone to their cove to swim and by the time autumn came with its chill and then the rains dianora felt as easy in the water as if it were a second skin to her once she remembered and there was no surprise to this memory lingering the prince himself had joined them as they walked past the palace dismissing his retinue valentin strolled with the three of them to the cove and disrobed to plunge into the sea beside their father straight out into the waves he had gone long after saevar stopped past the sheltering headland of the cove and into the choppy whitecaps of the sea then he had turned around and come back to them his smile bright as a gods his body hard and lean droplets of water sparkling in his golden beard he was a better swimmer than her father was dianora could see that right away even as a child she also knew somehow that it really didnt matter he was the prince he was supposed to be better at everything her father remained the most wonderful man in the world and nothing she could imagine learning was ever going to change that nothing ever had she thought shaking her head slowly in the saishan as if to draw free of the clinging spidery webs of memory nothing ever had though brandin in another better world in his imaginary finavir perhaps she rubbed her eyes and then shook her head again still struggling to come awake she wondered suddenly if the two of them her father and the king of ygrath had seen each other had actually looked each other in the eye that terrible day by the deisa which was such a hurtful thought that she was afraid that she might begin to cry which would not do not today no one not even scelto especially not scelto who knew her too well must be allowed to see anything in her for the next few hours but quiet pride and a certainty of success the next few hours the last few hours the hours that would lead her to the margin of the sea and then down into the dark green waters which were the vision of the riselkas pool lead her to where her path came clear at last and then came not before time and not without a certain relief beneath the fear and all the loss to an end it had unfolded with such direct simplicity from the moment she had stood by the pool in the kings garden and seen an image of herself amid throngs of people in the harbor and then alone underwater drawn toward a shape in darkness that was no longer a source of childhood terror but finally of release that same day in the library brandin had told her he was abdicating in ygrath in favor of girald but that dorotea his wife was going to have to die for what she had done he lived his life in the eyes of the world he said even had he wished to spare her he would have no real choice he didnt wish to spare her brandin said then he spoke of what else had come to him on his ride that morning through the predawn mists of the island a vision of the kingdom of the western palm he was going to make that vision real he said for the sake of ygrath itself and for the people here in his provinces and for his own soul and for her only those ygrathens willing to become people of his four joined provinces would be allowed to stay he said all others were free to sail home to girald he would remain not just for stevan and the response shaped in his heart to his sons death though that would hold that was constant but to build a united realm here a better world than he had known that would hold that was constant dianora had listened to him had felt her tears beginning to fall and had moved to lay her head in his lap beside the fire brandin held her moving his hands through her dark hair he would need a queen he had said in a voice she had never heard before one she had dreamt of for so long he wanted to have sons and daughters here in the palm now brandin said to start again and build upon the pain of stevans loss that something bright and fair might emerge from all the years of sorrow and then he spoke of love drawing his hands gently through her hair he spoke of loving her of how that truth had finally come home into his heart once she would have thought it far more likely that she might grasp and hold the moons than ever hear him speak such words to her she wept unable to stop for in his words it was all gathering now she could see how it was coming together and such clarity and prescience was too much for a mortal soul for her mortal soul this was the triads wine and there was too much bitter sorrow at the bottom of the cup she had seen the riselka though she knew what was coming where the path would lead them now for one moment a handful of heartbeats she wondered what would have happened had he whispered these same words to her the night before instead of leaving her alone with the fires of memory and that thought hurt as much as anything ever had in all her life let it go she wanted to say wanted so much to say that she bit her lip holding back the words oh my love let the spell go let tigana come back and all the worlds brightness will return she said nothing knowing that he could not do so and knowing for she was no longer a child that grace could not be come by so easily not after all these years not with tigana and stevan twined together and embedded so deep down in brandins own pain not with what he had already done to her home not in the world in which they lived besides which and above everything else there was the riselka and her clear path unfolding with every word whispered by the fire dianora felt as if she knew everything that was going to be said everything that would follow and each passing moment was leading them she could see it as a kind of shimmer in the room towards the sea almost a third of the ygrathens stayed it was more than hed expected brandin told her standing on the balcony above the harbor two weeks later watching most of his flotilla sail away back to their home to what had been his home he was exiled now by his own will more truly than he had ever been before he also told her later that same day that dorotea was dead she didnt ask how or how he knew his sorcery was still the thing she did not ever want to face shortly after that came bad tidings though the barbadians were beginning to move north toward and through ferraut all three armies apparently heading for the border of senzio he had not expected that she saw not nearly so soon it was too unlike careful alberico to move with such decisiveness something has happened there something is pushing him brandin said and i wish i knew what it was he was weak and vulnerable now that was the problem he needed time and they all knew it with the ygrathen army mostly gone brandin needed a chance to shape a new structure of order in the western provinces to turn the first giddy euphoria of his announcement into the bonds and allegiances that would truly forge a kingdom that would let him summon an army to fight in his name among a conquered people lately so hardoppressed he needed time desperately and alberico wasnt giving it to him you could send us deymon the chancellor said one morning as the dimensions of the crisis began to take shape send the ygrathens we have left and position the ships off the coast of senzio see if that will hold alberico for a time the chancellor had stayed with them there was never any real doubt that he would for all his trauma he had looked ill and old for days after brandins announcement dianora knew that deymons deepest loyalty his love though he would have shied awkwardly away from that word was given to the man he served and not to the nation moving through those days almost numbed by the divisions in her own heart she envied deymon that simplicity but brandin flatly refused to follow his suggestion she remembered his face as he explained looking up from a map and strewn sheets of paper covered with numbers the three of them together around a table in the sittingroom off the kings bedchamber rhun a nervous preoccupied fourth on a couch at the far end of the room the king of the western palm still had his fool though the king of ygrath was named girald now i cannot make them fight alone brandin said quietly not to carry the full burden of defending people i have just made them equal to this cannot be an ygrathen war for one thing they are not enough we will lose but it is more than that if we send an army or a fleet it must be made up of all of us here or this kingdom will be finished before i start deymon had risen from the table agitated visibly disturbed then i must say again what i have said before this is folly the thing to do is to go home and deal with what has happened in ygrath they need you there not really deymon i will not flatter myself girald has been ruling ygrath for twenty years girald is a traitor and should have been executed as such with his mother brandin looked up at him the grey eyes suddenly chilly must we repeat this discussion deymon i am here for a reason and you know that reason i cannot go back on that it would cut against the very core of what i am his expression changed no man need stay with me but i am bound myself to this peninsula by love and grief and by my own nature and those three things will hold me here the lady dianora could come with us with dorotea dead you would need a queen in ygrath and she would be deymon have done the tone was final ending the discussion but the chancellor was a brave man my lord he pushed on grimfaced his voice low and intense if i cannot speak of this and you will not send our fleet to face barbadior i know not how to advise you the provinces will not go to war for you yet we know that it is too soon they need time to see and to believe that you are one of them and i have no time brandin replied with what had seemed an unnatural calm after the sharp tension of the exchange so i have to do it immediately advise me on that chancellor how do i show them right now how do i make them believe i am truly bound to the palm so there it was and dianora knew that the moment had come to her at last i cannot go back on that it would cut against the very core of what i am she had never really nursed any fantasies of his ever freely releasing and unbinding his spell she knew brandin too well he was not a man who went back or reversed himself in anything the core of what he was in love and hate and in the defining shape of his pride she stood up there was an odd rushing sound in her ears and if she closed her eyes she was certain she would see a path stretching away straight and clear as a line of moonlight on the sea very bright before her everything was leading her there leading all of them he was vulnerable and exposed and he would never turn back there was an image of tigana flowering in her heart as she rose even here even now an image of her home in the depths of the riselkas pool there had been a great many people gathered under banners of all the provinces as she walked down to the sea she placed her hands carefully on the back of her chair and looked down at him where he sat there was grey in his beard more it seemed each time she noticed it but his eyes were as they had always been and there was no fear no doubt in them as they looked back at her she drew a deep breath and spoke words that seemed to have been given to her long ago words that seemed to have simply waited for this moment to arrive i will do it for you she said i will make them believe in you i will do the ring dive of the grand dukes of chiara as it used to be done on the eve of war you will marry the seas of the peninsula and i will bind you to the palm and to good fortune in the eyes of all the people when i bring you back the searing from the sea she kept her gaze steady on his own dark and clear and calm as she spoke at last after so many years the words that set her on the final path that set him set them all the living and the dead the named and the lost on that path as loving him with a sundered heart she lied she finished her khav and rose from bed scelto had drawn the curtains back and she could see sunrise just beginning to lighten the dark sea the sky was clear overhead and the banners in the harbor could just be seen moving lazily in the dawn breeze there was already a huge crowd gathered hours before the ceremony was to start a great many people had spent the night in the harbor square to be sure of a place near the pier to see her dive she thought she saw someone a tiny figure at such a distance lift a hand to point to her window and she stepped quickly back scelto had already laid out the clothes she would wear the garments of ritual dark green for the going down her outer robe and sandals the net that would hold her hair and the silken undertunic in which she would dive for afterwards after she came back from the sea there was another robe white richly embroidered with gold for when she was to represent to be the bride come from the sea with a gold ring in her hand for the king after she came back if she came back she was almost astonished at her own calm it was easier actually because she hadnt seen brandin since early the day before as was proper for the rite easier too because of how brilliantly clear all the images seemed to be how smoothly they had led her here as if she was choosing or deciding nothing only following a course set down somewhere else and long ago easier finally because she had come to understand and accept deeply and with certitude that she had been born into a world a life that would not let her be whole not ever this was not finavir or any such dreamplace this was the only life the only world she was to be allowed and in that life brandin of ygrath had come to this peninsula to shape a realm for his son and valentin di tigana had killed stevan prince of ygrath this had happened could not be unmade and because of that death brandin had come down upon tigana and her people and torn them out of the known past and the still unfolding pages of the world and was staying here to seal that truth forever blank and absolute in vengeance for his son this had happened and was happening and had to be unmade so she had come here to kill him in her fathers name and her mothers in baerds name and her own and for all the lost and ruined people of her home but on chiara she had discovered in grief and pain and glory that islands were truly a world of their own that things changed there she had learned long ago that she loved him and now in glory and pain and wonder had been made to understand that he loved her this had all happened and she had tried to unmake it and had failed hers was not a life meant to be made whole she could see it now so clearly and in that clarity that final understanding dianora found the wellspring of her calm some lives were unlucky some people had a chance to shape their world it seemed who could have foretold that both these things were true of her of dianora di tigana bren saevar a sculptors daughter a darkhaired darkeyed child gawky and unlovely in her youth serious and grave though with flashes of wit and tenderness beauty coming to her late and wisdom coming later too much later coming only now she took no food though shed allowed herself the khav a last concession to years of habit she didnt think that doing so would violate any rituals she also knew it didnt really matter scelto helped her dress and then in silence he carefully gathered and pinned her hair binding it in the dark green net that would hold it back from her eyes when she dived when he was done she rose and submitted herself as always before going out into the world to his scrutiny the sun was up now its light flooding the room through the drawnback curtains in the distance the growing noise from the harbor could be heard the crowd must be very large by now she thought she didnt go back to the window to look she would see them soon enough there was a quality of anticipation to the steady murmur of sound that gave evidence more clearly than anything else of the stakes being played for this morning a peninsula two different dominions here if it came to that perhaps even the very empire in barbadior with the emperor ill and dying as everyone knew and one last thing more though only she knew this and only she would ever know tigana the final secret coin lying on the gaming table hidden under the card laid down in the name of love will i do she asked scelto her voice determinedly casual he didnt follow that lead you frighten me he said quietly you look as though you are no longer entirely of this world as if you have already left us all behind it was uncanny how he could read her it hurt to have to deceive him not to have him with her on this last thing but there was nothing he could have done no reason to give him grief and there were risks in the doing so im not at all sure thats flattering she said still lightly but i will attempt to think of it that way he refused to smile i think you know how little i like this he said scelto albericos entire army will be on the border of senzio two weeks from now brandin has no choice if they walk into senzio they will not stop there this is his very best chance probably his only chance to link himself to the palm in time you know all this she forced herself to sound a little angry it was true it was all true but none of it was the truth the riselka was the truth this morning that and the dreams shed dreamt alone here in the saishan through all the years i know scelto said clearly unhappy of course i know and nothing i think matters at all it is just please she said to stop him before he made her cry i dont think i can debate this with you now scelto shall we go oh my dear she was thinking oh scelto you will undo me yet he had stopped flinching at her rebuke she saw him swallow hard his eyes lowered after a moment he looked up again forgive me my lady he whispered he stepped forward and unexpectedly took her hands pressing them to his lips it is only for you that i speak i am afraid please forgive of course she said of course there is really nothing to forgive scelto she squeezed his hands tightly but in her heart she was bidding him farewell knowing she must not cry she looked into his honest caring face the truest friend shed had for so many years the only real friend actually since her childhood and she hoped against hope that in the days to come he would remember the way she had gripped his hands and not the casual careless sound of her words lets go she said again and turned her face away from him to begin the long walk through the palace and out into the morning and then down to the sea the ring dive of the grand dukes of chiara had been the most dramatic single ritual of temporal power in the peninsula of the palm from the very beginning of their dominion on the island the leaders of chiara had known that theirs was a power granted by and subject to the waters that surrounded them the sea guarded them and fed them it gave their ships always the largest armada in the peninsula access to trade and plunder and it wrapped them about and enclosed them in a world within the world no wonder as the taletellers said no wonder it was on the island that eanna and adaon had come together to engender morian and make the triad complete a world within the world girdled by the sea it was said to have been the very first of the grand dukes who had begun the ceremony that became the ring dive it had been different in those early days not actually a dive for one thing only a ring thrown as a gift into the sea in propitiation and token of acknowledgment in the days when the world turned its face toward the sun and the sailing season began in earnest then one spring a long time after that a woman dived into the sea after the ring when the grand duke of that time cast it in some said later she had been crazed with love or religious possession others that she was only cunning and ambitious in either case she surfaced from the waters of the harbor with the ring bright in her hand and as the crowd that had gathered to watch the grand duke wed the sea shouted and babbled in wild confusion and wonder the high priest of morian in chiara suddenly cried aloud in words that would run down through all the years never to be lost look and see see how the oceans accept the grand duke as husband to them how they offer back the searing as a bride piece to a lover and the high priest moved to the very end of the pier beside the duke and knelt to help the woman rise from the sea and so he set in motion everything that followed saronte the grand duke was but new to his power and as yet unwed letizia who had come into the city from a farm in the distrada and had done this unprecedented thing was yellowhaired and comely and very young and their palms were joined together then and there over the water by mellidar that high priest of morian and saronte placed the searing on letizias finger they were wed at midsummer there was war that autumn against asoli and astibar and young saronte di chiara triumphed magnificently in a naval battle in the gulf of corte south of the island a victory whose anniversary chiara still remembered and from that time onward the newly shaped ritual of the ring dive was enshrined for use in time of chiaras need thirty years later near the end of sarontes long reign in one of the recurring squabbles for precedence among the triads clergy a newly anointed high priest of eanna revealed that letizia had been near kin to mellidar the priest of morian who had drawn her from the water and bound her to the duke eannas priest invited the people of the island to draw their own conclusions about the schemes of morians clergy and their endless striving for preeminence and power a number of events none of them pleasant had unfolded among the triads servants in the months following that revelation but none of these disturbances had come near to touching the bright new sanctity of the ritual itself the ceremony had taken hold on the imagination of the people it seemed to speak to something deep within them whether of sacrifice or homage of love or danger or in the end of some dark true binding to the waters of the sea so the ring dive of the grand dukes remained long after all those feuding clergy of the triad had been lowered to their rest their names only halfremembered and only because of their part in the story of the dive what had finally brought an end to the ceremony in much more recent times was the death of onestra wife to grand duke cazal two hundred and fifty years ago it was not by any means the first such death the women who volunteered to dive for the grand dukes always had it made absolutely clear to them that their lives were worth infinitely less than the ring they sought to reclaim from the sea to come back without the ring left one an exile from the island for life known and mocked throughout the whole peninsula the ceremony was repeated with another woman another ring until one of the thrown rings was found and claimed by contrast the woman who carried a searing back to the pier was acclaimed as the luck of chiara and her fortune was made for life wealth and honor an arranged marriage into nobility more than one had borne a child to her grand duke two had followed letizia to the consorts throne girls from families of little prospect were not chary about risking their lives for such a glittering hallucinatory future onestra di chiara had been different and because of her and after her everything had changed beautiful as a legend and as proud grand duke cazals young bride had insisted on doing the ring dive herself scorning to allocate such a glittering ceremony to some illbred creature from the distrada on the eve of a dangerous war she had been all the chroniclers of the day agreed the most beautiful vision any of them had ever seen as she walked down to the sea in the darkgreen of ritual when she floated lifeless to the surface of the water some distance from the shore in full sight of the watching throng duke cazal had screamed like a girl and fainted dead away after which there had been rioting and a terrified pandemonium unmatched before or since on the island in one isolated temple of adaon on the north shore all the priestesses had killed themselves when one of their number brought back the news it was the wrath of the god that was coming so the portents were read and chiara almost strangled on its fear duke cazal foolhardy and broken was slain in battle that summer against the joined armies of corte and ferraut after which chiara endured two generations of eclipse rising to power again only after the bitter destructive war fought between the erstwhile allies who had beaten it such a process of course was hardly noteworthy it had been the way of things in the palm as far back as the records went but no woman had done the ring dive since onestra died all the symbols had changed with her the stakes had risen too high if another woman were to die in the dive with that legacy of chaos and defeat it was far too dangerous successive grand dukes declared the one after the other and they found ways to keep the island safe in its seagirt power without the sanction of that most potent ceremony when the ygrathen fleet had been sighted nineteen years ago the last grand duke of chiara had killed himself on the steps of eannas temple and so there had been no one to cast a ring into the sea that year even had there been a woman willing to dive for it in search of morians intercession and the gods it was eerily silent in the saishan when she and scelto left her rooms normally at this hour the corridors would be loud with the stir and bustle of the castrates fragrant and colorful with the scented presence of women moving languorously to the baths or to their morning meal today was different the hallways were empty and still save for their own footsteps dianora suppressed a shiver so strange did the deserted echoing saishan seem they passed the doorway to the baths and then the entrance to the dining rooms both were empty and silent they turned a corner toward the stairway that led down and out of the womens wing and there dianora saw that one person at least had remained and was waiting for them let me look at you vencel said the usual words i must approve you before you go down the saishan head was sprawled as always among the manycolored pillows of his rolling platform dianora almost smiled to see his vast bulk and to hear the familiar words spoken of course she said and slowly turned full circle before his scrutiny acceptable he said at length the customary judgment though his high distinctive voice sounded more subdued than she had ever heard it but perhaps perhaps you would like to wear that vairstone from khardhun about your throat for luck i brought it with me for you from the saishan treasures almost diffidently vencel extended a large soft hand and she saw that he was holding the red jewel she had worn the day isolla of ygrath had tried to kill the king she was about to demur when she remembered that scelto had brought this back for her as something special for that day just before she had dressed to go down remembering that and moved by vences gesture she said thank you i would be pleased to wear it she hesitated would you put it on for me he smiled almost shyly she knelt before him and with his deft and delicate fingers the enormous saishan head clasped the jewel on its chain about her neck kneeling so near she was overwhelmed by the scent of tainflowers that he always wore vencel withdrew his hands and leaned back to look at her in his dark face his eyes were unwontedly soft in khardhun we used to say to someone going on a journey fortune find you there and guide you home such is my wish today he hid his hands in the billowing folds of his white robe and looked away down the empty corridor thank you she said again afraid to say more she rose and glanced over at scelto there were tears in his eyes he wiped them hastily away and moved to lead her down the stairs halfway down she looked back at vencel an almost inhumanly vast figure draped in billowing white he was gazing expressionlessly down after them from among the brilliantly colored panoply of his pillows an exotic creature from another world entirely somehow carried ashore and stranded here in the saishan of chiara at the bottom of the stairs she saw that the two doors had been left unbarred scelto would not have to knock not today he pushed the doors open and drew back to let her pass in the long hallway outside the priests of morian and the priestesses of adaon were waiting for her she saw the scarcely veiled triumph in their eyes a collective glittering of expectation there was a sound a drawing of breath as she came through the doors in the green robes of a rite that had not been performed in two and a half hundred years her hair drawn back and bound in a net green as the sea trained to control being what they were the clergy quickly fell silent and in silence they made way for her to follow behind in orderly rows of crimson and smokegrey she knew they would make scelto trail behind them he could not be part of this procession of the rites she knew she had not properly said farewell to him hers was not a life meant to be made whole they went west down the corridor to the grand staircase at the top of the wide marble stairs dianora paused and looked down and she finally understood why the saishan had been so silent all the women and the castrates were gathered below they had been allowed out permitted to come this far to see her pass by holding her head very high and looking neither left nor right she set her foot on the first stair and started down she was no longer herself she thought no longer dianora or not only dianora she was merging further into legend with every step she took and then at the bottom of the staircase as she stepped onto the mosaicinlaid tiles of the floor she realized who was waiting by the palace doors to escort her out and her heart almost stopped there was a cluster of men there deymon for one and rhamanus as well who had stayed in the palm as shed been sure he would and had been named as brandins first lord of the fleet beside them was doarde the poet representing the people of chiara she had expected him it had been deymons clever idea that the participation of one island poet could help counterbalance the crime and death of another next to doarde was a burly sharpfaced man in brown velvet hung about with a ransoms worth of gold a merchant from corte and a successful one clearly enough very possibly one of the ghouls who had made their fortune preying on the ruins of tigana two decades ago behind him was a lean greyclad priest of morian who was obviously from asoli she could tell from his coloring the native asolino all had that look about them she also knew he was from asoli because the last of the men waiting for her there was from lower corte and she knew him a figure from her own internal legends from the myths and hopes that had sustained her life this far and this was the one whose presence here almost froze the blood in her veins in white of course majestic as she remembered him from when she was a girl gripping the massive staff that had always been his signature and towering over every man there stood danoleon the high priest of eanna in tigana the man who had taken prince alessan away to the south so baerd had told her the night he saw his own riselka and went away to follow them she knew him everyone had known danoleon his longstriding broadshouldered preeminence the deep glorious instrument that was his voice in temple services approaching the doors dianora fought back a moment of wild panic before sternly controlling herself there was no way he could recognize her he had never known her as a child why should he have the adolescent daughter of an artist loosely attached to the court and she had changed she was infinitely changed since then she couldnt take her eyes off him though she had known deymon was arranging for someone to be there from lower corte but had never expected danoleon himself in the days when she had worked in the queen in stevanien it was wellknown that eannas high priest had withdrawn from the wider world into the goddesss sanctuary in the southern hills now he had come out and was here and looking at him drinking in his reality dianora felt an absurd an almost overwhelming swell of pride to see how he seemed to dominate merely by his presence all the people assembled there it was for him and for the men and women like him the ones who were gone and the ones who yet lived in a broken land that she was going to do what she would do today his eyes rested on her searchingly they were all doing that but it was under danoleons clear blue gaze that dianora drew herself up even taller than before behind them all beyond the doors which had not yet been opened she seemed to see the riselkas path growing brighter all the time she stopped and they bowed to her all six men putting a straight leg forward and bending low in a fashion of salute not used for centuries but this was legend ceremony an invocation of many kinds of power and dianora sensed that she must now seem to them like some hieratic figure out of the tapestry scrolls of the distant past my lady said deymon gravely if it pleases you and you are minded to allow us we would attend upon you now and lead you to the king of the western palm carefully said and clearly for all their words were to be remembered and repeated everything was to be remembered one reason the priests were here and a poet it pleases me she said simply let us go she did not say more her own words would matter less it was not what she would say today that was to be remembered she still could not take her eyes from danoleon he was the first man from tigana she realized that she had seen since coming to the island in a very direct way it eased her heart that eanna whose children they all were had allowed her to see this man before she went into the sea deymon nodded a command slowly the massive bronze doors swung open upon the vast crowd assembled between the palace and the pier she saw people spilling across the square to the farthest ends of the harbor even thronging the decks of the ships at anchor there the steady murmur of sound that had been present all morning swelled to a crescendo as the doors swung open and then it abruptly stopped and fell away as the crowd caught sight of her a rigid straining silence seemed to claim chiara under the blue arch of the sky and out into that stillness dianora went and it was then as they moved into the brilliant sunshine along the aisle the shining path that had been made for her passage that she saw brandin waiting by the sea for her dressed like a soldierking without extravagance bareheaded in the light of spring something twisted within her at the sight of him like a blade in a wound it will end soon she told herself steadily only a little longer now it will all be over soon enough she went toward him then walking like a queen slender and tall and proud clad in the colors of the darkgreen sea with a crimson gem about her throat and she knew that she loved him and knew her land was lost if he was not driven away or slain and she grieved with all her being for the simple truth that her mother and her father had had a daughter born to them all those years ago for someone as small as he was it was hopeless to try to see anything from the harbor square itself and even the deck of the ship that had brought them here from corte was thronged with people who had paid the captain for a chance to view the drive from this vantage point devin had made his way over to the mainmast and scrambled up to join another dozen men clinging to the rigging high above the sea there were compensations inherent in agility erlein was somewhere below amid the crowd on deck he was still terrified after three days here by this enforced proximity to the sorcerer from ygrath it was one thing he had said angrily to elude trackers in the south another for a wizard to walk up to a sorcerer alessan was somewhere among the crowd in the harbor devin had spotted him at one point working his way towards the pier but couldnt see him now danoleon was inside the palace itself representing lower corte in the ceremony the irony of that was almost overwhelming whenever devin allowed himself to think about it he tried not to because it made him afraid for all of them but alessan had been decisive when the courteously phrased request had come for the high priest to travel north and join men of the other three provinces as formal witnesses to the ring dive you will go of course the prince had said as if it were the most natural thing in the world and we shall be there as well i need to take the measure of things on chiara since this change are you absolutely mad erlein had gasped not bothering to hide his disbelief alessan had only laughed though not devin thought with any real amusement he had become virtually impossible to read since his mother had died devin felt quite inadequate to the task of bridging that space or breaking through several times in the days following pasitheas death he had found himself desperately wishing that baerd were with them what about savandi erlein had demanded couldnt this be a trap for danoleon or for you even alessan shook his head hardly you said yourself no message was sent and it is entirely plausible that he was killed by brigands in the countryside as torre made it seem the king of the western palm has larger things to worry about right now than one of his petty spies im not concerned about that erlein but i do thank you for your solicitude he smiled a wintry smile erlein had scowled and stalked away what are you concerned about devin had asked the prince but alessan hadnt answered that high in the rigging of the aema falcon devin waited with the others for the palace doors to open and tried to control the pounding of his heart it was difficult though the sense of excitement and anticipation that had been building on the island for three days had started to become overwhelming this morning and had taken an almost palpable shape when brandin himself had appeared and walked calmly down to the pier with a small retinue including one stooped balding old man dressed exactly like the king brandins fool the cortean in the rigging next to him said when devin asked pointing something to do with sorcery the way they do things in ygrath he grunted were better off not knowing devin had gazed for the first time at the man who had destroyed tigana and tried to imagine what it would be like to have a bow in his hands right now and baerd or alessans skill at archery it was a long but not an impossible shot down and across a span of water to strike a single soberly clad bearded man standing by the sea imagining the flight of that arrow in the morning sun he remembered another conversation with alessan at the rail of the falcon the night they reached chiara what do we want to happen devin had asked word had reached the gulf of corte just before they sailed that most of the second company of albericos barbadian mercenaries had now been pulled back from the border forts and cities in ferraut and were marching with the other armies towards senzio hearing that alessans face had gone pale and there was a sudden hard glitter in his gray eyes much like his mothers devin had thought but would not dream of saying on the ship alessan had turned to him briefly at the question and then looked back out to sea it was very late nearer dawn than midnight neither of them had been able to sleep both moons were overhead and the water gleamed and sparkled with their mingled light what do we want to happen alessan repeated im not completely sure i think i know but i cant be certain yet thats why were going to watch this dive they listened to the sounds of the ship in the night sea devin cleared his throat if she fails he asked alessan was silent for so long devin didnt think he was going to answer then very softly he said if the certandan woman fails brandin is lost i think i am almost sure devin looked quickly over at him well then that means that means a number of things yes one is our name come back another is alberico ruling the palm before the year is out almost certainly devin tried to absorb that if we take them then we must take them both he remembered the prince saying in the sandreni lodge with devin hiding in the loft above and if she succeeds he asked alessan shrugged in the blue and silver moonlight his profile seemed more marble than flesh you tell me how many people of the provinces will fight against the empire of barbadior for a king who has been wedded to the seas of the palm by a seabride from this peninsula devin thought about it a lot he said at length i think a lot of people would fight so do i said alessan then the next question becomes who would win and the one after that is is there something we can do about it is there alessan looked over at him then and his mouth crooked wryly i have lived my life believing so we may find it put to the test very soon devin stopped his questions then it was very bright with the two moons shining a short while later alessan touched his shoulder and pointed with his other hand devin looked and saw a high dark mass of land rising from the sea in the distance chiara said alessan and so devin saw the island for the first time have you ever been here before he asked softly alessan shook his head never taking his eyes from that dark mountainous shape on the horizon only in my dreams he said shes coming someone shouted from the topmost rigging of the asolini ship anchored next to them the cry was immediately picked up and strung from ship to ship and along the harbor peaking in a roar of anticipation and then falling away to an eerie chilling silence as the massive bronze doors of chiara palace swung fully back to reveal the woman framed within even when she began to walk the silence held moving slowly she passed among the throngs assembled in the square seeming almost oblivious of them devin was too far away to see her face clearly yet but he was suddenly conscious of a terrible beauty and grace it is the ceremony he told himself it is only because of where she is he saw danoleon behind her moving among the other escorts towering above them and then moved by some instinct he turned from them to brandin of ygrath on the pier the king was nearer to him and he had the right angle he could see how the man watched the woman approach his face was utterly expressionless icy cold hes calculating the situation devin thought the numbers the chances hes using all of this the woman the ritual everyone gathered here with so much passion in them for a purely political end he realized that he despised the man for that over and above everything else hated him for the blank emotionless gaze with which he watched a woman approach to risk her life for him by the triad he was supposed to be in love with her even the bent old man beside him devin saw the kings fool dressed exactly like brandin was wringing his hands over and about each other in obvious apprehension anxiety and concern vivid in his face by contrast the face of the king of the western palm was a frigid uncaring mask devin didnt even want to look at him anymore he turned back to the woman who had come much nearer now and because she had because she was almost at the waters edge he could see that his first sense had been right and his glib explanation wrong dianora di certando clad in the seagreen robes of the ring dive was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in all his life what do we want to happen he had asked alessan three nights ago sailing to this island he still didnt know the answer but looking down at the woman as she reached the sea a sudden fear rose in him and an entirely unexpected pity he grasped the rigging tightly and set himself to watch from high high above she knew brandin better than anyone alive it had been necessary in order to survive especially in the beginning in order to say and do the right things in a mortally dangerous place then as the years slipped by necessity had somehow been alchemized into something else into love actually bitterly hard as that had been to acknowledge she had come here to kill with the twin snakes of memory and hatred in her heart instead she had ended up understanding him better than anyone in the world because there was no one else who mattered half so much and so what came very near to breaking her as she passed through that multitude of people to the pier was seeing how ferociously he was struggling not to show what he was feeling as if his soul were straining to escape through the doorways of his eyes and he being born to power being what he was felt it necessary to hold it in here among so many people but he couldnt hide it from her she didnt even have to look at rhun to read brandin now he had cut himself off from his home from all that had anchored him in life he was here among an alien people he had conquered asking for their aid needing their belief in him she was his lifeline now his only bridge to the palm his only link really to any kind of future here or anywhere but tiganas ruin lay between the two of them like a chasm in the world the lesson of her days dianora thought was simply this that love was not enough whatever the songs of the troubadours might say whatever hope it might seem to offer love was simply not enough to bridge the chasm in her world which was why she was here what the riselkas vision in the garden had offered her an end to the terrible bottomless divisions in her heart at a price however that was not negotiable one did not bargain with the gods she came up to brandin at the end of the pier and stopped and the others stopped behind her a sigh rising and falling away like a dying of wind moved through the square with an odd trick of the mind her vision seemed to detach itself from her eyes for a moment to look down on the pier from above she could see how she must appear to the people gathered there inhuman otherworldly as onestra must have seemed before the last dive onestra had not come back and devastation had followed upon that which was why this was her chance the dark doorway history offered to release and to the incarnation of her long dream in the saishan the sunlight was very bright gleaming and dancing on the bluegreen sea there was so much color and richness in the world beyond rhun she saw a woman in a brilliant yellow robe an old man in blue and yellow a younger darkhaired man in brown with a child upon his shoulders all come to see her dive she closed her eyes for a moment before she turned to look at brandin it would have been easier not to infinitely easier but she knew that there were dangers in not meeting his gaze and in the end here at the end this was the man she loved last night lying awake watching the slow transit of the moons across her window she had tried to think of what she could say to him when she reached the end of the pier words beyond those of the ritual to carry layers of meaning down through the years but there too lay danger a risk of undoing everything this moment was to become and words the ones she would want to say were just another reaching out towards making something whole werent they towards bridging the chasms and in the end that was the point wasnt it there was no bridge across for her not in this life my lord she said formally carefully i know i am surely unworthy and i fear to presume but if it is pleasing to you and to those assembled here i will try to bring you the searing back from the sea brandins eyes were the color of skies before rain his gaze never wavered from her face he said there is no presumption love and infinite worthiness you ennoble this ceremony with your presence here which confused her for these were not the words they had prepared but then he looked away from her slowly as if turning away from light people of the western palm he cried and his voice was clear and strong a kings a leader of men carrying resonantly across the square and out among the tall ships and the fishing boats we are asked by the lady dianora if we find her worthy to dive for us if we will place our hopes of fortune in her to seek the triads blessing in the war barbadior brings down upon us what is your reply she waits to hear and amid the thunderous roar of assent that followed a roar as loud and sure as they had known it would be after so much pentup anticipation dianora felt the brutal irony of it the bitter jest seize hold of her our hopes of fortune in her the triads blessing through her in that moment for the first time here at the very margin of the sea she felt fear come in to lay a finger on her heart for this truly was a ritual of the gods a ceremony of great age and numinous power and she was using it for her own hidden purposes for something shaped in her mortal heart could such a thing be allowed however pure the cause she looked back then at the palace and the mountains that had defined her life for so long the snows were gone from the peak of sangarios it was on that summit that eanna was said to have made the stars and named them all dianora looked away and down and she saw danoleon gazing at her from his great height she looked into the calm mild blue of his eyes and felt herself reach out and back through time to take strength and sureness from his quietude her fear fell away like a discarded garment it was for danoleon and for those like him who had died for the books and the statues and the songs and the names that were lost that she was here surely the triad would understand that when she was brought to her final accounting for this heresy surely adaon would remember micaela by the sea surely eanna of the names would be merciful slowly then dianora nodded her head as the roar of sound finally receded seeing that the high priestess of the god came forward in her crimson gown and helped her free of the darkgreen robe then she was standing by the water clad only in the thin green undertunic that barely reached her knees and brandin was holding a ring in his hand in the name of adaon and of morian he said words of ritual rehearsed and carefully prepared and always and forever in the name of eanna queen of lights we seek nurture here and shelter will the sea welcome us and bear us upon her breast as a mother bears a child will the oceans of this peninsula accept a ring of offering in my name and in the name of all those gathered here and send it back to us in token of our fates bound together i am brandin di chiara king of the western palm and i seek your blessing now then he turned to her as a second murmur of astonishment began at his last words at what hed named himself and beneath that sound as if cloaked and sheltered under it he whispered something else words only she could hear then he turned towards the sea and drew back his arm and he threw the golden ring in a high and shining arc up towards the brightness of the sky and the dazzling sun she saw it reach its apex and begin to fall she saw it strike the sea and she dived the water was shockingly cold so early in the year using the momentum of the dive she drove herself downwards kicking hard the green net held her hair so she could see brandin had thrown the ring with some care but he had known he could not simply toss it near to the pier too many people would be looking for that she propelled herself forward and down with half a dozen hard driving strokes her eyes straining ahead in the bluegreen filtered light she might as well reach it she might as well see if she could claim the ring before she died she could carry it as an offering down to morian her fear amazingly was entirely gone or perhaps it was not so amazing after all what was the riselka what did its vision offer if not this certainty a sureness to carry her past the old terror of dark waters to the last portal of morian it was ending now it should have ended long ago she saw nothing kicked again forcing herself deeper and further out towards where the ring had fallen there was a sureness in her a brilliant clarity an awareness of how events had shaped themselves towards this moment a moment when simply by her dying tigana might be redeemed at last she knew the story of onestra and cazal every person in this harbor did they all knew what disasters had followed upon onestras death brandin had gambled all on this one ceremony having no other choice in the face of battle brought to him too soon but alberico would take him now there could be no other result she knew exactly what would follow upon her death chaos and shrill denunciation the perceived judgment of the triad upon this arrogantly selfstyled king of the western palm there would be no army in the west to oppose the barbadian the peninsula of the palm would be albericos to harvest like a vineyard or grind like grain beneath the millstones of his ambition which was a pity she supposed but redressing that particular sorrow would have to be someone elses task the souls quest of another generation her own dream the task shed set herself with an adolescents pride sitting by a dead fire in her fathers house long years ago had been to bring tiganas name back into the world her only wish if she were allowed a wish before the dark closed over her and became everything was that brandin would leave would find a place to go far from this peninsula before the end came and that he might somehow come to know that his life wherever he went was a last gift of her love her own death didnt matter they killed women who slept with conquerors they named them traitors and they killed them in many different ways drowning would do she wondered if she would see the riselka here seagreen creature of the sea agent of destiny guardian of thresholds she wondered if she would have some last vision before the end if adaon would come for her the stern and glorious god appearing as he had to micaela on the beach so long ago she was not micaela though not bright and fair and innocent in her youth she didnt think that she would see the god instead she saw the ring it was to her right and just above drifting like a promise or an answered prayer down through the slow cold waters so far below the sunlight she reached out in the dreamlike slowness of all motion in the sea and she claimed it and put it on her finger that she might die as a seabride with seagold upon her hand she was very far under now the filtered light had almost disappeared this far down she knew her last gathered air would soon be gone as well the need for the surface becoming imperative reflexive she looked at the ring brandins ring his last and only hope she brought it to her lips and kissed it and then she turned her eyes her life her long quest away from the surface and the sunlight and love downward she went forcing herself as deep as she could and it was then just then that the visions began to come she saw her father in her mind clearly holding his chisel and mallet his shoulders and chest covered with a fine powder of marble walking with the prince in their courtyard valentins arm familiarly thrown about his shoulders and then she saw him as he had been before he rode away awkward and grim to war then baerd was in her mind as a boy sweetnatured seemingly always laughing then weeping outside her door the night naddo left them then wrapped close in her arms in a ruined moonlit world and lastly in the doorway of the house the night he went away her mother next and dianora felt as if she were somehow swimming back through all the years to her family for her these images of her mother were from before the fall before the madness had come from a time when her mothers voice had seemed able to gentle the evening air her touch still soothe all fevers away all fear of the dark it was dark now and very cold in the sea she felt the first agitation of what would soon be a desperate need for air there came to her then as on a scroll unrolling through her mind vignettes of her life after shed left home the village in certando smoke over avalle seen from the high and distant fields the man she couldnt even remember his name who had wanted to marry her others who had bedded her in that small room upstairs the queen in stevanien arduini rhamanus on the river galley taking her away the opening sea before them chiara scelto brandin and so at the very end it was he who was in her mind after all and over and above the hard quick images of a dozen years and more dianora suddenly heard again his last words on the pier the words she had been fighting to hold back from her awareness had tried not to even hear or understand for fear of what they might do to her resolve what he might do my love hed whispered come back to me stevan is gone i cannot lose you both or i will die she had not wanted to hear that anything like that words were power words tried to change you to shape bridges of longing that no one could ever really cross or i will die he had said and she knew could not even try to deny within herself that it was true that he would die that her false beneficent vision of brandin living somewhere else remembering her tenderly was simply another lie in the soul he would do no such thing my love he had called her she knew gods how she and her home had cause to know what love meant to this man how deep it went in him how deep there was a roaring sound in her ears now a pressure of water so far below the surface of the sea her lungs felt as if they were going to burst she moved her head to one side with difficulty there seemed to be something there beside her in the darkness a darting figure further out to sea a glimmer glimpse of a form of a man or a god she could not say but it could not be a man down here not so far below the light and the waves and not glowing as this form was another inward vision she told herself a last one then the figure seemed to be swimming slowly away from her light shining around it like an aureole she was spent now there was an aching in her of longing a yearning for peace she wanted to follow that gentle impossible light she was ready to rest to be whole and untormented without desire and then she understood or thought she did that figure had to be adaon it had to be the god coming for her but he had turned his back he was moving away the calm glow receding away towards blackness here in the depths of the sea she did not belong to him not yet she looked at her hand the ring upon it was almost invisible so faint was the light but she could feel it there and she knew whose ring it was she knew far down in the dark of the sea terribly far below the world where mortal men and women lived and breathed the air dianora turned she pushed her hands above her touched palms together and parted them cleaving the water upwards hurling her body like a spear up through all the layers of the sea of darkgreen death towards life again and all the unbridged chasms of air and light and love when he saw her break the surface of the sea devin wept even before he saw the flash of gold sparkling on the hand she lifted in weariness that they all might see the ring wiping at his streaming eyes his voice raw from screaming with all the others on the ship on all the ships all through the harbor of chiara he then saw something else brandin of ygrath who had named himself brandin di chiara had dropped to his knees on the pier and had buried his face in his hands his shoulders were shaking helplessly and devin understood then how wrong he had been before that this was not after all a man who was only pleased and happy that a stratagem had worked with agonizing slowness the woman swam to the pier an eager priest and priestess helped her from the sea and supported her and wrapped her shivering form in a robe of white and gold she could scarcely stand but devin still weeping saw her lift her head high as she turned to brandin and offered him the searing in a trembling hand then he saw the king the tyrant the sorcerer who had ruined them with his bitter annihilating power gather the woman into his arms gently with tenderness but with the unmistakable urgency of a man deprived and hungry for too long alessan reached up and removed the child from his shoulders setting it carefully down beside its mother she smiled at him her hair was yellow as her gown he smiled back reflexively but found himself turning away from her from the man and woman embracing feverishly next to them he felt physically ill there was a quite substantial level of jubilant chaos erupting all around in the harbor his stomach was churning he closed his eyes fighting nausea and dizziness the tumultuous overflow when he opened his eyes it was to gaze at the fool rhun they had said his name was it was deeply unsettling to see how with the king releasing his own feelings clutching the woman in that grip of transparent need the fool the surrogate seemed suddenly empty and hollow there was a blank weighted sadness to him jarring in its discontinuity amid the exultation all around rhun seemed a still silent point of numbness amid a world of tumult and weeping and laughter alessan looked at the bent balding figure with his weirdly deformed face and felt a blurred disorienting kinship to the man as if the two of them were linked here if only in their inability to know how to react to all of this he had to have been shielding himself alessan repeated in his mind for the tenth time the twentieth he had to he looked at brandin again and then away hurting with confusion and grief for how many years in quileia had he and baerd spun adolescent plots of making their way here of coming upon the tyrant and killing him their cries of tiganas name ringing in the air hurtling back into the world and this morning now hed been scarcely fifteen feet away unsuspected unknown with a dagger at his belt and only one row of people between him and the man whod tortured and killed his father he had to have been shielding himself against a blade but the thing was the simple fact was that alessan couldnt know that he hadnt tested it hadnt tried he had stood and watched observed played out his own cool plan of shaping events steering them towards some larger abstraction his eyes hurt there was a dull pulsing behind them as if the sun were too bright for him the woman in yellow had not moved away she was still looking up at him with a slantwise glance hard not to understand he didnt know where the childs father was but it was clear that the woman didnt greatly care just now it would be interesting he thought with that perverse detached quirk of his mind that was always there to see how many children were born in chiara nine months from now he smiled at her again meaninglessly and made some form of mumbled excuse then he started back alone through the celebrating uproarious crowd towards the inn where the three of them had been paying for their room by making music these past three days music might help right now he thought very often music was the only thing that helped his heart was still racing weirdly as it had started to do when the woman broke the surface of the water with the ring on her hand after so long undersea so long a time he had actually begun to calculate if there was anything he could do to make use of the shock and fear that was going to follow upon her death and then she had come up had been there before them in the water and in the second before the roaring of the crowd began brandin of ygrath who had been rigidly motionless from the moment she dived had collapsed to his knees as if struck from behind by a blow that had robbed him of all his strength and alessan had found himself feeling ill and hopelessly confused even as the screams of triumph and ecstasy began to sweep across the harbor and the ships this is fine he told himself now forcing his way past a wildly dancing ring of people this will fit it can be made to fit it is coming together as i planned there will be war they will face each other in senzio as i planned his mother was dead he had been fifteen feet away from brandin of ygrath with a blade in his belt it was too bright in the square and much too loud someone grabbed his arm as he went by and tried to draw him into a whirling circle he pulled away a woman careened into his arms and kissed him full upon the lips before she disengaged he didnt know her he didnt know anyone here he stumbled through the crowd pushed and pulled this way and that trying numbly to steer himself a cork in a flood towards the trialla where his room was and a drink and music devin was already at the crowded bar when he finally made it back erlein was nowhere to be seen yet probably still on the ship staying afloat as far from brandin as he could as if the sorcerer had the faintest scintilla of interest in pursuing wizards right now devin mercifully said nothing at all only pushed over a full glass and a flagon of wine alessan drained the glass and then another very quickly he had poured and tasted a third when devin quickly touched his arm and he realized with a sense of almost physical shock that hed forgotten his oath the blue wine third glass he pushed the flagon away and buried his head in his hands someone was speaking beside him two men arguing youre actually going to do it youre a goatbegotten fool the first one snarled im joining up the second replied in the flat accents of asoli after what that woman did for him i figure brandins blessed with luck and someone who styles himself brandin di chiara is a long sight better than that butcher from barbadior what are you friend afraid of fighting the other man gave a harsh bark of laughter you simpleminded dolt he said he flattened his voice in broad mimicry after what that woman did for him we all know what she did for him night after night that woman is the tyrants whore she spent a dozen years coupling with the man who conquered us all spreading her legs for him for her own gain and here you are here all of you are making a whore into a queen over you alessan pushed his head up from his hands he shifted his feet pivoting for leverage then without a word spoken he hammered a fist with all the strength of his body and all the tormented confusion of his heart into the speakers face he felt bones crack under his blow the man flew backwards into the bar and halfway over it scattering glasses and bottles with a splintering crash alessan looked down at his fist it was covered with blood across the knuckles and already beginning to swell he wondered if hed broken his hand he wondered if he was going to be thrown out of the bar or end up in a freewheeling brawl for this stupidity it didnt happen the asolini who had proclaimed his readiness for war clapped him on the back with a hard cheerful blow and the owner of the trialla their employer in fact grinned broadly completely ignoring the shards of broken glass along the bar i was hoping someone would shut him up he roared over the raucous tumult in the room someone else came over and wrung alessans hand which hurt amazingly three men were shouting insistent demands to buy him a drink four others picked up the unconscious man and began carting him unceremoniously away in search of medical aid someone spat on the mans shattered face as he was carried by alessan turned away from that back to the bar there was a single glass of astibar blue wine in front of him he looked quickly at devin who said nothing at all tigana he murmured under his breath as a cortean sailor behind him bellowed his praise and ruffled his hair and someone else pushed over to pound his back oh tigana let my memory of you be like a blade in my soul he drained the glass someone not devin immediately reached to pick it up and smash it on the floor which started a predictable sequence of other men doing the same with their own drinks as soon as he decently could he made his way out of the room and went upstairs he remembered to touch devins arms in thanks as he went in their room he found erlein lying on his bed hands behind his head gazing fixedly at the ceiling the wizard glanced over as alessan came in and his eyes quickly narrowed and grew frankly curious alessan said nothing he fell onto his pallet and closed his eyes which were still hurting the wine naturally hadnt helped he couldnt stop thinking about the woman what she had done how she had looked rising like some supernatural creature from the sea he couldnt force out of his mind the image of brandin the tyrant falling to his knees and burying his face in his hands hiding his eyes but not before alessan fifteen feet away only that had seen the shattering relief and the blaze of love that had shone through like the white light of a falling star his hand hurt terribly but he flexed it gingerly and didnt think hed broken anything he honestly couldnt have said why hed felled that man everything hed said about the woman from certando was true all of it was true yet none of it was the real truth everything about today was brutally confusing erlein unexpectedly tactful cleared his throat in a way that offered a question yes alessan said wearily not opening his eyes this is what you wanted to happen isnt it the wizard asked unwontedly hesitant with an effort alessan opened his eyes and looked over erlein was propped on one elbow gazing at him his expression thoughtful and subdued yes he said at length this is what i wanted erlein nodded slowly it means war then in my province his head was still throbbing but less than before it was quieter up here though the noise from below still penetrated a dull steady background of celebration in senzio yes he said he felt a terrible sadness so many years of planning and now that they were here where were they his mother was dead she had cursed him before she died but had let him take her hand as the ending came what did that mean could it be made to mean what he needed it to he was on the island had seen brandin of ygrath what would he tell baerd the slender dagger at his side felt heavy as a sword the woman had been so much more beautiful than hed expected her to be devin had had to give him the blue wine he couldnt believe that hed hurt a hapless innocent man so brutally just now had shattered the bones of his face i must look truly terrible he thought for even erlein to be so gentle with me now they were going to war in senzio this is what i wanted he repeated to himself erlein im sorry he said risking it trying to struggle upwards from this sorrow he braced for a stinging reply he almost wanted one but erlein said nothing at all at first and when he spoke it was mildly i think it is time was what he said shall we go down and play would that help would that help since when did his people erlein even need to minister to him so much they went back down the stairs devin was waiting for them on the makeshift stage at the back of the trialla alessan took up his tregean pipes his right hand was hurting and swollen but it was not going to keep him from making music he needed music now very badly he closed his eyes and began to play they fell silent for him in the densely crowded room erlein waited his hands motionless on the harp and devin did leaving him a space in which to reach upwards alone yearning towards that high note where confusion and pain and love and death and longing could all be left behind him for a very little while chapter normally when she went up on the ramparts of her castle at sunset it was to look south watching the play of light and the changing colors of the sky above the mountains of late though as springtime turned towards the summer they had all been waiting for alienor found herself climbing to the northern ramparts instead to pace the guards walk behind the crenellations or lean upon the cool rough stone gazing into the distance wrapped in her shawl against the chill that still came when the sun went down as if she could actually see as far as senzio the shawl was a new one brought by the messengers from quileia that baerd had told them would come the ones who carried the messages that could if all went right turn the whole world upside down not just the palm barbadior too where the emperor was said to be dying and ygrath and quileia itself where precisely because of what he was doing for them marius might not survive the quileian messengers had stopped on their way to fort ortiz as was appropriate to pay their respects to the lady of castle borso and to bring her a gift from the new king of quileia an indigocolored shawl a color almost impossible to find here in the palm and one which was she knew a mark of nobility in quileia it was evident that alessan had told this marius a fair bit about her involvement with him over the years which was fine marius of quileia it seemed was one of them in fact as baerd had explained it the afternoon after alessan had ridden into the braccio pass and then away west marius was the key to everything two days after the quileians passed through alienor began a habit of springtime rides that took her casually far enough afield to necessitate one or two overnight stays at neighboring castles at which time she relayed a quite specific message to half a dozen equally specific people senzio before midsummer not long afterwards a silkmerchant and then a singer she rather liked came down to castle borso with word of tremendous troop movements among the barbadians the roads were absolutely clogged with mercenaries marching north they said she had raised her eyebrows in quizzical mystification but had allowed herself more wine than was customary each of those two nights and had rewarded both men later after her own fashion up on the ramparts at sunset now she heard a footstep on the stair behind her she had been waiting for it without turning she said you are almost too late the sun is nearly gone which was true the color of the sky and the thin underlit clouds in the west had darkened from pink through crimson and purple most of the way down to the indigo she wore about her shoulders elena stepped out on the parapet im sorry she said inappropriately she was always apologizing still uneasy in the castle she moved to the guards walk beside alienor and looked out over the gathering darkness of the latespring fields her long yellow hair fanned over her shoulders the ends lifting in the breeze ostensibly she was here to serve as a new ladyinwaiting to alienor she had brought her two young children and her few belongings into borso two mornings after the ember days had ended it was considered a good idea that she be established here well before the time that might matter it appeared incredibly enough that there could actually come a time when her being here might matter tomaz the gaunt aged khardhu warrior had said that it would be necessary for one of them to stay here tomaz who was very clearly not from khardhun and just as clearly unwilling to say who he really was alienor didnt care about that what mattered was that baerd and alessan trusted him and in this matter baerd was deferring to the dark hollowcheeked man absolutely one of whom exactly alienor had asked the four of them had been alone herself baerd and tomaz and the redheaded young girl who didnt like her catriana baerd hesitated a long time one of the night walkers he said finally she had raised her eyebrows at that the small outward gesture serving to show all she was prepared to reveal of her inward astonishment really here they are still about baerd nodded and that is where you were last night when you went out after a second baerd nodded again the girl catriana blinked in manifest surprise she was clever and quite beautiful alienor thought but she still had rather a great deal to learn doing what alienor asked baerd but this time he shook his head she had expected that there were limits with baerd she enjoyed trying to push towards them one night ten years ago she had found exactly where his boundaries of privacy lay in one dimension at least surprisingly perhaps their friendship had deepened from that time on now unexpectedly he grinned you could have them all stay here of course not just one she had grimaced with a distaste only partly feigned one will be sufficient thank you assuming it is enough for your purposes whatever those are she said that last to the old man disguised as a khardhu warrior his skin coloring was really very good but she knew all about baerds techniques of disguise over the years he and alessan had shown up here in an effective diversity of appearances im not absolutely sure what our purposes are tomaz had replied frankly but insofar as we need an anchor for what baerd wants us to at least be able to try one of them in this castle should be enough enough for what shed probed again not really expecting anything enough for my magic to reach out and find this place tomaz had said bluntly this time it was she who blinked and catriana who looked unruffled and superior which was unfair alienor decided afterwards the girl must have known the old man was a wizard that was why she hadnt reacted alienor had enough of a sense of humor to find their byplay amusing and even to feel a little regretful when catriana had gone two days afterwards elena had come baerd had said it would be a woman he had asked alienor to take care of her she had raised her eyebrows at that as well on the northern ramparts she glanced over in the twilight elena had come up without a cloak her hands were cupping her elbows tightly against her body feeling unreasonably irritated alienor abruptly removed her shawl and draped it over the others shoulders you should know better by now she said sharply it gets cold up here when the sun goes down im sorry elena said again quickly motioning to remove the shawl but youll be chilled now ill go down and get something for myself stay where you are alienor snapped elena froze apprehension in her eyes alienor looked out past her past the darkening fields and the emerging flickers of light where night candles and fires were being lit in houses and farms below she looked beyond all these under the first stars of the evening her eyes straining north her imagination winging far beyond her sight to where the others would all be gathering now or soon stay here she said more gently stay with me elenas blue eyes widened in the darkness as she looked over her expression was grave thoughtful unexpectedly she smiled and then even more astonishingly she moved nearer and drew her arm through alienors pulling her close alienor stiffened for a second then allowed herself to relax against the other woman she had asked for companionship for the first time in more years than she could remember she had asked for this a completely different kind of intimacy it felt of late as if something rigid and hard was falling away inside her she had waited for this summer for what it might mean for so many years what had the young one said devin about being allowed more than the transience of desire if only one believed it was deserved no one had ever said such a thing to her in all the years since cornaro of borso had died fighting barbadior in which dark time his young widow his bride alone in a highland castle with her grief and rage had been set upon the road towards what she had become he had gone with alessan devin by now they would probably be in the north as well alienor looked out letting her thoughts stream like birds arrowing away through darkness across the miles between to where all of their fates would be decided when midsummer came dark hair and light blown back and mingled by the wind the two women stood together in that high place for a long time sharing warmth sharing the night and the waiting time it had long been said sometimes in mockery sometimes with a bemusement that bordered on awe that as the days heated up in summer so did the nighttime passions of senzio the hedonistic selfindulgence of that northern province blessed with fertile soil and gentle weather was a byword in the palm and even over the seas you could get whatever you wanted in senzio it was said provided you were willing to pay for it and fight someone to keep it the initiated often added towards the end of spring that year it might have been thought that burgeoning tensions and the palpable threat of war would have dampened the nocturnal ardor of the senzians and their endless flow of visitors for wine for lovemaking in diverse combinations and for brawling in the taverns and streets someone might indeed have thought such a thing but not anyone who knew senzio in fact it actually seemed as if the looming portents of disaster the barbadians massed ominously on the ferraut border the everincreasing numbers of ships of the ygrathen flotilla anchored at farsaro island off the northwestern tip of the province were simply spurs to the wildness of night in senzio town there were no curfews here there hadnt been for hundreds of years and though emissaries of both invading powers were prominently housed in opposite wings of what was now called the governors castle senzians still boasted that they were the only free province in the palm a boast that began to ring more hollow with each passing day and sybaritic night as the entire peninsula braced itself for a conflagration in the face of which onrushing intrusion of reality senzio town merely intensified the already manic pace of its dark hours legendary wateringholes like the red glove or thetaph were packed with sweating shouting patrons every night to whom they dispensed their harsh overpriced liquors and a seemingly endless stream of available flesh male or female in the warrens of airless rooms upstairs those innkeepers who had elected for whatever reasons not to trade in purchased love had to offer substantially different inducements to their patrons for the eponymous owner of solinghis a tavern not far from the castle good food decent vintages and ales and clean rooms in which to sleep were assurances of a respectable if not an extravagant living derived primarily from merchants and traders disinclined to traffic in the carnality of night or at least to sleep and eat amid that overripe corruption solinghis also prided itself on offering by day or night the best music to be found in the city at any given time at this particular moment shortly before the dinnerhour one day late in the spring the bar and table patrons of the almost full tavern were enjoying the music of an unlikely trio a senzian harper a piper from astibar and a young asolini tenor who according to a rumor started a couple of days before was the singer who had disappeared after performing sandre dastibars funeral rites last fall rumors of every kind were rife in senzio that spring but few believed this one such a prodigy was unlikely in the extreme to be singing in a puttogether group like this but in fact the young tenor had an exceptional voice and he was matched by the playing of the other two solinghi di senzio was immensely pleased with their effect on business over the past week the truth was he would have given them employment and a room upstairs if they made music like boarhounds in lust solinghi had been a friend of the darkhaired man who was now calling himself adreano dastibar for almost ten years a friend and more than that as it happened almost half the patrons of the inn this spring were men who had come to senzio expressly to meet the three musicians here solinghi kept his mouth shut poured wine and beer supervised his cooks and servinggirls and prayed to eanna of the lights every night before he went to sleep that alessan knew what he was doing this particular afternoon the patrons enjoying the young tenors rousing rendition of a certandan ballad were rudely snapped out of their barpounding rhythm when the doors to the street were pushed open revealing a largish cluster of new customers nothing of note in that of course or not until the singer cut himself off in the middle of a chorus with a shouted greeting the piper quickly laid down his pipes and leaped off the stage and the harper lowered his own instrument and followed if more slowly the enthusiasms of the reunion that ensued would have led to predictably cynical conclusions about the nature of the men involved given the way of such things in senzio had the new party not included a pair of exceptionally attractive young women one with short red hair one with ravendark even the harper a dour unsmiling fellow if ever there was one was drawn almost against his will into the circle to be crushed against the bony breast of a cadaverous looking khardhu mercenary who towered over the rest of the party a moment later another kind of reunion occurred one with a different resonance that even stilled the excitement of the newly mingled group another man rose and walked diffidently over to the five people who had just arrived those who looked closely could see that his hands were trembling baerd they heard him say there followed a moment of silence then the man whom hed addressed said naddo in a tone even the most innocent senzian could interpret any lingering doubts about that were laid to rest a second later by the way the two men embraced each other they even wept more than one man eyeing the two women with frank admiration decided that his chances of a conversation and who knew what else might be better than theyd first appeared if the men were all like that alais had been moving through the days since tregea in a state of excitement that brought an almost continuous flush to her pale skin and made her more delicately beautiful than she knew what she did know is why she had been allowed to come from the moment the sea maid s landingboat had silently returned to the ship in the moonlit harbor of tregea bearing her father and catriana and the two men theyd gone to meet alais had been aware that something more than friendship was involved here then the darkskinned man from khardhu had looked at her appraisingly and at rovigo with an amused expression on his lined face and her father hesitating for only a moment had told her who this really was and then quietly but with an exhilarating confidence in her hed explained what these people his new partners were really doing here and what he appeared to have been doing in secret with them for a great many years it appeared that it had not been entirely a coincidence after all that theyd met three musicians on the road outside their home during the festival of vines last fall listening intently trying not to miss a syllable or an implication alais measured her own inward response to all of this and was pleased beyond words to discover that she was not afraid her fathers voice and manner had much to do with that and the simple fact that he was trusting her with this it was the other man baerd they named him who said to rovigo if you are truly set on coming with us to senzio then we will have to find a place on the coast to put your daughter ashore why exactly alais had said quickly before rovigo could answer she could feel her color rising as all eyes turned to her they were down below deck crowded in her fathers cabin baerds eyes were very dark by candlelight he was a hardlooking even a dangerousseeming man but his voice when he answered her was not unkind because i dont believe in subjecting people to unnecessary risks there is danger in what we are about to do there are also reasons for us to face those dangers and your fathers assistance and that of his men if he trusts them is important to us for you to come would be a danger without necessity does that make sense she forced herself to be calm only if you judge me a child incapable of any contribution she swallowed i am the same age as catriana and i think i now understand what is happening here what you have been trying to do i have i can say that i have the same desire as any of you to be free there are truths in that i think she should come it was remarkably catriana baerd she went on if this is truly the time that will decide we have no business refusing people who feel the way we do no right to decide that they must huddle in their homes waiting to see if they are still slaves or not when the summer ends baerd looked at catriana for a long time but said nothing he turned to rovigo deferring to him with a gesture in her fathers face alais could see worry and love warring with his pride in her and then by the light of the candles she saw that inner battle end if we get through this alive rovigo dastibar said to his daughter his life his joy in life your mother will kill me you know that dont you ill try to protect you alais said gravely though her heart was racing like a wild thing it had been their talk at the railing of the ship she knew she knew it absolutely the two of them looking at the cliffs under moonlight after the storm i dont know what it is she had said but i need more i know her father had replied i know you do if i could give it it would be yours the world and the stars of eanna would all be yours it was because of that because he loved her and meant what he had said that he was allowing her to come with them to where the world they knew would be put into the balance of that journey to senzio she remembered two things particularly standing at the rail early one morning with catriana as they moved north up the coast of astibar one tiny village and then another and another the roofs of houses bright in the sun small fishing boats bobbing between the sea maid and the shore that one is my home catriana said suddenly breaking a silence speaking so softly only alais could hear and that boat with the blue sail is actually my fathers her voice was odd eerily detached from the meaning of the words we have to stop then alais had murmured urgently ill tell my father hell catriana laid a hand on her arm not yet shed said i cant see him yet after after senzio perhaps that was one memory the other very different was of rounding the northern tip of farsaro island early in the morning and seeing the ships of ygrath and the western palm anchored in the harbor there waiting for war she had been afraid then as the reality of what they were sailing towards was brought home to her in that vision at once brightly colorful and forbidding as grey death but she had looked over at catriana and her father and then at the old duke sandre who named himself tomaz now and she had seen shadings of doubt and anxiety in each of them as well only baerd carefully counting the flotilla had a different kind of expression on his face if shed been forced to put a name to that look she would have said hesitantly that it was desire the next afternoon they had come to senzio and had moored the maid in the crowded harbor and gone ashore and so had come at the end of the day to an inn all the others seemed to know about and the five of them had walked through the doors of that tavern into a flashing of joy bright and sudden as the sun come up from the rim of the sea devin embraced her tightly and then kissed her on the lips and then alessan after a moments visible anxiety at her presence and a searching glance at her father did exactly the same there was a leanfaced greyhaired man named erlein with them and then a number of other men in the tavern came up naddo was one name ducas another and there was an older blind man with those two whose name she never caught he walked with the aid of a magnificent stick it had the most extraordinary carved eagles head with eyes so piercing they seemed almost to be a compensation for the loss of his own there were others as well from all over it seemed she missed most of their names there was a great deal of noise the innkeeper brought them wine two bottles of senzio green and a third one of astibars blue wine she had a small careful glass of each watching everyone trying to sort through the chaotic babble of all that was said alessan and baerd drew briefly apart for a moment she noticed when they returned to the table both men looked thoughtful and somewhat grim then devin and alessan and erlein had to go back and make their music for an hour while the others ate and alais flushed and terribly excited inwardly relived the feel of the two mens lips upon hers she found herself smiling shyly at everyone afraid that her face was giving away exactly what she was feeling afterwards they made their way upstairs behind the broad back of the innkeepers wife to their rooms and later when it was quiet on that upper level catriana led her from the room they were put in down the hall to the bedroom devin and alessan and erlein shared they were there and a number of other men some of the ones shed just met and a few who were strangers her father entered a moment later with sandre and baerd she and catriana were the only women there she had a moment to feel a little strange about that and to think about how far she was from home before everyone fell silent as alessan pushed a hand through his hair and began to speak and as he did alais concentrating gradually came to understand with the others the dimensions the truly frightening shape of what he proposed to do at a certain point he stopped and looked at three men one by one at duke sandre first then at a roundfaced certandan named sertino sitting with ducas and finally almost challengingly at erlein di senzio the three of them were wizards she understood it was a hard thing to come to terms with especially sandre the exiled duke of astibar their neighbor in the distrada all her life the man called erlein was sitting on his bed his back against the wall hands crossed over his breast he was breathing hard it is clear to me now that you have lost your mind he said his voice shook you have lived in your dreams so long youve lost sight of the world and now you are going to kill people in your madness alais saw devin open his mouth and then snap it shut without speaking all of this is possible alessan said with an unexpected mildness it is possible i am pursuing a path of madness though i think not but yes there are likely to be a great many people killed we always knew that the real madness would have been in pretending otherwise for the moment though compose your spirit and ease your soul you know as well as i do nothing is happening nothing what do you mean it was her father alessans expression was wry almost bitter havent you noticed you were in the harbor you walked through the town have you seen any barbadian troops any ygrathens soldiers from the west nothing is happening alberico of barbadior has his entire army massed on the border and the man refuses to order them north he is afraid said sandre flatly in the silence that followed hes afraid of brandin perhaps her father said thoughtfully or else he is just cautious too cautious what do we do then asked the redbearded tregean named ducas alessan shook his head i dont know i honestly dont know this is one thing i never expected you tell me he said how do we make him cross the border how do we bring him to war he looked at ducas and then at each of the others in the room no one answered him they would think he was a coward they were fools they were all fools only a fool went lightly into war especially a war such as this that risked everything for a gain he hardly cared about senzio the palm what did they matter should he throw twenty years away for them every time a messenger arrived from back in astibar something in him leaped with hope if the emperor had died if the emperor had died he and his men were gone away from this blighted peninsula home to claim an emperors tiara in barbadior that was his war the one he wanted to fight the one that mattered the only thing that had really mattered all these years he would sail home with three armies and wrest the tiara from the court favorites hovering there like so many ineffectual fluttering moths and after that he could make war back here with all the gathered might of barbadior then let brandin of ygrath of the western palm whatever he chose to name himself then let him try to stand before alberico emperor of barbadior gods the sweetness of it but no such message came from the east no such glittering reprieve and so the bald reality was that he found himself camped with his mercenaries here on the border between ferraut and senzio preparing to face the armies of ygrath and the western palm knowing that the eyes of the entire world would be upon them now if he lost he lost everything if he won well that depended on the cost if too many of his men died here what kind of an army would he have to lead home and too many men dying was a vivid prospect now ever since what had happened in the harbor of chiara most of the ygrathen army had indeed sailed home exactly as anticipated leaving brandin crippled and exposed which is why alberico had moved why the three companies were here and he with them the flow and shape of events had seemed to be on their side in the clearest possible way then the certandan woman had fished a ring from the water for brandin she haunted his dreams that neverseen woman three times now shed surfaced like a nightmare in his life back when brandin had first claimed her for his saishan she had nearly drawn him into an insane war siferval had wanted to fight alberico remembered the third company captain had proposed storming across the border into lower corte and sacking stevanien itself gods alberico shuddered even now long years after at the thought of such a war far to the west against the ygrathens in all their power he had swallowed his bile and absorbed all the mocking gibes brandin sent east even then long ago he had preserved his discipline kept his eyes on the real prize back home but he might have had the peninsula of the palm without effort this spring a pure gift fallen from the sky if that same dianora di certando had not saved the ygrathens life two months ago it had been there for him gently floating down with brandin assassinated the ygrathens would have all sailed home and the western provinces would have lain open before him like so much ripe fruit quileias crippled king would have hobbled across the mountains to abase himself before alberico begging for the trade he needed no elaborate letters then about fearing the mighty power of ygrath it would have all been so easy so elegant but it was not so because of the woman the woman from one of his own provinces the irony was coruscating it was like acid in his soul certando was his and dianora di certando was the only reason brandin was alive and now her third time in his life she was the only reason there was an army from the west a flotilla anchored in the bay of farsaro waiting for alberico to make the slightest move they are fewer than us his spies reported daily and not as well armed fewer the three captains echoed each other in mindless litany not as well armed they gibbered we must move they chorused their imbecilic faces looming in his dreams set close together hanging like lurid moons too near the earth anghiar his emissary in the governors castle at senzio sent word that casalia still favored them that the governor realized that brandin was not as strong as they that he had been persuaded to see the virtue of tilting even further towards the barbadior the emissary from the western palm one of the few ygrathens who had decided to stay with brandin was having a more difficult time each passing day gaining audience with the governor but anghiar dined with plump sybaritic casalia almost every night so now even anghiar who had grown lazy and selfindulgent morally corrupt as any senzian during his years there was saying the same thing as all the others senzio is a vineyard ripe for harvesting come ripe for harvesting didnt they understand didnt any of them realize that there was sorcery to reckon with he knew how strong brandin was he had probed and backed quickly away from the ygrathens power in the year they had both come here and that had been when he himself was in his prime not hollow and weakened with a bad foot and a drooping eye after almost being killed in that cursed sandreni lodge last year he was not the same anymore he knew it if none of the others did if he went to war it had to be a decision made in the light of that his military edge had to be enough to offset the ygrathens sorcery he needed to be certain surely any man not a fool could see that that had nothing to do with cowardice only with a careful measuring of gains and losses risks and opportunities in his dreams in his tent on the border he thrust the vacuous moon faces of his captains back up into the sky and under five moons not two he slowly dismembered and defiled the stakedout body of the woman from certando then the mornings would come digesting messages like rancid food he would begin to wrestle again endlessly with the other thing that was nagging him this season like an infected wound something felt wrong entirely wrong there was an aspect about this whole chain of events from the autumn onwards that jarred within him like a jangling dissonant chord here on the border with his army all around him he was supposed to feel as if he were calling the measure of the dance forcing brandin and the entire palm to respond to his tune seizing control again after a winter of being impacted upon in all those trivial disconcerting cumulative ways shaping events so that quileia would have no choice but to seek him out so that back home in the empire they could not mistake his power the vigor of his will the glory of his conquests that was how he was supposed to feel how he had indeed briefly felt the morning hed heard that brandin had abdicated in ygrath when hed ordered his three armies north to the border of senzio but something had changed since that day and it was more than just the presence of opposition now waiting in the bay of farsaro there was something else something so vague and undefined he couldnt even talk about it even if hed had anyone to talk to couldnt even pin it down but it was there nagging at him like an old wound in rain alberico of barbadior had not got to where he was achieved this power base from which a thrust for the tiara was imminent without subtlety and thoughtfulness without learning to trust his instincts and his instincts told him here on the border with his captains and his spies and his emissary in senzio literally begging him to march that something was wrong that he was not calling the tune someone else was somehow someone else was guiding the dangerous steps of this dance he had truly no idea who it could be but the feeling was there each morning when he woke and it would not be shaken off neither would it come clear for him under the spring sun in that border meadow bright with the banners of barbadior with irises and asphodels and fragrant with the scent of the surrounding pines so he waited praying to his gods for word of a death back home agonizingly aware that the world might soon be laughing at him if he drew back knowing as spies kept hastening south in relays that brandin was getting stronger in farsaro every day but held there on the border by his craftiness his instinct for survival by that ache of doubt waiting for something to come clear refusing as the days slipped past to dance to what might be someone elses tune however seductively the hidden pipes might play she was numbingly afraid this was worse infinitely worse than the bridge in tregea there she had embraced and accepted danger because there was more than a hope of surviving the leap it had been only water down below however frigid it might be and there had been friends waiting in the darkness around the bend to claim her from the river and chafe her back to life tonight was different catriana realized with dismay that her hands were shaking she stopped in the shadows of a lane to try to steady herself she reached up nervously to adjust her hair under the dark hood fingering the jeweled black comb shed set in it on the ship coming here alais who had said she was used to doing so for her sisters had evened and shaped her original swift cropping on the floor of the shop in tregea catriana knew her appearance was perfectly acceptable now more than that actually if the reactions of men in senzio these past days meant anything and they had to mean something for that was what had brought her out here in the darkness alone pressed against a rough stone wall in a lane waiting now for a noisy swarm of revelers to pass by in the street before her this was a better part of town so near the castle but there was no truly safe quarter of senzio for a woman alone in the streets at night she wasnt out here for safety though which is why none of the others knew where she was they would never have let her come nor would she being honest with herself have knowingly let any of them undertake anything like this this was death she was under no illusions all afternoon walking through the market with devin and rovigo and alais she had been shaping this plan and remembering her mother that single candle always lit at sunset on the first of the ember days devins father had done the same thing she remembered him saying pride hed thought it was withholding something from the triad because of what they had allowed to happen her mother wasnt a proud woman but neither had she permitted herself to forget tonight catriana saw herself as being like one of her mothers forbidden candles on those ember nights while all the rest of the world lay shrouded in darkness she was a small flame exactly like those candles one that would not last the night but one that if the triad had any love at all for her might shape a conflagration before she went out the drunken revelers finally staggered by heading in the direction of the harbor taverns she waited another moment and then muffled in her hood went quickly into the street keeping to the side of it and started the other way toward the castle it would be much better she thought if she could somehow make her hands be still and slow her racing heart she should have had a glass of wine back at solinghis before slipping away using the outside back stairs so that none of the others would see her shed sent alais down to dinner alone pleading a womans illness promising to follow soon if she could she had lied so easily had even managed a reassuring smile then alais was gone and she was alone realizing in that precise instant as the room door gently closed that she would never see any of the others again in the street she shut her eyes feeling suddenly unsteady she put her hand on a shopfront for support drawing deep breaths of the night air there were tainflowers not far away and the unmistakable fragrance of sejoia trees she was near to the castle gardens then she bit her lips to force color into them overhead the stars were bright and close vidomni was already risen in the east with blue ilarion to follow soon she heard a sudden peal of laughter from the next street over a womans laughter followed by shouting the voice of a man more laughter they were going the other way as she looked up a star fell in the sky following its track to her left she saw the garden wall of the castle the entrance would be further around that way entrances and endings faced alone but she had been a solitary child and then solitary as a woman drawn into an orbit of her own that took her away from others even those who would be her friends devin and alais only the latest of those who had tried there had been others back home in the village before she left she knew her mother had grieved for her proud solitude pride again her father had fled tigana before the battles at the river there it was there it was carefully she drew back her hood with real gratitude she discovered that her hands were steady now she checked her earrings the silver band about her throat the jeweled ornament in her hair then she drew onto her hand the red glove shed bought in the market that afternoon and she walked across the street and around the corner of the garden wall into the blaze of light at the entrance to the governors castle of senzio there were four guards two outside the locked gates two just within she allowed her hooded cloak fall open to let them see the black gown she wore beneath the two guards outside the gates glanced at each other and visibly relaxed removing their hands from their swords the other two moved nearer the better to see by torchlight she stopped in front of the first pair she smiled would you be kind enough she said to let anghiar of barbadior know that his red vixen has come and she held up her left hand sheathed in the bright red glove she had actually been amused at first by devins reaction and rovigos in the marketplace casalia the plump unhealthy looking governor had ridden through side by side with the emissary from barbadior they had been laughing together brandins emissary from the western palm had been several paces behind among a cluster of lesser senzians the image and the message were as clear as they could be made alais and catriana had been standing at a silkmerchants stall they had turned to see the governor go by he had not gone by instead anghiar of barbadior laid a quick restraining hand on casalias braceleted wrist and they stopped their prancing horses directly in front of the two women thinking back on it catriana realized that she and alais must have made a striking pair anghiar blond and beefy with an upturned moustache and hair as long as her own was now evidently thought so a mink and a red vixen he said in a voice pitched for casalias ear the plump governor laughed too quickly a little too loudly anghiars blue eyes stripped the women to their flesh under the bright sun alais looked away but not down catriana met the barbadians gaze as steadily as she could she would not turn away from these men his smile only deepened a red vixen truly he repeated but this time to her and not to casalia the governor laughed anyhow they moved on their party following including brandins emissary looking grimly unhappy for all the beauty of the morning catriana had become aware of devin at her shoulder and rovigo beside his daughter she looked at them and registered the clenched fury in their eyes it was then that shed felt amusement however briefly that she said lightly is exactly how baerd looked before he almost had us both killed in tregea i dont think im prepared to repeat the experience i have no hair left to cut it was alais cleverer by far than catriana had realized at first who laughed carrying them past the moment the four of them walked on i would have killed him devin said quietly to her as they paused by a leather goods booth of course you would have she said easily then realizing how that probably sounded and that he was quite serious in what hed said she squeezed his arm not something she would have done six months before she was changing they all were but just about then amusement and anger both fading catriana began to think about something it seemed to her that the brightness of the day slid abruptly into shadow for a moment though there were no clouds in the sky at all she realized afterwards that she had decided to do it almost as soon as the idea took shape in her mind before the morning market had closed she had managed to be alone long enough to purchase what she needed earrings gown black comb red glove and it was while doing these things that shed begun to think about her mother and to remember the bridge in tregea not surprisingly the mind worked in patterns like that such patterns were why she was doing this why shed even been able to think of it when night fell she would have to come away by herself telling none of them a lie of some sort for alais no farewells they would stop her just as she would have stopped any of them but something had to be done they all knew it a move had to be made and that morning in the market catriana had thought shed discovered what that move might be shed spent the first part of this solitary walk through darkness wishing she were braver though that her hands would not tremble as they were but theyd stopped shaking after all when she reached the garden wall and saw a star fall in the blueblack velvet sky well have to search you you understand said one of the two guards outside the gates a crooked smile on his face of course she murmured stepping nearer there are so few benefits to standing watch here arent there the other one laughed and drew her forward not ungently into the light of the torches and then a little past them to the more private shadows at the side of the square she heard a brief lowpitched altercation between the two men on the other side of the gate ending in a concise sixword order one of them manifestly outranked reluctantly began heading inward through the courtyard to find anghiar of barbadior and tell him his dreams had just come true or some such thing the other hastily unlocked the gates with a key on a ring at his belt and came out to join the others they took some with her but were not unkind nor did they presume too much in the end if she was going to the barbadian and found favor there they could be at risk in offending her she had counted on something like that she managed to laugh softly once or twice but not so much as to encourage them she was thinking of patterns still remembering the very first evening shed come to alessan and baerd the night porter at the inn groping for her as she went by leering sure of why she was there i will not sleep with you shed said when they opened to her knock i have never slept with any man so much irony in her life looking back from these tangled shadows the guards hands moving over her what mortal knew the way their fate line would run inevitably perhaps she thought about devin in the hidden closet of the sandreni palace which had worked our rather differently in almost every way than she had expected it to not that shed been thinking of futures or fates that day not then and now what should she be thinking now as the patterns began to unfold again the images she told herself cloaked in shadow with three guards hold hard to the images entrances and endings a candle starting a blaze by the time they were done with her the fourth guard was back with two barbadians they were smiling too but they treated her with some courtesy as they led her through the open gates and across the central courtyard light spilled erratically downward from interior windows above before they passed inside she looked up at the stars eannas lights every one of them with a name they went into the castle through a pair of massive doors guarded by four more men then up two long flights of marble stairs and along a bright corridor on the highest level at the end of this last hallway a door was partly open beyond it as they approached catriana caught a glimpse of a room elaborately furnished in dark rich colors in the doorway itself stood anghiar of barbadior in a blue robe to match his eyes holding a glass of green wine and devouring her with his gaze for the second time that day she smiled and let him take her redgloved fingers in his own manicured hand he led her into the room he closed and locked the door they were alone there were candles burning everywhere red vixen he said how do you like to play devin had been edgy all week uneasy in his own skin he knew they all felt the same way the combination of building tension and enforced idleness coupled with the awareness one had only to look at alessans face sometimes of how close they were to a culmination created a pervasive dangerous irritability among them all in the face of such a mood alais had been extraordinary a blessing of grace these past few days rovigos daughter had seemed to grow wiser and gentler and yet more at ease among them with each passing day as if sensing a need a reason for her to be here and so moving to fill that need observant unceasingly cheerful effortlessly conversational with questions and bright responses and a declared passion for long anecdotes from all of them she had almost singlehandedly prevented three or four mealtimes from degenerating into sullen grimness or fractious rancor blind rinaldo the healer seemed almost in love with her so much did he seem to flourish when she was by his side he wasnt the only one of them either devin thought almost grateful that the tensions of the time were preventing him from addressing his own inward feelings in the hothouse atmosphere of senzio alaiss delicate pale beauty and diffident grace singled her out like some flower transplanted here from a garden in a cooler milder world which was of course exactly true an observer himself devin would catch rovigo gazing at his daughter as she drew one or another of their new companions into conversation and the look in the mans eyes spoke volumes now at the end of dinner having spent the last halfhour turning their market expedition of the morning and afternoon into a veritable seavoyage of discovery alais excused herself briefly and went back upstairs her departure was followed by an abrupt return of grimness to the table an inexorable reversion to the single dominating preoccupation of their lives even rovigo was not immune he leaned towards alessan and asked a sharp lowvoiced question about the latest foray outside the city walls alessan and baerd with ducas and arkin and naddo had been scouting the distrada searching out likely battlefields and so the best place for them to position themselves when the time came for their own last roll of dice devin didnt much like thinking about that it had to do with magic and magic always bothered him besides which there had to be a battle for anything to happen and alberico of barbadior was hunkered down in his meadow on the border and showing no signs of moving at all it was enough to drive men mad they had begun spending more time apart from each other in the days and evenings partly for reasons of caution but undeniably because too much proximity in this mood was good for none of them baerd and ducas were in one of the harbor taverns tonight braving the blandishments of the fleshmerchants to keep in touch with the tregeans men and rovigos sailors and a number of the others who had made their way north in response to a longawaited summons they also had a rumor to spread about rinaldo di senzio the governors exiled uncle said to be somewhere in the city stirring up revolution against casalia and the tyrants devin had briefly wondered about the wisdom of that but alessan had explained even before devin could ask rinaldo was greatly changed in eighteen years few people even knew he had been blinded he had been a muchloved man for casalia to have released such a word would have been dangerous back then they had gouged rinaldos eyes to neutralize him and then kept it very quiet the old man huddled quietly now in a corner of solinghis was unlikely in the extreme to be recognized and the only thing they could really do these days was contribute as much as they could to raising tensions in the city if the governor could be made more anxious the emissaries a little more uneasy rinaldo himself said little though it was he himself who had first suggested starting the rumor he seemed to be coiling or gathering himself with a war to come the demands on a healer would be severe and rinaldo was not young anymore when he did speak it was mostly with sandre the two old men enemies from rival provinces in the time before the tyrants now eased and distracted each other with whispered recollections from bygone years stories of men and women who had almost all crossed to morian long ago erlein di senzio was seldom with them the past few days he played his music with devin and alessan but tended to eat and drink alone sometimes in solinghis more often elsewhere a few of his fellow senzians had recognized the troubadour over the course of their time here though erlein seemed no more effusive with them than he was with any of their own party devin had seen him walking one morning with a woman who looked so much like him he was sure she was his sister he had thought of walking over to be introduced but hadnt felt up to enduring erleins abrasiveness one might have naively thought that as events hung fire here poised on the edge of a climax the wizard would lay down his own grudges finally it was not so he wasnt worried about erleins absences because alessan wasnt for the man to betray them in any way was certain death for himself erlein might be enraged and bitter and sullen but he wasnt by any stretch a fool he had gone elsewhere to dine this evening as well though he would have to be back in solinghis soon they were due to play in a few minutes and for their music erlein was never late the music was their only sanctuary of harmony these last few days but devin knew that only really applied to the three of them what some of the others scattered about the city were doing for release he couldnt imagine or yes he could this was senzio somethings wrong blind rinaldo said abruptly beside him tilting his head as if sniffing the air alessan stopped sketching the distrada terrain on the tablecloth and looked up quickly so did rovigo sandre had already halfrisen from his chair alais hurried up to the table even before she spoke devin felt a finger of dread touch him catrianas gone she said fighting to keep her voice low her eyes flicked from her father to devin then rested on alessan what how rovigo said sharply we would have had to see her when she came down surely the back stairs outside alessan said his hands devin noticed had suddenly flattened on the tabletop the prince stared at alais what else the girls face was white she changed her clothes i dont understand why she bought a black silk gown and some jewelry in the market this afternoon i was going to ask her about it but i i didnt want to presume shes so hard to ask questions of but theyre gone all the things she bought a silk gown alessan said incredulously his voice rising what in morians name but devin already knew he knew absolutely alessan hadnt been with them that morning neither had sandre they had no way of understanding a bonedeep fear dried his mouth and began hammering at his heart he stood up tipping over his chair spilling his wine oh catriana he said catriana no stupidly fatuously as if she were in the room and could still be stopped still be kept among them dissuaded from going out into the dark alone with her silk and jewels with her unfathomable courage and her pride what devin tell me what is it sandre voice like a knife alessan said nothing only turned the grey eyes bracing for pain shes gone to the castle devin said flatly shes gone to kill anghiar of barbadior she thinks that will start the war even as he spoke he was moving rational thought quite gone something deeper than that infinitely deeper driving him though if she had reached the castle already there was no hope no hope at all he was flying when he reached the door even so alessan was right beside him with rovigo only a step behind devin knocked someone down as they burst into the darkness he didnt look back eanna show grace he prayed silently over and over as they raced toward the risen moons goddess of light let it not be like this not like this he said nothing though he sped toward the castle in the dark fear in his heart like a living thing bringing the terrible knowledge of death devin knew how fast he could run had prided himself on his speed all his life but moving as if possessed scarcely touching the ground alessan was with him when they reached the governors castle they careened around a corner side by side and came to the garden wall and there they stopped looking upward past the branches of a huge spreading sejoia tree they could hear rovigo come up behind them and someone else further back they did not turn to see they were both looking at the same thing there was a figure silhouetted against torchlight in one of the highest windows a figure they knew wearing a long dark gown devin dropped to his knees in the moonlit lane he thought about climbing the wall about screaming her name aloud the sweet scent of tainflowers surrounded him he looked at alessans face and then quickly away from what he saw there how did she like to play mostly she didnt and especially not like this she had not been the playing kind she had liked swimming and walks along the beach in the mornings mostly alone other walks inland into the woods picking mushrooms or mahgoti leaves for tea she had liked music always and the more since meeting alessan and yes some six or seven years ago she had begun to have her own intermittent dreams of finding love and passion somewhere in the world not often though and the man seldom had a face in those dreams there was a mans face with her now though and this was not a dream nor was it play it was death entrances and endings a candle shaping fire before it went out she was lying on his bed naked to his sight and touch save for the jewelry shining at wrist and throat and ears and in her hair light blazed from all corners of the room it seemed that anghiar liked to watch his women respond to what he did come on top of me hed murmured in her ear later she had replied he had laughed a husky sound deep in his throat and had moved to be above her naked as well save for his ruffled white shirt which hung open showing the delicate blond hairs on his chest he was a skillful lover a deeply experienced one it was what let her kill him in the end he lowered his head to her breasts before entering her he took one nipple in his mouth surprisingly gently and began to run his tongue in circles over it catriana closed her eyes for a moment she made a sound one she thought was right she stretched her hands catlike above her head moving her body sinuously under the pressure of his mouth and hands she touched the black comb in her hair red vixen she moaned again his hands were on her thighs moving upward and between his mouth was still at her breast she slid the comb free pressed the catch so the blade sprang open and then moving without haste as if she had all the time in the world as if this single moment were the gathered sum of all the moments of her life she brought her weapon down and plunged it into his throat which meant that his life was over you could buy anything you wanted in senzios weapon market anything at all including a womans ornament with a hidden blade and poison on the blade an ornament for the hair in black with shining jewels one of which released the spring that freed the blade an exquisite deadly thing grafted in ygrath of course for that was central to her plan tonight anghiars head snapped back in shock his mouth twisted in an involuntary snarl as his eyes bulged wide in staring agony there was blood pumping from his throat soaking into the sheets and the pillows covering her he screamed a terrible sound he rolled off her off the bed onto the carpeted floor clutching desperately at his throat he screamed again there was so much blood pulsing from him he tried to stop it pressing his hands to the wound it didnt matter it wasnt the wound that would kill him she watched him heard the screaming stop followed by a wet bubbling sound anghiar of barbadior toppled slowly over on one side mouth still open blood leaking from his throat onto the carpet and then his blue eyes clouded and closed catriana looked down at her hands they were steady as stone and so was the beat of her heart in a moment that was all the moments in her life entrances and endings there was a furious pounding on the locked door frantic shouting a panicstricken volley of curses she was not yet done they could not be allowed to take her she knew what sorcery could do to the mind if they had her alive they had all of her friends they would know everything she was under no illusions had known there was a final step from the time she formed this plan they were battering against the door now it was large and heavy would hold a moment or two she rose up and put on the gown again she did not want to be naked now she couldnt have really said why bending over the bed she took the ygrathen weapon that glittering agency of death and careful of the treated blade laid it beside anghiar to be quickly found it was necessary that it be found there was a sharp splintering sound from the door more shouting a tumult of noise in the corridor she thought about setting fire to the room candle to blaze it appealed to her but no they had to find anghiars body and exactly what had killed him she opened the casement window and stepped up on the ledge the window was elegantly designed easily tall enough for her to stand upright before it she looked outward and down for a moment the room was over the garden far above it more than high enough the scent of the sejoia trees came drifting up and the heavy sweetness of tainflowers and there were other night flowers whose names she did not know both moons had risen now vidomni and ilarion watching her she looked at them for a moment but it was to morian she prayed for it was toward morian she was crossing through the last portal of all she thought of her mother of alessan of his dream that had become hers and for which she was now to die in a land not her own briefly she thought of her father knowing how much this all had to do with making redress with the way each generation seemed to put its mark upon the next one way or another let it be enough she prayed then aiming the thought like an arrow of the mind toward morian in her halls the door burst inward with a grinding crash half a dozen men stumbled into the room it was time catriana turned back from the stars and the two moons and the garden she looked down at the men from the windowledge there was a singing in her heart a crescendo of hope and pride death to barbadiors servants she screamed at the top of her voice freedom for senziol she cried and then long live king brandin of the palm one man quicker than the others reacted springing across the room he was not quite quick enough not as fast as she she had already turned the acid of those last necessary words eating in her brain she saw the moons again eannas stars the wide waiting darkness between them and beyond she leaped felt the night wind in her face and in her hair saw the dark ground of the garden begin to hurtle up toward her heard voices for an instant and then none at all only the loud rushing wind she was alone falling she had always been alone it seemed endings a candle memories a dream a prayer of flames that they might come then a last doorway an unexpectedly gentle darkness seemed to open wide before her in the air she closed her eyes just before she went through chapter a warm night the fragrance of flowers moonlight on the trees on the pale stones of the garden wall on the woman standing in the high window devin hears a sound to his left and quickly turns rovigo running up to stop rigid with shock as his gaze follows alessans upward behind him now comes sandre with alais help me the duke orders harshly dropping to the cobblestones beside devin his expression is wild distraught he has a knife in his hand what devin gasps uncomprehending what do you my fingers now cut them i need the power and sandre dastibar slaps the hilt of the knife hard into devins palm and curls his own left hand around a loose slab of stone in the street only his third and fourth fingers are extended the wizards fingers of binding to the palm sandre devin begins stammering no words cut me devin devin does as he is told wincing gritting his teeth against pain against grief he poises the sharp slim blade and brings it down on sandres exposed fingers cleaving through he hears someone cry out alais not the duke but in the moment the knife cuts clean through flesh to grind against stone there is a swift and dazzling flash sandres darkened face is illuminated by a corona of white light that flares like a star about his head and dies away leaving them blinded for a moment in the afterimage of its glow alais is on the dukes other side kneeling to quickly wrap a square of cloth about his bleeding hand sandre lifts that hand with an effort silent in the face of pain without a word spoken alais helps him her fingers supporting his arm from high above they hear a sharp distant crash the sound of men shouting silhouetted in the tall window catriana becomes suddenly taut she screams something they are too far away to make out the words too terribly far they see her turn though to the darkness to the night oh my dear no not this alessans voice is a ragged whisper scoured up from his heart too late far far too late on his knees in the dusty road devin sees her fall not wheeling or tumbling to death but graceful as she has always been a diver cleaving the night downward sandre thrusts forward his maimed wizards hand straining upward he speaks rapid words devin cannot understand there is a sudden weirdly distorting blur in the night a shimmer as of unnatural heat in the air sandres hand is aimed straight at the falling woman devins heart stops for a moment seizing at this wild impossible hope then it starts beating again heavy as age as death whatever sandre has tried it is not enough he is too far it is too hard a spell he is too new to this power any of these all none catriana falls unstayed unchecked beautiful as a moonlit fantasy of a woman who can fly down to a broken crumpled ending behind the garden wall alais bursts into desperate sobs sandre covers his eyes with his good hand his body rocking back and forth devin can hardly see for the tears in his eyes high above them in the window where she had stood the blurred forms of men appear looking downward into the darkness of the garden we have to move away rovigo croaks the words scarcely intelligible they will be searching it is true devin knows it is and if there is any gift anything at all they can offer back to catriana now to where she might be watching with morian it is that her dying should not have been meaningless or in vain devin forces himself up from his knees he helps sandre to rise then he turns to alessan who has not moved nor taken his eyes from the high window where there are still men standing and gesturing devin remembers the prince the afternoon his mother died this is the same this is worse he wipes at his eyes with the backs of his hands turns to rovigo we are too many to stay together you and sandre take alais be very careful they may recognize her she was with catriana when the governor saw them well go another way and meet you in our rooms then he takes alessan by the arm and turns him the prince does not resist follows his lead the two of them start south stumbling down a lane that will take them away from the castle from the garden where she lies he realizes he is still holding sandres bloodied dagger he jams it into his belt he thinks about the duke about what sandre has just done to himself he remembers his mind playing its familiar tricks with time and memory a night in the sandreni lodge last fall his own first night that has led him here when sandre told them he could not take tomasso out of the dungeon alive because he lacked the power because hed never sacrificed his fingers in the wizards binding and now he has for catriana not his son and to no good at all there is something that hurts so much in all of this tomasso is nine months dead and now she lies in a garden in senzio dead as any of the men of tigana who fell in war by the deisa years ago which was the whole point for her devin knows she had told him as much in alienors castle he begins to cry again unable to stop himself a moment later he feels alessans hand upon his shoulder hold hard for a little longer yet the prince says his first words since her fall you lead me and ill lead you and afterwards we will mourn together you and i he leaves the hand on devins shoulder they make their way through the dark lanes and the torchlit ones there is already an uproar in the streets of senzio as they go a careening breathless thread of rumor about some happening at the castle the governor is dead someone shouts feverishly sprinting wildly past them the barbadians have crossed the border a woman screams leaning out from a window above a tavern she has red hair devin sees and he looks away there are no guards in the streets yet they walk quickly and are not stopped by anyone thinking back upon that walk later devin realizes that never not for a single moment did he doubt that catriana had killed the barbadian before she jumped back at solinghis devin wanted nothing more than to go upstairs to his room and close his eyes and be away from people from all the invading tumult of the world but as they came through the door he and the prince a loud impatient cheer suddenly rose in the packed front room running swiftly toward the back as well they were well overdue for the first of the evenings performances and solinghis was jammed with people whod come to hear them play regardless of the increasing noises from outside devin and alessan exchanged a glance music there was no sign of erlein but the two of them slowly made their way through the crowd to the raised platform in the middle space between the two rooms alessan took up his pipes and devin stood beside him waiting the prince blew a handful of testing tuning notes and then without a word spoken began the song devin had known he would begin as the first high mournful notes of the lament for adaon spun out into the densely crowded rooms there was a brief disconcerted murmur and then silence fell into which stillness devin followed alessans pipes lifting his voice in lament but not for the god this time though the words were not changed not for adaon falling from his high place but for catriana di tigana fallen from hers men said after that there had never been such a stillness such rapt attention among the tables in solinghis even the servants waiting on patrons and the cooks in the kitchens behind the bar stopped what they had been doing and stood listening no one moved no one made a sound there were pipes playing and a solitary voice singing the oldest song of mourning in the palm in a room upstairs alais lifted her head from her tearsoaked pillow and slowly sat up rinaldo tending to sandres maimed hand turned his blind face toward the door and both men were still and baerd who had come back here with ducas to tidings that smashed his heart in a way he had not thought could ever happen to him again listened to alessan and devin below and he felt as if his soul were leaving him as it had on the ember night to fly through darkness searching for peace and a home for a dreamtof world in which young women did not die in this way out in the street where the sound of the pipes and that pure lamenting voice carried people stopped in their loud pursuit of rumor or the restless chasing of nights pleasures and they stood outside the doors of solinghis listening to the notes of grief the sound of love held fast in the spell of a music shaped by loss for a long time after it was remembered in senzio that haunting heartbreaking utterly unexpected offering of the lament on the mild moonlit night that marked the beginning of war they played only the one song and then ended there was nothing left in either of them devin claimed two open bottles of wine from solinghi behind the bar and followed alessan upstairs one bedroom door was partly open alaiss that had been catrianas too baerd was waiting in the doorway he made a small choking sound and stepped forward into the hallway and alessan embraced him for a long time they stood locked together swaying a little when they drew back both of their faces looked blurred unfocused devin followed them into the room alais was there and rovigo sandre rinaldo ducas and naddo sertino the wizard all of them crowded into this one room as if being in the room from which shed gone would somehow hold her spirit nearer to them did anyone think to bring wine rinaldo asked in a faint voice i did devin said going over to the healer rinaldo looked pale and exhausted devin glanced at sandres left hand and saw that the bleeding had been stopped he guided rinaldos hand to one of the wine bottles and the healer drank not bothering to ask for a glass devin gave the other bottle to ducas who did the same sertino was gazing at sandres hand youre going to have to get in the habit of masking those fingers he said he held up his own left hand and devin saw the nowfamiliar illusion of completeness i know sandre said i feel very weak right now though doesnt matter sertino replied two missing fingers seen will mean death for you however weary we are the masking must be constant do it now sandre looked up at him angrily but the certandan wizards round pink face showed nothing but concern the duke closed his eyes briefly grimaced and then slowly held up his own left hand devin saw five fingers there or the illusion of such he couldnt seem to stop thinking about tomasso dead in a dungeon in astibar ducas was offering him the bottle he took it and drank passed it over to naddo and went to sit beside alais on the bed she took his hand which had never happened before her eyes were red with weeping her skin looked bruised alessan had slumped on the floor by the door leaning against the wall his eyes were closed in the light of the candles his face looked hollowed out the cheekbones showing in angular relief ducas cleared his throat we had best do some planning he said awkwardly if she killed this barbadian there will be a search through the city tonight and triad knows what tomorrow sandre used magic as well alessan said not opening his eyes if theres a tracker in senzio hes in danger that we can deal with naddo said fiercely looking from ducas to sertino we did it once already remember and there were more than twenty men with that tracker you arent in the highlands of certando now rovigo said mildly doesnt matter ducas said naddos right if enough of us are down in the street and sertinos with us to point out the tracker then id be ashamed of my men if we couldnt contrive a brawl that killed him theres a risk baerd said ducas suddenly smiled like a wolf cold and hard without a trace of mirth id be grateful for a risk to take tonight he said devin understood exactly what he meant alessan opened his eyes and looked up from his place against the wall do it then he said devin can run any messages back here to us well move sandre out back to the ship if we have to if you send word that he stopped and then uncoiled in one lithe movement to his feet baerd had already seized his sword from where it was leaning against the wall devin stood up releasing alaiss hand there came another rattle of sound from the stairway outside the window then the window opened as a hand pulled the glass outward and erlein di senzio stepped carefully over the ledge and into the room with catriana in his arms in the stony silence he looked at them all for a moment taking in the scene then he turned to alessan if you are worried about magic he said in a paperthin voice then you had best be very worried i used a great deal of power just now if theres a tracker in senzio then anyone near me is extremely likely to be captured and killed he stopped then smiled very faintly but i caught her in time she is alive the world spun and rocked for devin he heard himself cry out with an inarticulate joy sandre literally leaped to his feet and rushed to claim catrianas unconscious body from erleins arms he hastened to the bed and laid her down he was crying again devin saw so unexpectedly was rovigo devin wheeled back to where erlein stood in time to see alessan cross the room in two swift strides and wrap the exhausted wizard in a bear hug that lifted erlein feebly protesting clean off the ground alessan released him and stepped back the grey eyes shining his face lit by a grin he couldnt seem to control erlein tried without success to preserve his own customary cynical expression then baerd came up and without warning seized the wizard by the shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks again the troubadour struggled to look fierce and displeased again he failed with an entirely unconvincing attempt at his usual scowl he said careful you devin flattened me to the ground when you all ran out the door im still bruised he threw a glare at devin who smiled happily back at him sertino handed erlein a bottle he drank a long thirsty pull he wiped at his mouth it wasnt hard to guess from the way you were running that something was seriously wrong i started to follow but i dont run very fast anymore so i decided to use magic i got to the far end of the garden wall just as alessan and devin reached the near side why alessan asked sharply wonder in his voice you never use your magic why now erlein shrugged elaborately id never seen all of you run anywhere like that before he grimaced i suppose i was carried away alessan was smiling again he couldnt seem to hold it in for very long every few seconds he glanced quickly over at the bed as if to reassure himself of who was lying there then what he asked then i saw her in the window and figured out what was happening so i i used my magic to get over the wall and i was waiting in the garden beneath the window he turned to sandre you sent an astonishing spell from so far but you didnt have a chance you couldnt know never having tried but you cant stop someone falling that way you have to be beneath them and they usually have to be unconscious that kind of magic works on our own bodies almost exclusively if we want to apply it to someone else their will has to be suspended or everything gets muddled when they see what is happening and their mind begins to fight it sandre was shaking his head i thought it was my weakness that i just wasnt strong enough even with the binding erleins expression was odd for a second he seemed about to respond to that but instead he resumed his tale i used a spell to make her lose consciousness partway down and a stronger one to catch her before she hit then a last to get us over the wall again by then i was completely spent and terrified they would trace us immediately if there was a tracker anywhere in the castle but they didnt there was too much chaos i think something else is happening back there we hid behind the main temple of eanna for a time and then i carried her here carried her through the streets alais asked no one noticed that erlein grinned at her not unkindly it isnt that unusual in senzio my dear alais flushed crimson but devin could see that she didnt really mind it was all right everything was suddenly all right we had better get down into the street then baerd said to ducas well have to get arkin and some of the others regardless of whether there are trackers this changes things when they dont find her body in the garden theres going to be an unbelievable search of the town tonight i think there will have to be some fighting ducas smiled again more like a wolf than ever i hope so was all he said one moment said alessan quietly i want you all to witness something he turned back to erlein and hesitated choosing his words we both know that you did this tonight without any coercion from me and against your own best interests in every way erlein glanced over at the bed two sudden spots of red forming on each of his sallow cheeks dont make too much of it he warned gruffly every man has his moments of folly i like redheaded women thats all thats how you trapped me in the first place remember alessan shook his head that may be true but it is not all erlein di senzio i bound you to this cause against your will but i think you have just joined it freely erlein swore feelingly dont be a fool alessan i just told you i i know what you just told me i make my own judgments though i always have and the truth is i have been made to realize tonight by you and catriana both that there are limits to what i wish to do or see done for any cause even my own as alessan finished speaking he stepped forward quickly and laid a hand on erleins brow the wizard flinched but alessan steadied him i am alessan prince of tigana he said clearly direct in descent from micaela in the name of adaon and his gift to her children i release you to your freedom wizard both men suddenly staggered apart as if a taut cord had been cut erleins face was bonewhite i tell you again he rasped you are a fool alessan shook his head you have called me worse than that with some cause but now i will name you something you will probably hate i will unmask you as a decent man with the same longing to be free as any of us here erlein you cannot hide anymore behind your moods and rancor you cannot channel into me your own hatred of the tyrants if you choose to leave us you can i do not expect you will be welcome freely to our company erlein looked cornered assailed his expression was so confused devin laughed aloud the whole situation was clear to him now and comical in a bizarre twisted way he stepped forward and gripped the wizard im glad he said im glad youre with us im not i havent said that erlein snapped i havent said or done any such thing of course you have it was sandre the evidence of exhaustion and pain still vivid in his lined dark face you did it tonight alessan is right he knows you better than any of us better in some ways than you know yourself troubadour how long have you tried to make yourself believe that nothing mattered to you but your own skin how many people have you convinced that that was true im one baerd and devin perhaps catriana not alessan erlein he just set you free to prove us all wrong there was a silence they could hear shouting from the streets below now and the sound of running footsteps erlein turned to alessan and the two men gazed at each other devin was suddenly claimed by an image another of his intrusions of memory that campfire in ferraut alessan playing songs of senzio for erlein an enraged shadow by the river there were so many layers here so many charges of meaning he saw erlein di senzio raise his hand his left hand with a simulation of five fingers there and offer it to alessan who met it with his right so their palms touched i suppose i am with you erlein said after all i know said alessan come said baerd a second later we have work to do devin followed him with ducas and sertino and naddo toward the back stairs beyond the window just before stepping through devin turned to look back at the bed erlein noticed and followed his gaze shes fine the wizard said softly shell be just fine do what you have to do and come back to us devin glanced up at him they exchanged an almost shy smile thank you devin said meaning a number of things then he followed baerd down into the tumult of the streets she was actually awake for a few moments before she opened her eyes she was lying somewhere soft and unexpectedly familiar and there were voices drifting towards and away from her as if on a swelling of the sea or like slowmoving fireflies in the summer nights at home at first she couldnt quite make the voices out she was afraid to open her eyes i think she is awake now someone was saying will you all do me a great courtesy and leave me alone with her for a few moments she knew that voice though she heard the sound of a number of people rising and leaving the room a door closed that voice was alessans which meant she could not be dead these were not morians halls after all with the voices of the dead surrounding her she opened her eyes he was sitting on a chair drawn close to where she lay she was in her own room in solinghis inn lying under a blanket in bed someone had removed the black silk gown and washed the blood from her skin anghiars blood that had fountained from his throat the rush of memory was dizzying quietly alessan said you are alive erlein was waiting in the garden below you he rendered you unconscious and then caught you with his magic as you fell and brought you back she let her eyes fall shut again as she struggled to deal with all of this with the fact of life the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed the beat of her heart this curiously lightheaded sensation as if she might drift away on the slightest of breezes but she wouldnt she was in solinghis and alessan was beside her he had asked all the others to leave she turned her head and looked at him again he was extremely pale we thought you had died he said we saw you fall from outside the garden wall what erlein did he did on his own none of us knew we thought you had died he repeated after a moment she thought about that then she said did i achieve anything is anything happening he pushed a hand through his hair it is too soon to tell for certain i think you did though there is a great deal of commotion in the streets if you listen you can hear it concentrating she could indeed make out the sounds of shouting and running feet passing beneath the window alessan seemed unnaturally subdued struggling with something it was very peaceful in the room though the bed was softer than she had remembered it being she waited looking at him noting the perennial unruliness of his hair where his hands were always pushing through it he said carefully catriana i cannot tell you how frightened i was tonight you must listen to me now and try to think this through because it is something that matters very much his expression was odd and there was something in his voice she couldnt quite pin down he reached out and laid his hand over hers where it lay upon the blanket catriana i do not measure your worth by your fathers none of us ever has you must stop doing this to yourself there was never anything for you to redeem you are what you are in and of yourself this was difficult ground for her the most difficult of all and she found that her heartbeat had quickened she watched him blue eyes on his grey ones his long slender fingers were covering her own she said we arrive with a past a history families matter he was a coward and he fled alessan shook his head there was still something strained in his expression we have to be so careful he murmured so very careful when we judge them and what they did in those days there are reasons why a man with a wife and an infant daughter might choose other than fear for himself to stay with the two of them and try to keep them alive oh my dear in all these years i have seen so many men and women who went away for their children she could feel her tears starting now and she fought to blink them back she hated talking about this it was the hard kernel of pain at the core of all she did but it was before the deisa she whispered he left before the battles even the one we won again he shook his head wincing at the sight of her distress he lifted her hand suddenly and carried it to his lips she could not remember his ever having done that before there was something completely strange about all of this parents and children he said so softly she almost missed the words it is so hard we are so quick to judge he hesitated i dont know if devin told you but my mother cursed me in the hour before she died she called me a traitor and a coward she blinked moved to sit up too suddenly she was dizzy and terribly weak devin hadnt told her any such thing he had said next to nothing about that day how could she she said anger rising in her against this woman she had never seen you a coward doesnt didnt she know anything about she knew almost all of it he said quietly she simply disagreed as to where my duty lay that is what i am trying to say catriana it is possible to differ on such matters and to reach a place as terrible as that one was for both of us i am learning so many things so late in this world where we find ourselves we need compassion more than anything i think or we are all alone she managed this time to push herself up higher in the bed she looked at him imagining that day those words of his mother she remembered what she herself had said to her father on her own last night at home words that had driven him violently out of the house into the dark he had still been out there somewhere alone when she had gone away she swallowed did it did it end like that with your mother was that how she died she never unsaid the words but she let me take her hand before the end i dont think ill ever know if that meant of course it did she said quickly of course it did alessan we all do that we do with our hands our eyes what we are afraid to say she surprised herself she hadnt known she knew any such thing he smiled then and looked down to where his fingers still covered hers she felt herself coloring he said there is a truth there i am doing that now catriana perhaps i am a coward after all he had sent the others from the room her heart was still beating very fast she looked at his eyes and then quickly away afraid that after what she had just said it would look like she was probing she felt like a child again confused certain that she was missing something here she had always always hated not understanding what was happening but at the same time there seemed to be this very odd extraordinary warmth growing inside her and a queer sensation of light brighter than the candles in the room should have allowed fighting to control her breathing needing an answer but absurdly afraid of what it might be she stammered i would you explain that to me please she watched him closely this time watched him smile saw what kindled in his eyes she even read his lips as they moved when i saw you fall he murmured his hand still holding hers i realized that i was falling with you my dear i finally understood too late what i had denied to myself for so long how absolutely i had debarred myself from something important even the acknowledging of its possibility while tigana was still gone the heart has its own laws though catriana and the truth is the truth is that you are the law of mine i knew it when i saw you in that window in the moment before you leaped i knew that i loved you bright star of eanna forgive me the manner of this but you are the harbor of my souls journeying bright star of eanna he had always called her that from the very beginning lightly easily a name among others a teasing for when she bridled a term of praise when she did something well the harbor of his soul she seemed to be crying silently tears welling up to slide slowly down her cheeks oh my dear no he said with an awkward catch to his voice i am so sorry i am a fool this is far too sudden tonight after what you have done not tonight i should never have spoken i dont even know if you he stopped just there but only because she had covered his mouth with her fingers to make him stop she was still crying but there seemed to be the most amazing brightness growing inside the room far more than candles now more than the moons a light like the sun beginning to rise beyond the rim of darkness she slipped her fingers down from his mouth and claimed the hand he had held her with we do with our hands what we cannot say she still said nothing she couldnt speak she was trembling she remembered how her hands had been shaking when she walked out earlier tonight so little time ago she had stood in a castle window and known she was about to die her tears fell on his hand she lowered her head but others kept falling she felt as though her heart were a bird a trialla only newly born spreading wings preparing to give voice to the song of its days he was on his knees beside the bed she moved her free hand across and ran it through his hair in a hopeless attempt at smoothing it it seemed to be something she had wanted to do for a long time how long how long could such needs be present and yet never known never acknowledged or allowed when i was young she said finally her voice breaking but needing to speak i used to dream of this alessan have i died and come back am i dreaming now he smiled slowly the deeply reassuring smile that she knew that they all knew as if her words had granted him release from his own fear freed him to be himself again to offer the look that had always meant that he was with them and so everything would be made all right but then unexpectedly he moved forward and lowered his head to rest it against the thin blanket covering her as if seeking his own shelter one that was hers to give to him she understood it seemed oh what goddess could have foretold this that she did have something to offer him something more than her death after all she lifted her hands and closed them around his head holding him to her and it seemed to catriana in that moment as if that newborn trialla in her soul began to sing of trials endured and trials to come of doubt and dark and all the deep uncertainties that defined the outer boundaries of mortal life but with love now present at the base of it all like light like the first stone of a rising tower there had been a barbadian tracker in senzio devin learned later that night and he was killed but not by them nor did they have to deal with the kind of search party theyd feared it was nearly dawn by the time they pieced the story together it seemed that the barbadians had gone wild finding the poisoned ygrathen knife on the floor by anghiars body hearing what the woman cried before she leaped they had leaped themselves to all the murderously obvious conclusions there were twenty of them in senzio an honor guard for anghiar they armed themselves assembled and made their way across to the western wing of the governors castle they killed the six ygrathens on guard there broke down a door and burst in upon cullion of ygrath brandins representative as he struggled into his clothing then they took their time about killing him the sound of his screams echoed through the castle then they went back downstairs and through the courtyard to the front gates and hacked to death the four senzian guards who had let the woman in without a proper search it was during this that the captain of the castle guard came into the courtyard with a company of senzians he ordered them to lay down their arms the barbadians were according to most reports later about to do so having achieved their immediate purposes when two of the senzians enraged at the butchery of their friends fired arrows at them two men fell one instantly dead one mortally wounded the dead one was albericos tracker there ensued a bloody tothedeath melee in the torchlit courtyard of the castle soon slippery with blood the barbadians were slaughtered to the last man taking some thirty or forty senzians with them no one knew which man fired the arrow that killed casalia the governor as he came hastily down the stairs screaming hoarsely at them all to stop in the chaos that followed that death no one gave a thought to going down to the garden for the body of the woman who had started it all there was an increasingly wild panic in the city as the news spread through the night a huge terrified crowd gathered outside the castle shortly after midnight two horses were seen racing away from the city walls heading south for the ferraut border not long after that the five remaining members of brandins party in senzio rode away as well in a tight cluster under the risen moons they went north of course toward farsaro where the fleet was anchored catriana was asleep in the other bed her face smooth and untroubled almost childlike in its peace alais could not find rest though there was too much noise and tumult in the streets and she knew her father was down there among whatever was happening even after rovigo came back in and stopped at their door to look in on the two of them and report that there seemed to be no immediate danger alais was still unable to sleep too much had happened tonight but none of it to her and so she was not weary as catriana was only excited and unsettled in oddly discontinuous ways she couldnt even have said all the things that were working upon her eventually she put on the robe shed bought two days before in the market and went to sit on the ledge of the open window it was very late by then both moons were west down over the sea she couldnt see the harbor solinghis was too far inland but she knew it was there with the sea maid bobbing at anchor in the night breeze there were people in the streets even now she could see shadowy forms pass in the lane below and she heard occasional shouts from the direction of the tavern quarter but nothing more now than the ordinary noises of a city without a curfew prone to be awake and loud at night she wondered how near to dawn it was how long she would have to stay awake if she wanted to see the sunrise she thought she might wait for it this was not a night for sleep or not for her alais amended glancing back at catriana she remembered the other time the two of them had shared a room her own room at home she was a long way from home she wondered what her mother had thought receiving rovigos letter of carefully phrased almostexplanation sent by courier across astibar from the port of ardin town as they sailed north to senzio she wondered but in another way she knew the trust shared between her parents was one of the sustaining defining elements of her own world she looked up at the sky the night was still dark the stars overhead even more bright now that the moons were setting it probably lacked several hours yet till dawn she heard a womans laughter below and realized with an odd sensation that that was the one sound shed not heard earlier that night amid the tumult in the streets in a curious quite unexpected way the womans breathless sound and then a mans murmur following close upon it served to reassure her in the midst of all else whatever might come certain things would still continue as they always had there was a footstep on the wood of the stairway outside alais leaned backward on the windowledge belatedly realizing she could probably be seen from below who is it she called though softly so as not to disturb catriana only me devin said coming up to stand on the landing outside the room she looked at him his clothing was muddy as if hed tumbled or rolled somewhere but his voice was calm it was too dark to properly see his eyes why are you awake he asked she gestured not sure what to say too many things at once i suppose im not used to this she saw his teeth as he smiled none of us are he said believe me but i dont think anything else will happen tonight we are all going to bed my father came in a while ago he said it seemed to have quieted down devin nodded for now the governor was slain in the castle catriana did kill the barbadian there was chaos up there and somebody seems to have shot the tracker i think that was what saved us alais swallowed my father didnt tell me about that he probably didnt want to disturb your night ill be sorry now if i have he glanced past her toward the other bed how is she shes all right really asleep she registered the quick concern in his voice but catriana had earned that concern that caring tonight and before tonight in ways alais could scarcely even encompass within her mind and how are you devin asked in a different tone turning back to her and there was something in that altered deeper voice that made it difficult for her to breathe im fine too honestly i know you are he said actually you are a great deal more than that alais he hesitated for a moment seeming suddenly awkward she didnt understand that until he leaned slowly forward to kiss her full upon the lips for the second time if you counted the one in the crowded room downstairs but this was really quite amazingly unlike the first for one thing he didnt hurry and for another they were alone and it was very dark she felt one of his hands come up brushing along the front of her robe before coming to rest in her hair he drew back unsteadily alais opened her eyes he looked blurred and softened where he stood on the landing footsteps went past in the lane below slowly now not running as before the two of them were silent looking at each other devin cleared his throat he said it is there are still two or three hours to morning you should try to sleep alais there will be a a great deal happening in the days to come she smiled he hesitated another moment then turned to walk along the outer landing toward the room he shared with alessan and erlein she remained sitting where she was for some time longer looking up at the brightness of the stars letting her racing heart gradually slow she replayed in her mind the ragged very young uncertainty and wonder in his voice in those last words alais smiled again to herself in the darkness to someone schooled by a life of observation that voice had revealed a great deal and it had been simply touching her that had done this to him which was if one lingered to think about it and relive the moment of that kiss a most astonishing thing she was still smiling when she left the windowledge and returned to her bed and she did fall asleep then after all for the last few greatly altered hours of that long night all through the next day everyone waited a pall of doom like smoke hung over senzio the city treasurer attempted to assert control in the castle but the leader of the guard was disinclined to take orders from him their shouted confrontations went on all day by the time someone thought to go down for the girl her body had already been taken away no one knew where or by whose orders the work of the city ground to a halt men and women roamed the streets feeding on rumor choking on fear on almost every corner a different story was heard it was said that rinaldo the last dukes brother had come back to the city to take command in the castle by the middle of the day everyone had heard some version of the tale but no one had seen the man a restless nervous darkness fell the streets remained crowded all night long it seemed that no one in senzio could sleep the night was bright and very beautiful both moons riding through a clear sky outside solinghis inn a crowd gathered there was no room at all inside to hear the three musicians play and sing of freedom and of the glory of senzios past songs not sung since casalia had relinquished his claim to his fathers ducal throne and allowed himself to be called governor instead with emissaries from the tyrants to advise him casalia was dead both emissaries were dead music drifted out from solinghis into the scented summer night spilling along the lanes rising toward the stars just after dawn word came alberico of barbadior had crossed the border the afternoon before and was advancing north with his three armies burning villages and fields as he went before noon they heard from the north as well brandins fleet had lifted anchor in farsaro bay and was sailing south with a favorable wind war had come all through senzio town people left their homes left the taverns and the streets and began thronging belatedly to the temples of the triad in the almost deserted front room of solinghis that afternoon one man continued to play the tregean pipes faster and faster and higher and higher in a wild almost forgotten tune chapter the sea was at their back at the end of a long goatherds track that wound down the slope to the sands just south of where theyd beached the ships and come ashore about two miles north of them the walls of senzio rose up and from this height dianora could see the gleaming of the temple domes and the ramparts of the castle the sun rising over the pine forests to the east was bronze in a close deep blue sky it was warm already this early in the day it would be very hot by midmorning by which time the fighting would have begun brandin was conferring with deymon and rhamanus and his captains three of them newly appointed from the provinces from corte and asoli and chiara itself not from lower corte of course though there were a number of men from her province in the army below them in the valley she had wondered briefly lying awake one night in the flagship off farsaro if baerd was one of them she knew he wouldnt be though just as brandin could not change in this neither could her brother it went on however much might alter this single thing would go on until the last generation that knew tigana died and she since the dive since rising from the sea she had been trying hard not to think at all simply to move with the events she had set in motion to accept the shining fact of brandins love for her and the terrible uncertainties of this war she no longer saw the riselkas path in her minds eye she had some sense of what that meant but she made an effort not to dwell upon it during the day nights were different dreams were always different she was owner and captive both of a bitterly divided heart with her two guards just behind her she moved forward on the crown of the hill and looked out over the wide eastwest running valley the dense green pine woods were beyond with olive trees growing on steeper ridges to the south and a plateau north leading to senzio town down below the two armies were just stirring men emerging from their tents and sleepingrolls horses being saddled and harnessed swords cleaned bowstrings fitted and readied metal glinted in the young sun all along the valley the sound of voices carried easily up to her in the clear bright air there was just enough breeze to take the banners and lift them to be seen their own device was new a golden image of the palm itself picked out against a background of deep blue for the sea the meaning of brandins chosen image was as clear as he could make it they were fighting in the name of the western palm but the truer claim was to everything to a united peninsula with barbadior driven away it was a good symbol dianora knew it was also the proper the necessary step for this peninsula but it was being taken by the man who had been king of ygrath there were even senzians in brandins army besides the men of the four western provinces several hundred had joined them from the city in the two days since theyd landed in the southern part of the bay with the governor dead and a squabble for meaningless power going on in the castle the official policy of senzian neutrality was in tatters helped no one doubted by albericos decision to torch the lands through which he had come in retaliation for barbadian deaths in the city had the barbadians moved faster rhamanus might have had trouble landing the fleet in the face of opposition but the winds had been with them and they reached the city a full day before alberico which let brandin choose the obvious hill from which to overlook the valley and to align his men where he wanted them it was an advantage they all knew it it had seemed less of one the next morning when the three armies of barbadior arrived emerging out of the smoke of burning to the south they had two banners not one the empires red mountain and golden tiara against their white background and albericos own crimson boar on a yellow field the red in both banners seemed to dot the plain like stains of blood while horsemen and footsoldiers arrayed themselves in crisp precisely drilled ranks along the eastern side of the valley the soldiers of the barbadian empire had conquered most of the known world to the east dianora had stood on the hill watching them come it seemed to take forever she went away into their tent and then came back several times the sun began to set it was over behind her in the west above the sea before albericos mercenaries had all marched or ridden into the valley three to one perhaps a little better than that brandin had said coming up beside her his short greying hair was uncovered ruffled by the late afternoon breeze are they too many she had asked quietly so no one else would hear he looked at her quickly then took her hand he often did that now as if unable to bear not having touched her for any length of time their lovemaking since the dive had taken on an urgency that would leave them both shattered and drained afterwards scarcely able to form thoughts of any kind which was at the center of things for her dianora knew she wanted to numb her mind to still the voices and the memories obliterate the image of that clear straight path disappearing in the darkness of the sea on the hill the day the barbadians came brandin laced his fingers through her own and said they may be too many it is hard to judge i am stronger in my power than alberico in his i think that on this hill i am worth the difference in the armies quietly spoken a careful statement of relevant facts no arrogance only the steady always enduring pride and why should she doubt his sorcery she knew exactly what it had done in war some twenty years ago that conversation had been yesterday afterwards she had turned to watch the sun go down into the sea the night had been bright and glorious with vidomni waxing and ilarion at her full blue and mysterious a moon of fantasy of magic she had wondered if they would have time to be alone that night but in fact brandin had been down on the plain among the tents of his army through most of the dark hours and speaking with his captains after that deymon she knew was going to remain up here with him tomorrow and rhamanus more a sailor than a military commander would be on the hill as well to lead the men of the kings guard in defense if matters came to that if matters came to that they were probably dead she knew both moons had set by the time brandin came back to their tent on that hill above the sea awake in bed waiting she could see his weariness he had maps with him sketches of terrain to study one last time but she made him put them down he came over to the bed still fully clothed and lay down after a moment he rested his head in her lap neither of them spoke for a long time then brandin shifted a little and looked up at her i hate that man down there he said quietly i hate everything he stands for there is no passion in him no love no pride only ambition nothing matters but that nothing in the world can move him to pity or grief but his own fate everything is a tool an instrument he wants the emperors tiara everyone knows it but he doesnt want it for anything he only wants i doubt anything in his life has ever moved him to feel anything for anyone else love loss anything he subsided he was repeating himself in his exhaustion she pressed her fingers against his temples looking down at his face as he turned again and his eyes closed and his brow gradually grew smooth under her touch eventually his breathing steadied and she knew he was asleep she stayed awake her hands moving like a blind womans over him knowing from the light outside that the moons were down knowing the morning was war and that she loved this man more than the world she must have slept because the sky was grey with the coming of dawn when she opened her eyes again and brandin was gone there was a red anemone on the pillow beside her she looked at it without moving for a moment then picked it up and crushed it to her face inhaling the fragile scent she wondered if he knew the legend of that flower here almost certainly not she thought she rose and a few moments later scelto came in with a mug of khav in his hand he was wearing the stiff leather vest of a messenger lightweight inadequate armor against arrows he had volunteered to be one of the score of such men running orders and messages up and down the hill he had come to her first though as he had every morning in the saishan for a dozen years dianora was afraid that thinking about that would make her cry a brutal omen on such a day she managed a smile and told him to go back to the king who needed him more this morning after he left she slowly drank her khav listening to the growing noises outside then she washed and dressed herself and went out of the tent into the rising sun two men of the kings guard were waiting for her they went wherever she did a discreet step or two behind but not more than that she would be guarded today she knew she looked for brandin and saw rhun first they were both near the front of the flattened ridge both bareheaded without armor though with identical swords belted at their sides brandin had chosen to dress today in the simple brown of an ordinary soldier she was not fooled none of them were or could be not long after that they saw him step alone toward the edge of his hill and raise one hand above his head for all the men in both armies to see without a word spoken any warning at all a dazzling bloodcrimson flare of light sprang from that upthrust hand like a flame into the deep blue of the sky from below they heard a roar of sound as crying their kings name aloud brandins outnumbered army moved forward across the valley to meet the soldiers of alberico in a battle that had been coming for almost twenty years not yet alessan said steadily for the fifth time at least we have waited years we must not be too soon now devin had a sense that the prince was cautioning himself more than anyone else the truth was that until alessan gave the word there was nothing for them to do but watch as men from barbadior and ygrath and the provinces of the palm killed each other under the blazing senzian sun it was noon or a little past it by the sun it was brutally hot devin tried to grasp how the men below must feel hacking and battering each other slipping on blood treading the fallen in the broiling caldron of battle they were too high and far away to recognize anyone but not so distant that they couldnt see men die or hear their screams their vantage point had been chosen by alessan a week before with a sure prediction of where the two sorcerers would base themselves and both had done exactly as he judged they would from this sloping ridge less than half a mile south of the higher broader rise of land where brandin was devin gazed down over the valley and saw two armies knotted together in a pitiless sending of souls to morian the ygrathen chose his field well sandre had said with an almost detached admiration earlier that morning as the cries of horses and men began the plain is wide enough to allow him room to maneuver but not so broad as to let the barbadians flank around him without serious trouble in the hills they would have to climb out of the valley and then along the exposed slopes and back down again and if you look you will see ducas di tregea had added that brandin has most of his archers on his own right flank toward the south in case they do try that they could pick the barbadians off like deer among the olives on the slopes if they attempt to go around one contingent of barbadians had in fact tried just that an hour ago they had been slaughtered and driven back by a rain of arrows from the archers of the western palm devin had felt a quick surge of excitement but then that congealed within him into turmoil and confusion the barbadians were tyranny yes and all that it meant yet how could he possibly exult in any kind of triumph for brandin of ygrath but should he then desire the death of men of the palm at the hands of albericos mercenaries he didnt know what to think or feel he felt as though his soul was being stripped raw and exposed here laid out for burning under the senzian sky catriana was standing just ahead of him next to the prince devin didnt think hed seen them apart from each other since erlein had brought her back from the garden hed spent a disoriented difficult hour the morning after that struggling to adjust to the shining thing that had so clearly overtaken them alessan had looked as he did when he made music as if hed found a hearthstone in the world when devin had glanced over at alais it was to find her watching him with a curious very private smile on her face it left him even more confused than before he had a sense that he wasnt even keeping up with himself let alone with the changes around him he also knew that there wasnt going to be any time to deal with such things not with what was coming to senzio in the next two days the armies had arrived from north and south bringing with them a bonedeep awareness of destiny hanging before them all as if suspended on some balance scale of gods in the summer air on their ridge above the battle devin looked back and saw alais offering water to rinaldo in the partial shade of a twisted olive tree that clung to the slope of their ridge the healer had insisted on coming with them instead of remaining hidden with solinghi in town if lives are at risk then my place is there as well was all hed said and hed carried his eagleheaded staff up here with all of them before sunrise devin glanced beyond them to where rovigo stood with baerd he should probably be with those two he knew his own responsibility here was the same as theirs to guard this hill if either sorcerer or both should send troops after them they had sixty men ducass band rovigos brave handful of mariners and those carefully chosen men who had made their solitary way north to senzio in response to the messages scattered across the provinces sixty men it would have to be enough sandre ducas alessan said sharply snapping devin out of reverie look now and tell me i was about to sandre said with an emerging note of excitement in his voice it is as we guessed with his own presence on the hill brandin is not outnumbered after all his power is too much stronger than albericos more so than i guessed even if you are asking my reading right now i would say that the ygrathen is on the edge of breaking through in the center before the hour is out sooner than that ducas said in his deep voice when such things begin they happen very fast devin moved forward to see more clearly the seething center of the valley was as choked with men and horses as before many of them dead and fallen but if he used the banners as his frame of reference it seemed even to his untutored eye that brandins men were pushing their front lines forward now though the barbadians were still more numerous by far how he muttered almost to himself he weakens them with his sorcery a voice to his right said he looked over at erlein the same way they conquered us years ago i can feel alberico trying to defend them but i think sandre has it right the barbadian is weakening as we speak baerd and rovigo came quickly up from where they too had been looking down alessan baerd said only the name no more the prince turned and looked at him i know he said we were just thinking the same thing i think it is time i think it has come he held baerds gaze for another moment neither of them spoke then alessan looked away past the friend of his life to the three wizards erlein he said softly you know what must be done i do said the senzian he hesitated pray for the triads blessing upon the three of us upon all of us whatever youre going to do you had better hurry ducas said bluntly the barbadian center is starting to give we are in your hands alessan said to erlein he seemed about to say something more but did not erlein turned to sandre and sertino who had moved nearer to him all of the others stepped back a little to leave the three of them alone link said erlein di senzio on the plain at the back of his army but near to them and in their midst because distance mattered in magic alberico of barbadior had spent the morning wondering if the gods of the empire had abandoned him at last even the darkhorned god of sorcerers and the nightriding queen on her mare his thoughts such thoughts as he could manage to coherently form under the ceaseless mindpounding onslaught of the ygrathen were black with awareness of ruin it seemed to him as if there were ashes in his heart choking his throat it had seemed so simple once all that would be needed were planning and patience and discipline and if he had any qualities any virtues at all they were those twenty years worth of each of them here in the service of his long ambition but now as the merciless bronze sun reached its zenith and slipped past and began its descent toward the sea alberico knew with finality that he had been right at the first and wrong at the last winning the whole of the palm had never mattered but losing it meant losing everything including his life for there was nowhere to run or hide the ygrathen was brutally stupefyingly strong he had known it he had always known it had feared the man not as a coward does but as one who has taken the measure of something and knows exactly what it is at dawn after that crimson beacon had flamed from brandins hand on his hill in the west alberico had allowed himself to hope even briefly to exult he had only to defend his men his armies were almost three times as strong and they were facing only a small number of the trained soldiers of ygrath the rest of the army of the western palm was a flungtogether melange of artisans and traders fishermen and farmers and scarcely bearded boys from the provinces he had only to blunt the thrust of brandins sorcery from the hill and let his soldiers do their work he had no need to push his own powers outward against his foe only to resist only defend if only he could for as the morning wore on and gathered heat to itself like a smothering cloak alberico felt his mindwall begin by grudging agonizing degrees to flatten and bend under the passionate steady numbing insistence of brandins attack endlessly the ygrathens waves of fatigue and weakness flowed down from his hill upon the barbadian army wave after wave after wave tireless as the surf and alberico had to block them to absorb and screen those waves so his soldiers could fight on unafraid unsapped in their courage and strength save by the sweltering heat of the sun which was blazing down upon the enemy too well before noon some of the ygrathens spell began to leak through alberico couldnt hold it all it just kept coming and coming monotonous as rain or surf without alteration in rhythm or degree simple power hugely pouring forth soon far too soon too early in the day the barbadians began to feel as if they were fighting uphill even on a level plain as if the sun actually was fiercer above their heads than on the men they fought as if their confidence and courage were seeping away with the sweat that poured from them soaking through their clothing and armor only the sheer weight of numbers kept them level kept that senzian plain in balance all morning long his eyes closed sitting in the great canopied chair they had brought for him alberico mopped at his face and hair continuously with watersoaked cloths and he fought brandin of ygrath through that morning with all his power and all the courage to which he could lay claim but shortly after noon cursing himself cursing the maggoteaten soul of scalvaia dastibar who had so nearly killed him nine months ago and who had weakened him enough after all to be killing him now cursing his emperor for living too long as a useless senescent emaciated shell alberico of barbadior confronted the bleak pitiless reality that all his gods were indeed leaving him here under the burning sun of this faroff land as the messages began streaming back from the crumbling front ranks of his army he began preparing himself in the way of his people for death then the miracle happened at first his mind too punishingly battered he couldnt even grasp what was taking place only that the colossal weight of magic pouring down from the hill was suddenly inexplicably lightening it was a fraction a half of what it had been only a moment before alberico could sustain it easily that level of magic was less than his own even weakened as he was now he could even push forward against that instead of only defending he could attack if that was all that brandin had left if the ygrathen had suddenly reached the end of his reserves wildly mindscanning the valley and the hills around for a clue alberico suddenly came upon the third matrix of magic and abruptly realized with a glory flowering out of the mornings ashes in his heart that the horned god was with him yet after all and the night queen in her riding there were wizards of the palm here and they were helping him they hated the ygrathen as much as he somehow for whatever incomprehensible reason they were on his side against the man who was king of ygrath whatever he might pretend to call himself now i am winning he shouted to his messengers tell the captains at the front revive their spirits tell them i am beating the ygrathen back he heard sudden glad cries around him opened his eyes to see messengers sprinting forward across the valley he reached out toward those wizards four or five he judged by their strength perhaps six of them seeking to merge with their minds and their power but in that he was balked he knew exactly where they were he could even see where they were a ridge of land just south of the ygrathens hill but they would not let him join with them or know who they were they must still be afraid of what he did to wizards when he found them what he did to wizards he would glory in them he would give them land and wealth and power honor here and in barbadior riches beyond their starved pinched dreams they would see no matter that they did not open to him it truly mattered not so long as they stayed and lent their powers to his defense there was no need to merge together they were a match for brandin and all they had to do was be a match alberico knew he still had more than twice the army in the field that the other had but even as hope was pouring back into his soul with these thoughts he felt the weight beginning to return unbelievably the ygrathens power growing again frantically he checked the wizards on their ridge were still with him yet brandin was still pushing forward he was so strong so accursedly unimaginably strong even against all of them he was exerting his might tapping deeper into his wellspring of sorcery how deep could he go how much more did he have alberico realized the knowledge like ice amid the inferno of war the savage heat of the day that he had no idea none at all which left him only the one course the only one hed ever had from the moment the battle had begun he closed his eyes again the better to focus and concentrate and he set himself with all the power in him to resist again to resist to hold to keep the wall intact by the seven sisters of the god rhamanus swore passionately they are regaining the ground they lost something has happened brandin rasped in the same moment they had erected a canopy above him for shade and had brought a chair for him to sit upon he was standing though one hand on the back of the chair for support at times the better to look down on the course of battle below dianora was standing close to him in case he needed her for water or comfort for anything at all that she could give but she was trying not to look down she didnt want to see any more men die about the screaming in the valley she could do nothing though and every cry below seemed to fly upward and sheath itself in her like a knife made of sound and human agony had it been like this by the deisa when her father died had he screamed so with his own mortal wound seeing his lifes blood leave him not to be held back staining the river red had he died in this kind of pain under the vengeful blades of brandins men it was her own fault this sickness rising she should not be here she should have known what images war would unleash in her she felt physically ill from the heat the sounds she could actually smell the carnage below something has happened brandin said again and with his voice a clarity came back into the maelstrom of the world she was here and he was the reason why and if the others could not dianora who knew him so well could hear a new note in his voice a marginal clue to the strain he was enduring she walked quickly away and then back a beaker of water in her hand and a cloth to wet his brow he took the water seeming almost oblivious to her presence to the touch of the cloth he closed his eyes and then slowly turned his head from side to side as if blindly seeking something then he opened his eyes again and pointed over there rhamanus dianora followed his gaze on a ridge of land south of them across the uneven tummocky ground a number of figures could be discerned there are wizards there brandin said flatly rhamanus youll have to take the guard after them they are working with alberico against me i dont know why one of them looks like a khardhu but he isnt i would recognize khardhun magic there is something extremely odd about this his eyes were a dark clouded grey can you match them my lord it was deymon his tone deliberately neutral masking any hint of concern i am about to try brandin said but i am getting near to the limit of the power i can safely tap and i cant turn my magic on them alone they are working with alberico rhamanus youll have to get those wizards for me yourself take everyone here rhamanuss ruddy face was grim i will stop them or die my lord i swear it dianora watched him step out from under the canopy and summon the men of the kings guard in pairs they fell into step behind him and started quickly down the goattrack leading west and south rhun took a couple of steps after them and then stopped looking confused and uncertain she felt a touch and turned from the fool as brandin took her hand trust me love he murmured and trust rhamanus after a second he added with what was almost a smile he brought you to me then he let her go and turned his attention back to the plain below and now he did sit down in the chair watching she could literally see him gather himself to renew his assault she looked over at deymon then followed the chancellors narrowed speculative gaze south again across to the cluster of people on that slope half a mile away they were near enough that she could see the darkskinned figure brandin said wasnt really a khardhu she thought she could make out a redhaired woman as well she had no idea who they were but suddenly for the first time looking around at their own thinnedout numbers on the hill she felt afraid here they come baerd said looking north a hand up to screen his eyes they had been waiting for this and watching for it from the moment the wizards linked but anticipation was not reality and at the sight of the picked men of brandins guard moving swiftly down their hill and beginning to cross the ground between devins heart began thumping hard there had been war all morning in the valley below now it was coming to them how many rovigo asked and devin was grateful to hear the tension in the merchants voice it meant he was not alone in what he was feeling now fortynine if he sent them all and alessan thought he would baerd replied not turning around that is always the number of the kings guard in ygrath it is sacred for them rovigo said nothing devin glanced to his right and saw the three wizards standing closely together erlein and sertino had their eyes closed but sandre was staring fixedly downwards to where alberico of barbadior was at the back of his army alessan had been with the wizards but now he came quickly over to join the thirty or so men spread out behind baerd on the ridge ducas he asked quietly i cant see any of them baerd said with a quick glance at the prince the last of the ygrathen guard had now descended their hill the vanguard were already moving rapidly over the uneven ground between i still dont believe it let me take my men to meet them below ducas had urged alessan the moment the wizards had linked we know he will be coming after us of course we do alessan had said but we are poorly armed and trained we need the advantage of height up here speak for yourself ducas di tregea had growled there isnt any cover down there where could you hide you are telling me whether there is cover ducas replied feigning anger his mouth widened in his wolfish grin alessan go teach your fingers to know your fingernails i was fighting running battles and ambushes in this kind of terrain while you were still numbering oak trees or some such thing in quileia leave this to me alessan had not laughed after a moment though he nodded his head not waiting for more redbearded ducas and his twentyfive men had immediately melted away down the slopes of their ridge by the time the ygrathens sent the guard the outlaws were down below hidden among the gorse and heather the high grass and the scattered olive and fig trees in the ground between the hills squinting devin thought he could see one of them but he wasnt sure in marians name erlein di senzio suddenly cried from the east end of the ridge he is pushing us back again then hold sandre snarled fight him go deeper i havent got any deeper to go sertino gasped baerd leaped from his crouch staring at the three of them he hesitated visibly wracked by doubt for a moment then he strode swiftly over to the wizards sandre erlein can you hear me yes of course sandres darkened face was streaming with perspiration he was still staring east but his gaze was unfocused now inward then do it do what we talked about if hes pushing all of you back we have to try or there is no point to any of this baerd they could be erleins words came out one by one as if forced from his lips no hes right sertino gasped cutting in have to try the mans too strong ill follow you two know where to reach do it stay with me then erlein said in a voice leeched of all strength stay with me both of you there were sudden shouts and then screaming below them not from the battlefield from the ground to the north all of them but the wizards wheeled around to see ducas had sprung his trap firing from ambush his outlaws unleashed a score of arrows at the ygrathens and then swiftly let fly as many more half a dozen eight ten of their attackers fell but the kings guard of ygrath were armored against arrows even in the blazing heat and most of them pushed on reacting with frightening agility despite the weight they carried moving toward ducass spreadout men devin saw three of the downed men get up again one pulled an arrow from his own arm and stumbled resolutely on pressing toward their ridge some of them will have bows we have to cover the wizards alessan snapped any man with any kind of shield over here half a dozen of the men remaining on the hill rushed over five had makeshift shields of wood or leather the sixth a man of some fifty years limped behind them on a twisted foot carrying nothing but an ancient battered sword my lord prince he said my body is shield enough for them your father would not let me go north to the deisa do not deny me now not again i can stand between them and any arrows in tiganas name devin saw the suddenly blank frightened look on many of the faces near them a name had been spoken that they could not hear ricaso alessan began looking around ricaso you need not you shouldnt have even come here there were other ways to the prince stopped for a moment it looked as if he would refuse the man as his father had but he said nothing more only nodded his head once and strode away the lame man and the other five immediately placed themselves in a protective circle around the wizards spread out alessan ordered the others cover the north and the west sides of the ridge catriana alais keep your eyes on the south in case some of them make it around behind us shout if you see anything move sword in hand devin raced for the northwest edge of their hill there were men fanning out all around him he looked over as he ran and caught his breath in dismay ducass men were in pitched battle on the uneven ground with the ygrathens and though they were holding their own taking a man it seemed for every one of them that fell that meant that they were falling the ygrathens were quick and superbly trained and ferociously determined devin saw their leader a big man no longer young hurl himself against one of the outlaws and hammer the man flat to the ground with a blow of his shield naddo look out a scream not a shout baerds voice wheeling devin saw why halfway to the other hill naddo had just beaten back an ygrathen and was continuing a fighting withdrawal toward a clump of bushes where arkin and two others were what he didnt see was the man who had flanked wide to the east and was now rushing toward him from behind what the running ygrathen didnt see was the arrow that hit him fired from the summit of the ridge by baerd di tigana with all the strength of his arm and the skill of a lifelong discipline far away unbelievably far the ygrathen grunted and fell an arrow in his thigh naddo whirled at the sound saw the man and dispatched him with a quick sword he looked up at the ridge saw baerd and quickly waved his thanks he was still waving hand aloft in salute to the friend he had left as a boy when an ygrathen arrow took him in the chest no devin cried out a fist of grief clenching about his throat he looked toward baerd whose eyes had gone wide with shock just as devin took a step towards him he heard a quick scrabbling sound and a grunt and behind him alais screamed look out he turned back just in time to see the first of half a dozen ygrathens surging up the slope he had no idea how theyd got here so fast he howled a second warning for the others and rushed forward to engage the first man before he gained the summit of the ridge he didnt make it the ygrathen was up and balanced with a shield in his left hand charging at him trying to drive the man backward down the slope devin swung his sword as hard as he could it clanged on the metal shield sending shock waves all along his arm the ygrathen thrust straight ahead with his own blade devin saw it coming and twisted desperately to one side he felt a sudden tearing pain as the sword ripped him above the waist he let himself drop ignoring the wound and as he fell forward he chopped viciously for the unprotected back of the ygrathens knee he felt his sword bite deep into flesh the man cried out and pitched helplessly forward trying even as he tumbled to bring his own blade down on devin again devin rolled frantically away dizzy with pain he clawed to his feet clutching his ripped side in time to see the prone ygrathen killed by alais bren rovigo with a clean sword thrust in the back of his neck it seemed to devin that he knew a moment of almost hallucinatory stillness then in the midst of carnage he looked at alais at her clear mild blue eyes he tried to speak his throat was dry their gazes locked for a second it was hard for devin to absorb to understand this image of her with a reddened sword in her hand he looked past her and instantly the stillness was gone shattered fifteen perhaps twenty of the ygrathens were up on the summit more were coming and some of them did have bows he saw an arrow fly to be embedded in one of the shields around the wizards there was a sound of quick footsteps ascending the slope to his left no time to speak even if he could have they were here to die if they had to it had always been possible there was a reason why they had come there was a dream a prayer a tune his father had taught him as a child he held his left hand tightly to his wound and turned from alais stumbling forward gripping his sword to meet the next man scrambling up the ridge a mild day the sun in and out of the clouds pushed swiftly along by the breeze in the morning they had walked in the meadows north of the castle gathering flowers armfuls of them irises anemones bluebells the sejoia trees were just coming into flower now this far south they left the white blossoms for later in the season they were back in castle borso drinking mahgoti tea just past midday when elena abruptly made a small frightened sound she stood up rigidly straight her hands clutching at her head her tea spilled unregarded staining the quileian carpet alienor quickly laid her own cup down it has come she said the summons elena what can i do elena shook her head she could scarcely hear the other womans words there was a clearer harder more compelling voice in her head something that had never happened before not even on the ember nights but baerd had been right her stranger who had come to them out of darkness and changed the shape of the ember wars he had returned to the village late in the day that followed after his friends had come down from the pass and ridden west he had spoken to donar and mattio and to carenna and elena and said that what the night walkers shared had to be a kind of magic if not the same as wizardry their bodies changed in the ember nights they walked under a green moon through lands that were not there by the light of day they wielded swords of growing corn that altered under their hands they were wedded in their own fashion he had said to the magic of the palm and donar had agreed that this was so so baerd had told them carefully what his purpose was and that of his friends and hed asked elena to come to castle borso until summers end in case hed said in case it was possible for their power to be tapped in this cause would they do this there would be danger he had asked it diffidently but there had been no hesitation in elena as she looked into his eyes and answered that she would nor in the others when they agreed he had come to them in their own need they owed him at least this much and more and they too were living through tyranny in their own land his cause in the daylight was their own elena di certando are you there are you in the castle she didnt know this mindvoice but within its clarity she could sense a desperation there seemed to be chaos all around him yes yes i am im here what what must i do i dont believe it a second voice joined them deeper as imperative erlein you have reached her is baerd there she asked a little desperately herself the sudden link was dizzying and the sense of tumult all around she swayed almost fell she reached out and put both her hands on the high back of a chair the room in castle borso was beginning to fade for her had alienor spoken now she would not have even heard he is the first man said quickly he is here with us and we have terrible need of help we are at wart can you link to your friends to the others we will help you please reach for them she had never tried such a thing not by daylight nor even under the green moon of the ember nights she had never known anything like this wizards link but she felt their power resting in her and she knew where mattio would be and donar and carenna would be at home with her newest child she closed her eyes and reached out for the three of them straining to focus her mind on the forge the mill carennas house in the village to focus and then to call to summon elena what mattio she had him join me she sent quickly the wizards are here there is war he asked no more questions she could feel his steadying presence in her mind as the wizards helped her open to him she registered his own sudden disoriented shock at the link to the other men two of them no three there was a third one there as well elena has it come have they sent donar in her mind seizing at truth like a weapon to his hand i am here love carennas mindvoice quick and bright exactly the same as her speech elena what must we do hold to each other and open to us the deep presence of the second wizard was there to answer we may now have a chance there is danger i will not lie but if we hold together for once in this peninsulawe may yet break through come join us we must forge our minds into a shield i am sandre dastibar and i never died come to us now elena opened her mind to him and reached out and in that moment she felt as though her own body was entirely gone as if she were no more than a conduit like and yet very unlike what happened on the ember nights a clammy fear of this unknown thing rose in her defiantly she fought it back her friends were with her and unbelievably the duke of astibar was there and alive and baerd was with him in faroff senzio battling against the tyrants he had come to them to her in their own war she had heard him weep and had lain with him in love on a hill in the ember dark after the green moon had set she would not fail him now she would lead the carlozzini to him along the pathway of her mind and her soul without warning they broke through the link was forged she was in a high place under a fiercely blazing sun seeing with the eyes of the duke of astibar on a hill in senzio the vision rocked with stomachchurning dislocation then it steadied and elena saw men killing each other in a valley below armies grappling together in the heat like beasts in a convulsive embrace she heard screaming so loud she felt the sound as pain then she became aware of something else sorcery north of them that hill brandin of ygrath and in that moment elena and the three other night walkers understood why they had been summoned feeling in their own minds the punishing weight of the assault they had to resist back in castle borso alienor stood by helpless and blind in her uncertainty understanding nothing of this at all only knowing that it was happening that it was upon them at last she wanted to pray to reach back toward words not thought or spoken in almost twenty years she saw elena bring her hands up to cover her face oh no she heard the girl whisper in a voice thin as old parchment so strong how can one man be so strong alienors hands gripped each other so tightly the knuckles were white she waited desperately seeking a clue to what was happening to all of them so far to the north where she could not go she did not could not hear sandre dastibars reply to elena he is strong yes but with you we will be stronger oh children we can do it now in the name of the palm together we can be strong enough what alienor did see was how elenas hands came down how her white face grew calm the wild primitive terror leaving her staring eyes yes she heard the other woman whisper yes then there was silence in that room in castle borso under the braccio pass outside the cool wind of the highlands blew the high white clouds across the sun and away and across it and away and a single hunting hawk hovered on motionless wings in that passing of light and shadow over the face of the mountains in fact the next man scrabbling up the slope of the cliff was ducas di tregea devin had actually begun to swing his sword before he recognized who it was ducas reached the summit in two hard churning strides and stood beside him he was a fearful sight his face was covered in blood dripping down into his beard there was blood all over him and wet on his sword he was smiling though a terrible red look of battlelust and rage you are hurt he said sharply to devin i wouldnt talk devin grunted pressing his left hand to his torn side come on quickly they turned back east more than fifteen of the ygrathens were still on their summit pressing forward against the untrained band of men alessan had kept back to defend the wizards the numbers were almost even but the ygrathens were the picked and deadly warriors of that realm even so even with this they were not getting through and they would not devin realized with a surge of exultation in his heart rising high over pain and grief they would not because facing them side by side swinging blades together in their longedfor battle after all the long waiting years that had run by were alessan prince of tigana and baerd bar saevar the only brother of his soul and the two of them were absolute and deadly and even beautiful if killing could be so devin and ducas rushed over but by the time they got there five ygrathens only were left then three then only two one of them made as if to lay down his sword before he could do so a figure moved forward with an awkward deceptive swiftness from the ring guarding the wizards dragging his lame foot ricaso came up to the ygrathen before anyone could stay him he swung his old halfrusted blade in a passionate scything arc cleaving through the links in armor to bury itself in the mans breast then he fell to his knees on the ground beside the soldier hed killed weeping as though his soul was pouring out of him which left one of them only and the last was the leader the large broadchested man devin had seen down below the mans hair was plastered flat to his head he was redfaced with heat and exhaustion sucking hard for breath but his eyes glared at alessan are you fools he gasped fighting for the barbadian instead of with a man who has joined the palm do you want to be slaves slowly alessan shook his head it is twenty years too late for brandin of ygrath to join the palm it was too late the day he landed here with an invading force you are a brave man i would prefer not to kill you will you give us an oath in your own name and lay down your sword in surrender beside devin ducas snarled angrily but before the tregean could speak the ygrathen said my name is rhamanus i offer it to you in pride for no dishonor has ever attached to that name you will have no oath from me though i swore one to the king i love before i led his guard here i told him i would stop you or die it is an oath i will keep he raised his sword toward alessan and gestured though not seriously devin realized afterwards to strike at the prince alessan did not even move to ward the blow it was baerd whose blade came up and then swept downward to bite with finality into the neck of the ygrathen driving him to the ground oh my king they heard the man say then thickly through the blood rising in his mouth oh brandin i am so sorry then he rolled over on his back and lay still his sightless eyes staring straight at the burning sun the sun had been burning hot as well the morning he had defied the governor and taken a young servinggirl for tribute down the river from stevanien so many years ago dianora saw a man raise his sword on that hill she turned her head away so she would not see rhamanus die there was an ache in her a growing void she felt as if all the chasms of her life were opening in the ground before her feet he had been an enemy the man who had seized her to be a slave sent to claim tribute for brandin he had burned villages and homes in corte and asoli he had been an ygrathen had sailed to the palm in the invading fleet had fought in the last battle by the deisa he had been her friend one of her only friends brave and decent and loyal all his life to his king kind and direct illatease in a subtle court dianora realized that she was weeping for him for the good life cloven like a tree by that strangers descending sword they have failed my lord it was deymon his voice actually showing or was she imagining it the faintest hint of emotion of sorrow all of the guards are down and rhamanus the wizards are still there from his chair under the canopy brandin opened his eyes his gaze was fixed on the valley below and he did not turn dianora saw that his face was chalkwhite now with strain even in the red heat of the day she wiped quickly at her tears he must not see her thus if he should chance to look he might need her whatever strength or love she had to give he must not be distracted with concern for her he was one man alone fighting so many and more in fact than she even knew for the wizards had reached the night walkers in certando by now they were linked and they were all bending the power of their minds to albericos defense from the plain below there came a roar even above the steady noise of battle cheering and wild shouts from the barbadians dianora could see their whiteclad messengers sprinting forward from the rear where alberico was she saw that the men of the western palm had been stopped in their advance they were still outnumbered terribly so if brandin could not help them now then all was done all over she looked south toward that hill where the wizards were where rhamanus had been cut down she wanted to curse them all but she could not they were men of the palm they were her own people but her own people were dying in the valley as well under the heavy blades of the empire the sun was a brand overhead the sky a blank pitiless dome she looked at deymon neither of them spoke they heard quick footsteps on the slope scelto stumbled up fighting for breath my lord he gasped dropping to his knees beside brandins chair we are hardpressed in the center and on the right the left is holding but barely i am ordered to ask if you want us to fall back and so it had come i hate that man he had said to her last night before falling asleep in utter weariness hate everything he stands for there was a silence on the hill it seemed to dianora as if she could hear her own heartbeat with some curious faculty of the ear discerning it even above the sounds from below the noises in the valley seemed oddly to have receded now to be growing fainter every second brandin stood up no he said quietly we do not fall back there is nowhere to retreat and not before the barbadian not ever he was gazing bleakly out over sceltos kneeling form as if he would penetrate the distance with his eyes to strike at albericos heart but there was something else in him now something new beyond rage beyond the grimness of resolution and the everlasting pride dianora sensed it but she could not understand then he turned to her and she saw in the depths of that grey gaze a bottomless well of pain opening up such as she had never seen in him never seen in anyone in all her days pity and grief and love he had said last night something was happening her heart was racing wildly she felt her hands beginning to shake my love brandin said mumbled slurred it she saw death in his eyes an abscess of loss that seemed to be leaving him almost blind stripping his soul oh my love he said again what have they done see what they will make me do oh see what they make me do brandin she cried terrified not understanding at all beginning again to weep frantically grasping only the open sore of hurt he had become she reached out toward him but he was blind and already turning away east toward the rim of the hill and the valley below all right said rinaldo the healer and lifted his hands away devin opened his eyes and looked down his wound had closed the bleeding had stopped the sight of it made him feel queasy the unnatural speed of the healing as if his senses still expected to find a fresh wound there you are going to have an easy scar for women to know you by in the dark rinaldo added dryly ducas gave a bark of laughter devin winced and carefully avoided meeting alaiss eye she was right beside him wrapping a roll of linen around his torso to bind the wound he looked at ducas instead whose own cut above his eye had been closed by rinaldo in the same way arkin who had also survived the skirmish down below was bandaging it ducas his red beard matted and sticky with blood looked like some fearful creature out of childhood night terrors is that too tight alais asked softly devin drew a testing breath and shook his head the wound hurt but he seemed to be all right you saved my life he murmured to her she was behind him now tying up the ends of his bandage her hands stopped for a moment and then resumed no i didnt she said in a muffled voice he was down he couldnt have hurt you all i did was kill a man catriana standing near them glanced over i i wish i hadnt alais said and began to cry devin swallowed and tried to turn to offer comfort but catriana was quicker than he and had already gathered alais in her arms he looked at them wondering bitterly what real comfort there could be to offer on this bare ridge in the midst of war erlein now brandin is standing alessans cry knifed through all other sounds his heart suddenly thumping again devin went quickly toward the prince and the wizards it is upon us then said erlein in a hard flat voice to the other two i will have to pull out now to track him wait for my signal but move when i give it we will sertino gasped triad save us all sweat was pouring down the pudgy wizards face his hands were shaking with strain erlein alessan began urgently he must use it all you know what you hush i know exactly what i must do alessan you have set this in motion you brought us all here to senzio every single person the living and the dead now it is up to us be still unless you want to pray devin looked north to brandins hill he saw the king step forward from under his canopy oh triad he heard alessan whisper then in a queerly high voice adaon remember us remember your children now the prince sank to his knees please he whispered again please let me have been right on his hill to the north of them brandin of ygrath stretched forth one hand and then the other under the burning sun dianora saw him move forward to the very edge of the hill out from the canopy into the white blaze of the light scelto scrambled away beneath them the armies of the western palm were being hammered back now center and left and right the cries of the barbadians had taken on a quality of triumphant malice that fell like blows upon the heart brandin lifted his right hand and leveled it ahead then he brought up his left beside it so that the palms were touching each other the ten fingers pointing together pointing straight to where alberico of barbadior was at the rear of his army and brandin of the western palm who had been the king of ygrath when he first came to this peninsula cried aloud then in a voice that seemed to flay and shred the very air oh my son stevan forgive me what i do dianora stopped breathing she thought she was going to fall she reached out a hand for support and didnt even realize it was deymon who braced her then brandin spoke again in a voice colder than she had ever heard him use words none of them could understand only the sorcerer down in the valley would know only he could grasp the enormity of what was happening she saw brandin spread his legs as if to brace himself then she saw what followed now erlein di senzio screamed both of you get the others out cut free now theyre loose sertino cried im out he collapsed in a heap to the ground as if he might never rise again something was happening on the other hill in the middle of day under the brilliant sun the sky seemed to be changing to be darkening where brandin stood something not smoke not light some kind of change in the very nature of the air seemed to be pouring from his hands boiling east and down disorienting to the eye blurred unnatural like a rushing doom erlein suddenly turned his head his eyes widening with horror sandre what are you doing he shrieked grabbing wildly at the duke get out you fool in eannas name get out not yet said sandre dastibar in a voice that carried its own full measure of doom there had been more of them four more coming to his aid not wizards now a different kind of magic of the palm one he hadnt even known about didnt understand but it didnt matter they were here and on his side if screened from his mind and with them with all of them bending their power to his defense he had even been able to reach out and forward to assert his own strength against the enemy who were falling back there was glory after all under the sun and hope more than hope a glittering vista of triumph spreading in the valley before him a pathway made smooth with the blood of his foes leading straight from here back across the sea and home to the tiara he would bless these wizards honor them make them lords of unimagined power here in this colony or in barbadior wherever they wanted whatever they chose and thinking so alberico had felt his own magic flow like intoxicating wine in his veins and had sent it pouring forth against the ygrathens and the men of the western palm and his armies had laughed aloud in triumph and felt their swords to be suddenly as light as summer grass he heard them beginning to sing the old battlesong of the empires legions conquering in far lands centuries ago and they were it was happening again they werent just mercenaries they were the empires legions for he was or would be the empire he could see it it was here it was shining before him in the blazing day then brandin of ygrath rose and stepped to the rim of his hill a distant figure alone under the sun in that high place and a moment later alberico who was a sorcerer himself felt for he could not have actually heard the dark absolute words of invocation that brandin spoke and his blood froze in his veins like ice in the dead of a winter night he cannot he gasped aloud not after so long he cannot do this but the ygrathen was he was reaching for all summoning everything every last scintilla of his magic holding nothing back nothing not even the power that had sustained the vengeance that had kept him here all these years he was emptying himself to shape a sorcery such as had never been wielded before desperately still half disbelieving alberico reached out for the wizards to tell them to brace to be ready crying that there were eight of them nine that they could hold against this that all they had to do was survive this moment and brandin would be nothing a shell waste for weeks months years a hollow man with no magic in him anymore their minds were closed barred against him they were still there though and defending braced oh if the horned god and the night queen were with him if they were with him yet he might still they were not they were not with him for in that instant alberico felt the wizards of the palm cut loose melting away without warning with terrifying suddenness to leave him naked and alone on the hill brandin had now leveled his hands and from them came bluegrey death an occluding obliterating presence in the air foaming and boiling down across the valley toward him and the wizards were gone he was alone or almost gone almost alone one man was still linked one of them had held with him and then that one mind opened up to alberico like the locked door of a dungeon springing back letting light flood in the light of truth and in that moment alberico of barbadior screamed aloud in terror and helpless rage for illumination came at last and he understood too late how he had been undone and by whom destroyed in the name of my sons i curse you forever said sandre duke of astibar his remorseless image rising in albericos mind like an apparition of horror from the afterworld but he was alive impossibly alive and here in senzio on that ridge with eyes implacable and utterly merciless he bared his teeth in a smile that summoned the night in the name of my children and of astibar die now forever cursed then he cut free he too was gone as that bluegrey death came boiling down the valley from brandins hill from his outstretched hands with blurred annihilating speed and alberico still reeling with shock clawing frantically upward from his chair was struck and enveloped and consumed by that death as a tidal wave of the raging engorged sea will take a sapling in lowlying fields it swept him away with it and sundered his body still screaming from his soul and he died died in that far peninsula of the palm two days before his emperor passed to the gods in barbadior failing at last one morning to wake from a dreamless sleep albericos army heard his last scream and their own cries of exultation turned to panicstricken horror in the face of that magic from the hill the barbadians felt a fear such as men should never have had to endure sweep over them they could scarcely grip their swords or flee or even stand upright before their foes who advanced untouched unharmed exalted under that dread sunblighting sorcery and began to carve and hew them with hard and deadly wrath everything thought brandin of ygrath of the western palm weeping helplessly on his hill as he looked down over the valley he had been driven to this and had answered had summoned all he had ever had to this final purpose and it was enough it was sufficient and nothing less would have been there had been too much magic opposed to him and death had been waiting for his people here he knew what he had been made to do knew the price of holding nothing back he had paid that price and was paying it now would go on doing so with every breath he drew until he died he had screamed stevans name aloud and in the echoing chambers of his soul before the summoning of that power had known that twenty years of vengeance for that toosoon shattered life were now undone under this bronze sun nothing held back it was over there had been men dying below him though fighting under his banner in his name and there had been no retreat for them from that plain nor for him he could not retreat he had been driven to this moment like a bear to a rocky cliff by a pack of wolves and the price was being paid now everywhere the price was being paid there was butchery in the valley a slaughter of barbadians his heart was crying he was a grieving torn thing all the memories of love of a fathers loss flooding over him another kind of tidal wave stevan he wept adrift in an ocean of loss far from any shore he was aware dimly of dianora beside him clutching his hands between her own but he was lost inside his pain power gone now the core of his being shattered into fragments shards a man no longer young trying without any hope at all to conceive of how to shape a life that could possibly go forward from this hill then the next thing happened for he had in fact forgotten something something he alone could possibly have known and so time which truly would not stop for grief or pity or love carried them all forward to the moment no sorcerer or wizard or piper on his ridge had foreseen the weight had been the weight of mountains crushing his mind carefully exquisitely judged to leave him that faintest spark of selfawareness which was where the purest torture lay that he might always know exactly who he was and had been and what he was being made to do utterly unable to control himself pressed flat under the burden of mountains which now were gone he straightened his back of his own will he turned east of his own will he tried to lift his head higher but could not he understood too many years in the same skewed sunken position they had broken the bones of his shoulder several times carefully he knew what he looked like what they had turned him into in that darkness long ago he had seen himself in mirrors through the years and in the mirrors of others eyes he knew exactly what had been done to his body before they started on his mind that didnt matter now the mountains were gone he looked out with his own sight reached back with his own memories could speak if he wished to speak with his own thoughts his own voice however much it had changed what rhun did was draw his sword of course he had a sword he carried whatever weapon brandin did was given each day the clothing the king had chosen he was the vent the conduit the double the fool he was more than that he knew exactly how much more brandin had left him that delicately measured scrap of awareness at the very bottom of his mind under the burying piledup mountains that had been the whole point the essence of everything that and the secrecy the fact that only they two knew and only they would ever know the men who had maimed and disfigured him had been blind working on him in their darkness knowing him only by the insistent probing of their hands upon his flesh reaching through to bone they had never learned who he was only brandin knew only brandin and he himself with that dim flickering of his identity so carefully left behind after everything else was gone it had been so elegantly contrived this answer to what he had done this response to grief and rage this vengeance no one living other than brandin of ygrath knew his true name and under the weight of mountains he had had no tongue to speak it himself only a heart to cry for what was being done to him the exquisite perfection of it of that revenge but the mountains that had buried him were gone and on that thought valentin prince of tigana lifted his sword on a hill in senzio his mind was his own his memories of a room without light black as pitch the voice of the ygrathen king weeping telling what was being done to tigana even as they spoke and what would be done to him in the months and the years to come a mutilated body his own features sorcerously imposed upon it was deathwheeled in chiara later that week then burned to ash and scattered to the winds in the black room the blind men began their work he remembered trying not to scream at first he remembered screaming much later brandin came and began and ended his own part of that careful patient work a torture of a different kind much worse the weight of mountains in his mind late in that same year the kings fool from ygrath died of a misadventure in the newly occupied palace of chiara and shortly afterwards rhun with his weak blinking eyes his deformed shoulder and slack mouth his nearly crippled walk was brought shambling up from his darkness into twenty years of night it was very bright here now almost blindingly so in the sunlight brandin was just ahead of him the girl was holding his hand the girl the girl was saevars daughter he had known her the moment she was first brought to be presented to the king she had changed in five years greatly changed and she would change much more as the years spun past but her eyes were her fathers exactly and valentin had watched dianora grow up when he had heard her named that first day as a woman from certando the dim allowed spark of his mind had flickered and burned for he knew he knew what she had come to do then as the months passed and the years he watched helplessly with his rheumy eyes from under the crush of his mountains as the terrible interwovenness of things added love to everything else he was bound to brandin unimaginably and he saw what happened more he was made to be a part of it by the very nature of the relationship between the kings and the fools of ygrath it was he who first gave expression beyond his control he had no control to what was growing in the heart of the king back in a time when brandin still refused to admit even the idea of love into a soul and a life shaped by vengeance and loss it was rhun valentin who would find himself staring at dianora at saevars darkhaired daughter with another mans soul in his eyes no more not ever again the long night had been rolled back the sorcery that had bound him was gone it was over he stood in sunlight and could speak his true name if he chose he took an awkward step forward and then more carefully another no one noticed him though they never noticed him he was the fool rhun even that name chosen by the king only the two of them ever to know not for the world this the privacy of pride he had even understood perhaps the most terrible thing of all he had understood he stepped under the canopy brandin was ahead of him near the edge of the hill he had never struck a man from behind in all his days he moved to one side stumbling a little and came up on the kings right hand no one looked at him he was rhun he was not you should have killed me by the river he said very clearly slowly brandin turned his head as if just now remembering something valentin waited until their eyes met and held before he drove his sword into the ygrathens heart the way a prince killed his enemies however many years it might take however much might have to be endured before such an ending was allowed dianora could not even scream she was so stunned so unprepared she saw brandin stagger backward a blade in his chest then rhun rhun jerked it clumsily free and so much blood followed brandins eyes were wide with astonishment and pain but they were clear so luminously clear and so was his voice as she heard him say both of us he swayed still on his feet father and son both what a harvest prince of tigana dianora heard the name as a white burst of sound in her brain time seemed to change to slow unbearably she saw brandin sinking to his knees it seemed to take forever for him to fall she tried to move toward him her body would not respond she heard an elongated weirdly distorted sound of anguish and saw stark agony in deymons face as the chancellors blade ripped into and through rhuns side not rhun not rhun valentin the prince brandins fool all those years the thing that had been done to him and she beside him beside that suffering all those years she wanted to scream she could not make a sound could scarcely breathe she saw him falling too the maimed broken form crumpling to the ground beside brandin who was still on his knees a red wound in his chest and who was looking at her now only at her a sound finally escaped her lips as she sank down beside him he reached out so slowly with such a colossal effort of will with all the control he had and he took her hand oh love she heard him say it is as i told you we should have met in finavir she tried again to speak to answer him but tears were streaming down her face and closing her throat she gripped his hand as tightly as she could trying to will life from herself over into him he slumped sideways against her shoulder and so she lowered him to her lap and wrapped her arms around him the way she had last night only last night when he slept she saw the brilliantly clear grey eyes slowly grow cloudy and then dark she was holding him like that when he died she lifted her head the prince of tigana on the ground beside them was looking at her with so much compassion in his newly clear eyes which was a thing she could not possibly endure not from him not with what he had suffered and what she was what she herself had done if he only knew what words would he have for her what look would there be in those eyes she could not bear it she saw him open his mouth as if to speak then his eyes flicked quickly to one side a shadow crossed the sun she looked up and saw deymons sword lifted high valentin raised a hand pleading to ward it wait she gasped forcing the one word out and deymon almost mad with his own grief yet stayed for her voice held back his sword valentin lowered his hand she saw him draw breath against the massive final reality of his own wound and then closing his eyes to the pain and the fierce light she heard him speak not a cry only the one word spoken in a clear voice the one word which was oh what else could it have ever been the name of his home offered as a shining thing for the world again to know and dianora saw then that deymon of ygrath did know it that he did hear the name which meant that all men now could that the spell was broken valentin opened his eyes and looked up at the chancellor reading the truth of that knowledge in deymons face and dianora saw that the prince of tigana was smiling as the chancellors sword came down from its great height and drove into his heart even in death the smile remained on the terribly afflicted face and the echo of his last word the single name seemed to dianora to be hanging yet and spreading outward in ripples through the air around the hill above the valley where the barbadians were all dying now she looked down at the dead man in her arms cradling his head and the greying hair and she could not stop her tears in finavir he had said last words another named place farther away than dream and had been right as so many many times he had been right they ought to have met if the gods had any kindness any pity at all for them in another world than this not here for love was what it was but it was not enough not here she heard a sound from under the canopy and turned in time to see deymon slump forward against brandins chair the hilt of his sword was against the seatback of the chair the blade was buried in his breast she saw it and she pitied him his pain but she could not properly grieve there was nothing left within her for such a sorrow deymon of ygrath could not matter now not with the two men lying here with her beside each other she could pity oh she could pity any man or woman born but she could not grieve for any but these two not now not ever she realized she looked over then and saw scelto still on his knees the only other living person on this hill he too was weeping but for her she realized even more than for the dead his first tears had always been for her he seemed to be far away though everything seemed oddly remote except brandin except valentin for the last time she looked down at the man for whose love she had betrayed her home and all her dead and her own vengeance sworn before a fire in her fathers house so long ago she looked down upon what remained of brandin of ygrath with his soul gone and slowly tenderly dianora lowered her head and kissed him upon the lips in farewell in finavir she said my love then she laid him on the ground beside valentin and she stood looking south she saw that three men and the woman with red hair had descended the slope of the wizards ridge and were beginning to swiftly cross the uneven ground between she turned to scelto whose eyes had now a terrible foreknowledge in them he knew her she remembered he loved her and he knew her much too well he knew all save the one thing and that one secret she would take away with her that was her own in a way she said to him gesturing at the prince it would almost be better if no one ever knew who he was but i dont think we can do that tell them scelto stay and tell them when they get here whoever they are they ought to know oh my lady he whispered weeping must it end like this she knew what he meant of course she knew she would not dissemble with him now she looked at the people whoever they were coming quickly across the ground from the south the woman a brownhaired man with a sword another darker one a third man smaller than the other two yes she said to scelto watching them approach yes i think it must and so she turned and left him with the dead on that hill to wait for those who were coming even now she left the valley behind the hill left all the noises of battle and pain walking down the northernmost of the goatherds tracks as it wound west along the slope of the hill out of sight of everyone there were flowers growing along the path sonrai berries wild lilies irises anemones yellow and white and then there was a scarlet one in tregea they said that flower had been made red by the blood of adaon where he fell there were no men or women on that slope to see her or to stay her as she went nor was the distance very far to level ground and then to the beginnings of the sand and finally to the margin of the sea where there were gulls wheeling and crying overhead there was blood on her garments she discarded them in a small pile on the wide sweep of that white sand she stepped into the water it was cool but not nearly so cold as the sea of chiara had been on the morning of the dive she walked out slowly until it came to her hips and then she began to swim straight out heading west toward where the sun would set when it finally went down to end this day she was a good swimmer her father had taught her and her brother long ago after a dream she had had valentin the prince had even come with them once to their cove long ago when she began at length to tire she was very far from the shore out where the bluegreen of the ocean near land changes to the darker blue of the deep and there she dived pushing herself downward away from the blue of the sky and the bronze sun and it seemed to her as she went down that there was an odd illumination appearing in the water a kind of path here in the depths of the sea she had not expected that she had not thought any such thing would be here for her not after all that had happened all that she had done but there was indeed a path a glow of light defining it she was tired now and deep and her vision was beginning to grow dim she thought she saw a shape flicker at the edge of the shimmering light she could not see very clearly though there seemed to be a kind of mist coming down over her she thought for a moment the shape might be the riselka though she had not earned that or even adaon though she had no claim at all upon the god but then it seemed to dianora that there was a last gathering of brightness in her mind at the very end and the mist fell back a little and she saw that for her it was neither of these after all not the riselka nor the god it was morian come in kindness come in grace to bring her home alone of the living on a hill with the dead scelto stood and composed himself as best he could waiting for those he could see beginning to climb the slope when the three men and the tall woman reached the summit he knelt in submission as they surveyed in silence what had happened here what death had claimed upon this hill he was aware that they might kill him even as he knelt he wasnt sure that he cared the king was lying only an arms length away from rhun who had slain him rhun who had been a prince here in the palm prince of tigana lower corte if he had a space of time later scelto sensed that the pieces of this story might begin to come together for him even numbed as he was now he could feel a lancing hurt in his mind if he dwelt upon that history so much done in the name of the dead she would be near the water by now she would not be coming back this time he had not expected her to return on the morning of the dive she had tried to hide it but he had seen something in her when she woke that day he hadnt understood why but he had known that she was readying herself to die she had been ready he was certain of it something had changed for her by the waters edge that day it would not change again you are he looked up a lean blackhaired man silvering at the temples was looking down at him with a clear grey gaze eyes curiously like brandins had been i am scelto i was a servant in the saishan a messenger today you were here when they died scelto nodded the mans voice was calm though there was a discernible sense of effort in that as if he were trying with his tone to superimpose some pattern of order upon the chaos of the day will you tell me who killed the king of ygrath his fool scelto said quietly trying to match the manner of the other man in the distance below them the noises of battle were subsiding at last how at brandins request it was one of the other men a hardlooking bearded figure with dark eyes and a sword in his hand scelto shook his head he felt overwhelmingly weary all of a sudden she would be swimming she would be a long way out by now no it was an attack i think he lowered his head fearful of presuming go on said the first man gently you are in no danger from us i have had enough of blood today more than enough scelto looked up at that wondering then he said i think that when the king used his last magic he was too intent on the valley and he forgot about rhun he used so much in that spell that he released the fool from his binding he released more than that the greyeyed man said softly the tall woman had come to stand beside him she had red hair and deep blue eyes she was young and very beautiful she would be far out among the waves it would all be over soon he had not said farewell after so many years despite himself scelto choked back a sob may i know he asked them not even sure why he needed this may i know who you are and quietly without arrogance or even any real assertion the darkhaired man said my name is alessan bar valentin the last of my line my father and brothers were killed by brandin almost twenty years ago i am the prince of tigana scelto closed his eyes in his mind he was hearing brandins voice again clear and cold laden with irony even with his mortal wound what a harvest prince of tigana and rhun just before he died speaking that same name under the dome of the sky his own revenge was here then where is the woman the third man asked suddenly the younger smaller one where is dianora di certando who did the ring dive was she not here it would be over by now it would be calm and deep and dark for her green tendrils of the sea would grace her hair and twine about her limbs she would finally be at rest at peace scelto looked up he was weeping he didnt even try to stop or hide his tears now she was here he said she has gone to the sea again to an ending in the sea he didnt think they would care that they could possibly care about that any of them but he saw then that he was wrong all four of them even the grim warlike one with the brown hair grew abruptly still and then turned almost as one to look west past the slopes and the sand to where the sun was setting over the water i am deeply sorry to hear that said the man named alessan i saw her do the ring dive in chiara she was beautiful and astonishingly brave the brownhaired man stepped forward an unexpected hesitation in his eyes he wasnt as stern as he had first seemed scelto realized and he was younger as well tell me the man was she did she ever he stopped in confusion the other man the prince looked at him with compassion in his eyes she was from certando baerd everyone knows the story slowly the other man nodded his head but when he turned away it was to look out toward the sea again they dont seem like conquerors scelto thought they didnt seem like men in the midst of a triumph they just looked tired as at the end of a very long journey so it wasnt me after all the greyeyed man was saying almost to himself after all my years of dreaming it was his own fool who killed him it had nothing to do with us he looked at the two dead men lying together then back at scelto who was the fool do we know she was gone claimed by the dark sea far down she was at rest and scelto was so tired tired of grief and blood and pain of these bitter cycles of revenge he knew what was going to happen to this man the moment he spoke they ought to know she had said before she walked away to the sea and it was true of course it was true scelto looked up at the greyeyed man rhun he said an ygrathen bound to the king many years ago no one very important my lord the prince of tigana nodded his head his expressive mouth quirking with an inwarddirected irony of course he said of course no one very important why should i have thought it would be otherwise alessan said the younger man from the front of the hill i think it is over down below i mean i think i think the barbadians are all dead the prince lifted his head and so did scelto men of the palm and of ygrath would be standing beside each other down in that valley are you going to kill us all now scelto asked him the prince of tigana shook his head i told you i have had enough of blood there is a great deal to be done but i am going to try to do it without any more killing now he went to the southern rim of the hill and lifted his hand in some signal to the men on his own ridge the woman went over and stood beside him and he put an arm around her shoulders a moment later they heard the notes of a horn ring out over the valley and the hills clear and high and beautiful sounding an end to battle scelto still on his knees wiped at his eyes with a grimy hand he looked over and saw that the third man the one who had tried to ask him something was still gazing out to sea there was a pain there he could not understand there had been pain everywhere today though he had had it in his grasp even now to speak truth and unleash so much more his eyes swung slowly down again away from the hard blue sky and the bluegreen sea past the man at the western edge of the hill past deymon of ygrath slumped across the kings chair with his own blade in his breast and his gaze came to rest on the two dead men beside each other on the ground so near that they could have touched had they been alive he could keep their secret he could live with it epilogue three men on horses in the southern highlands looking over a valley to the east there are pine and cedar woods beyond hills on either side the sperion river sparkles in the distance flowing down out of the mountains not far from where it will begin its long curve west to find the sea the air is bright and cool with a feel of autumn in the breeze the colors of the leaves will be changing soon and the yearround snow on the highest peaks of the mountains will begin moving down closing the pass in the tranquil green of the valley below them devin sees the dome of eannas temple flash in the morning sunlight beyond the sanctuary he can just make out the winding trail they had ridden down in the spring coming here from the east across the border it seems a lifetime ago he turns in the saddle and looks north over the rolling gradually subsiding hills will we be able to see it from here later baerd glances over and then follows his gaze what avalle and the towers easily on any clear day meet me here in a years time and youll see my greenandwhite princes tower i promise you where are you getting the marble sandre asks same place as orsaria did for the original tower the quarry is still available believe it or not about two days ride west of us near the coast and youll have it carried here by sea to tigana then on river barges up the sperion the same way they did it back then baerd has shaved his beard again he looks years younger devin finds himself thinking how do you know so much about it sandre asks with lazy mockery i thought all you knew was archery and how not to fall on your face when you were out alone in the dark baerd smiles i was always going to be a builder i have my fathers love of stone if not his gift im a craftsman though and i knew how to look at things even back then i think i know as much as any man alive about how orsaria built his towers and his palaces including one in astibar sandre would you like me to tell you where your secret passages are sandre laughs aloud dont boast you presumptuous mason on the other hand it has been almost twenty years since i was in that palace you may have to remind me of where they are grinning devin looks over at the duke it has taken him a long time to adjust to seeing sandre without his dark khardhu guise you will be going back after the wedding then he asks feeling a sadness at the thought of another parting ahead i think i must though i will say that im torn i feel too old for governing anyone now and it isnt as if i have any heirs to groom after a moments stillness sandre takes them smoothly past the darkness of those memories to be honest the thing that interests me most right now is what ive been doing here in tigana the mindlinking with erlein and sertino and the wizards weve managed to find and the night walkers devin asks indeed baerds carlozzini as well i must say im pleased that the four of them are coming with alienor to the wedding not as pleased as baerd is im sure devin adds slyly baerd gives him a look and pretends to be absorbed in scanning the distant line of the road south of them well hardly as pleased sandre agrees though i do hope hell spare his elena for a small part of the time shes here if we are going to change the attitude of this peninsula to magic theres no better time to start than now wouldnt you say oh certainly devin says grinning broadly shes not my elena baerd murmurs keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the road she isnt sandre asks in mock surprise then whos this baerd person she keeps using me to relay messages to would you know the fellow never heard of him baerd says laconically he keeps a straight face for a moment longer then gives way to laughter im beginning to remember why i preferred keeping to myself and what about devin if youre on that subject you dont think alais would be sending him messages if she could devin says the duke airily is a mere child far too young and innocent to be getting involved with women especially the likes of that guileful experienced creature from astibar he attempts to look stern and fails both of the others know his real opinion of rovigos daughter there are no inexperienced women in astibar baerd retorts and besides hes old enough he even has a battle scar on his ribs to show her shes seen it already devin says enjoying this enormously she taped it up after rinaldo healed me he adds hastily as both of the others raise their eyebrows no thrill there he tries and fails to conceive of alais as guileful and deceptive the memory of her on the windowledge in senzio keeps coming back to him of late though the particular smile on her face as he stumbled along the outside landing to his own room they are coming arent they the duke asks it occurs to me that i could sail home with rovigo theyll be here devin confirms they had a wedding of their own last week or theyd have arrived by now i see you are intimately versed in their timing baerd says with a straight face just what do you plan to do after the wedding actually devin says i wish i knew there must be ten different things ive thought about he evidently sounds more serious than hed meant to for both of his friends turn their attention fully to him such as sandre asks devin takes a breath and lets it out he holds up both hands and starts counting on his fingers find my father and help him settle here again find menico di ferraut and put together the company we should have had before you people sidetracked me stay with alessan and catriana in tigana and help them with whatever they have to do learn how to handle a ship at sea dont ask me why stay in avalle and build a tower with baerd he hesitates the others are smiling he plunges onward spend another night with alienor at borso spend my life with alais bren rovigo start chasing down the words and music of all the songs weve lost go over the mountains to quileia and find the twentyseven tree in the sacred grove start training for the sprint race in next summers triad games learn how to shoot a bow which reminds me you did promise me that baerd he stops because they are laughing now and so is he a little breathlessly you must have gone past ten somewhere in that list baerd chuckles there are more devin says do you want them i dont think i could stand it sandre says you remind me too painfully of how old i am and how young you are devin sobers at those words he shakes his head never think that i dont think there was a moment last year when i didnt have to work to keep up with you wherever we went he smiles at a thought you arent old sandre youre the youngest wizard in the palm sandres expression is wry he holds up his left hand they can clearly see the two missing fingers theres truth to that and i may be the first to break the habit of screening what we are because i never got into the habit youre serious about dropping the screening baerd asks utterly serious if we are to survive in this peninsula as a whole nation in the world we are going to need magic to match barbadior and ygrath and khardhun come to think of it and i dont even know what powers they have in quileia now it has been too many years since we dealt with them we can no longer hide our wizards or the carlozzini we cant afford to be as ignorant as weve always been about how magic is shaped here even the healers we dont understand anything about them we have to learn our magic value it search wizards out and train them find ways to control them too the palm has to discover magic or magic will undo us again one day the way it did twenty years ago you think we can do that first thing though devin asks make a nation here out of the nine we are i know we can and i think we will i will wager you both right now that alessan di tigana is named king of the palm at the triad games next year devin turns quickly to baerd whose color has suddenly risen would he take it he asks would he do that baerd baerd looks at sandre and then slowly back to devin who else could he answers finally i dont even think he has a choice the knitting together of this peninsula has been his lifes cause since he was fifteen years old he was already on that path when i found him in quileia i think i think what hed really like to do is find menico with you devin and spend a few years making music with you two and erlein and catriana and some dancers and someone who can play the syrenya but sandre asks but hes the man who saved us all everyone knows it everyone knows who he is now after a dozen years of being on the roads he knows more people who matter in each province than anyone else hes the one who gave the rest of us the vision and hes the prince of tigana too and in his prime im afraid he grimaces at the word i dont see how he can avoid this even if he wanted to i think for alessan it is just beginning now they are silent a moment what about you devin asks will you go with him what do you want baerd smiles what do i want nothing nearly so high id badly like to find my sister but im beginning to accept that shes gone and i think that i may never know where or how ill be there for alessan whenever he needs me but what i most want to do is build things houses temples bridges a palace half a dozen towers here in avalle i need to see things rising and i i suppose its part of the same thing but i want to start a family we need children here again too many people died he looks away for a moment toward the mountains and then back again you and i may be the lucky ones devin we arent princes or dukes or wizards were only ordinary men with a life to start i told you he was waiting for elena sandre says gently not a gibe the voice of a friend speaking with deep affection baerd smiles looking into the distance again and in that moment his expression changes it grows charged with a fierce bright pleasure look he cries pointing here he comes from the south winding out of the mountains and the hills of the highlands along a road that has not been used in hundreds of years there comes a caravan manycolored stretching back a long way there is music playing beside it and ahead with men and women riding and on foot donkeys and horses laden with goods at least fifty banners flapping in the wind and now the tunes drift up to the three of them bright and gay and all the colors are flashing in the morning light as marius king of quileia comes riding down from the mountain pass to the wedding of his friend he is to spend the night in the sanctuary where he will be formally welcomed by the high priest of eanna whom he will remember as the man who brought a fourteenyearold boy to him over the mountains long ago there are barges waiting in avalle to take them down the river to tigana in the morning but the right of first greeting is baerds in alessans name and he has asked the two of them to ride here with him come on he cries now joy in his face he urges his horse forward down the sloping path devin and sandre glance at each other and hasten to follow i will never understand devin shouts as they catch up to baerd how you can possibly be so pleased to see a man who calls you pigeon two sandre gives a cackle of glee baerd laughs aloud and mimes a blow at devin the three of them are still laughing as they slow their horses to swing around a cluster of sonrai bushes at a wide curve in the downward trail and it is there that they see the riselka three men see a riselka sitting on a rock beside the sunlit path her long seagreen hair blowing back in the freshening breeze
