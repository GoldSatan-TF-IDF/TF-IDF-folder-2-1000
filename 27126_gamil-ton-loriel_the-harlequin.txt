writing group tom drennan deborah millitello rett macpherson marella sands sharon shinn and mark sumner you guys help keep me going chapter one malcolm the head of the church of eternal life the vampire church sat across from me malcolm had never been in my office before in fact the last time id seen him hed accused me of doing black magic and being a whore id also killed one of his members on church grounds in front of him and the rest of his congregation the dead vamp had been a serial killer id had a court order of execution but still it hadnt made malcolm and me buddies i sat behind my desk sipping coffee from my newest christmasthemed mug a little girl sat on santas lap saying define good i worked hard every year to find the most offensive mug i could so that bert our business manager could throw a fit this years mug was tame by my usual standards it had become one of my holiday traditions id at least dressed for the season in a red skirt and jacket over a thin silk sweatervery festive for me i had a new gun in my shoulder holster a friend of mine had finally persuaded me to give up my browning hipower for something that fit my hand a little better and had a smoother profile the hipower was at home in the gun safe and the browning dual mode was in the holster i felt like i was cheating but at least i was still a browning girl once upon a time id thought malcolm handsome but that had been when his vampire tricks worked on me without vampire wiles to cloud my perception i could see that his bone structure was too rough almost as if it hadnt quite gotten smoothed out before they put that pale skin on it his hair was cut short and had a little curl to it because to take the curl out of it hed have had to shave it the hair was a bright bright canary yellow thats what blond hair does if you take it out of the sun for a few hundred years he looked at me with his blue eyes and smiled and the smile filled his face with personality that same personality that made his sunday morning television program such a hit it wasnt magic it was just him charisma for lack of a better word there was force to malcolm that had nothing to do with vampire powers and everything to do with who he was not what he was hed have been a leader and a mover of men even if hed been alive the smile softened his features filled his face with a zeal that was both compelling and frightening he was a true believer head of a church of true believers the whole idea of a vampire church still creeped me out but it was the fastestgrowing denomination in the country i was surprised to see your name in my appointment book malcolm i said finally i understand that ms blake i am almost equally surprised to be here fine were both surprised why are you here i suspect you have or will soon have a warrant of execution for a member of my church i managed to keep my face blank but felt the stiffness in my shoulders hed see the reaction and hed know what it meant master vampires dont miss much you have a lot of members malcolm could you narrow it down a little who exactly are we talking about dont be coy ms blake im not being coy youre trying to imply that you have a warrant for more than one of my vampires i do not believe it and neither do you i should have felt insulted because i wasnt lying two of his upstanding vamps had been very naughty if your vampires were fully bloodoathed to you youd know i was telling the truth because youd be able to enforce your moral code in entirely new ways a blood oath is not a guarantee of absolute control ms blake no but its a start a blood oath was what a vamp took when he joined a new vampire group a new kiss he literally took blood from the master of the city it meant the master had a lot more control over him and the lesser vamps gained in power too if their master was powerful enough a weak master wasnt much help but jeanclaude st louiss master of the city and my sweetie wasnt weak of course the master gained power from the oath as well the more powerful a vamp they could oath the more they gained like so many vampire powers it was a twoway street i do not want to enforce my moral code i want my people to choose to be good people malcolm said until your congregation is bloodoathed to some master vampire they are loose cannons malcolm you control them by force of personality and morality vampires only understand fear and power you are the lover of at least two vampires ms blake how can you say that i shrugged maybe because i am dating two vampires if that is what being jeanclaudes human servant has taught you ms blake then it is sad things he is teaching you he is the master of the city of st louis malcolm not you you and your church go unmolested by his tolerance i go unmolested because the church grew powerful under the previous master of the city and by the time jeanclaude rose to power we were hundreds he did not have the power to bring me and my people to heel i sipped coffee and thought about my next answer because i couldnt argue with him he was probably right regardless of how we got where we are malcolm you have several hundred vampires in this city jeanclaude let you have them because he thought you were bloodoathing them we learned in october that you arent which means that the vamps with you are cut off from an awful lot of their potential power im okay with that i guess their choice if they understand that it is a choice but no blood oath means that they are not mystically tied to anyone but the vamp that made them you im told do the deed most of the time though the church deacons do recruit sometimes how our church is organized is not your concern yes i said it is do you serve jeanclaude now when you say that or is it as a federal marshal that you criticize me he narrowed those blue eyes i do not think the federal government knows or understands enough of vampires to care whether i bloodoath my people bloodoathing lowers the chance of vamps doing things behind the back of the master bloodoathing takes away their free will ms blake maybe but ive seen the damage they can do with their free will a good master of the city can guarantee that there is almost no crime among his people they are his slaves malcolm said i shrugged and sat back in my chair are you here to talk about the warrant or to talk about the deadline jeanclaude gave your church both jeanclaude has given you and your church members their choices malcolm either you bloodoath them or jeanclaude does or they can move to another city to be bloodoathed there but it has to be done it is a choice of who they would be slaves to ms blake it is no choice at all jeanclaude was generous malcolm by vampire law he could have just killed you and your entire congregation and how would the law how would you as a federal marshal have felt about such slaughter are you saying that my being a federal marshal limits jeanclaudes options he values your love anita and you would not love a man that could slaughter my followers you dont add yourself to that listwhy you are a legal vampire executioner anita if i broke human law you would kill me yourself you would not fault jeanclaude for doing the same if i broke vampiric law you think id just let him kill you i think you would kill me for him if you felt justified a small part of me wanted to argue but he was right id been grandfathered in like most of the vamp executioners who had two or more years on the job and could pass the firearms test the idea was making us federal marshals was the quickest way to grant us the ability to cross state lines and to control us more crossing state lines and having a badge was great i wasnt sure how controlled we were of course i was the only vampire hunter who was also dating her master of the city most saw it as a conflict of interest frankly so did i but there wasnt much i could do about it you do not argue with me malcolm said i cant decide if you think im a civilizing influence on jeanclaude or a bad one i saw you once as his victim anita now i am no longer certain who is the victim and who the victimizer should i be offended he just looked at me the last time i was in your church you called me evil and accused me of black magic you called jeanclaude immoral and me his whore or something like that you were trying to take away one of my people to be killed with no trial you shot him to death on the church grounds he was a serial killer i had an order of execution for everyone involved in those crimes all the vampires you mean are you implying that humans or shapeshifters were involved no but if they had been you would never have been allowed to shoot them to death with the police helping you do it ive had warrants for shapeshifters before but those are rare anita and there are no orders of execution for humans the death penalty still exists malcolm after a trial and years of appeals if you are human what do you want from me malcolm i want justice the law isnt about justice malcolm its about the law she did not do the crime she is accused of as our wandering brother avery seabrook was innocent of the crime you sought him for he called any of his church group who joined jeanclaude wanderers the fact that avery the vampire had a last name meant he was very recently dead and that he was an american vampire vampires normally only had one name like madonna or cher and only one vamp per country could have that name duels were fought over the right to use names until now until america we had vampires with last names unheard of i cleared avery legally i didnt have to no you could have shot him dead found out your mistake later and suffered nothing under the law i did not write this law malcolm i just carry it out vampires did not write this law either anita thats true but no human can mesmerize other humans so that they help in their own kidnappings humans cant fly off with their victims in their arms and that justifies slaughtering us i shrugged again i was going to leave this argument alone because id begun to not like that part of my job i didnt think vampires were monsters anymore it made killing them harder it made executing them when they couldnt fight back monstrous with me as the monster what do you want me to do malcolm i have a warrant with sally hunters name on it witnesses saw her leave bev levetos apartment ms leveto died by vampire attack i know it wasnt any of jeanclaudes vampires that leaves yours hell i had her drivers license picture in the file with the warrant i have to admit that having a picture to go with it made me feel more like an assassin a picture so id get the right one are you so certain of that i blinked at him the slow blink that gave me time to think but didnt look like i was thinking furiously what are you trying to say malcolm im not good at subtle just tell me what you came to say something powerful someone powerful came to my church last week they hid themselves i could not find them in the new faces of my congregation but i know that someone immensely powerful was there he leaned forward his calm exterior cracking around the edges do you understand how powerful they would have to be for me to sense them use all my powers to search the room for them yet not be able to find them i thought about it malcolm was no master of the city but he was probably one of the top five most powerful vampires in town hed be higher if he werent so terribly moral it limited him in some ways i licked my lips careful of the lipstick and nodded did they want you to know they were there or was that part an accident he actually showed surprise for a moment before he got control of his face he played human too much for the media he was beginning to lose that stillness of features that the old ones have i dont know even his voice was no longer smooth did the vamp do it to taunt you or was it arrogance he shook his head i do not know i had a moment of revelation you came here because you think jeanclaude should know but you cant let your congregation see you going to the master of the city it would undermine your whole freewill thing he settled back into his chair fighting to keep the anger off his face and failing he was even more scared than i thought to be losing it this badly in front of someone he disliked hell hed come to me for help he was desperate but you can come to me a federal marshal and tell me because you know ill tell jeanclaude think what you like ms blake we werent on a firstname basis anymore id hit it on the head a big bad vamp checks your church out you arent vampire enough to smoke him out and you come to me to jeanclaude and all his immoral power structure you come to the very people you say you hate he stood up the crime that sally is accused of happened less than twentyfour hours after he it they came to my church i do not think that is a coincidence im not lying about the second order of execution malcolm its in my desk drawer right now with a drivers license picture of the vampire in question he sat back down what name is on it why so you can warn them id almost said her because it was another female vamp my people are not perfect ms blake but i believe that another vampire has come to town and is framing them why why would someone do that i dont know no one has bothered jeanclaude or his people i know malcolm said without a true master a true bloodoathed mystically connected master your congregation are just sheep waiting for the wolves to come get them jeanclaude said as much a month ago yeah he did i thought at first that it was one of the new vampires who has joined jeanclaude one of the ones from europe but it is not it is something more powerful than that or it is a group of vampires combining their powers through their masters marks i have felt such power only once before when i asked he shook his head we are forbidden to speak of it on penalty of death only if they contact us directly can we break this silence it sounds like youve already been contacted i said he shook his head again they are tampering with me and my people because technically i am outside normal vampire law did jeanclaude report to the council that my church had not bloodoathed any of its followers i nodded yes he did he put his big hands over his face and leaned over his knees almost as if he felt faint he whispered i feared as much okay malcolm youre moving too fast for me here what does jeanclaudes reporting to the council have to do with some group of powerful vamps messing with your church he looked at me but his eyes had gone gray with worry tell him what i have told you he will understand but i dont i have until new years day to give jeanclaude my answer about the bloodoathing he has been generous and patient but there are those among the council that are neither of those things i had hoped they would be proud of what i had accomplished i thought it would please them but i fear now that the council is not ready to see my brave new world of free will free will is for humans malcolm the preternatural community is about control he stood again you have almost complete discretion on how the warrant is executed anita will you use some of that discretion to find the truth before you kill my followers i stood up i cant guarantee anything i would not ask that i ask only that you look for the truth before it is too late for sally and my other follower whose name you will not even give me he sighed i have not sent sally running out of town why would i warn the other you came through the door knowing sally was in trouble im not helping you figure the other bad guy out it is a man then i just looked at him glad that i could give full eye contact it had always been so hard to do the tough stare back when i couldnt look a vamp in the eyes he straightened his shoulders as if only now aware that he was slumping you wont even give me that will you please tell jeanclaude what i have told you i should have come to you immediately i thought morals kept me from running to the very power structure i despise but it wasnt morals it was sin the sin of pride i hope that my pride has not cost more of my followers their lives he went for the door i called after him malcolm he turned how big an emergency is this big will a couple of hours make a difference he thought about it perhaps why do you ask i wont be seeing jeanclaude tonight i just wanted to know if i should call him give him a headsup yes by all means give him his headsup he frowned at me why would you not see your master tonight anita arent you living with him actually no i stay over at his place about half the week but ive got my own place still will you be killing more of my kindred tonight i shook my head then you will raise my other colder brethren whose blissful death will you disturb tonight anita whose zombie will you raise so some human can get their inheritance or a wife can be consoled no zombies tonight i said i was too puzzled by his attitude on the zombies to be insulted id never heard a vampire claim any kinship with zombies or ghouls or anything but other vamps then what will keep you from your masters arms ive got a date not that its any of your business but not a date with jeanclaude or asher i shook my head your wolf king then richard i shook my head again for whom would you abandon those three anita ah your leopard king micah wrong again i am amazed that you are answering my questions so am i actually i think its because you keep calling me a whore and i think i want to rub your face in it what the fact that you are a whore his face showed nothing when he said it i knew you couldnt do it i said do what ms blake i knew you couldnt play nice long enough to get my help i knew if i kept at you youd get snotty and mean he gave a small bow just from the neck i told you ms blake my sin is pride and whats my sin malcolm do you want me to insult you ms blake i just want to hear you say it why why not i said very well your sin is lust ms blake as it is the sin of your master and all his vampires i shook my head and felt that unpleasant smile curl my lips the smile that left my eyes cold and usually meant i was well and truly pissed thats not my sin malcolm not the one nearest and dearest to my heart and what would your sin be ms blake wrath malcolm its wrath are you saying ive made you angry im always angry malcolm you just gave me a target to focus it on do you envy anyone ms blake i thought about it then shook my head not really no i will not ask about sloth you work entirely too hard for that to be an issue you are not greedy nor a glutton are you prideful sometimes i said wrath lust and pride then i nodded i guess if were keeping score oh someone is keeping score ms blake never doubt that im christian too malcolm do you worry about getting into heaven ms blake it was such an odd question that i answered it i did for a while but my faith still makes my cross glow my prayers still have the power to chase the evil things away god hasnt forsaken me its just that all the rightwing fundamentalist christians want to believe he has ive seen evil malcolm real evil and you arent that he smiled and it was gentle and almost embarrassed have i come to you for absolution ms blake i dont think im the one to give you absolution i would like a priest to hear my sins before i die ms blake but none will come near me they are holy and the very trappings of their calling will burst into flames in my presence not true the holy items only go off if the true believer panics or if you try vampire powers on them he blinked at me and i realized his eyes held unshed tears shimmering in the overhead lights is this true ms blake i promise it is his attitude was beginning to make me afraid for him i didnt want to be afraid for malcolm i had enough people in my life that i cared for enough to worry about i did not need to add the undead billy graham to my list do you know any priests that might be willing to hear a very long confession i might though i dont know if theyre allowed to give you absolution since technically in the eyes of the church youre already dead you have ties to a lot of the religious community malcolm surely one of the other leaders would be willing i do not want to ask them anita i do not want them to know my sins i would ratherhe hesitated then spoke but i was pretty sure it wasnt the sentence he started to use quietly i would rather it be done quietly why the sudden need for confession and absolution i am still a believer ms blake being a vampire has not changed that i wish to die absolved of my sins why are you expecting to die tell jeanclaude what i have told you about the stranger or strangers in my church tell him about my desire for a priest to hear my confession he will understand malcolm he kept walking but stopped with his hand on the door i take back what i said ms blake i am not sorry i came i am only sorry i did not come days ago with that he walked out and closed the door softly behind him i sat down at my desk and called jeanclaude i had no idea what was going on but something was up something big something bad chapter two i called jeanclaudes strip club guilty pleasures first hed gone back to being manager there since he had enough vampires to help run the other businesses of course i didnt get jeanclaude on the phone first thing one of the employees answered and informed me that he was on stage i told them id call back and yes it was important so have him call me asap i hung up and stared at the phone what was my sweetie doing while i sat in my office a few miles away i pictured all that long dark hair the pale perfection of his face and i was thinking too hard i could feel him feel the woman in his arms as she clung to him he held her face between his hands to keep the kiss from getting out of hand to keep her from shredding her own lips against the sharp points of his fangs i felt her eagerness saw inside her mind that she wanted him to take her here and now on the stage in front of everyone she didnt care she just wanted him jeanclaude fed on that desire that need he fed on it as other vampires fed on blood halfnaked waiters came onto the stage to help pry her gently from him they helped her back to her seat while she cried cried for what she could not have she had paid for a kiss and shed gotten that but jeanclaude always left you wanting more i should know he spoke like some seductive wind through my mind ma petite what are you doing here thinking too hard i whispered to the empty office but he heard me he smiled with at least two different types of lipstick smeared around his mouth you entered my mind while i fed the ardeur and it did not rise in you you have been practicing yeah it felt weird saying it out loud in the empty dim office especially because i could hear the hum and murmur of the club around him the women clamoring to be next waving their cash for him to choose them i must choose a few more then we may talk use the phone i said im at the office he laughed and the sound echoed through me shivered down my skin made things low in my body tighten i drew away from him closed the metaphysical links between us enough so i wouldnt get sucked back into his act then i tried to think about something else anything else if id known enough about baseball id have thought about that but that wasnt my sport jeanclaude didnt strip but he did feed off the crowds sexual energy in another century hed have been called an incubus a demon that fed on lust the thought almost pulled me back to him but i thought think about legal stuff the law something in this century he just had to put a disclaimer in several prominent places in the club stating warning vampire powers will be part of the entertainment there are no exceptions by being inside the club you give permission for the legal use of vampire powers upon yourself and anyone with you the new laws that had helped make vamps legal hadnt really caught up to everything they could do you couldnt do oneonone mind control though mass hypnosis was okay because the call wasnt as deep or as complete oneonone mind control meant the vampire could call people out of their beds force them to come to the vampire mass hypnosis didnt work that way or that was the theory a vamp couldnt drink blood without getting the donors permission first you couldnt use vamp powers to get sex beyond that the law stated that you had to notify humans in your place of business and beyond that the law got really vague the last nono about no vamp powers for sex had been added only last year it was treated like a daterape drug for legal purposes except that a vampire convicted of its use was sentenced to death not trial or jail malcolm was right about the double standard vampires were people under the law but they didnt get all the rights that the rest of the american citizenry got of course most of the rest of the citizens couldnt tear iron bars from their sockets and use mind control to wipe peoples memories theyd been deemed too dangerous for jail after a few bloody and very messy escapes so my job as vamp executioner had been invented i dont mean to make it sound like i was the first one with the job i wasnt the ones who took the job first were people who had been slaying vampires when they were still illegal so you could kill them on sight with no legal problems the government had actually yanked the credentials of some people whod had a hard time understanding that they had to wait for a warrant of execution before killing anyone theyd finally had to put one of the oldstyle vamp hunters in jail he was still in jail five years later that had sent the message they wanted id come in at the tail end of the old school but mostly i had never killed a vampire that hadnt been covered by legal paperwork i glanced at my watch i still had enough time to run home change into date clothes get nathaniel and make the movie the phone rang and i jumped nervous who me hello i made it a question ma petite what is wrong that smooth voice eased over the phone like a hand caressing down my skin it wasnt sexual this time it was calming hed picked up my nervousness in the middle of feeding the ardeur hed missed it malcolm came to see me about the bloodoathing yes and no i said why yes and no ma petite i told him what malcolm had told me somewhere in the middle of the talk he shut down the metaphysical link between us shut it down so hard and so tight that i couldnt feel anything from him we could share each others dreams but if we shielded hard enough we could shut each other out but it took work and we didnt do it often lately the silence when i finished was so complete that i had to ask jeanclaude you still there i cant even hear you breathing i do not have to breathe ma petite as well you know its just a saying i said he sighed then and the sound of it shivered over my skin this time it was sexual he could use some of his powers on me and still shield like a son of a bitch i couldnt when i shielded that tight i was cut off from a lot of my abilities stop that dont try to distract me with your voice what is it that malcolm cant speak of without being killed you will not like my answer ma petite just tell me i cannot tell you i am under the same vow as malcolm as all the vampires everywhere are all vampires oui what or who could force an oath like that from all of you i thought about it for a second then answered my own question the vampire council of course your ruling body oui so you arent going to tell me anything about whats happening i cannot ma petite well that is just frustrating as hell you have no idea how frustrating ma petite i am your human servant doesnt that make me privy to all your secrets ah but this is not my secret what does that mean not your secret it means ma petite that i cannot discuss this with you unless i am given permission how do you get permission pray that i am never able to answer that question ma petite what does that mean it means that if i am able to speak about this openly then we will have been contacted and we do not wish to be contacted by this this a thing not a person i will say no more i knew i could push against his shields and sometimes crack them i thought about it and it was as if he read my mind and maybe he had please ma petite do not push me on this how bad is it bad but i think it is not our bad i believe malcolm will come to vampire justice for his crimes whether we do it or not so whatever or whoever this is is hunting malcolm perhaps it is certainly he and his congregation that have the attention would whoever this is really frame malcolms people and set up me and the other vamp executioners to do their dirty work perhaps this legal status is very new i know some of the older levels of vampire politics are puzzled by it perhaps some decided to use it to their own advantage i had a case of that just two months ago where one vamp framed another for a murder of a woman i dont want to kill someone whos innocent is any vampire truly innocent dont give me that fundamentalist shit jeanclaude we are monsters ma petite you know that i believe that yeah but you dont want us to go back to the bad ol days and have it be open season on you guys no i do not want that there was something in the dry tone of his voice youre shielding so hard i cant tell what youre feeling you only shield this hard when youre scared really scared i am afraid that you will pick from my mind what i am forbidden to tell you there is no how do you say fudging on this rule of law for us if you learned this secret even in my mind by accident it might be grounds to slaughter both of us what the hell is this secret i have told you all i can do i need to sleep at the circus of the damned with you tonight do we need to circle the wagons he was quiet again then finally said no no you dont sound sure i think it would be a very bad thing for you to sleep with me tonight ma petite sex and dreams are the times when shields drop and you might learn what we cannot afford for you to know are you saying that im not going to see you until this is resolved no no ma petite but not tonight i will think about our situation and decide a course of action by tomorrow night course of action what are the possibilities i dare not say damn it jeanclaude talk to me i was a little angry but the tight feeling in my stomach was mostly fear if all goes well you will never learn this secret but its something that the council could have sent to kill malcolm and destroy his church i cannot answer your questions wont you mean non ma petite cannot has it not occurred to you that this could be a ploy of our enemies to give them an excuse under vampire law to destroy us i suddenly felt cold no it hadnt occurred to me think upon it ma petite you mean they send something so that if you tell me about it then it or they can kill us you think someone on the council is counting on the fact that were so tightly bound metaphysically that you cant keep a secret this big from me and if i find out it wont just be malcolm that theyll kill but us too it is a thought ma petite a very twistyturny underhanded thought vampires are a very twistyturny lot ma petite as for underhanded they would think of it as clever they can think what they like but its a cowards way oh no ma petite we do not want anyone on the council to put their full attention in a challenge to me that would also be a very bad thing so what i meet nathaniel for our date and i pretend we havent had this talk something like that yes i cant pretend that i dont know something big and bad has come to town if it is not hunting us be grateful and do not pick at it i beg you anita for the sake of all you love do not seek an answer to this riddle hed called me by my real name it was a bad sign i cant just pretend nothing is happening jeanclaude arent you even going to tell me to be more careful than normal you are always careful ma petite i never worry that any bad thing will catch you unaware it is one of your charms for me that you can take care of yourself even against something bad enough to scare you and malcolm this badly i trust you ma petite do you trust me that was a loaded question but finally i said yeah you do not sound certain i trust you but i dont like secrets and i do not trust the council and i have a warrant of execution on a vamp who is probably innocent ive got a second warrant coming by tomorrow they are both members of the church of eternal life i may not agree with malcolms philosophy but his members usually stay away from killing offenses if i get a warrant of execution for a third member of malcolms church this week then its a frame the law as written doesnt give me much wiggle room jeanclaude actually it gives you a great deal of wiggle room ma petite yeah yeah but if i dont use the warrant in a timely manner i may have to answer to my superiors im a federal marshal now and they can call me on the carpet and make me explain my actions have they done that to any of the new marshals yet not yet but if ive got a warrant and other murders with the same mo keep happening ill need an explanation as to why i havent killed sally hunter the police whatever the flavor wont accept its a secret as an answer if people keep dying how many humans are dead one victim per warrant but if i hesitate on the warrants will whoever this is escalate the violence and force my hand possibly possibly i said oui you know this could get ugly really fast you have used your discretionary powers to get warrants vacated in the past you saved our avery he is not our avery he would be yours if you would let him there was the faintest of tones in his voice are you jealous of avery seabrook hes like only two years dead not jealous in the way you mean then how it was my blood he drank when he took oath to me ma petite but it is not me he watches i should be his master but i think if we both ordered him to do opposite things i am not certain i would win the contest are you saying that my hold on him is stronger than yours i am saying it is a possibility it was my turn for silence i was a necromancer not just an animator of zombies but a real true necromancer i could control more than just zombies we were still trying to figure out how much more malcolm said he wasnt sure which of us was victim and which victimizer anymore he is foolish but not a fool i think i understood that i said then i will be plain go on your date with nathaniel celebrate your almostanniversary this is not our fight not yet perhaps not ever do not make it our fight for it could be the death of everyone we love oh thanks and with that cheery message ill have no trouble going to the movies and enjoying myself truthfully i felt a little silly about the whole date tonight nathaniel wanted to celebrate our anniversary the trouble was we couldnt agree on when our relationship changed from friends to more than friends so hed chosen a date and called it our almostanniversary if i hadnt been too embarrassed id have picked the first time we had intercourse as the anniversary date i just couldnt figure out how to explain to friends why that date jeanclaude sighed and it wasnt sexual this time just frustrated i think i wanted this almostanniversary to go well tonight ma petite not just for your sake and nathaniels but if he can work you through your reluctance to be romantic then the rest of us might have a chance to celebrate special days with you as well and what date would you pick as our anniversary i asked in a voice thick with sarcasm the first night we made love for that is the night that you truly let yourself love me damn it youve thought about this why does sentiment make you so uncomfortable ma petite id have loved to answer him but i couldnt truthfully i wasnt sure i dont know and im sorry that im such a pain in the ass im sorry that i dont let you and the rest of the guys do all the romantic gestures you want im sorry that its so hard to be in love with me now you are being too hard on yourself im scared im angry im frustrated and i dont want to fight with you because its not your fault but now thanks to what you just said i dont feel like i can cancel the date with nathaniel tonight i thought about what id just said you bastard you did this on purpose you manipulated me into keeping the date with nathaniel perhaps but you are his first real girlfriend and he is twenty it is important to him this night hes dating me not you oui but if all the men in your life are happy you are happier and it makes my life easier that made me laugh you bastard and i did not lie ma petite i would love to celebrate once a year the first night you came to me if your first attempt at a modest celebration fails then the larger more romantic gestures will never come to pass i want them to come to pass i sighed and leaned my head against the phone receiver i heard him saying ma petite ma petite are you still there i put the receiver back to my mouth and said im here not happy but im here ill go but there wont be time to change now i am sure that nathaniel would much rather you go on this almostanniversary than that you are dressed a certain way spoken from the man who most often dresses me in fetish wear not as often as i would like before i could think of a comeback he said je taime and hung up i love you in french and he got off the phone while the getting was good chapter three i was running too late to even go home first a phone call and nathaniel agreed to just meet me at the theatre there was no reproach in his voice no complaint i think he was afraid to complain afraid id use it as an excuse to cancel the almostanniversary he was probably right i was dating at last count six men when youre dating that many people anniversaries seem hypocritical i mean wasnt an anniversary something you did for your special someone i still hadnt worked my way through the squirming discomfort of dating this many men i still couldnt get rid of the idea that with six men to choose from you couldnt have a special sweetie i was still struggling with the idea that they could all be special when i was alone not with any of them not looking at them or all covered in their metaphysical stuff i could be all uncomfortable and feel stupid i felt stupid and grumpy right up to the moment that i saw nathaniel standing just inside the doors waiting for me he was five foot six and a half now hed grown half an inch in the last month at twenty twentyone in the spring he was growing into the broad shoulders filling out in the way that most men do at a slightly earlier age i actually got carded more at clubs than he did now which irritated me and pleased him but it wasnt height that made me stop and stare i stood in the midst of the friday night crowd hurrying around me and for just a few minutes i forgot that something bad enough to scare jeanclaude and malcolm had come to town yeah jeanclaude had told me we were safe but still it wasnt like me to be careless in a crowd nathaniel wore a leather trench coat and a matching fedora the hat and coat hid most of him and still managed to emphasize the body underneath it was like hiding and asking for attention at the same time hed added the hat to his winter gear because without it he had gotten recognized a few times customers from guilty pleasures had spotted him as brandon his stage name once we covered the hair it didnt happen again his hair was in some kind of tight braid so that it looked like his auburn hair was cut nice and standard short it was illusion his hair fell to his ankles totally impractical but god it was pretty it wasnt just the standard ooh isnt he pretty that made me stop it was that suddenly in his new leather trench coat and hat with his hair all covered he looked grownup he was seven years younger than me and id felt vaguely like a child molester when he first hit my radar id fought long and hard to keep him out of the boyfriend box but in the end it hadnt worked now i looked at him like a stranger might and realized that the only one who still thought he might be a child was me standing there looking like a fetish version of sam spade he didnt look twenty he looked very over twentyone someone bumped me and that made me jump shit that was too careless i started moving dressed in my own black leather trench coat but no hat i didnt do hats unless it was freaking freezing even with christmas only weeks away it wasnt that cold st louis in the wintertime freezing one day nearly fifty the next my trench coat was unbuttoned from the waist up only belted in place it was colder that way but i could still reach my gun going armed in winter was always full of fun choices like that he spotted me before id gotten through the outer doors he gave me that smile that made his whole face glow so happy to see me once i would have bitched but i was too busy fighting off my own version of the same smile one of my other boyfriends said i hated being in love and he was right it always felt so stupid like your insurance rates should go up because youre impaired romantically handicapped the face under the hat was too pretty to be handsome he was beautiful not handsome apparently no matter how tall he got or how much he muscled up that wasnt going to change but it wasnt a delicate face the way jeanclaudes was or micahs was it was stronger boned than that higher cheekboned something a touch more male in his facei couldnt put my finger on it but somethingand when he looked full at you you never thought feminine but always male had that changed in the last few months had i not noticed that or had it always been like this and i just was so determined to marginalize him that i couldnt let his face be more masculine than jeanclaudes or micahs did i still equate strength and being a grownup to being male me of all people surely not his smile had faded around the edges whats wrong i smiled and went to hug him just wondering if im paying enough attention to you he hugged me back but not like he meant it he pulled me back so he could see my face why would you say that i finally let myself look full into his eyes tonight i was so distracted by him that id avoided his eyes almost like he was a vampire with a gaze and i was some tourist human his eyes were lavenderreally truly the color of lilacs but it wasnt just the color they were large and perfect and crowned his face with that final touch that just made your heart hurt too beautiful simply too beautiful he touched my face anita whats wrong i shook my head i dont know and i didnt i was attracted to nathaniel but this was excessive i looked away so i wouldnt be staring directly into his face what the hell was wrong with me tonight he tried to draw me into a kiss and i pulled away a kiss would undo me his hands dropped away from me his voice held the first hint of anger it took a lot to make nathaniel angry its just a movie anita im not even asking for sex just a movie i glanced up at him id rather go home and have sex which is why i asked for the movie he said i frowned at him what are you embarrassed about being seen with me in public no i let my face show how much it shocked me that hed even have to ask his face was very serious hurt ready to be angry then what is it you wont even kiss me i tried to explain i forgot everything but you for a minute he smiled his eyes not quite catching up to it is that so bad in my line of work yes i watched him try to understand he was beautiful but i could look at him without being stupidfaced i moved closer to the smell of the new leather coat i hugged him and after a seconds hesitation he hugged me back i buried my face against the scent of leather and him sweet clean and underneath that the smell of vanilla i knew now that it was only partially him that some of that sweet scent was bath products and cologne but the scent he wore didnt smell so lusciously of vanilla on anyone elses skin one of those tricks of skin chemistry that changes the scent of the really good perfumes we need to get seats he whispered it against my hair i drew away from him frowning again i shook my head and that only partially cleared it i reached into my coat pocket for a small padded velvet bag i opened it and dug the padding out until a cross spilled into my hand it lay there silver and inert id half expected it to glow to show me that some vamp was messing with me but it lay there innocent and untouched what is wrong anita nathaniel looked worried now i think someones messing with me the cross isnt showing it youre scrumptious nathaniel but its not like me to lose focus this badly in public you think mommie dearest is trying again he asked mommie dearest was my nickname for the head of the vampire council the creator of vampire culture the last time shed messed with me a cross had burned into my hand and had to be pried out by a doctor i had a permanent scar in my left palm from it up to now the cross in a bag or under my bed had kept her at bay i dont know maybe there arent that many vamps that can get through your psychic shields he said i slipped the chain over my neck the silver glittering against the thin silk sweater you sure thats enough cloth between your skin and the cross no but i dont think its mommie he sighed and tried to keep the frown off his face do you need to skip the movie no jeanclaude said wed be safe tonight okay nathaniel said but i dont like the way you said that whats gone wrong now lets find seats and ill tell you what little i know i said we managed to find two seats in the back row so my back was to a wall and i could see the rest of the theatre i wasnt being paranoid or at least not more paranoid than usual i always sat in the back row if i could manage it by the time the previews had finished id told him everything i knew which wasnt much and thats all jeanclaude would tell you yep way too mysterious understatement i said the music came up the lights went down and for the life of me i couldnt remember what movie wed decided to see i didnt ask nathaniel because it might have hurt his feelings and besides in moments the question would answer itself chapter four three hours and some change later i knew the movie was the new version of king kong nathaniel liked the movie better than i did the special effects were great but i was way ready for the ape to die long before he did which was a shame since some of the movie was amazing my cross hadnt glowed once and i hadnt been more than normally fascinated with nathaniel normally fascinated meant that sitting in date seats in the dark was intimate and fun but it didnt make me lose control i thought about letting my hands wander and with the other men in my life i might have but nathaniel had less inhibitions than most i might start something i wouldnt want to finish in the theatre besides you cant watch the movie and grope your boyfriend or at least i cant one thing i had to do after a movie that long was take a restroom break riddle me this why is it that there is never a line for the mens room but the womens always seems to have one i did my bit in line then finally got into the stall at least it was clean the noise died away and let me know i was alone long damn line i tucked and buckled everything back into place one of the things i liked about shoulder holsters as opposed to carrying on the hip is that you dont run the risk of dumping the gun in the toilet inner pants holsters that dont go through a belt loop are some of the most precarious for bathroom use guns unlike pagers do not float i smoothed the stockings in place glad that i wasnt having to struggle with pantyhose anymore garter and stockings really are more comfortable the bathroom was empty as i pushed the door open i started for the sinks when i saw the box sitting across one of them anita was printed on the box in black block letters that little dickens how had nathaniel gotten in here to leave a present if hed been caught in the ladies restroom it could have gone badly i washed and dried my hands then opened the box i had to fold back layers of white tissue paper before i found a mask it was white and would have covered everything but the eyes from forehead to chin it was utterly plain a blank white face staring up at me why would he buy me this if it had been leather and fetishlooking i might have guessed something more adventurous on the sexual front but this didnt look like that kind of mask of course i wasnt an expert on that kind of mask so maybe that was what it was for if so he hadnt sold me on the idea i didnt like masks and i was far from comfortable with bondage and submission the fact that i had leanings that way myself hadnt made me like it more on the contrary it scared me more because of it you hate most in others what youre afraid of in yourself i tried to find an expression that was neutral but pleased and walked out carrying the box nathaniel was waiting against the far wall holding both our coats and his hat the leather hat got hot indoors he smiled when he saw me and walked toward me with a quizzical look on his face did someone leave that in the bathroom i showed him that it had my name on it i thought you were trying to surprise me you hate surprises he said my pulse sped up not a lot but a little i moved us so that the wall was at my back i was suddenly looking at the people near us looking hard but everyone looked innocent or at least not guilty couples holding hands families with kids in tow it all looked normal whats in there nathaniel asked a mask i whispered can i see it i nodded he moved the lid and tissue paper while i kept searching the happy moviegoers for evil intent there was a couple staring a little too hard at us but that could be other things it looks like someone started to make a mask and stopped before they finished he said yeah it looks too blank why would someone give you this did you see someone carry this in its a big box anita id have noticed did anyone carry in a biggerthanaverage purse not one big enough to hide this you were standing right there nathaniel you had to see we exchanged a look i didnt see this shit i said low and with feeling someone was messing with you earlier and they messed with me to get inside the bathroom he said did you sense anything i asked he thought about it and finally shook his head no double shit call jeanclaude now he said i nodded and handed him the box so i could use my cell phone nathaniel wrapped the mask back up while i waited for jeanclaude to pick up this time he actually answered his office phone himself i got a present i said what did our pussycat buy you he asked not offended that i hadnt said hello first nathaniel didnt buy it it is not like you to speak in riddles ma petite ask me what it is i said what is it and his voice was sliding into that blankness he did so well a mask what color is it you dont sound surprised i said what color is it ma petite what does that matter it matters white why he let out a breath i hadnt known he was holding and spoke softly and heatedly in french for several minutes until i could get him calmed down enough to speak english to me it is good news and bad ma petite white means they have come to observe us not to harm us i moved so that my hand covered my mouth as i talked i wanted to keep an eye on the drifting crowd but i didnt want some human to overhear what promised to be a tricky conversation but i didnt want to go outside until i found out how much danger we were in the crowd was both a danger and a help most bad guys are reluctant to start cutting people up in a crowd what color would mean harm i asked red okay who is they because i assume this means weve been contacted by the mystery whoever it does so who are they what are they and why the hell this cloakanddagger shit with the mask why not a letter or a phone call i am not certain they would normally have sent the mask to me as master of the city why send it to me then i do not know ma petite he sounded angry and he didnt usually get angry this easily youre scared very i guess we come to the circus tonight after all apologize to nathaniel for this ruining his date with you but oui you must come here we have much to discuss who are these guys jeanclaude the name will mean nothing to you just tell me the harlequin they are the harlequin harlequin you mean like the french clown nothing half so pleasant ma petite come home and i will explain how much more danger are we in the couple was still staring at us the woman nudged the man and he shook his head white means they will observe only this could be the only contact we have with them if we are very very lucky they will watch us then leave why tell us at all if thats all they plan to do because it is our law they may pass through a territory or hunt someone across a territory much as you hunt wicked vampires across state lines but if they are planning to be within an area for more than a few nights then they are bound by law to contact the master of the city so this could be all about malcolm and his church it could you dont believe that it would be too easy ma petite and nothing about the harlequin is ever easy what are they they are the closest thing to police that we vampires have but they are also spies assassins it was they who slew the master of london when he went mad elinore and the other vamps didnt say that because they could not you mean if they had told anyone who killed their master theyd have been killed yes thats crazy they all knew it among themselves oui but not to outsiders and once the harlequin leave town the secrecy takes effect once more so we can talk about them now but later when they leave its forbidden to mention them oui thats insane it is law have i told you recently that some of the vampire laws are stupid you have never put it quite that way well im putting it that way now come home ma petite or better yet come to guilty pleasures i will tell you more of the history of the harlequin when i have you safe with me we should be safe it is a white mask we are expected to act as if there is nothing wrong so i will finish my work night youve fed the ardeur youre done for the night there are still acts to manage and my voice to lend to a microphone fine well be there nathaniel whispered theyre coming over i glanced up to find the couple that had been staring so hard walking toward us they didnt look dangerous and they were definitely human i whispered into the telephone are all the harlequin vamps to my knowledge why weve got a pair of humans walking toward us come to me ma petite and bring nathaniel love ya i said and i you we hung up so i could give my attention to the couple the woman was petite and blond and embarrassed and eager at the same time the man was grumpy or embarrassed youre brandon she said to nathaniel he admitted it and i watched his stage smile come on line he was happy to see her and all the worry was just gone he was on i didnt really have an on face i wasnt really sure what i was supposed to do while strange women came up and said things to my boyfriend but you were on stage too she said turning to me id been recognized as anita blake vampire hunter zombie raiser but never from that one night id gone on stage at guilty pleasures nathaniel had picked me out of the crowd instead of some stranger id agreed to it but i hadnt wanted to do it again i nodded once i felt nathaniel tense beside me i should have just said yes nathaniel worried that i was embarrassed by him and i wasnt it was fine that he was a stripper but it wasnt my gig i was not nearly exhibitionist enough for it id finally persuaded greg to go with me to the club and he was glad he came werent you she turned to the grumpy boyfriend he finally nodded and he wouldnt look at me definitely embarrassed that made two of us none of my clothes had come off on stage but i still didnt like being reminded of it it was so erotic what you did on stage together she said so sensual nathaniel said so glad you enjoyed the show ill be on stage tomorrow night her face glowed with happiness i know i check the website but it doesnt mention your friend she nodded at me greg wants to know when youll be back dont you greg she was looking at me when she said it what i thought in my head was when hell freezes over i dont know what i would have said out loud because nathaniel saved us you know how you had to persuade greg to come to the club she nodded i had to persuade her to get on stage really she said really nathaniel said greg finally spoke was it your first time on stage yes i said wondering how to get out of this conversation without being rude id have been rude but nathaniel wouldnt be bad for business and rude just wasnt one of the things that he did much it didnt seem like your first time and he looked at me then the look was the kind you never want a strange man to give you too much heat too much sex i looked at nathaniel the look said clearly end this conversation or i will nathaniel understood the look hed seen it enough im glad you enjoyed the show and i hope to see you both again tomorrow have a wonderful night he started to move away and i followed greg moved closer to us will you be there tomorrow night nathaniel smiled and said of course he shook his head not you her whats her name i didnt want to give him my name dont ask me why but i didnt nathaniel came to the rescue again nicky i gave him a look but my back was to them so they couldnt see it greg said nicky nathaniel took my arm and kept us moving balancing the box in his other hand when shes on stage he said when will nicky be at the club never i said and walked faster nathaniel kept up with me when we were clear of his our fans his face showed dread dreading the fight that was coming chapter five i wasnt so angry that i forgot to check out the crowd as we moved but i had to force the anger down to be able to see straight i was actually more embarrassed than angry which meant the fight could be all the worse for it i hated being embarrassed and usually masked it with anger even knowing thats what i did didnt change the fact that i did it it just let me know why i was angry i actually waited until we were in the parking lot to say nicky what the fuck kind of name is that one id remember he said i jerked away from him hard enough that he almost dropped the box im never going to be on stage again i dont need a stage name you dont want them to figure out your real name do you i frowned at him im in the news enough theyll figure it out eventually maybe but if you give them a stage name to remember theyll think of you as a stripper not as a federal marshal youre embarrassed enough that detective arnet saw us on stage that night yes and im still waiting for her to tell the rest of the police that she and i work with but she hasnt he said i shook my head she cant admit she saw you without admitting she was there and why he said cops go to strip clubs all the time i said but she didnt go to see strippers she went to see me that stopped me made me turn and stare at him what do you mean she came to the club on a night you werent there since youve avoided the club as much as possible thats a lot of the time can we have this conversation in the car he had a point i unlocked the car and we climbed in wheres the other car i had micah drop me off so hell have the car if he needs it i knew youd drive me home it made sense i turned on the car so the heater would start working i finally realized it was a little chilly my anger had kept me warm even with my coat flapping open what do you mean arnet came to the club she paid to have a private dance i stared at him she did what detective jessica arnet worked on the regional preternatural investigation team rpit for short it was the branch of local police that i worked with the most id known she had a crush on nathaniel but id been so busy trying not to admit that i was living with a stripper that id kept him too much a secret until i brought him as a date to a wedding that arnet was at then the secret was out and she was mad at me for not telling her we were an item sooner she seemed to feel like id let her make a fool of herself she hadnt made a fool of herself but she had come to guilty pleasures for the first time that one night that nathaniel got me on stage she was now convinced that i was abusing nathaniel chain someone up on stage and hit them with a flogger a few times and people think youre abusing them of course the flogger had been nathaniel and jeanclaudes idea a part of nathaniels regular show apparently what id done next had been all me and nathaniel i had marked him bitten him hard enough to bleed him on stage it had been the first time id voluntarily marked him like that not just because the ardeur got out of control but because he liked it and i liked it and id promised arnet was convinced that i was madame de sade and nathaniel was my victim id tried explaining that nathaniel was only a victim when he wanted to be but she hadnt bought it id been convinced she would tell the other cops and out me badly living with a twentyyearold stripper with juvenile arrests for prostitution was bad enough but getting on stage myself well that would have been oh hell bad how private a dance did she get he grinned are you jealous i thought about it for a second then had to say yeah i guess so thats so sweet he said just tell me about arnet she didnt want the dance she wanted to talk he seemed to think about it for a second then added okay she wanted the dance a lot but she was too uncomfortable with me to ask for what she wanted we just talked about i said she tried to get me to admit that you were abusing me she wanted me to leave you and save myself why didnt you tell me you were already worried about arnet telling zerbrowski and the other cops what shed seen you were in the middle of some messy murder investigation i didnt figure you needed the hassle and i handled it has she been back he shook his head tell me next time okay if you want i want she cant tell on you because shed be afraid youd tell them that she has a thing for your stripper boyfriend she doesnt want to admit that what bothered her the most about the show you and i did is that she liked it i didnt think arnet swung that way i said neither did she i looked at him studied that face there was a look on it now just say it the look in your eyes just say it you hate most in others what you dont like in yourself huh what i thought something almost identical to that earlier tonight what about i shook my head do you really think giving greg and his girlfriend a stage name for me will keep them from making the connection to anita blake yeah i do theyll think of you as a stripper named nicky and thats it you wont be anything or any more to them than that strangely disturbing but why nicky why that name because i knew id remember it remember it why because it was my name when i did porn i blinked at him what nicky brandon is the name i used when i did movies i did the long blink the one that meant i was thinking hard or too surprised to think you gave me your pornography name half of it he said i didnt know what to say was i supposed to be flattered or insulted i declare this fight over until i figure out if were actually fighting trust me anita this isnt a fight then how come im angry lets see theres some bad vamps in town messing with us you always hate it when fans recognize brandon the stripper but tonight for the first time you got recognized from the one time you went on stage if youre embarrassed by my job youre even more embarrassed that anyone would think you could be a stripper im not embarrassed about your job yeah you are he said i started the car i am not then next time you introduce me to your friends dont call me a dancer call me an exotic dancer i opened my mouth closed it and started backing up i wouldnt do it he was right id keep introducing him as simply a dancer do you want me to introduce you like that no but i want you not to be ashamed of what i do im not ashamed of you or your job fine have it your way but his tone said clearly that he was letting me win but that i was wrong and hadnt won anything i hated when he did that he just stopped fighting in the middle of the fight not because hed lost but just because he didnt want to fight anymore how do you fight with someone who wont fight answer you dont the real trouble was he was right i was embarrassed about his job i shouldnt have been but i was when he was a teenager hed been a runaway and a prostitute and on drugs hed been off drugs for nearly four years hed been out of the life since he was sixteen hed done porn and i knew that but i didnt dwell on it i assumed hed stopped doing the movies about the same time he stopped hooking but i wasnt sure of that i hadnt really asked had i he was a wereleopard which meant he couldnt catch any sexually transmitted disease that helped me ignore his past the lycanthropy killed everything that could injure the host body it kept him healthy it made it so that i could pretend he hadnt had more sexual partners than i wanted to know about i was trapped at the light across from st louis bread company when i said want to hear what jeanclaude told me about the mask if you want to tell me he sounded mad im sorry that im not completely comfortable with your job okay well at least you admit it the light changed and i eased forward wed had two inches of snow and everyone here forgot how to drive in it i dont like to admit when im uncomfortable you know that tell me what jeanclaude said i told him so they may be here for malcolm and his church maybe im surprised you didnt demand more answers on the phone i didnt know what the happy couple wanted jeanclaude said were not in danger so i hung up its not my fault that they recognized us you they recognized you fine they recognized me he was back to being mad again im sorry nathaniel im really sorry that wasnt fair no youre right if we hadnt been out together they probably wouldnt have spotted you i am not embarrassed to be seen with you in public you hate it when fans recognize me i thought i was pretty cool when that woman passed you her phone number at dinner when you were out with micah and me she waited until you went to the bathroom and thats supposed to make me feel better i turned onto and headed toward the city she didnt want to intrude on our date she thought you and micah were escorts and that i was paying you for the evening the last time she saw me thats what i was doing for a living anita i know i know she passed you her number because she wanted to see you again and the old number wasnt working youre right she was polite about it i told her i was on a datedate and she was embarrassed i still remembered the woman shed been slender and elegant and old enough to be nathaniels mother thanks to jeanclaude i knew clothes and shed been wearing expensive ones the jewelry had been understated but very nice she was one of those women who headed charity balls and sat on committees for the art museum and shed been hiring male prostitutes young enough to be her son i think what bothered me about her was that she didnt look like someone who would hire an escort he finished for me yeah i had a lot of different kinds of customers anita i figured that did you or did you try never to think about it okay the latter i cant change my past anita i didnt ask you to but you want me to quit stripping i never said that youre embarrassed by it though for gods sake nathaniel let it go im embarrassed about being up on stage myself im embarrassed that i fed on you in public i gripped the steering wheel so tight it hurt when i fed the ardeur off you that night i fed off the entire audience i didnt mean to but i fed on their lust i felt how much they enjoyed the show and i fed on it and you didnt have to feed again for twentyfour hours jeanclaude took my ardeur and shared it around among you guys yes but he thinks that one of the reasons he was able to do that is that you fed off the crowd and me i loved that you marked me in front of the crowd you know how much i loved it are you saying that if i hadnt gone up on stage and accidentally fed from the crowd the ardeur would have gotten out of control in the middle of that serial killer case maybe i thought about that for a second as i drove i thought about the ardeur going out of control in a van full of cops mobile reserve cops our answer to swat i thought about the ardeur getting out of control while i was in a nest of vampires that had killed over ten people if thats true then why didnt jeanclaude try to get me down to the club again hes offered ive refused yeah nathaniel said why tell me now because im mad at you he said he lowered his head on top of the box in his lap because im mad that our date is ruined im mad that some metaphysical crap is going to ruin our almostanniversary i didnt plan this i said no but your life is always like this do you have any idea how hard it is to have a normal date with you if you dont like it you dont have to stay in it the moment i said it i wished i hadnt but i didnt take it back do you mean that he asked in a low careful voice no i said no i dont mean it im just not used to you picking at me thats usually richards job dont compare me with him i dont deserve that no you dont richard zeeman had once been my fiancé but it hadnt lasted id broken up with him when i saw him eat someone he was the head of the local werewolf pack hed broken up with me when he couldnt handle that i was more comfortable with the monsters than he was at the moment we were lovers and he was finally letting me feed the ardeur off him i was his girlfriend in the preternatural community lupa to his ulfric and he wasnt shopping to replace me in that part of his life he was shopping for a completely human woman to replace me in the part of his life where he was a mildmannered junior high science teacher he wanted kids and a life that didnt include full moons and killer zombies i didnt blame him completely if id had an option for a normal life i might have taken it of course richard really didnt have the option either there was no cure for lycanthropy but he was going to divide his life into pieces and try to keep all the pieces from finding out about the other parts sounded hard hell sounded like a recipe for disaster but it wasnt my life and so far he was just dating people if he got serious about someone else then wed see how i felt about being the other woman you missed the turn anita nathaniel said i cursed and braked too hard in the thin snow i got the jeep under control then let us coast past our exit id turn around you could always turn around sorry i said thinking about richard he tried for neutral and failed yeah my fault i guess i brought him up whats with the tone i asked i turned into a section of town that was in the middle of being gentrified but hadnt quite made it yet but we were headed back toward the riverfront if richard were a stripper would you be embarrassed by him too drop this nathaniel i mean it or what there was that first prickling run of energy over my skin he was angry enough that it was making his beast peek out youre picking on me tonight nathaniel i dont need that i believe that you love me anita but you love me by hiding from what i am i need you to accept who i am i do you tell arnet that im not your victim but you wont tie me up during sex you wont abuse me dont start this again i said anita the bondage is part of who i am it makes me feel safe and good this was one of the reasons id fought so long and hard to stay out of nathaniels love life i did some stuff nails teeth and i enjoyed it but there were limits to my comfort level and hed been trying to push me past those limits in the last few weeks id worried from the beginning that he wouldnt be happy with someone who was less into the bondage scene than he was and that was exactly what was happening in some ways you make me feel better about myself than anyone ever has anita but you also make me feel bad about myself you make me feel like an evil freak because of what i want i found a parking spot just down the street from guilty pleasuress glowing neon sign it was unusual to find parking this close to the club on a weekend parallel parking is not my best thing so i concentrated on that while part of me thought furiously about what to say to him i finally got us parked and turned off the car the silence was thicker than i wanted it to be i turned as far as the seat belt would allow and looked at him he stared out the window away from me i dont want to make you feel bad about yourself nathaniel i love you damn it he nodded then turned and looked at me the streetlight glittered on tears im terrified that im going to drive you away my therapist says that im either a full partner in the relationship or im not full partners ask for their needs to be met truthfully id thought his therapist would be on my side but bdsm was no longer considered an illness it was just another alternative lifestyle damn it i want you to get what you need out of our out of us im not asking for that much anita just tie me up while we have sex then do what we would have done anyway nothing else i leaned over and brushed the tears from his cheeks its not the tying up nathaniel its that once i say yes to that whats next and dont tell me there isnt a next tie me up make love to me and well go from there thats what scares me i said i say yes to this and therell be something else and whats wrong with something else anita what scares you isnt my needs but that you might like it thats not fair maybe not but its true you like being held down during sex you like it rough not all the time and i dont like being tied up all the time but i like it some of the time why is that wrong im not sure i can meet all your needs okay it was one of the things that worried me about us as a couple from the beginning then are you okay with me finding someone else to meet those needs sex with you bondage with someone else he said it fast as if he were afraid hed lose his nerve i just stared at him where the hell did this come from im trying to find out what the limits are anita thats all do you want someone else i asked it because i had to ask no but you have other people in your bed and im okay with that but if you wont meet my needs then are you saying that if i dont come across youll break up with me no no he hid his face with his hands and made a frustrated noise his energy level swirled back through the car like hot water spilling across my skin he swallowed the power back and looked at me he looked pained i need this anita i want to do it with you but i need it with someone its part of who i am sexually it just is i tried to wrap my mind around letting nathaniel play sex games with someone else then come home to me i couldnt do it he was right i was forcing him to share me with other men but sharing him with another woman so what youd have tieup games with someone else then come home to me i can find a master who doesnt do sexual contact i can find someone who will just do the bondage but bondage is sex for you he nodded sometimes i cant do this tonight nathaniel im not asking you to just think about it decide what you want me to do youre giving me an ultimatum i dont deal well with ultimatums its not an ultimatum anita its just true i love you and im happier with you than ive ever been with anyone for this long honestly i didnt think wed still be together this long seven months is the longest relationship ive ever had when i thought it would be like all the resta few months then overit wasnt a big deal i could behave myself for a few months until you got tired of me im not tired of you i know that in fact i think youre going to keep me i didnt expect that keep you you make yourself sound like a lost puppy that i picked up on the street you dont keep people nathaniel fine pick a different word but were living together and its working and it might last years i cant go years without having this need met anita it might last years you still talk about us like we wont last years is lasting he said and everyone gets tired of me eventually i didnt know what to say to that im not tired of you frustrated puzzled as hell but not tired he smiled but it didnt reach his eyes i know that and if i didnt feel secure enough i wouldnt make any demands id just go on being unhappy about this but if you love me then i can ask for what i want if you love me hed said jesus it must be true love nathaniel because im not booting your ass to the curb for this for what asking for my sexual needs to be met stop just stop i rested my forehead against the steering wheel and tried to think can we please drop this for now while i think about it sure his voice sounded hurt but his voice could sound hurt i was out of my depth how long have you been saving this conversation up i asked still resting against the wheel i kept waiting for there to be a quiet time when you werent assdeep in alligators but but im always assdeep in alligators yeah he said i rose and nodded that was fair ill think about what you said and thats all ive got tonight okay thats wonderful i mean it i was afraid i frowned at him you really thought id dump you because of this he shrugged and wouldnt look at me you dont like demands anita not from any of the men in your life i unbuckled my seat belt and slid over so i could turn him to look at me i cant promise that this wont eventually break me but i cant imagine not waking up beside you most mornings i cant imagine not having you puttering in our kitchen hell its more your kitchen than mine i dont cook he kissed me and drew back with that smile that made his face shine with happiness i loved that smile our kitchen ive never had an our anything before i hugged him partially because i wanted to and partially to hide the expression on my face on one hand i loved him to pieces on the other hand i wished he had come with an instruction book more than almost any other man in my life he confused me richard hurt me more but most of the time i understood why i didnt like it but i understood his motivation nathaniel was so far outside my comfort zone sometimes that i had no clue that i understood vampires that had been alive over five hundred years better than i understood the man in my arms said something i wasnt sure what it said but something lets go inside before jeanclaude wonders what happened to us he nodded still looking happy he got out on his side with the box in hand i got out hit the button to make the jeep beep and eased between the cars onto the sidewalk hed put his hat back on nathaniel in disguise i put my left arm through his and we walked over the melting snow toward the club he was still all glowing from the our comment id made me i wasnt glowing i was worried how far would i really go to keep him could i send him to a stranger for slap and tickle could i share him if i couldnt meet his needs i didnt know i really didnt know chapter six i opened that metaphysical connection i had to jeanclaude opened it and thought where are you i felt him or saw him or some other word that they hadnt invented yet for seeing and feeling what someone else was doing in another room he was on stage using that voice of his to announce an act i drew back enough to be solidly on nathaniels arm sometimes when i tried mindtomind stuff i had trouble walking jeanclaude is on stage so well go in the front whatever you say he said once in our relationship hed meant that hed been my little submissive wereleopard id worked long and hard to make him more to force him to be more demanding try to do a good deed and it bites you on the ass the bouncer at the door was tall blond and way too cheerful for the job clay was one of richards werewolves and when he wasnt bodyguarding someone he worked security here clays gift was avoiding fights he was really good at calming things down a much more useful ability for a bouncer than brute strength last week clay had been helping guard my body no pun intended thered been a metaphysical accident and it had looked for a while like id be turning into a wereanimal for real so id had different lycanthropes with me so that whatever i changed into i was covered but i had gotten some control over it all and it looked like i still wasnt going to turn furry clay had been one of my watchwolves he was happy to be off the duty i scared clay he was afraid the ardeur would make him my sexual slave okay he didnt say that exactly maybe it was just me projecting my terrors on him maybe his smile slipped a little when he saw me his face going all serious he gave me a hard look as he said hows it going anita he wasnt just being polite as afraid as he was of some of my metaphysical abilities hed been convinced it wasnt a good idea to take all my guards off duty he thought it was too soon im fine clay he peered at me leaning that sixfoot frame down to my five foot three he studied me as the crowd behind us grew to four his gaze went to nathaniel has she really been fine shes been fine clay stood up straight and motioned us through he looked positively suspicious as he did it though honest nathaniel whispered as we went by not a twinge of anything furry clay nodded and turned to the next group he was the gatekeeper tonight we entered the permanent dimness of the club the noise was soft murmurous like the sea the music picked up and the crowd noise both was drowned out and got louder the murmur of it was drowned out with the rise of the music but the screams and yells of encouragement were louder the woman behind the coat area came out smiling crosses arent allowed in the club id forgotten i was wearing one outside my clothes usually i just tucked it out of sight and got to avoid the holyitem check girl i spilled the cross inside my sweater sorry forgot im sorry but just hiding it isnt enough ill give you a claim check just like for a coat great she was new and didnt know me call jeanclaude over or buzz i get a pass on this one nathaniel took off his hat and gave her a grin even in the dim light i could see her blush brandon she breathed i didnt recognize you im in disguise he said and gave her that look that was part mischief part flirting is she with you i was holding on to his armof course we were together but i stood there and was quiet nathaniel would handle it me yelling at her wouldnt help things honest nathaniel leaned over and whispered joan thinks youre a fan that just grabbed me at the door oh i gave her a real smile sorry im his girlfriend nathaniel nodded to confirm it as if women claimed to be his girlfriend all the time it made me look at his smiling peaceful face and wonder how many overzealous fans he had how weird did it get joan leaned in to us to whisper over the rising music sorry but jeanclaudes orders are that just because youre dating a dancer the holy item still doesnt get inside on one hand it was good that she was good at her job on the other hand it was beginning to irritate me two of the blackshirted security people came over to us i think the hat and coat fooled them too they didnt act like they recognized either one of us lisandro was tall dark handsome with shoulderlength hair tied back in a ponytail he was a wererat which meant somewhere on him was a gun a quick glance didnt show it under the black tshirt and jeans so it was probably at the small of his back the wererats were mostly exmilitary expolice or had never been on the right side of the law they always went armed the other security guy was taller and way more muscled the weight lifting meant he was probably a werehyena their leader had a thing for weight lifters anita lisandro said whats the holdup she wants my cross he looked at joan shes jeanclaudes human servant she gets a pass the woman actually blushed and apologized im sorry i didnt know and you being with brandon i i held up a hand its okay really just let us get out of the doorway there was a crowd behind us that went out the door clay was peeking inside wondering what was happening lisandro helped us ease through the room away from the door but not quite to the tables closer to the drink area i would have said bar area but they werent allowed to serve liquor yet another of the interesting zoning laws about strip clubs on this side of the river the weight lifter stayed near the door to help sort the crowd with joan i could finally see who was dancing to the music byron was near the end of his act because he was down to a very small gstring it left the pale muscled body very bare his short brown hair curled haphazardly as if some of his customers had mussed it a woman was stuffing money down the front of the gstring i felt him use a small slap of power to capture her just enough to keep her hand out of his pants it skirted the edge of legal but the vamps had found that a tiny bit of control could keep them from getting hurt on stage id seen bloody nail marks and even a few bite marks on nathaniel and jason it was a lot more dangerous to strip for women than for men apparently all the dancers agreed that men behaved themselves better byron writhed around the eager circle of women who surrounded the front of the stage he laughed and joked they ran hands over his body and rained money down on his skin id had sex with him once to feed the ardeur wed both enjoyed it but byron and i both agreed that it wasnt our cup of tea that each other wasnt our cup of tea besides the weight lifting helped him pass for eighteen but hed died at fifteen yeah he was several hundred years old but his body wasnt his body was still that of an athletic teenager i was still disturbed by the fact that id had sex with him also byron preferred men to women hed do bisexual if it came his way but he was one of the few men who spent more time ogling my boyfriends than me i found that disturbing too jeanclaude was standing near the back of the stage lost in shadow letting byron have his limelight jeanclaude turned to look at me his pale face lost in the darkness of his hair and clothes he breathed through my mind await me in my office ma petite lisandro leaned over and whispershouted over the music jeanclaude said to take you through to the office just now i asked puzzled because to my knowledge no one but me should have heard it lisandro gave me a puzzled look back and shook his head no after you called he said to take you back to the office when you got here i nodded and let him lead us to the door nathaniel had kept his hat and coat on he didnt want to be recognized for several reasons it was rude to distract the audience from byrons show and brandon wasnt working tonight lisandro unlocked the door and ushered us through the door closed behind us and it was blessedly quiet the rear area wasnt soundproof but it was soundmuffled i hadnt realized how loud the music was until it stopped or maybe that was just how bad my nerves were tonight lisandro led us down the hallway to the door on the lefthand side jeanclaudes office was its usual elegant blackandwhite self there was even an oriental screen in one corner that hid an emergency coffin sort of a vampires version of a rollaway only the couch against the wall and the carpet were new asher and i had ruined the old stuff with sex that got so out of hand id ended up in the hospital lisandro closed the door and leaned against it on this side you staying i asked he nodded jeanclaudes orders he wants you to have bodyguards again when did he order that just a few minutes ago shit did your beast try to rise again he asked i shook my head nathaniel had set the box on jeanclaudes black lacquer desk he took off the hat and coat and laid them on one of the two chairs in front of the desk ive got to get a lighterweight hat if im going to keep using it for a disguise the leather is just too warm he wiped a thin bead of sweat off his forehead if your beast didnt try to rise again then why are you back to needing bodyguards lisandro asked i opened my mouth closed it i dont know how much jeanclaude will want you to know im not even sure how much anyone is allowed to know about what i shrugged ill tell you if i can if youre going to get me killed can i at least know why ive never gotten you hurt before no but weve lost two of our rats guarding you anita lets just say that if my wife ends up a widow id like to know why i glanced at his hand you dont wear a ring not at work no why not you dont want people knowing you have people that you care about anita it can give them ideas his gaze flicked to nathaniel just for a moment then back to me but nathaniel had seen it lisandro thinks im a victim that you need stronger men in your life i went to sit beside nathaniel on the new white couch he put his arm across my shoulders and i settled in against him yeah wed been fighting but that wasnt lisandros business and it certainly wasnt his business who i dated you can date who you want thats not my beef what is your beef i asked and let my words take on that slight hostile edge that was almost always just below the surface for me youre a vampire now right my my news travels fast not exactly i said out loud i know youre not like a bloodsucker youre still alive and everything but you gained jeanclaudes ability to feed off sex yeah i said still hostile human servants gain some of their masters abilities thats normal you should have gained the ability to help jeanclaude feed his hungers but your feeding on lust isnt an extra for his energy its a necessity for you i heard what happened the night you tried to stop feeding it you almost killed damian and nathaniel and yourself remus thinks you would have died if you hadnt fed the ardeur if you hadnt fucked someone he really thinks you might have died isnt it nice that he shared with everybody i said you can be all defensive about it if you want but its weird as hell rafael cant find anyone whos ever heard of a human servant gaining a hunger or thirst like this and how weird my life has become is your business why because youre asking me and my people to risk our lives to keep you safe thats why i gave him unfriendly face because i couldnt argue with his logic i had gotten two of the wererats killed in the last couple of years killed guarding me i guess he had a right to be pissy its your job nathaniel said if you dont like it ask your king to change your job description rafael would take me off duty if i asked youre right on that then ask nathaniel said lisandro shook his head thats not my point if you have a point make it i said and let him hear the impatience in my voice fine youre some sort of living vampire a master vampire because you gained a vampire servant in damian and an animal to call in nathaniel youre not telling me anything i dont already know lisandro jeanclaude chose you as his human servant he chose one of the most powerful necromancers to come along in centuries it was a good move to pick you his animal to call is the head of the local werewolf pack richard may have his problems but hes powerful again a good choice you both help jeanclaudes power base you both help him be stronger he motioned at nathaniel i like nathaniel hes a good kid but hes not powerful he gained more from you than you gained from him the same with damian hes a vampire over a thousand years old and hes never going to be a master anything have you reached your point i asked almost you know this is the most ive ever heard you talk at one time i said we all agreed that whoever had a chance to ask should talk to you whos we me and some of the other guards fine whats your point did you have a choice about nathaniel and damian he asked do you mean could i have chosen another wereleopard another vampire yes no why no lisandro asked one none of us had any idea that this could happen like you said human servants dont gain powers like this two i dont have the control over my metaphysics that jeanclaude has most vamps who gain a human servant or animal to call dont do that until theyve got a few decades or centuries under their belt i got thrown into the deep end of the pool without a life preserver i grabbed who the power threw at me i patted nathaniels leg im happy with the choices but i didnt know i was choosing when it happened nathaniel hugged me onearmed we were all surprised but you have more control of it now lisandro said and you know whats happening ive got more control yes but as to whats happening pick a topic somehow youve got three or four different kinds of lycanthropy inside you but you havent shifted into any of them yeah so but youre starting to be attracted to the different animals the way you were to the wolves and the leopards im just saying that if you pick a new animal cant it be someone powerful instead of weak why cant you choose someone who will help you power up instead of hurting you nathaniel shifted beside me nathaniel doesnt hurt me i said but part of me was thinking about our fight earlier there was room to get hurt but not the kind of hurt that lisandro meant he doesnt help you either not the way richard helps jeanclaude i could have argued that part richard was so conflicted about what he was and what he wanted out of life that he crippled the triumvirate among the three of us but if lisandro didnt realize how reluctant a partner richard was then i wasnt going to share it what do you want from me lisandro just if were going to put our bodies between you and a bullet can we have some input into the next animal you pick no i said just no he said yeah just no this is so not in your job description lisandro not you or remus or anyone if you dont want to risk yourself then dont i dont want anyone guarding me who feels like its a bad idea im not saying this right then stop saying it i said stop explaining and just say what you want anita to do nathaniel said lisandro frowned then said i think joseph was wrong when he forced you to send the werelion haven back to chicago joseph keeps trying to feed you his weakassed pride of lions and they arent any better than nathaniel no offense even josephs brother justin isnt that much stronger it had taken me a moment to remember who haven was because i still thought of him as cookie monster hed had hair dyed that color of blue and had sported several sesame street tattoos haven was also an enforcer for the master vampire of chicago haven had helped me handle the lion part of my metaphysical problem but hed also picked fights with three of the local werelions including joseph their rex their leader haven and richard had had a fight richard had kicked his ass proving that richard could be damned useful when he wanted to be but also proving that haven was way too much trouble to keep around you guys all explained to me how lion society works if someone that tough and that powerful had moved into town they would have felt compelled to take over the local werelions the first thing most takeovers do is slaughter most of the pride i think you could control him you saw him lisandro please hes a thug a professional thug with a prison record lisandro nodded ive got a record too juvie but some bad stuff on it my wife straightened me out i think you could do the same for him what a good woman is all a bad boy needs to straighten his life out if the woman has something that the man wants bad enough yeah what does that mean i asked it means i saw the way he looked at you i smelled what effect the two of you had on each other the only reason you didnt have sex was that your head overruled the rest of you you know lisandro i liked you better when you didnt talk this much ive seen havens record he doesnt have anything on his sheet that i aint got on mine that made me give him the long blink because i hadnt known that about him that would make you a very dangerous man i said my voice low and even youve killed more people than i have this conversation is over lisandro if not haven then can rafael put out feelers for some better lion candidates joseph is so scared that some big bad lion will come and eat his weakassed pride that he wont ever bring anyone to town who will do the job for you i started to say no but nathaniel squeezed my arm rafael is a good leader he cant interview for new lions he can bring in new rats but its not his place to bring in new lions i said lisandro is right on one thing anita joseph is scared everyone hes thrown at you in the last few weeks has been wimpynot just weak in power but innocent your life doesnt have room for innocents i stared into those lavender eyes and didnt like what i saw i was seven years older but hed seen as much violence as i had or more hed seen what our fellow human beings could do up close and personal id solved crimes of violence but mostly i hadnt been the victim hed been on the streets alone before he hit ten nathaniel was weak in some ways that lisandro counted but he was stronger than me in ways that most people wouldnt understand hed survived things that would have destroyed most people he let me see in his face what he usually hid that i was the innocent that no matter how many people i killed in the line of duty id never really know what he knew do you think i was wrong to make haven go back to chicago no he scared me but you need a werelion and they need to know the score what does that mean i asked two of the lions he sent you were virgins nathaniel said youre a succubus anita you dont give virgins over to something like that you have to have had bad sex to appreciate really good sex lisandro said nathaniel nodded that too but what i meant was that we havent met a lion yet who we didnt all think was weak he looked at the tall guard by the door some of them were tough in a normalworld sort of way but we all live in a world where guns and sex and violence of all kinds can happen and do we need someone who doesnt make us all feel like were corrupting children we both looked at nathaniel what he said is that how you really felt about all of them even justin i asked yes he said justins idea of violence is the kind that has referees and limits the fact that hes josephs enforcer is scary for them josephs better in a fight lisandro said but neither of them is as good as richard or rafael or your micah lisandro asked i think micah would do anything it took to keep his people safe i heard that about him lisandro said since we were talking about one of my other livein sweeties i wasnt sure how i felt about it micah and i were both very practical people sometimes practical and ruthless were just different words for the same thing youre both saying that you dont think joseph would do whatever it took the only thing thats kept his pride safe is the fact that there just arent a lot of werelions in this country catbased lycanthropy is usually harder to catch than other kinds lisandro said reptilebased is harder to catch nathaniel said lisandro nodded true but there arent a lot of lions in this country the closest is chicago they wont be trying a takeover jeanclaude and i made sure of that i said but dont you see anita you and jeanclaude made sure of it not joseph that makes his threat weak lisandro said nobody from chicago will mess with them now i said yeah but if chicago noticed theyre this weak then so will someone else i didnt know we had any big prides other than these two one on the west coast one on the east lisandro said is that where joseph got his last candidate i asked east coast pride yeah but you turned him down just like all the others i cant give your leader permission to shop for lions lisandro its against the rules to interfere that much over crossspecies lines not for you lisandro said remember joseph asked you not to keep haven the moment he asked you to protect him and his pride he asked you to interfere youre the leopards nimirra and the wolves lupa you were nothing to the lions once he asked for your help he gave you permission to mess with his lions i dont think joseph saw it that way i said lisandro shrugged doesnt matter how he saw it its still the truth i dont know what i would have said to that because there was a knock on the door lisandro went all bodyguardy on us his hand went behind his back and i knew for sure the gun was there who is it requiem jeanclaude requested my presence lisandro glanced at me i realized he was asking my permission i liked him better for that i didnt really want to see requiem tonight i was still embarrassed that id added him to my list of food but hed been in england so hed seen the harlequin in person and recently hed be helpful or thats what i told myself as i nodded for lisandro to let him in chapter seven requiem glided in wearing a long hooded cloak as black as his hair he was the only vamp id ever met who wore a cloak like that byron came behind him carrying a towel that seemed to be full of something he was still wearing nothing but his gstring there was still money stuffed in it he grinned at me hi duckie hey byron he always talked like he had just stepped out of an old british movie lots of loves and duckies he talked that way to everyone so i didnt take it personally he upended the towel on the couch beside me it was suddenly raining money good night nathaniel said byron nodded and started taking the money out of his gstring jeanclaude used that sweet sweet voice of his during my act the pigeons always give it up for him he slipped off the gstring letting some bills flutter to the floor i used to protest the nudity in front of me but they were strippers and after a while either you stopped being bothered by the casual nudity or you didnt hang at the club nudity didnt mean to the dancers what it meant in the real world stripping is about the illusion that the customers can have themthe illusion of sex not the reality of it it had taken me a while to understand that byron used the towel to dry some of the sweat off his body he winced and turned to show bloody scratches high on one buttock got me from behind just at the end of m act hitandrun or did she give you extra money for it nathaniel asked hitandrun i must have looked puzzled because nathaniel explained a hitandrun is when a customer gets an extra grope or scratch or something intimate and we dont know who did it and they dont pay for it oh i said because i didnt know what else to say i didnt like watching my boyfriends being groped by strangers it was another reason i stayed away the evening star loves harbinger sits before me and does not even waste a smile upon me requiems greeting to me it wasnt what he always said but it was typical hed started calling me his evening star you know i looked up the quote its john miltons paradise lost im not sure but i think its your very poetic way of complaining he glided in making sure the cloak showed nothing but the long oval of his face and even that was mostly hidden by the vandykestyle beard and mustache the only color on him was the swimming blue of his eyes the richest deepest medium blue id ever seen i know what i am to you anita and that would be i said i am food he bent over me and i turned my face so that the kiss he gave was on the cheek and not the mouth he didnt fight me on it but the kiss was empty and neutral the kind of kiss youd give your aunt but id made certain it wouldnt be more id turned away first so why did it bug me that hed just accepted the rebuff and not tried to make the kiss more i didnt want him pursuing me harder than he was id made that clear so why did his just accepting the cheek bother me god only knows because i had no idea i was mad at nathaniel for demanding more of me and irritated with requiem for not demanding anything even in my own head i was confused he glided away to sink into the empty chair near the desk he made sure the cloak covered him completely only the tips of his black boots peeking out why the frown my evening star i did exactly what you wished me to do didnt i i fought not to frown harder and probably failed you bother me requiem why he asked simply why just why no poetry i asked nathaniel patted my shoulder either reminding me he was there or trying to stop me from picking a fight either way it worked because i closed my eyes and counted to ten i wasnt sure why requiem got on my nerves lately but he did he was one of my lovers he was food but i didnt like it any of it he was wonderful in bed but there was always that feeling from him that no matter what i did it was never enough never what he wanted me to do there was a constant unspoken pressure from him i knew the feeling but unless you were going to have a relationship with a man it was a pressure you didnt deserve or wouldnt respond to he was food and we were lovers he was jeanclaudes thirdincommand id tried to be his friend but somehow the sex had ruined that i think without the sex we could have been friends but with it with it we were neither friends nor boyfriend or girlfriend we were lovers but i had no words for what was wrong between us but i could feel it like an old ache in a wound you thought had healed you told me you were tired of my constantly quoting poetry to you im practicing speaking simply i nodded i remember but i feel like youre unhappy with me and i dont know why you have allowed me into your bed i share the ardeur once more what could any man desire above that love nathaniel said requiem looked past me to the other man there was a flash of blue fire in the vampires eyes anger power requiem hid it but id seen it wed all seen it where both deliberate the love is slight who ever loved that loved not at first sight i dont know who youre quoting nathaniel said but anita doesnt love at first sight or at least she didnt me hes quoting from hero and leander by christopher marlowe byron said the other vampire was counting the money hed rained down on the couch he had his back to the other vampire and whats bothering him is that he thinks hes wonderful and he cant understand why you dont love him do not tempt me byron my anger seeks only a target requiem said byron turned with his stacked and counted money in his hand i can resist anything but temptation he said he glanced at me he hates it when you quote back at him your tongue doth overstep your purpose byron requiem said his voice purring low with warning my purpose byron said his gray eyes flashing with a moment of shining power like quiet lightning he laid his money on the lacquered coffee table and turned to face the other vampire i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not he sat in nathaniels lap putting his legs across my lap nathaniel put an arm around him almost automatically and gave me a look the look said whats going on but since i didnt know i had no answers it was like wed stepped into a fight i hadnt known was happening i had my hands in the air above byrons bare legs i could ignore the nudity most of the time now but not when that nudity was sitting in my boyfriends lap and had flung itself across my legs my ability to ignore just wasnt that good whats going on i asked my hands finally coming to light on byrons bare legs because i felt stupid keeping my hands in the air if hed been more on my lap than nathaniels i might have just dumped him on the floor but whatever was happening hed involved nathaniel too and that meant i couldnt simply act i had to think too simply reacting was so much easier not always in the long run but in the short run it felt so much better ask byron requiem said i have no idea why hes acting like this i patted byrons calf and said why are you sitting in our laps byron wrapped his arms around nathaniels shoulders cuddling his face next to his he stared at me giving me a look out of those gray eyes that made me fight off a shiver not a shiver of fear but one that was all about sex nathaniel looked faintly puzzled as their faces pressed next to each other it was the blatant sex look that made me slide out from under his legs and stand up i dont know what game this is byron but nathaniel and i dont want to play byron slid off nathaniels lap and knelt on the far side of him so that i could still see the two of them clearly it was like he was doing serious flirting byron flirted but not seriously more like it was a casual hobby there was nothing casual about the look on his face he slid his hand along nathaniels neck then grabbed his braid grabbed it and yanked nathaniels neck backward at a painful angle nathaniels breath came in fast pants his pulse visible like a trapped thing in his throat my gun was just in my hand i didnt remember drawing it i didnt remember aiming it my own pulse was hammering in my throat years of practice had a gun pointed at byrons face he was staring at me his gray eyes straight on face still serious but not threatening i didnt know what was going on but whatever it was someone was going to get hurt if it didnt stop let him go i said and my voice was as steady as the gun pointed at his forehead i had a sense of lisandro moving away from the door coming toward us i wasnt sure if i wanted the interference or even if i needed it he doesnt want me to let him go do you nathaniel byrons voice was very careful even as if he finally realized that his game could turn deadly nathaniels voice came strangled with the angle of his neck and the force of the vampires hand on his hair but what he said was no no dont stop i finally let myself glance at nathaniel i didnt normally look away from someone i was pointing a gun at but there was no sense of menace to byron whatever we were doing i wasnt sure it was about violence nathaniels hands were gripping byrons arm but not like he was trying to stop the vampire from hurting him more like he was just holding on but it was the look on nathaniels face that made me lower the gun to point at the floor nathaniels lips were half parted his eyes fluttering closed his face slack with pleasure his body was tense with anticipation he was enjoying the pain enjoying being manhandled shit byron let go of nathaniel abruptly almost with a throwaway gesture nathaniel fell back onto the couch gasping for breath his eyes rolled back into his head behind fluttering eyelids his spine bowed throwing his head back making him writhe against the back of the couch byron stood there and watched him duckie this much reaction you have been neglecting your boy he was right id have liked to argue it but he was right the proof of neglect was writhing on the couch in some sort of ecstasy that i couldnt even begin to understand i liked a little force now and then but it didnt do this for me nathaniel began to grow quiet eyes still closed and a smile on his face i understood for the first time that the violence could be sex for him really truly could i looked at byron and your point i was pretty sure i knew what the point was but id be damned if id help him make it i heard rumors that you werent doing dominance and submission with the boy but i didnt believe it i mean how can you be with nathaniel and not do bdsm bondage and submission is the boys bread and butter i nodded and put my gun up do you know how close you came to getting yourself shot i did once i saw your gun pointed at my face the joking was gone again so serious and then he smiled so exciting are you saying you got off on the fact that i damn near shot you i laughed a little at the end but it was a nervous laugh not got off the way that nathaniel does but i like to be dominated sometimes he sat down on the couch squeezed between nathaniel and the couch arm he wrapped his arms around nathaniels shoulders again though he was sitting on his knees so that he couldnt put their faces next to each other nathaniel cuddled in against him a peaceful look on his face it creeped me out but he cuddled byrons arms tighter around him as if he were his favorite teddy bear hed never liked byron that much and now just a little abuse and he was his best buddy i did not get it i just didnt byron hugged him back and stroked the side of his hair im a switch anita in every sense of the word i frowned at him switch means bisexual right theres another meaning for it duckie just tell me byron im not very good at subtle it means that im both a sub and a dom submissive and dominant i said he nodded what are you offering i said i could help you tame your kittycat here how i let the word hold all the suspicion it could he laughed you can put so much menace and doubt into one word duckie answer the question i said feed the ardeur on me and nathaniel while i abuse him if this is a preview the energy will be amazing and what do you get out of it i get to have sex with you duckie i shook my head try again byron you like boys a lot more than you like girls i get to have sexual contact with nathaniel i felt my eyes narrow at him youve never acted like nathaniel was your type before i know that hes unhappy and i want my friends to be happy thats not all of it i said dont know what you mean lover he settled into the corner of the couch nathaniel and he cuddled like they had done it before though i didnt think they had hes doing it for my benefit requiem said i looked at the other vampire who had never moved from his chair explain i said tell her byron tell her why youre offering where has all your poetry gone requiem byron asked in chains and darkness wherefore should i stay and mourn in prison while i keep the key requiem said thats better byron said have you thought about ending it all duckie is the fact that anita doesnt adore you that painful to you requiem just stared at him and something in that look made byron shiver i wasnt sure if it was a shiver of fear or of other things if he wasnt afraid he should have been id never seen requiem look at anyone with that coldness before this has the smell of something that will get out of hand and get people hurt since part of my job is to protect everyone who could get hurt talk to me i said byron looked at me nathaniel needs his pain anita ill help you give it to him while youre in the bed with us you get to supervise but you dont have to do the dirty work did nathaniel talk to you about this problem i know what its like anita to want a certain kind of touch and be denied it i spent centuries being given to masters that didnt give a damn what i wanted or needed you love nathaniel and he loves you but eventually needs left unanswered can curdle love like milk left to spoil in the sun so this little demonstration is out of the kindness of your heart i said and let my tone say how little i believed that hes tried to tell you duckie but you didnt understand im not sure i understand now i said but did it help my little show i wanted to say no but it would have been a lie most vamps could smell or feel a lie so why bother hate to admit it but yeah it helped dont pull shit like this again but youve made your point have i he said sliding lower on the couch so that he and nathaniel were more intertwined if it bothered nathaniel to be that up close and personal with a naked man it didnt show okay a naked man who wasnt one of our sweeties had just a little hair pulling made him like byron that much was nathaniels need that great or had i just neglected his needs that much byron hadnt done anything that i wasnt willing to do he hadnt done anything bad would it be so bad to just tie nathaniel up and have the sex we would have had without the tying up was that so awful i looked at the two men cuddled together the look of peaceful contentment on nathaniels face and realized that id been arrogant id assumed that if our relationship ended it would be me doing the ending that id dump him for being too needy or too something in that instant i realized that he might dump me for simply not trying hard enough to meet his needs the thought made my chest tight i loved him i really did i could not imagine my life without him so what was i willing to do to keep him how far would i go and did i need help to get there id had sex with byron once before id fed the ardeur off him could byron teach me how to dominate nathaniel maybe maybe not but his little show had proved one thing that i needed someone to show me how nathaniel worked i would never have dreamed that simply pulling his hair putting a little force behind it would get such an amazing reaction out of him you look like youre thinking too hard lover im thinking about your little show isnt that what you wanted i asked i wanted it to excite you but thats not excitement in your eyes it was his turn to frown she is not easily captured requiem said she likes two men at once not just any two men requiem said just as she does not prefer just any single man youre talking about me like im not here i really hate that i said sorry duckie but i was hoping that the sight of nathaniel and me together would do something for you it puzzled me byron laughed and it made his face look younger gave you a glimpse of what he might have been at a human fifteen when a vampire found him and made sure hed never see sixteen puzzlement wasnt exactly what i had in mind i shrugged sorry he shook his head not your fault dearie i dont do it for you i dont do it for you either i said he laughed again the sex was lovely but youd have liked it better if it had been jeanclaude a look slid through his eyes he actually looked down lowering his eyes in a show of coyness to hide the look when he raised his gaze to me again it was that smiling blankness that he hid behind jeanclaude loves you duckie hes made that abundantly clear i might have asked what he meant by that but the door opened and the vampire in question glided through his clothes had just looked dark in the club his usual black the clothes were black but they werent usual he was wearing a tuxedo complete with tailsthough once you made it out of leather was it still a tuxedo braces like silk suspenders slid over the bare flesh of his chest i stared at that bare skin the way some men stare at a womans breasts it wasnt like me i mean it was a nice chest but to stop there and not look at his face was just wrong because as nice as the chest was the face was better i raised my gaze to that face the hair fell past his shoulders in black curls the line of his neck was encircled with a black velvet ribbon and a cameo id bought for him up to the kissable curve of his mouth the curve of his cheek like a swallows wing all grace and swallows wing what the hell did that mean i would never have described anyones jawline like that ma petite are you well no i said softly i dont think i am he moved closer and i had to move my eyes upward had to meet that midnight blue gaze it was like back at the movies when id first seen nathaniel i was too fascinated too taken with him i actually had to close my eyes so the vision of him didnt distract before i could say i think someones messing with me what do you mean ma petite you mean like at the movie theatre nathaniel said his voice was closer than the couch he must have moved toward us i nodded eyes still closed jeanclaudes voice came from right in front of me what happened at the theatre nathaniel explained she had to get her cross out before it got better but im wearing my cross now i said its inside your shirt now it was in plain sight before nathaniel said that shouldnt matter unless the vampire is in the room with me try bringing it into the light jeanclaude said i opened my eyes a crack glancing at him he was still heartrendingly beautiful but i could think again that shouldnt matter for this i stared up into his face straight into those wondrous eyes they were just eyes beautiful captivating but not literally its gone again whats going on duckies byron asked he walked up to us looking from one to the other lisandro leave us jeanclaude said lisandro seemed to think about protesting but he didnt he just asked do you want me to stay on the door or go back to the club the door i think jeanclaude said dont our guards need a headsup i asked this is not the business of the rodere lisandro raised a point before you came in that if were going to endanger them they have a right to know why jeanclaude looked at lisandro it was not a completely friendly look did he lisandro gave him a flat look back i was talking about when anita picks another animal to call nothing about your orders jeanclaude all that concerns ma petite concerns me there was a dangerous purr to his voice lisandro shifted a little and visibly let out a breath no offense but dont you want her to pick a stronger beast next time someone who will help your power base jeanclaude stared at him and lisandro fought to both look at the vampire and not looka trick that id mastered over the years but was glad id become powerful enough to give up so hard to be tough when you cant look someone in the eyes is my strength the concern of the rats jeanclaude asked yes lisandro said how one word flat and unfriendly your strength keeps us all safe the wererats remember what st louis was like when nikolaos was master of the city lisandro shook his head face darkening she didnt protect anyone or anything but the vampires you think about the entire preternatural community jeanclaude i think you will find it is ma petite who thinks of such things shes your human servant lisandro said her actions are your actions isnt that what the vampires believe that their human servants are just extensions of their masters jeanclaude blinked and moved farther into the room collecting me by the hand as he moved a pretty conceit but you know that ma petite is her own person his hand in mine felt solid real and the world was suddenly safer just the touch of his hand and i felt more myself whatever or whoever is messing with me is still here i said around the edges somehow but still here what do you mean ma petite when you touched me i felt more solid your touch chased back a fuzziness i didnt even know was there he drew me in against his body so that it was almost a hug i caressed the butter softness of his leather lapels is that more solid still he asked i shook my head try touching skin to skin requiem said he had stayed in the chair by the desk wed moved until we were close to him not intentionally at least not on my part i kept one hand in jeanclaudes but the other i put against his bare chest the moment i touched that much of his skin it was good even better i said i traced my hand over the smooth firm muscles of his chest i traced the crossshaped burn scar better still why did you want to speak to byron and me jeanclaude requiem looked up at us his face fighting for blankness but failing around the edges he reclined in the chair body at ease but his eyes gave him away tight careful youve seen this before havent you i asked once he said his voice more neutral than his eyes when i asked he looked at jeanclaude the wererat should leave jeanclaude nodded go for now lisandro if we can tell you more we will lisandro looked at me as he left as if he thought i was the one most likely to tell him the truth later he was right chapter eight byron looked at all of us his usual joking face was utterly serious someone talk to us poor little peons please did you receive a gift requiem asked oui what kind of gift byron asked a mask jeanclaude said byron paled hed fed tonight so he had enough color to do it no no fuck me not here not again what color was it requiem said in a voice that had fallen away to emptiness the way some of the old vampires could do white jeanclaude said byron relaxed so suddenly he almost fell nathaniel offered him a hand that he took im all weakkneed duckies dont scare me like that white were safe with white nathaniel helped him back to the couch but didnt stay by him he moved back toward us what color did your master in england get i asked red first then black requiem said what does red mean i asked pain jeanclaude said it is typically a bid to punish a master to bring him to heel the council does not use the harlequin lightly the name fell into the room like a stone dropped down a well you strained to hear the splash i leaned my face in against jeanclaudes chest there was no heartbeat to hear he would breathe only when he needed to speak i raised my head away from his chest sometimes it still disturbed me to lay my ear against a silent chest byron broke the silence red means they fuck with you like someone has been doing tonight i asked yes requiem said and black i asked death requiem said but doesnt white mean they just observe us nathaniel said it should he said id begun to dread when requiem answered in short clipped sentences the poetry might occasionally get on my nerves but the short choppy words meant something had gone wrong or he was pissed or both you said youd explain more about them when i got to guilty pleasures well im here explain harlequin is now merely a figure for jest once he was or they were the mesnee dhellequin do you know what the wild hunt is ma petite the wild hunt is a common motif all over europe a supernatural leader leads a band of devils or the dead with spectral hounds and horses they chase and kill either anyone who crosses their path or only the evil and take them to hell it depends on who you read whether its a punishment to join the hunt or a reward its usually considered really bad to be outside when the hunt goes by as always you surprise me ma petite well its such a widespread story that there has to be some basis for it but it hasnt been seen for real since the time of one of the henrys in england i think henry the second but im not a hundred percent on that one usually the leader of the hunt is some local dead bad guy or the devil but before christianity got hold of it a lot of the norse gods were said to lead it odins mentioned a lot but sometimes goddesses like hel or holdathough holdas version gave gifts as well as punishment some of the other hunts did too but generally it was really bad to get caught or even see them ride by harlequin is one of those leaders jeanclaude said thats a new one on me but then i havent read up on it since college i think the only reason it stuck with me is that its such a widespread story and it stops abruptly a few hundred years ago almost every other legend that has that many witness stories is true or at least thats what ive found so why did it stop why did the wild hunt just stop riding if it was real it is real ma petite i looked at him are you saying it was vampires i am saying that the legend existed and we took advantage of it the harlequin adopted the persona of the wild hunt for it was something that people already feared vampires scare people already jeanclaude you guys didnt need to pretend to be norse gods to be frightening the harlequin and his family were not trying to frighten people ma petite they were trying to frighten other vampires you guys already scare each other mommie dearest proves that early in our history marmee noir decided we were too dangerous that we needed something to keep us in check she created the idea of the harlequin as you say ma petite there were so many wild hunts over the face of europe what was one more vampires begin life as people and the idea of the wild hunt was something many already feared okay so what does this fake wild hunt have to do with us they are not fake ma petite they are a supernatural troop that can fly that can punish the wicked and kill mysteriously and quickly they arent the original wild hunt jeanclaude that makes them fake in my book as you will but they are the closest thing that vampires have to police they are taken from all the major bloodlines they owe allegiance to no one line they are called upon when the council is divided they are divided about us about me what do they do exactly nathaniel asked disguise and subterfuge are their meat and drink they are assassins spies of the highest order no one knows who they are no one has ever seen their faces and lived they come to us masked if they mean us no harm masked in the manner of venice when the rich and powerful wore masks caps and hats so all looked alike and none could be distinguished from the other if they appear before us in those costumes then they are merely here to observe if they appear in the masks of their namesakes then it could go either way they could be merely observing or they could mean to kill us they would wear their namesakes both to hide their faces and to let us know that if we do not cooperate they could turn deadly what do you mean namesakes i asked there is only one harlequin at a time but there are other harlequin as a group name whatever names they had once they have adopted the names and masks of the commedia dellarte i dont know the term i said it was a type of theatre that flourished before i was born but it gave rise to many characters the women were not originally masked on stage but there are those among harlequins band that have taken female personas whether they are actually women or only seek to confuse the matter is open for debate but does not truly matter as for namesakes there are dozens but some names have been known for centuries harlequin of course punchinello scaramouche pierrot or pierrette columbine hanswurst il dottore there could be dozens more or a hundred no one knows how many are in the harlequins raid most of the time they will only appear in nearly featureless masks of black and white they will simply say we are the harlequin the best possible scenario is that we never learn who individually has come to our city how serious a breach of vampy etiquette is it that we get a white mask but theyre acting like its red i asked jeanclaude and requiem exchanged a look that i couldnt read exactly but it wasnt good talk to me damn it i said it should not be happening ma petite either this is an attack by some other vampire powerful enough to fool us all or the harlequin are breaking their own rules they are deadly within their rules if the rule of law were to break downhe closed his eyes and hugged me hugged me tight nathaniel came to stand beside us his face uncertain what can we do about it jeanclaude looked at him and smiled very practical mon minet as practical as our micah he turned to look at requiem whose smile had vanished is this how it began in london yes one of the harlequin could increase our emotions of desire but only emotions we already owned it was very subtle at first then worsened truthfully what has happened tonight to anita went unnoticed among us it simply seemed to be couples finally deciding to consummate their friendships how did it worsen nathaniel asked i dont know if it was the same vampire but they began to interfere when we used the powers of belles line making the lust go terribly wrong how terribly i asked the ardeur at its worst he said shit i said nathaniel touched my shoulders and jeanclaude opened his arms to pull the other man into our embrace so that he hugged us both and i was firmly in the middle of them it was as if i could finally catch my breath better and better i said the more you touch your power base the more surety you have against them at first requiem said what do you mean at first i asked eventually our master was tormented by them no matter who he touched whatever he touched turned ill and whatever touched his skin was poisoned poisoned with what i asked they turned our own powers against us anita we were a kiss made up almost entirely of belle mortes line they turned our gifts against us so that the blade bit deep and we bled for them they didnt torment elinore and roderick byron said from the couch the three of us looked at him still clinging to each other not true she was bothered at first like all of us so smitten with roderick she couldnt do her job but how did you say it when the madness overcame us they were spared byron said there was a tone to his voice that held anger or something close to it jeanclaude hugged us both and nathaniel hugged back until it was hard to breathe not from some vampire trick but from the strength in their bodies jeanclaude eased away and nathaniel did the same jeanclaude moved us to the desk edge he leaned upon it drawing my back in against his body he held a hand out to nathaniel and drew him to the desk nathaniel sat on the desk his feet dangling in the air but he kept his hand in the vampires as if afraid to let go i guess we all were what do you mean madness i asked we fucked our brains out dearie i tried to think of a polite way to say it byron laughed the look on your face anita yes sex is our coin and we did a lot of it but you want to have a choice dont you he looked past us to requiem you dont like having your choices taken away do you lover requiem gave him a look that should have stopped his heart let alone his words but byron was already dead and the dead are made of stouter stuff than the living or maybe byron just didnt care anymore requiem found that men were on the menu didnt you lover there was a purring insolence in his voice bordering on hatred i got the implications theyd become lovers after the harlequin messed with them all badly enough requiem didnt do men period belle had punished him over the centuries for refusing to bed men to refuse belle morte anything was never a good idea so hed been serious about saying no someone on the harlequins team was very good at manipulating emotions scary good i hugged jeanclaudes arm tight to me and reached out to nathaniel i ended up touching his hip just running my hand lightly along it shapeshifters were always touching each other and id begun to pick up the habit tonight i didnt fight it you are never to speak of it requiem said his voice low and very serious how much does it bother you to know that ive had sex with anita too requiem stood in one swift motion the black cloak swinging out revealing that he wasnt wearing much under the cloak stop jeanclaude said requiem froze his eyes blazing with bluegreen light his shoulders rose and fell with his breathing as if hed been running i believe that lust is not the only emotion the harlequin can incite jeanclaude said it took requiem a moment and then he frowned and turned those sparkling eyes to us our anger jeanclaude nodded the light began to fade like light moving away through water what are we to do jeanclaude if they do not even observe their own rules we are doomed i will ask for a meeting with them he said youll what byron said his voice squeaking just a little i will ask for a meeting between them and us you do not seek the harlequin out jeanclaude requiem said you hide cowering in the grass praying that they pass you by you do not invite them closer the harlequin are honorable what is happening is not honorable behavior you are mad byron said you think one of them is disobeying the rules i said quietly i hope so jeanclaude said why hope so i asked because if what is happening is being done with the full weight and approval of the harlequin behind it then requiem is correct we are doomed they will play with us then destroy us i dont do doomed i said he kissed the top of my head i know ma petite but you do not understand what force is against us explain it to me i have told you they are the bogeymen of vampirekind they are what we fear in the dark not true i said theyre bloody frightening lover byron said we do fear them the bogeyman of all vampires is marmee noir mommie dearest your queen thats who scares the shit out of all of you they were quiet for a heartbeat or two yes the harlequin fear the queen of darkness our creator jeanclaude said everyone fears the dark requiem said but if the mother of all darkness is our nightmare then the harlequin are the swift sword of the dark byron nodded no arguments from me on that one duckie everyone fears her what are you suggesting ma petite im not suggesting anything im saying ive stood in the dark and seen her rise above me like a black ocean shes invaded my dreams ive seen the room where her body lies heard her voice whisper through my head tasted rain and jasmine choking on my tongue i shivered and could almost feel her moving restless in the dark she lay in a room with windows and they kept a fire below her a continuous watch shed fallen into a sleep longer ago than most of them remembered once id thought they watched to celebrate her awakening but id begun to realize most of them were as afraid of her as i was which meant they were scared shitless marmee noir liked me for some reason i interested her and from thousands of miles away she messed with me shed made a cross melt into my hand id have the scar until i died speak of the devil and you bring him closer requiem said i nodded and tried to think of something else oh yeah i knew what to think about the harlequin are just vampires right which means theyre subject to your laws right oui then lets use the law against them what do you propose ma petite this is a direct challenge to our authority the council has forbidden any master of the city to fight in the united states until the law decides whether you guys are staying legal or not youre not suggesting that we fight them byron said im saying that we act in accordance with the law i said dont you understand anita byron said the harlequin are who we turn to when the bad things happen sort of they are the police for us when the police go bad they arent police anymore i said what are they he asked criminals you cannot seriously suggest that we are to fight the harlequin requiem said not exactly i said what exactly then i looked up at jeanclaude what would you do if someone powerful moved in on us like this i would contact the council in hopes of avoiding open war then contact them i said i thought not everyone on the council liked us nathaniel said they do not but if the harlequin are breaking the law then that would take precedence over more petty concerns jeanclaude said have you forgotten how petty the council can be requiem said non but not all on the council have forgotten what it means to live in the real world which council member will you contact first byron asked there was a knock on the door all of us with heartbeats jumped nathaniel gave that nervous laugh and i said shit lisandros voice theres a delivery for you jeanclaude it can wait he said his voice showing some of the strain the letter with it says youre expecting it enter jeanclaude said lisandro opened the door but it was clay who walked in with a white box in his hands a box just like the one id found in the restroom i think i stopped breathing because when i remembered to breathe it came in a gasp clay looked at me whats wrong who delivered this jeanclaude asked it was just sitting by the holyitem check desk and you just brought it in here i said my voice rising no give me some credit we checked it out the note says jeanclaude is expecting it what is it i asked but was afraid i knew a mask clay said he was looking at all of us now trying to see why we were so upset what color is it jeanclaudes voice was as empty as id ever heard it white the tension level dropped a point or two with little gold musical notes all over it didnt you order it in a way i suppose i did jeanclaude said i stared up at him and moved away enough so i could see his face clearly what do you mean you suppose you did i said i wanted to meet with them did i not yeah but so what thats what this mask means ma petite it means they wish to meet not to kill us or torment but to talk but how did they know what youd said nathaniel asked jeanclaude looked at me and there was something in that look that made me say theyre listening to us i fear so when was the mask delivered requiem asked clay was still looking at us as if waiting for us to throw him a clue were not sure i went on break about thirty minutes ago it must have come while i was off the door how long have you been back on the door jeanclaude asked maybe five minutes they were listening requiem said they knew what jeanclaude was going to say byron said and his voice held more panic than most vampires would have shown he just couldnt quite keep all the emotion out of his face and voice what is going on clay asked something big and bad has come to town lisandro said they wont tell us about it but theyll expect us to fight it and die because of it his voice sounded bitter what are the rules about telling our soldiers about them i asked jeanclaude took in a deep deep breath and shook almost like a bird settling its feathers mutable mutableoh it depends he nodded then i had a smart idea i believe wed know if someone was listening in on us metaphysically especially another vampire they are very powerful ma petite lisandro i said he came to his version of attention he gave me all his concentration there was a demand to his dark eyes if i widowed his wife he wanted to know why i thought he deserved to know why but first things first i need this room swept for bugs what kind of bugs anything that would let someone listen to us you think they are relying on technology ma petite i dont believe that any vampire could spy on us like this without our sensing it they are very powerful ma petite they are fucking ghosts lover byron said fine theyre ghosts but it doesnt do any harm to look for technology if the room is clean then we can blame it on spooky stuff but lets look for tech first jeanclaude looked at me for a long moment then nodded it would be interesting if they used listening devices did you look for bugs in london nathaniel asked byron and requiem exchanged a look then both shook their heads it never occurred to us duckies i mean this is the bloodybyron licked his lips and stopped himself before saying their name just in case they are ghosts bogeys walking nightmares you dont expect the bogeyman to need technology exactly i said whats that supposed to mean he asked it means that most vampires dont use technology much if these guys use it a lot then it would seem like magic if you didnt know what it was any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic requiem said i nodded he stared at me my evening star you are full of surprises i just dont think like a vampire does rafael have someone he trusts to clean a room of such things jeanclaude asked yes lisandro said then do it how soon do you need it we said we wanted to meet with them a minute or two ago and the mask arrives with the invitation i said so like yesterday lisandro said or sooner i said he nodded ill make the call he hesitated at the door ill put someone on the door and ill use a phone outside the club good thinking i said its what i do then he was gone where do you want this clay asked motioning with the box put it on the desk with the other one i guess he put it beside the first one jeanclaude didnt seem to want to touch it i was the one who opened it and found the white mask staring sightless up at me but this one looked more finished with gilt musical notes decorating the face i touched a note and found it was raised above the rest of the mask the note with it said only as you requested is there writing inside the mask jeanclaude asked i lifted it out of the tissue paper inside the smooth bow of the mask was writing do not read it out loud ma petite i didnt i just handed it to him inside the mask was written circus of the damned and a date that was two days away the date was written backward with the day first then the month then the year like they wrote it in europe theyd chosen one of jeanclaudes own businesses for the meeting was that good bad or neither did it mean we had homecourt advantage or that they were planning to torch the place i wanted to ask but didnt want our enemies to hear the question if we did find bugs in this office wed have to look everywhere all the offices all the businesses my house all of it i was praying we found bugs because the alternative was that these vamps were so good that they could plant psychic bugs inside our brains you could find and destroy mechanical shit in the rooms if they were good enough to use magic inside our heads then we were fucked wed die when they wanted us to die or wed live and either way it would be their idea and not ours i never thought id pray to have our offices turn out to be bugged funny what turns out to be the lesser evil some nights chapter nine dawn had come and all the vampires were asnooze in their coffins when i finally got a few minutes to try edward again id called twice while lisandros experts searched everything they had found bugs but not where they were listening to us like listening posts hours of work later and we were clean we actually got lucky the bugs werent the smallest and latest cuttingedge technology which meant they needed to be close to the clubs to hear probably something mobile like a van the experts said the tech was good but not the latest and greatest which probably meant the harlequin didnt know how to hack phone lines and computer systems probably but even the listening devices we found were pretty high tech for a bunch of ancient vampires made me wonder what other wonders of modern technology they might be willing to use most vamps relied on vampire powers i wasnt sure the harlequin did in fact i was betting they didnt ancient vampires and armed with modern shit it just wasnt fair i wanted to even those odds so i was in jeanclaudes bathroom with my cell phone trying one last time to reach edward i dialed the number and had almost given up when i heard the phone click over the voice that answered the phone was thick with sleep for a second i thought it was edward so i said edward the voice cleared a little and said anita that you the voice was male but definitely not edward shit edward was engaged to a widow with two kids lately when i wanted to be sure id get him the first time i called donnas house not his they werent officially living together but he spent more time at her place than at his own hey peter sorry forgot the time difference i heard some movement as if hed rolled over and taken the phone under the covers with him its all right whats up his voice had spent the last year breaking and finally settled into a deeper bass that still startled me sometimes i just need to talk to ted i said hoping he hadnt heard the edward earlier its okay anita and he gave a laugh that still held a lazy edge of sleep i know who edward is but youre lucky i answered the phone mom or becca would have asked questions this was the first i knew that any of edwards new family knew his secret identity i wasnt sure how i felt about peter knowing or about any of them knowing they knew what he did sort of the legalish parts but they didnt really know who edward was or at least thats what i had believed until now i checked my wristwatch which had gone on along with a robe i did quick math in my head and said shouldnt you be getting ready for karate class theyre painting the dojo he said i would also have asked why he had a phone in his room but he wasnt my kid i mean sixteen was a little young for your own phone wasnt it i placed first in the karate tournament last saturday he said congratulations i said its not like real fighting not like you and edward do but its still cool ive never won first place in a martial arts tournament of any kind peter youre doing good but you have a black belt in judo right yeah and youre training in other martial arts right yeah but a tournament is just kid stuff i know but edward says i have to wait until im at least old enough to sign up for military service before hell take me on anything real i did not like the sound of that at all eighteen right yeahhe sighed so heavilytwo years he made two years sound like forever i guess at sixteen it is i wanted to tell him that there were other lives to live that had nothing to do with fighting guns or violence i wanted to tell him that he couldnt follow in his almoststepfathers footsteps but i couldnt it wasnt my place to say it and peter wouldnt have listened anyway i was in the same business as his dad so i was cool too is ted there anita and he sounded chiding i know his real name yes but youre right i should never have said edward when calling this number it should be ted until im sure who im talking to im practicing he laughed again i didnt think i was that funny teds here i heard that slide of cloth again though at eight on a day we dont have school mom and ted are probably still in bed he must have rolled over to look at a clock i didnt mean to call this early i said ill call back later his voice sobered whats wrong anita you sound all stressed great i couldnt even control my voice enough to fool a teenage boy truth was id finally realized that i wasnt just asking edward to come hunt monsters i was asking him to leave his family to come hunt monsters edward used to live to find bad things that could test his skills he lived to be better faster meaner quicker more deadly than the monsters he hunted then hed met donna and suddenly he had other things to live for i wasnt sure hed ever walk down the aisle with her but he was the only father the kids had and the only husband donna had her first husband had been killed by a werewolf an eightyearold peter had picked up his fathers dropped gun and finished off the wounded shapeshifter hed saved his family while his fathers body was still twitching on the floor in some ways edward fit in just fine edward picked becca up from ballet class for gods sake but but what if i got him killed what if i got him killed and peter and becca lost another parent because i was too chickenshit to handle my own mess anita anita are you there yeah yeah peter im here you sound strange like scared almost peter was too damned perceptive for comfort sometimes i justoh hell what could i say that would fix this let edward sleep in dont wake them somethings wrong i can hear it in your voice you called because youre in trouble thats it isnt it he asked im not in trouble i said in my head i added yet silence on his end of the phone for a heartbeat youre lying to me he sounded accusatory well thats a hell of a thing to say i said with as much indignation as i could muster i wasnt lying not really i was just fudging the truth okay fudging like double chocolate with three kinds of nuts but it still wasnt completely a lie your word your word of honor he said in a very serious voice tell me you didnt call to get edwards help with some nasty monster problem shit you know youre being a pain in the ass here i said im sixteen im supposed to be a pain in the ass or thats what mom says give me your word that youre not lying to me and ill believe you give me your word and ill believe everything youve said and ill hang up and you can go back to not being in trouble damn it peter you wont give your word and then lie will you his voice held question and almost wonderment as if he didnt quite believe it no not as a general rule no edward said you wouldnt but i wasnt sure i believed him but you really wont will you no i said happy now yes he said though his voice didnt sound exactly happy tell me whats wrong why do you need edwards help i need to talk to edward but i wont tell you why or what its about im not a baby anita i know that no you dont he said i sighed i dont think youre a baby but you are a kid peter youre grownup for sixteen but id like to keep some of the darker shit away from you until you reach at least eighteen if edward wants to share with you later thats his lookout you might as well tell me anita if i ask hell tell me i hoped he was wrong but was afraid he was right if edward wants you to know hell tell you peter but i am not going to tell you and thats final is it that bad he asked and i heard the first thread of worry shit again i just couldnt win conversations with peter id only had a handful of them lately but he always seemed to talk me into a box get edward on the phone peter now i can handle myself in a fight anita i can help shit shit and double shit i was not going to win this conversation im hanging up now peter no anita im sorry im sorry and his voice went from that cynical grownup to an almost childlike panic the panic had worked better before his voice deepened dont hang up please ill get ted the phone hit wood so hard i had to put the phone away from my ear he came back on saying sorry dropped the phone im getting dressed ill go knock on their door if its bad enough for you to call edward then you need to talk to him ill stop being a kid and just get him for you he was a little angry with me but mostly frustrated he wanted to help he wanted to grow up he wanted to fight for real whatever the hell that meant what was edward teaching him did i really want to know no would i ask yes unfortunately yes god i did not need another problem on my plate right now i thought about trying to lie to edward say id just called up to chat about the latest issue of mercenaries quarterly but if i wasnt up to lying to peter edward was absolutely out of my weight class chapter ten i sat on the edge of the bathtub waiting for edward to come to the phone id insisted on privacy for the phone call though id told jeanclaude and micah who i was trying to call jeanclaude had said only help would not be unwelcome the comment said clearly that he was worried the more worried i realized he was the more worried i got i heard noise over the phone movement the phone was picked up and i heard edwards voice say hang up the other extension peter a second later he spoke directly into the phone anita peter said you needed help my kind of help his voice was that emptymiddleofnowhere accent it was his normal voice when he was playing ted forrester good ol boy he had a drawl i didnt say i needed help i said then why did you call cant i just call to chat he laughed and the laugh was strangely familiar i realized it was an echo of peters laugh earlier or maybe peters laugh was an echo of edwards they werent genetically related i knew that so what was with the laugh imitation maybe you would never call me just to chat anita thats not what we do for each other he laughed again and murmured called to chat as if the idea were too ridiculous for words i do not need you to be condescending thanks anyway i was angry and had no right to be id called him and it was me i was angry at i was wishing i hadnt calledfor so many reasons whats wrong he asked not taking offense he knew me too well to let a little angry outburst bother him i opened my mouth closed it then said im trying to decide where to start start with the dangerous part there that was edward not start at the beginning but start with the dangerous part i did call for backup but i have other backup already its not you but its not a bunch of amateurs either i was being honest the wererats were almost completely exmilitary expolice or excriminals some of the werehyenas were the same flavor of professional i had help i shouldnt have called edward you sound like youre trying to talk yourself out of asking me for help he said and his voice was curious not worried just curious i am why because peter answered the phone there was a sharp intake of breath hang up the phone peter edward said if anitas in trouble i want to know about it hang up the phone he said and dont make me ask again but now i heard the phone click well i said wait he said i sat on my side of the phone in silence wondering what we were waiting for finally edward said hes off does he listen in on phone conversations a lot no how do you know he doesnt i knowhe stopped himself and said i dont think he does i think youre a special case for peter hes in donnas old room i told him he could keep the phone if he behaved ill talk to him if hes in donnas old room where are you and she sleeping not that its any of my business i added we put a master suite on the house have you moved in then pretty much you sell your house i asked no i guess batman cant sell the bat cave something like that but his voice which had started a little friendly was not friendly now it was empty the old predonna edward talking to me he might be talking about domestic bliss and raising teenagers but he was still the coldest killer id ever met and that person was still in there i wasnt sure whether i couldnt bear the thought of him watching becca at ballet class or would have paid to see him sitting with all the other parents waiting for their leotardclad darlings if i lied well enough id just make something up and hang up why he asked in that empty voice because peter answering the phone made me realize that its not all fun and games anymore if i get you killed then they lose another father i dont want to have to explain that to peter or donna or becca but especially peter he said yeah i said since you cant lie to me just tell me anita his voice was a little softer now a little feeling to it edward liked me we were friends hed miss me if i were gone and id miss him but there was still a little question on whether one day wed find ourselves on the opposite sides of a problem and have to finally see which of us was the better man i was hoping that day would never come because there was no way for me to win the fight now dead or alive wed both lose do you know what the harlequin are i asked french clowns he said and let himself sound puzzled do you know them in any other context twenty questions isnt like you anita just talk i just wanted to see if i was the only vampire hunter extraordinaire who was totally in the dark about this it makes me feel a little better that you dont know about them either apparently jeanclaude is right they really are a big dark secret talk he said i talked i told him what little i knew about the harlequin and his band it really wasnt that much he was quiet so long that i said edward i can hear you breathing but im here anita just thinking thinking what i asked that you always let me play with the best toys and his voice wasnt empty now it was eager and what if these toys finally manage to be bigger and badder than you and me then we die just like that i said you wouldnt have regrets you mean donna and the kids yes i said and i stood starting to pace the bathroom i would regret leaving them then dont come i said and if you get killed id always believe that i could have saved you no anita ill come but i will bring backup not anyone too crazy okay he laughed that chuckle of true delight that id heard maybe six times in the entire seven years id known him i cant promise that anita fine but edward im serious i dont want to get you killed on them i cant stop being who i am just because i love donna anita i cant stop being what i am because ive got the kids to think about why not i asked and i was thinking of a conversation richard and i had had when we thought i was pregnant hed expected that if i were pregnant id stop being a federal marshal or vampire hunter i hadnt agreed because it wouldnt be me and they love me donna and becca may not know everything that peter does about me but they know enough they know what i had to do to save the kids when riker took them riker had been a very bad man he had been doing illegal archaeology digs and donnas amateur protection group had gotten in their way it actually hadnt been edward or me that first got the kids on rikers radar nice to know we werent completely to blame for what happened riker had wanted me to do a certain spell for him which truthfully i hadnt been necromancer enough to do but he wouldnt believe me he tortured the children to get my and edwards cooperation sixyearold now eightyearold becca had gotten a badly broken hand peter had been sexually molested by a female guard wed had to watch on videotape wed killed riker and all his people we rescued the kids and edward had made me give peter my backup gun edward decided in that moment that if we lost he preferred peter to be killed resisting rather than taken again i hadnt argued not after what theyd done to him i had watched peter empty my gun into the body of the woman whod hurt him hed kept dryfiring into her body until i wrestled the gun away from him i still saw his eyes when he told me i wanted her to hurt i knew that peter had lost some of his innocence the night his father died and he had to pick up a gun to protect his family hed taken a life but i think he thought it was killing a monster and that didnt really count hell once id thought the same thing about monsters killing the woman who had hurt him had taken more from him a bigger piece of his soul i couldnt even imagine how big a piece the sexual abuse stole away had it been better for him to have his revenge so quickly or had it cost him more id told him the only truth i had that night you killed her peter thats as good as revenge gets once you kill them there isnt any more revenge was always the easy part the hard part was living with it afterward living with what youd done living with what theyd done to you or those you loved anita are you there anita answer me sorry edward i didnt hear a damn thing you said youre a thousand miles away inside your own thoughts thats not a good place to be in the middle of a firefight it hasnt come to a firefight yet i said you know what i mean anita i have to round up my backup and arrange transport thatll take a day or so ill be there as soon as i can but you need to watch your back until i get there ill do my best not to get killed before you get here this isnt funny anita you seem seriously distracted i thought about it for a moment then realized what was wrong i was happy for the first time in my life i loved the men i was living with i like edward had a family to protect and mine wouldnt be tucked safely in new mexico while we cleaned this up i just realized that ive got my own family here and i dont like them being on the firing line i dont like that a lot who are you worried about he asked nathaniel micah jeanclaude all of them im looking forward to meeting your new lovers it took me a minute to realize youve never met micah and nathaniel id forgotten that jeanclaude can handle himself anita as well as anyone in this situation it sounds like the shapeshifters have you covered for now micah is head of the local wereleopards he didnt get the job on his winning personality hes a survivor and a fighter or hed be dead already is this supposed to be a pep talk i asked he gave a sound that was almost a laugh yeah well you suck at it he laughed then which of your lovers is cannon fodder anita who are you really the most worried about i took a deep breath let it out slow and said nathaniel why him because hes not a fighter ive taken him to the gun range and he knows the basics then i remembered a moment when chimera a very bad guy had come to town i remembered an ambush when nathaniel had been with me id forgotten hed killed someone and id forgotten i hadnt even thought how it might have affected him some leopard queen i was fuck anita you still there yeah i just remembered something that i guess i was trying to forget nathaniel shot someone killed him to save me one of the wererats had gotten killed and he picked up the guys gun and used it just like id taught him i was suddenly cold down to my toes all the awful things that people had made nathaniel do over the years while he was on the street and it had been me that forced him to kill hed done it out of love but motive didnt change the end product someone was still dead hell do anita there was a tone to edwards voice approval maybe you know i hadnt thought about what hed done until just now what kind of person forgets that did he seem messed up about it no then let it go edward said just like that i said just like that im not good at letting go no youre not how much does peter know about your real life as assassin to the undead and furry thats my call anita not yours his voice wasnt friendly now id love to argue but youre right i havent laid eyes on peter since he was fourteen he turned fifteen that year oh so not two years since i saw him but more like a year and a half that gives me so much more room to bitch at you for introducing him to the scary stuff im just saying that he wasnt a kid when we met him he was a young man and ive treated him like one no wonder he adores you i said it was edwards turn to be quiet i can hear you breathing i said you know how i said we dont chat yeah i finally realized just now youre the only person i can talk about this with what peter no in my head i went through the list of things that edward could only talk to me about nothing came to mind im all ears donna is pushing for kids that stopped me it was my turn to be at a loss for words i managed to stumble out some words the wrong words really i mean i guess i thought she was too old to start over shes only fortytwo anita im sorry edward i didnt mean it that way i just never saw you with a baby ditto he said and he sounded angry now too worse yet i felt my throat closing tight my eyes burning what the fuck was wrong with me do you ever wish you had a life where you could see babies and shit like that i asked and fought to keep the sudden rise of emotion under check no he said never i asked you thinking about a baby he asked then i told him something i had never expected to tell edward i had a serious pregnancy scare last month false positive and everything lets just say it made me reassess some parts of my life the biggest difference between us anita is that if i have a baby with donna she carries it not me you would have a lot more trouble doing it i know the whole girl thing are you seriously thinking about babies no i was relieved as hell when i found out i wasnt pregnant howd your lovers take it you know most normal people would call them boyfriends no one woman could date as many men as you have in your life anita you can fuck them but you cant date them im having enough trouble having a relationship with one woman i cant imagine juggling a half dozen of them maybe im just better at relationships than you are i said and my voice was not friendly i wasnt close to tears i had the beginnings of a nice anger warming me up maybe girls usually are better at it wait a minute how do you know how many men im sleeping with you and your little harem are big news in the preternatural community are we and i let it be hostile dont be that way id be bad at my job if i didnt listen to my sources you want me good at my job right ted forrester is a legal vampire hunter a federal marshal just like you it had creeped me out when id discovered edward had a badge it just seemed wrong but too many of the vampire hunters had failed the firearms test for the newer ones too many hadnt made it through the more detailed training the government had turned further afield to get enough vampire hunterfederal marshals to cover the country edward had been grandfathered in on the firearms training no sweat but the fact that ted forrester had stood up to government scrutiny meant either that edward had some highplaced friends or that ted forrester was his real identitythe name hed gone into the military with his actual true name id asked him which it was and he wouldnt answer of course edward wouldnt answer such a mystery man i dont like being spied on edward you know that did edward know about the ardeur how long had it been since id filled him in on the metaphysics in my life i couldnt remember how did your lov boyfriends take the news of the almostbaby he asked do you really care i wouldnt have asked if i didnt care he said and that was probably absolutely true fine i said pretty well micah and nathaniel were ready to rearrange their lives to play daddy and nanny if i decided to keep it richard proposed and i turned him down jeanclaude seemed like he always was cautious and waiting for me to decide what wouldnt piss me off i thought about that i think asher was pretty sure it wasnt his so he didnt offer too much comment i knew you were living with micah and nathaniel but when did jeanclaude start sharing you with other vampires i didnt think master vamps shared well asher is sort of an exception for jeanclaude he sighed normally id enjoy playing with you anita but its early and i know youve had a hard morning whats that mean i asked and i couldnt keep the suspicion out of my voice he made a sound halfway between a chuckle and an mmm sound ill tell you the rumors ive heard and you tell me how big a lie they are rumors i said what rumors anita thanks to my new status i hang with a lot of creature killers youre not the only one whos got ties to the monsters in their town admittedly you have the most intimate ties to them and that means what i asked and didnt try to keep the irritation out of my voice it means no one else is fucking their local master of the city put that way it was hard to argue with the intimate part fine the harlequin only come if youve gotten high enough on the radar to attract the councils attention for good or not so good right yeah i said i could just ask you what youve been doing you and your vampires that has attracted their attention but i think itll go quicker if i ask which rumors are true i need to get off the phone and start gathering backup the backup may take longer than transport or the weaponry ask i said not sure i wanted him to ask at all that jeanclaude has become his own bloodline and broken from his old mistress i was surprised very surprised how the hell did that rumor get started were wasting time anita true or false part true he is his own bloodline that makes it so he doesnt have to answer to his old mistress but he hasnt broken with europe hes just stopped being belle mortes beckandcall boy that youve got a string of lovers among jeanclaudes vamps and the local shapeshifters i really didnt want to answer this question was i embarrassed yes i dont see what my love life has to do with the harlequin coming to town lets just say that the answer to this question will decide me on whether i ask something else something i didnt believe now im beginning to wonder wonder what i asked answer the question anitado you have a string of lovers i sighed and said define string more than two three i guess he sounded uncertain yes then he was quiet for a second then continued that jeanclaude makes everyone male or female fuck him before they can join his kiss not true that he makes the men fuck you not true and someones having a better fantasy life with my life than i am he gave a small laugh then said if you had told me no on the first question i wouldnt even ask this next one but here it is that youre some kind of daywalking vampire that feeds off sex instead of blood i dont believe that one but i thought you might be interested in what some of your fellow monster hunters are saying about you i think theyre just jealous of your kill count i swallowed hard and went back to sit on the edge of the tub anita he said youre awfully quiet i know anita its not true youre not a daywalking vamp not the vampire part not exactly how not exactly do you know the term ardeur i know the french word but thats not what you mean is it i explained briefly as coldly as i could just the facts what the ardeur was you have to fuck people every few hours or what eventually i die but before that i start draining the life out of damian and then nathaniel what i have a vampire servant and an animal to call what id never heard him sound so astonished i repeated myself there isnt even a rumor about this anita human servants cant have vampire servants it doesnt work that way i know that i said nathaniel is your animal to call apparently does the council know this yep well shit no wonder they sicced their dogs on you youre lucky they didnt just kill you the council is divided on the appropriate action to take about jeanclaude and us divided how some of them want us dead but its not a majority vote they cant agree so the harlequin come to break the tie is that it he asked maybe honestly im not sure is there anything else youve done that might make them decide to kill you quicker like before i can get there i thought about the fact that i might be a panwere i thought about a lot of things then sighed then i thought of one thing that wed done that might bother the other masters of the city in the united states enough to cry for council help maybe how maybe anita can you wait for me to get backup or do i need to get a plane and get my ass to st louis thats what i need to know truth edward i dont know jeanclaude and i did something back in november that was pretty powerful it might be enough to scare the harlequin what did you do we had a little private gettogether with a couple of the visiting masters of the city the two that jeanclaude calls friends and he said and belle morte interfered from all the way in europe she messed with me and the master of chicago augustine he said auggie to his friends you know him of him edward said then you know how powerful he is yes we rolled him edward rolled how he asked jeanclaude and i fed off him we both fed the ardeur off him we fed on him and through him we fed on every person he had brought to our lands we did this massive feed on them all it was an amazing power rush and all of us vamps beasties anyone tied to either jeanclaude or me by metaphysics gained power from it ill contact the backup i want they can join me later ill be on the ground inhe paused as if checking his watchfour hours five at the outside ill be in st louis before sundown you think its that serious i asked if i were a vampire and you had a vampire servant i might kill you just for that but if you guys rolled augustine one of the most powerful masters in this country then yeah anita theyll be nervous im just surprised the harlequin didnt hit st louis earlier i think they needed the excuse of malcolm and his misbehaving church the council is truly divided about jeanclaude and his power base i think maybe the council wouldnt agree to let the harlequin near us but now that theyre here checking out the church of eternal life well two birds with one stone sounds reasonable he said ill be there as soon as i can anita thanks edward dont thank me yet why not ill see you in a few hours anita watch your back like a son of a bitch if these guys are masters they may have wereanimals and humans to do their daywalking just because the sun is up doesnt make you safe i know that edward i probably know that better than you do maybe but be careful until i get there ill do my best but i was already talking to an empty phone line hed hung up i hung up too chapter eleven nathaniel was asleep in jeanclaudes red silk sheets jeanclaude himself was in ashers room for the day but hed made a point of telling me hed had the sheets changed to red because the three of us look so lovely against red micahs eyes caught the light from the partially opened bathroom door his curly brown hair was a heavy darkness around the delicate triangle of his face the door was our version of a night light here since there was no bedside lamp and the other light switch was across the room by the door micahs eyes caught that faint glow and glittered with it his eyes were leopard eyes or looked like leopard eyes a doctor had told him that the optics were still human but the eyes themselves werent splitting hairs i guess chimera the same bad guy whod made the ambush that caused nathaniel to pick up a gun and shoot for real had also forced micah into animal form so long that he couldnt come all the way back his eyes were never human id asked him once what color theyd started as and hed said brown i couldnt picture it i couldnt picture his face with anything but the greengold of the eyes hed come to me with they were simply micahs eyes anything else would have made it the face of a stranger his voice was quiet that voice you use when youre trying not to wake someone in the room what did he say hell be here in four or five hours his backup will be following i came to the edge of the bed what backup i dont know you didnt ask no truthfully it had never occurred to me to ask you trust him that much micah asked i nodded micah rolled under the red silk so he could reach my hand he tried to draw me onto the bed but in a silk robe on silk sheets id learned better they were too slippery i took my hand back and undid the robes sash he lay back and watched me with that look a man can getthe look that is part sex part possession part just male its not a look that has much to do with love not the kind that includes hearts and flowers anyway but it has everything to do with being together being real edward was right micah was my lover not my boyfriend we dated we did movies theatre picnics even at nathaniels insistence but in the end what had drawn us together had been sex lust like a forest fire that could have burned our lives down around our ears but instead had saved us or thats how i felt i hadnt really asked him in so many words serious face he whispered i nodded and let the robe slip to the floor i stood in front of him naked and had the feeling id had from almost the first moment that my skin was thick with need he reached for me again and this time i let him help me climb up on the big bed the bed was big enough that he could draw me down beside him without either of us touching nathaniels sleeping form in november when jeanclaude and i had rolled augustine of chicago wed also figured out something else my instant lust for micah and his for me had been vampire powers not jeanclaudes or augustines but mine my vampire powers mine and mine alone my powers may have started with jeanclaudes marks but they had mutated with my necromancy and become something else something more i was like a vampire of belle mortes line and all of her line had powers dealing with sex and love though not real love not usually that was beyond most of belles line my version of her ardeur allowed me to see the strongest need in someones heart and my own and meet those needs when micah had come to me id needed a helpmate someone to help me run the shapeshifter coalition that wed just established someone to help me with the wereleopards that id inherited when i killed their old leader id needed help and someone who didnt see my coldblooded practicality as a bad thing micah had met those needs and i had given him his greatest wish to have his own wereleopards safe from chimera the sexual sadist who had taken them over id killed chimera freed them all and micah had moved in with me just like that it had been so unlike me and in november wed realized why my own vampire tricks had made us a couple micah was under the silk and i was on top of it his hands danced down my body as our lips found each other we must have moved too much because nathaniel made a small noise it made us freeze in midmotion and look at him his face was still peaceful eyes still closed his hair a gleam in the near dark vampire powers had made nathaniel my animal to call and made us love each other too it was real love true love but it had begun with vampire mind tricks but belle mortes powers cut both ways as auggie had said you can only cut someone as deep as youre willing to be cut apparently id been willing to be cut to the heart nathaniel stirred in his sleep again his face flexed frowned he made another small sound it was his bad dream sound hed had more nightmares of late his therapist said it was because he felt safe enough with us to explore his deeper pain we were his safe haven why did safety raise all the shit deeper it seemed like it should have been the other way around didnt it we reached for him at the same timemicahs hand going for the bare paleness of his shoulder my hand going for his cheek we stroked him wordlessly most of the time petting him in his sleep was all it took to chase the bad things away reallife bad things werent so easy there was a soft knock on the door we both looked toward it and nathaniel stirred one arm pulling out of the covers he blinked awake his eyes confused as if he expected to be somewhere else he saw us and visibly relaxed he smiled and said what is it i shook my head still lying pressed in micahs arms micah said dont know i called what it was remus one of the exmilitary werehyenas theyd been hired after chimera nearly destroyed the bodybuilders and martial artists of the hyenas as peter had said it wasnt real the hyenas had liked showy muscle that had never seen real battle theyd learned that just because muscle is pretty doesnt mean its the real deal its the ulfric he wants in ulfric wolf king richard zeeman was at our door the question was why i wanted to ask what he wanted but he might take it wrong so i looked at micah he shrugged lying back one arm still curved around me holding me along the line of his body i stayed propped up so i could see the door and so most of my nakedness was covered richard was my lover but he didnt share nearly as well as everyone else did i wouldnt get out of bed for him but i wouldnt make it as bad as it could be by flaunting either no matter what i did wed probably end up fighting when we werent having sex thats what we did we fought and had makeup sex and he let me feed the ardeur off him it wasnt much of a relationship lately anitarichards voicelet me in let him in remus i said nathaniel rolled onto his back so that the covers pooled at his waist and the expanse of his upper body was naked to the light that came in through the door as richard came inside he hesitated at the door watching us in the rectangle of light from the hallway his hair had finally grown out enough to go a little past his shoulders in heavy chestnut waves his hair looked black with a nimbus of gold around it now but his hair was brown with highlights of gold and copper when the light hit it just right he was wearing jeans and a jean jacket with a heavy wool collar he had a small suitcase in one hand he set it down on the floor as he came through the door i caught a glimpse of the guards in the hallway as he shut the door claudia wererat and one of the few other women who carried a gun besides me looked a question at me i shook my head it was my way of saying let it go i wasnt sure it was a good idea but i couldnt figure out a way to refuse him access to the bedroom without starting a fight i didnt want to start the fight may i turn on the light he asked very polite i looked at the other two men they nodded and shrugged sure i said i was left blinking into the sudden glare it wasnt that bright a light but after almost complete darkness it seemed bright when my eyes adjusted i could finally look at richard he was as he had always been six feet one inch of handsome masculinity perfect cheekbones and a nearly permanent tan showed that somewhere back in all that dutch blood was something darker and less european id always bet on american indian but they actually didnt know he was almost heartrendingly handsome so why hadnt my new vampire powers made us the perfect couple too because for my abilities to work you had to know what you wanted what you really wanted richard didnt know that he was too conflicted too full of selfloathing to know what his hearts desire was he looked at the coffin that sat near the far wall closer to the door than to the bed jeanclaude he made it a question damian i said he nodded so if you start draining him of life youll be able to check on him richard had actually carried damians nearly lifeless body to me once so i could save the vampire yes i pulled up the sheet so that my breasts were more covered it bared a little more of micahs chest but that was okay his body was already blocking all but the upper curve of my hip from richards sight covered was better until i knew what richard wanted wheres jeanclaude sleeping ashers room i said he had left his suitcase by the door but he was in the middle of the floor halfway between the door and the bed he licked his lips and wouldnt quite look at us he was nervouswhy jason has his new girlfriend bunking with him perdita perdy i said shed come to us from the master of cape cod she was a mermaid a real live mermaid the first id ever met though id never seen her look anything but human i was told she really could be part fish but id never seen it richard nodded micah moved against me and let me know hed thought of something oh do you want to stay here with us micah asked richard closed those perfectly brown eyes the color of milk chocolate he took a deep breath let it out slow then nodded we all exchanged a look which was almost finished by the time he opened those eyes we must have looked surprised though because he said im a shapeshifter we like big puppy piles for sleeping most of you guys do i said but youve never willingly slept with me and any of the other guys this is who you are anita this is who we both are he shoved his big hands into his jacket pockets and looked at the floor i was on a date when i got the call that some insanely powerful vampires are in town he looked up and his face held that anger that hed gotten from me through jeanclaudes vampire marks he shared my rage at the world and it had made him even harder to deal with i had to call it an early evening and i couldnt explain to her why we had to cut our date short too nathaniel said richard looked at him it was not an entirely friendly look but his words were civil you guys were trying to celebrate some kind of anniversary yes i said sorry it got ruined sorry your date got cut short i said my we were being terribly polite they found bugs in my house anita my dates my phone calls everything recorded he rocked on the heels of his boots i know i said same for us the circus is the most secure place we have so im here for the duration scary i said the scary part is that i might be endangering the kids i teach if its not fixed by monday maybe i should take a leave of absence he seemed to be asking my opinion and i didnt know what to say but micah did weve all been blindsided by this lets get some sleep richard nodded his head a little too rapidly a little too often there were guest rooms in the underground there was even a couch big enough for him to use in the living room so why was he here i can stay he asked it without looking at us yes micah said yes i said my voice soft he looked up nathaniel im not dominant to anyone in this room i dont get a vote its polite to ask richard said yes i said it is i appreciate it so do i nathaniel said but you dont have to ask it was your bed before it was ours that seemed a little impolitic but strangely richard smiled nice of someone to remember that but he didnt sound angry as he said it he picked up his suitcase and started walking toward the bed he walked past the bed and we all watched him he put the suitcase down beside the armoire in the corner that held extra clothes for all of us he knelt opened the case and began to unpack he took his jacket off first and put it on a hanger in the armoire then he took out shirts socks and underwear and put them in the drawers he unpacked as if we werent there we all exchanged looks again this was too weird entirely too civilized for richard the other shoe had to drop soon and all hell would break loose wouldnt it micah moved the covers letting me know to get off them enough to get under them he was right discretion was the better part of valor we were all three under the red silk sheets when richard finally finished putting everything awayincluding one trip with a toiletry kit to the bathroom he left the door wide open so he had plenty of light then walked to the light by the door and turned it off it was so normal it scared me i hadnt seen him this reasonable in months maybe years my shoulders and arms were tight with tension it felt like the quiet before the storm but i couldnt tell if the tension was just me projecting richard and i could share each others dreams let alone thoughts but right now he and i were shielding so tight that nothing got through we were separate from each other metaphysically or as separate as jeanclaudes marks would let us be it was safer that way richard walked to the bed his eyes downcast not looking at us he sat down on the bed near me the three of us scooted back a little to give him more room he must have felt the bed move but he ignored it he pulled off his boots and let them fall to the floor then socks he took off his tshirt and i was suddenly looking at the muscled expanse of his naked back his hair caressed the edges of all that bare skin i fought the urge to touch him i was afraid of what would happen afraid that he would take it wrong he had to stand up to undo his belt unbutton the fly the sound of the buttons coming undone jerked things low in my body richard had been the man who taught me the joys of buttonfly jeans micahs arm curled around my waist drawing me in closer to his body was he jealous richard hesitated as a shapeshifter nudity should have been second nature maybe first but he didnt like being nude in front of my other lovers he just didnt he stripped the jeans down in one motion if hed been wearing underwear he wasnt now the sight of him nude did what it always did it made me catch my breath and think about touching him all richard had to do to win any fight with me was to strip i just couldnt argue with him when he looked so scrumptious he let the jeans hit the floor then turned toward the bed his eyes were still downcast his hair spilling forward around his face he finally looked up and our eyes met i didnt try to keep my face blank i let him see what i thought of him beautiful and nude before me even with micahs body pressed against me in the bed richard was still beautiful he smiled half shy and half the old richard the richard who had known how much i loved him and how much he meant to me he lifted the covers up and slid under them he was tall enough that he had no trouble getting into the bed without help scoot over please he said micah scooted moving me with him a little richard slid into the space wed made i felt the bed move which meant nathaniel had moved too the bed wasnt a kingsize it was an orgysize bed wed had more people than this on it at the same time sometimes even for sleeping richard scooted down until he was almost pressed to the front of my body but not quite micahs hand was still around my waist im not sure where to put my hands richard said micah laughed but it was a good guy laugh i know what you mean where do you want to put them nathaniel asked i glanced over my shoulder and found that nathaniel was peering over micahs more slender body at us im nervous tired i want to be touched and held youre a shapeshifter micah said we all like skin contact when were shaky richard nodded he was propped up on one elbow and he made even nathaniel look small richard was one of those large men who didnt seem that large until moments like this then you appreciated the full physical presence of him i brought wolves with me theyre in one of the guest rooms i could have my puppy pile i didnt have to come here for that i swallowed hard enough that it hurt micah said then why are you here im tired of running from myself i wasnt sure that answered the question but richard seemed to think it did and i felt micah nod behind me stop running im not sure i know how it was like i wasnt there as if whatever issues they were discussing had less to do with me than with the two of them maybe the three of themor did nathaniel feel as left out as i did this is a good start micah said richard nodded then finally gave me the full attention of those eyes those eyes that i once thought would be the eyes i woke up with every morning lately he hadnt slept over much i dont know how to do this do what i whispered i want to kiss you but i dont want to have sex with everyone in this bed i wasnt sure if he meant he didnt want to have sex while the other men were in the bed or if he didnt want to actually have sex with them i was pretty sure both were true ive been wanting to touch you since you took off your shirt i said there that was the truth maybe if we told the truth wed be okay he smiled and it was richards smile that smile that he sometimes gave that let you know he really did know how lovely he was to look at he usually came off humble but then he had that smile he leaned in toward me his hands still chastely to himself our lips touched his hair spilled along my cheek micahs hand eased from around my waist letting me know i could move where i wanted to move or thats how i took it i let my hand rest against the swell of richards chest his hand cupped the side of my face we kissed and his lips were still as soft as full as kissable as they had always been my hand slid down the curve of his chest to his waist he pulled me in against his body and the kiss grew to something fuller deeper my body fell against his my hand tracing across his back not sure whether to touch lower his body was already growing with need i wanted to react to that need but hed said he didnt want to have sex with all of us in the bed and no one was leaving he drew back from the kiss breathless panting eyes laughing god how do you do that to me my own voice came breathy you too he laughed then his gaze slid past me to the other men his eyes darkened for a moment i cant i cant not yet truthfully richard this is more than i ever thought youd do with micah and nathaniel he nodded me too would it totally spoil things if i asked what changed your mind nathaniel asked it id wanted to ask it but i wouldnt have richard looked across the bed at the other man its none of your business no its not nathaniel said richard bowed his head then nodded okay i love anita im trying to learn to love all of her even the part that wants to live with two other men his eyes were uncertain a little angry nathaniel said my therapist told me that if im an equal partner in our relationship i need to ask for what i want did yours tell you that you need to resolve your feelings about anita richard ignored the question what did you ask anita what arent you getting from her ill answer yours if youll answer mine richard nodded as if that was fair yeah my therapist says i have to either come to terms with anitas life or move on you know im into the bondage and submission scene nathaniel said i wanted not to be naked in the bed with them while they had this conversation but if they could be honest i could lie there and let them do it i know raina talked about you a lot raina had been the old lupa of the wolf pack shed taken richards virginity and trained nathaniel to be a good little pain slut micah and i looked back to nathaniel it was like a therapy tennis match nathaniel nodded anita wont do it with me and i want her to shes not much more comfortable with that side of herself than i am richard said i know nathaniel said did she agree to do it not yet are you going to leave her if she doesnt come across with it micah and i lay back between them feeling superfluous ive asked permission to have someone else abuse me but save sex for anita richard looked at me finally and i wished he hadnt you really know how to pick them dont you whats that supposed to mean i asked but it was hard trying to sound indignant naked in a bed with three men richard laughed a good open laugh he kissed me hard and fast i lay there and frowned at him it means lets go to sleep he settled on his side facing me i hesitated a second then turned onto my other side it started a chain reaction with micah and nathaniel following suit it took us a while but finally we were all settled richards body spooned along the back of mine micah against me and distant nathaniel against him my hand went over both of them so i could still touch nathaniel richard had the hardest time figuring out where to put his arm he finally seemed to think to hell with it because he let his arm follow the line of mine so he was both holding more of me and helping me hold the other two men for sex it would have been fun but for sleeping i thought id have trouble relaxing but either it had been a long night or the sensation of being held between richard and micahs body was more comforting than i realized nathaniel went to sleep first as he always did micah and richard went at almost the same time sleep wrapped over me richards breath warm against my neck chapter twelve i woke in a tangle of bodies i was on my back with micah and richard half on top of me as if even in their sleep they had fought over who would touch the most of me the scent of their skins had mingled into a rich perfume that tightened my body but i was still pinned and not comfortable at all i was so tangled that i couldnt even rise enough to see nathaniel on the far side of micah i thought the uncomfortable position had been what woke me then i caught movement at the foot of the bed i held my breath was it one of the guards somehow i knew it wasnt the faint light from the halfopen bathroom door didnt really show me anything it was almost as if the light were being sucked at by the dark as if eventually the darkness would swallow the light completely my pulse was thudding in my throat so hard i could barely breathe past it and swallowing hurt i knew who was in the dark and i knew i dreamed but just because its a dream doesnt mean it cant hurt you what is that i screamed a short sharp scream i was looking into richards face he was awake he started easing up to sit and i moved with him he tried to shake micah awake but i didnt bother id had this dream before wake them up he whispered eyes searching the darkness her animals to call are all cats they wont wake who marmee i stopped the words with fingers against his lips dont i whispered i dont know why we were whispering she would hear us but theres something about being in the dark when you know the predator is out there that makes you whisper you try to be small and quiet you pray that it passes you by but this wasnt a predator exactly this was the entire night given life and substance and a mind i smelled jasmine and summer rain and other scents of a land that i had never seen except in vision and dream the land where marmee noir had begun i had no idea how old she was didnt want to know i was a necromancer i could have tasted her age on my psychic tongue but i didnt know if i could swallow that many centuries i feared id choke necromancer her voice eased through the night like a sweetscented wind i managed to swallow past the beating of my heart marmee noir i said and my voice was only a little hoarse it was better with richard beside me awake his arm wrapped around me as if he felt it too that together we were more here maybe our accidental sharing of dreams richard and me and jeanclaude had a purpose one we just hadnt understood until now i leaned into the curve of richards body and his arm tightened my hand on his bare chest let me feel the beat of his fear against my palm the darkness gathered almost the way light will narrow down to a point of brightness except this was darkness compacted squeezed down as if a small black hole were forming in front of our eyes the black hole took on the vague shape of a woman in a cloak i thought very carefully in my head at richard dont look at her face i know the rules he said out loud he had heard me good great mindtomind talking was still not my best thing in dream or out of it do you truly believe that not looking upon my face will save you great she read minds too id had much lesser vamps be able to do it i shouldnt have been surprised tell me again why micah and nathaniel wont wake richard asked his voice soft but not a whisper anymore it was too late for whispering shed found us necromancer she said cats are her creatures to call all cats so she can keep them out of the dream jeanclaude was with me last time and she was able to keep him out too she doesnt do wolves your wolf will not save you this time necromancer how about mine richard said and a low growl trickled out from between his lips it raised the hair on my arms and that part of me where the beasts waited stirred the best i can describe it is that the place is like a cave where my animals wait they walk up a long corridor to get to me since theyre inside me that cant exactly be right but its the visualization that works for me in dream though the wolf inside me could come out and play my wolf was pale white and cream with a black saddle and marks on her head she crouched in front of me and joined her growl with richards i dug my free hand into her fur and found it like last time soft coarse i could feel the vibration of the growl through my hand feel the muscle and meat of her body she was real my shewolf she was real richard stopped growling and stared at the wolf she turned eyes that were brown and glowing to him my eyes when vampire powers had filled them they stared at each other then she turned back to the darkness when richard looked down at me his eyes were the amber of his wolf your master has left you both with the last piece undone she said her voice floated around the almostbody shed formed from the shadows she came to the foot of the bed the wolf crouched and growled that sound that was absolutely serious it was the last warning sound before violence she didnt try to touch the bed she actually stopped moving i remembered seeing her body in that distant room jerk when my wolf bit her in dream last time had it hurt her enough to make her hesitate had it hurt her enough to make a true threat god i hoped so you can still be enslaved to any master stronger than he and there is no one stronger than me necromancer i clung to the wolfs fur and richards body i believe that last part marmee noir then why has your master left this door open the question puzzled me i do not know that expression on your face i have been too long without humans im puzzled i said i will help you not be puzzled necromancer i came tonight to make you mine to shatter your triumvirate and make you my human servant i do not need to share blood to own your soul i was trying to breathe past my pulse again and having trouble doing it you wont touch her richard said and his voice sounded gravelly the beginnings of the change in the sound of his words i think you are right wolf i think it would be a battle with you by her side i am not ready for battle not yet but there are others who know what jeanclaude has not done who i managed to ask do i need to say the word she asked i opened my mouth to say it but richard said its against your laws to say it out loud a killing offense jeanclaude said she laughed and the darkness tightened around the bed like a giants fist you knew could feel that it could crush the bed and everyone on it if it wanted to that is not the trick i have come to play wolf but fine harlequin they know you are not safe they know that i am close to waking they fear the darkness everyones afraid of you i said the wolf had begun to relax under my grip you could only hold on to emergency mode for so long apparently we were talking not fighting fine by me true and i would have taken you tonight i planned on it you said that already richard said his voice a little more human but sullen then let me not repeat myself wolf her anger was not hot but cold as if an icy wind danced across my bare skin richard shivered beside me i didnt think id have to caution him to be nice that flex of power explained it nicely by tomorrow they will be upon you and i do not want them to have you have me how i asked i will allow jeanclaude to have you because you are already his but no one else i would prefer you were my human servant but jeanclaude is acceptable no one else necromancer i will destroy you before i allow the harlequin to make you their slave why do i matter to you i like the taste of you necromancer she said and no one else can have you i am a jealous goddess and i do not share power i swallowed past the lump in my throat i nodded as if that made sense to me a parting gift necromancer wolf the shadowed form vanished but she wasnt gone the darkness suddenly had weight and grew thicker as if the night itself could become so thick it would eventually crawl down your throat and choke you shed done almost exactly that to me before the scent of jasmine and rain was thick on my tongue the wolf growled and richard echoed her can you bite that which you cannot find her voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere my mistake was trying to be too human for you i do not repeat mistakes the wolf crouched but marmee noir was right there was no body to bite here now i had to find a way to visualize a target for my wolf i struggled to believe that my wolf could bite the night itself richard grabbed my shoulders turned me to him his eyes were still amber and inhuman he kissed me he drew back enough to say i can taste her power in your mouth i nodded he kissed me again and this time he stayed with our mouths pressed together he poured that warm rising energy that was shapeshifter into me he pushed it into me through our mouths his hands our bodies i kept my grip on my wolf but the rest of me i gave to richard and gradually i could taste pine and leaf mold rich and thick and foresty i smelled the musk of wolf fur i smelled pack i smelled home and the last taste of jasmine vanished under the taste of richards power richards wolf and finally at the end simply the taste of richard the sweet thick taste of his kiss the dream ended with a kiss chapter thirteen i woke on the floor of jeanclaudes bedroom with nathaniel staring down at me i glanced to my right and found richard on the floor with micah beside him there were guards in the room and the smell of burning richards first words were you all right i nodded his second words were whats burning the bed micah said what i asked the cross in its bag that you have underneath your pillow got hot enough that it set the pillow on fire micah said shit i said claudia appeared above me with a fire extinguisher in her hands what the hell happened anita i stared up at her and there was a lot of her to stare up at she was one of the tallest people id ever met and lifted weights in a serious fashion her black hair was in its usual tight ponytail her face free of makeup and still strikingly beautiful that bitch queen vampire came again didnt she remus said i tried to sit up but if nathaniel hadnt caught me id have fallen back to the floor the last time id fought off the darkness id been damn near killed by my own beasts trying to tear their way out of my human body apparently today id just be weak i could live with that remus was standing scowling at the foot of the bed he was tall muscled and blond but his face was a crisscross of scars as if hed been badly broken and put back together again when he was angry enough his face mottled and you could see the pale lines against the flushed skin of his face he almost never made eye contact with anyone i think because he didnt want to see in others faces what they thought of his own but when he got upset enough hed meet your eyes then you could see how lovely the eyes were all green and gray with long lashes tonight i got a good dose of the eyes i leaned into the warm curve of nathaniels body and said yeah it was the mother of all darkness at least your beasts arent trying to tear you apart this time claudia said yeah i said at least then i felt something stirring inside me as if something big and furred had brushed the inside of my body oh shit i whispered nathaniel leaned in and sniffed just above my face i smell something cat but its not leopard he closed his eyes and breathed in deep its not lion i shook my head richard said she said it was a parting gift i looked inside myself in that place where the beasts waited there was a gleam of eyes then a face came out of the shadows a face the color of night and flame tiger oh shit i said louder tiger crap claudia said to my knowledge there was only one weretiger in the entire st louis area christine worked as an insurance agent and was miles away shed never get here in time for me to share my beast with her and keep it from tearing me apart either marmee noir had decided it was time for me to finally be a shapeshifter for real and shed chosen tiger or she meant to kill me if she couldnt have me no one could possessive bitch but i was better at controlling the beast than i had been the last time she tried this i called the other animals we could play metaphysical tag for a while at least the black panther looked frail compared to the great striped beast the wolf growled and flared its ruff of fur the tiger stared at them waiting the lioness came from the darkness last almost the same size as the tiger they were animals that should never have met in the wild never have tried their great strengths against one another but the inside of my body was a lot weirder than any zoo the beasts stared at the newcomer and we waited by calling them all at once i kept myself from trying to turn into any single one of them but eventually my body would choose and when that happened there had to be a weretiger in the room call christine micah said hed helped me learn this control he knew what i was doing jeanclaude warned me that anita might be collecting more kittycats remus said so we went shopping he turned to one of the guards by the door go get soledad we need her asap the man went out the door at a jog remus turned back to me shell do what needs doing shes a wererat i managed to say shes pretending to be one of rafaels rats but shes a tiger we had to promise to keep her secret before shed agree to stay in town shes probably running from an arranged marriage tigers are weird about keeping it in the family claudia said what i said well explain later promise claudia said remus said most of the solo tigers ive met all hide what they are really well most of them can even hide their energy enough to pass for human i wanted to look at richard but didnt dare even the thought made the wolf stand up straighter and think about coming closer once richard had played human for me and id been fooled i buried my face against nathaniels arm smelled his leopard and the wolf quieted but the leopard began to pace i still didnt have a werelion to call my own i wasnt even sure we had a lion in the place tonight but i should have known that remus and claudia would think of it we better send for the lions too she said remus just looked at the door one of the other guards opened the door then hesitated which one travis the guard went i would have protested the choice but of the few lions we had he was probably one of the best none of the local lions really appealed to methey were too weak my lioness didnt want food she wanted a mate id worked hard not to give her one eventually shed pick one whether i liked it or not or that was the prevailing theory since what i was doing metaphysically was pretty much impossible it was just a theory none of us truly knew how all this was going to turn out i sat in nathaniels arms and tried to think evenly about all the beasts but nathaniel was too close and the scent of his skin too real the leopard turned and began to pace up that corridor that led to pain i gripped nathaniels arm i cant hold them richard crawled to me and put his arm by my face the musk of wolf was there to slow the leopard and send it circling around not trying to come out but now the wolf paced toward the light not good travis got there before soledad his blondbrown curls were tousled from sleep his face still not wholly awake he was wearing the bottoms of a pair of cotton pajamas and nothing else theyd dragged him from bed with no time to do anything he was a college student and i wondered briefly if his rex lion king had made him stay here with us instead of going to class he knelt by my legs and didnt even react to the fact that i was nude either the guard had explained the problem or he could feel it his sleepy face began to clear and an intelligence that was both too acute and one of his best features began to fill his goldbrown eyes he held his wrist out to me and the lioness began to pace the three of them played tag with my beasts as one moved they traded whose skin i was smelling but it would not last eventually my body would pick someone the tiger moved up and there was no tiger to smell but the others distracted me calling their beasts keeping us playing our metaphysical musical chairs except i was the chair i waited for the tiger to try to tear me apart as the other three beasts had done periodically but the tiger sat there waiting wolf leopard lion the three men played me like a game of tag putting their bare skin close enough for me to smell it touch it and the tiger waited then a thing happened that had never happened before with any of the other beaststhe tiger began to fade like some monstrous version of the cheshire cat it began to fade in pieces i settled back in nathaniel and richards arms with travis kneeling beside us travis was close but not as close as the other two my mistake the tiger fading had made me let my guard down big mistake the leopard and wolf paced around each other the lioness saw her opportunity and charged past them up that long black tunnel inside me the leopard and wolf were still circling each other the lioness didnt care about them she just wanted to be real richard put his wrist near my face but it was too late for simple measures the lioness hit my body as if it were a wall it felt like a small car crashed into me from the inside the impact jerked me off the floor tore me out of their surprised hands my body hit the floor and they tried to cradle me but it was too late the lioness stretched inside my body trying to fit all that huge cat inside me there was no room i was too small the lioness was trapped trapped in a small dark space she reacted like any wild animal she tried to destroy the trap tried to claw and bite her way out of it the trouble was my body was what she was trying to tear her way out of i shrieked while the muscles in my body tried to tear themselves off my bones you try to forget how much it hurts and then its happening and you cant forget cant think cant be cant do anything but hurt weight pressing me down hands holding my wrists on the floor something pinning my lower body i opened my eyes and found travis above me the lioness screamed her frustration because shed seen him before she didnt like him she didnt want him travis tried to grab my face in his hands tried to take my beast into him but the lioness was too close to the surface and we agreed on one thing travis was weak we didnt want him i bit him sank teeth into his wrist the lioness meant it to chase him away and so did i but the moment that hot blood spilled into my mouth all i could taste was lion i could taste traviss beast in his blood and that was enough i looked up at him with his blood spilling out of my mouth and i shoved my beast into him i gave the lioness what she wanted i gave her a body that could make her real the lioness spilled out of me in a rush of heat and power that felt like it was taking my skin with it i screamed and traviss screams echoed mine one minute travis was staring down at me the next second he exploded bits of skin and meat and liquid spraying over me a lion rose above me shaking its maned head staggering as it straddled me as if even in lion form he hurt he made a sound halfway between a roar and a moan and fell to his side beside me i lay there my body aching from my toes to the roots of my hair god i hurt but it was fading a bonegrinding ache but it was fading as it faded i was able to pay attention to the fact that i was covered in that clear warm goo that shapeshifters seem to lose instead of blood when they change the more violent the change the more of it there seems to be id given my beast to travis and even though it wasnt exactly my beast it was as if my lioness did go to him for a while the pain faded enough so i could think about something else and the first thought was that when haven had taken my beast he hadnt been weakened by it hell nathaniel micah even clay and graham didnt collapse like travis did he was weak i needed someone strong then i had other things to worry about because the wolf decided she wanted a chance she ran up that tunnel like a pale ghost i had time to say wolf then she hit me and i was back to writhing on the floor i reached out and richard was there he wrapped his arms around me held me tight while my body tried to tear itself apart he pinned my face with one strong hand he called his beast his power hit mine and it felt like my blood was boiling i shrieked tried to tell him to stop he leaned in to kiss me while his power combined with mine to boil me alive i tried to give him my wolf but i couldnt it couldnt get past the weight of his power his power began to push my beast back like boiling water pushing a forest fire back it worked but it felt like my skin was singeing and smoking as he forced my beast back he drove it back to that place deep inside me he drove it back and it went whimpering i whimpered with it because it felt as if my body had been burned with power i tried to look down at my body and the world swam in streamers of color and nausea id seen richard force people to swallow their beasts before but id never known that it hurt when my vision cleared richard was smiling down at me he looked pleased i wasnt sure it was going to work he said and there was strain in his own voice as if it had cost him something too i whispered in a voice that was broken from screaming that hurt his smile faded around the edges but i didnt have time to worry about his hurt feelings because the leopard spilled up into me like poison trying to find a way to drip out of my skin nathaniels arms found me but micah took me from him micah wrapped his arms around me pinned me to his body my leopard knew his knew the smell and taste of it the energy went into him like a huge hot breath it washed over his human body and fur followed the power like turning a shirt inside out micah was one of the smoothest shifts of any wereanimal id ever seen only chimera had changed more easily and less messily than he did i was left clasped to the front of his furred body held by a body that was half man and half leopard travis had only two shapes lion and human every other wereanimal in the room had three animal human and halfandhalf once id thought you had to be powerful to do the halfhuman form but id been spending too much time around really powerful wereanimals now i thought that only the weak couldnt do it i let micah hold me but i was too weak to hold him back he laid me gently on the floor and lay down on his side beside me propped up on one elbow i stared up into his blackfurred face a strangely graceful mix of cat and human his eyes looked just as at home in this face as his other one they were both micah to me did you do that to make a point richards voice angry micah looked up at him and spoke in that gravelly purr that he had in this shape what point would that be that i caused her more pain making her swallow her beast than you did by taking it i took her beast because im not powerful enough to make her swallow it and because being forced to swallow it can hurt a lot so i cause her more pain and you come off the hero if i hadnt been exhausted and aching from head to toe id have told richard to stop it not to fight but i was too tired hed slept over hed helped me with marmee noir it had all been going so well i didnt want it to go badly damn it damn it i called her leopard instead of letting nathaniel do it because i can do this he moved away enough so he wasnt touching me and then it was like magic it was as if the black fur were tiny flames that spilled off and blew away in the wind of his power and everywhere the black blew away there was skin underneath everyone else looked as if they were being torn apart and remade or pulled inside out when they shifted the best you could hope for was to have the other body melt away and the beast or the human pull itself out of the other form but micah micah just changed one minute leopardman the next human again if i hadnt seen chimera shift from one form to the other like water spilling back and forth between hands id have said micah was the best at shifting id ever seen micah looked up at richard nathaniel would have been trapped in leopard form for hours i couldnt see richards face because i was turned to micah and it seemed like too much effort to turn my head the other way but i heard the disbelief in his voice its supposed to cost if you change back before six hours sometimes longer arent you exhausted no micah said are you disoriented at all i wouldnt want to jump to my feet but give me a few minutes and ill be fine ive never seen anyone who can shift back and forth like that ive seen one other who was better micah said who chimera and just saying it caused micahs face to take on that serious sorrowfilled expression that i knew too well i reached up to touch his arm id have liked to touch his face but those extra inches seemed too much effort he smiled down at me as if he knew what even that small effort had cost a womans voice said if this guy could change shape easier than that id have liked to meet him soledad came to stand over us she wasnt as tall as some of the guards well under six feet but from flat on the floor she looked tall enough she was slender but curvy with hair cut boy short and dyed a shade of yellow that didnt occur in nature with the hair youd expect more makeup but she usually did lipstick and just enough liner to accent her brown eyes she stared down at me with that look she usually had like she thought something was funny and would laugh any minute id realized a few days ago that it was her version of a blank face i might have asked her what she was thinking staring down at me but the tiger flashed inside the darkness in me no please no i thought soledad stared down at me the smile slipped away from her face and i saw something i hadnt expected for a moment fear i might have asked what she was afraid of but the tiger started racing up that long dark hallway inside me i reached up to her she hesitated claudia said do your job soledad she leaned over to take my hand saying in this world i would rather live two days like a tiger than a hundred years like a sheep i might have asked what she was quoting but the moment her hand touched mine the tiger sped up it bounded down that hallway and i braced for the impact chapter fourteen the impact never came the tiger hit my skin my body and kept going i didnt give my beast to soledad it just washed out of me and into her it didnt hurt me it was as if all that went down my hand to hers was power it just happened to look like a tiger i wasnt sure that was it at all because soledad didnt change shape she halfcollapsed around me catching herself with her free hand so she didnt fall on top of me her breath came in sharp pants as if something hurt but i wasnt feeling it i was just holding her hand and watching her face she managed to whisper you dont hold tiger inside you i think youre right i said my voice still sounded hoarse from all the screaming but at least i could talk above a whisper whats wrong claudia asked from behind us i think marmee noir couldnt turn me into a tiger i said i kept looking at soledads face though she still looked hurt i asked are you all right she nodded but her lips were pressed in a tight thin line i think she was lying to me about being all right i think shes hurt i said claudia knelt beside us soledad are you hurt she shook her head tell me you arent hurt claudia said soledad just kept shaking her head claudia helped the other woman to her feet and soledads knees wouldnt hold her claudia had to catch her or shed have fallen to the floor remus came on the other side of her and helped ease her to the edge of the bed he asked whats wrong with her im not sure claudia said soledad found her voice that was not a weretiger i tried to sit up and micah had to help me richard moved in on the other side to help me sit between them it was marmee noir i said who soledad asked the mother of all darkness the queen of the vampires it smelled like tiger not vampire she said tigers are one of her animals to call i said soledad shook her head and leaned against claudia for a moment all right i admit it i dont feel so good why didnt she bring her beast nathaniel asked anita isnt a weretiger so the tiger couldnt be as real as the rest of the beasts micah said what do you mean richard asked wed been wondering if anita is picking up beasts because she survived attacks or if its vampire powers and shell collect animals to call as if they are types of lycanthropy i think this answers the question shes never been attacked by a weretiger and chimera didnt hold tiger as one of his shapes so why try to call tiger richard said why not call one of the cats anita already has i dont know micah said i had a thought shes been inside my head deep enough to know that i didnt think we had a tiger nearby she said she wanted to make me hers but if she couldnt have me then she meant for the tiger to tear you apart richard said softly or she was trying to make you a tiger from a distance soledad said i dont think she knew what would happen i dont think she cared what would happen the power that brushed me didnt think like a tiger what did it think like i asked a serial killer a butcher tigers only hunt when theyre hungry this thing hunts because its bored yeah i said that sounds like mommie dark sorry you got a taste of her soledad she gave a weak smile my job to take the hits for you right but she was pale and looked as close to fainting as i thought id ever see one of the guards chimera might not have been a tiger remus said but he did hold hyena snake and bear at least those three more why doesnt anita react to them too micah shrugged shes never been attacked by them she seems to need to be bled by an animal first he stroked his hand down my bare back it reminded me that we were nude but strangely because everyone else treated it like it was nothing so could i richard settled in closer to my other side as if that one touch of micahs made him have to touch me too or maybe he was just nervous and letting himself take comfort i looked for bad motives for richard i didnt mean to do it but hed hurt me so badly and so often that i finally realized i looked for the negative in him not the positive i took a deep breath in and let it out slow you all right remus asked but his eyes did a slide to each side of me as if he knew what was wrong i nodded and the movement was too fast i ached but it was sharper than that the pain would fade but damn i didnt know how the real wereanimals did it changing completely had to hurt worse than this inbetween stuff remus asked do you know why you dont react to all of chimeras animal forms jeanclaude thinks maybe i need a vamp with that animal to call to mess with me before the beast rises so a combination of the attacks youve survived and vamp powers he said something like that i said richard moved his hand across my shoulders drawing me in against his body and away from micah i tried not to tense up but failed he stopped in midmotion and just kept his hand on me the movement that had been so natural was suddenly awkward awkward moments when im naked make me want clothes then you should react to us the hyenas because were ashers animal to call and he has messed with you anita messed with you so much he almost killed you i tried not to think about asher tried not to dwell on what we had done together the last time wed been allowed alone together his bite was orgasmic combine that with actual sex and it was an experience youd give your life for and id almost done just that micah touched my shoulder anita dont i jumped and looked at him startled he was right id almost thought too hard about asher just the memory could come back and duplicate the pleasure at the most inopportune moments or the most embarrassing i shoved thoughts of asher and his hair like spun gold as far away as i was able but he never seemed to be too far from my thoughts lately not since the night that wed both gotten so caught up in his ability to bring pleasure micah grabbed me hard and turned me to look at him anita think about something else i nodded youre right you are right youre still having flashbacks to that night richard made it a question i nodded he touched my back again tentatively gently not trying to move me away from micah but just touching me that i could deal with hard to compete with someone who can make you orgasm just from remembering i turned and looked at him he looked away as if he wasnt certain id like what i saw on his face i already knew he was jealous of the other men i couldnt even blame him i guess he let all that heavy hair fall forward to help hide his face it wasnt as long as ashers hair but the gesture was similar asher used his hair to hide the scars that the old inquisition had given him centuries ago when theyd tried to burn the devil out of him with holy water was richard mimicking that hiding gesture on purpose or by accident travis the lion gave a gasping breath it turned my attention to him and away from richard micah let go of me so i could run my hand down the soft furred side of the lion traviss lion was a pale straw gold he rolled over on his stomach and looked at me with a perfect lion face but the look out of that face wasnt lion the look said clearly that there was still a person in there lions just didnt give you that disgusted look im sorry it hurt i said he shook his head hard enough to fluff his mane it was dry i never understood that but though changing shape was wet work the product at each end was always mostly dry the floor or bed would be wet people around them could be wet but they were dry id asked all the lycanthropes in my life how that worked and they didnt know either ill take travis to find food nathaniel said he stood there still nude still covered in some of the gunk that had managed to miss the lion youll need to shower micah said ill catch one in the group showers nathaniel was quietly counting himself out for the morning feedmorning sex it occurred to me then that i hadnt fed last night before bed the ardeur hadnt risen and we hadnt woken it on purpose i looked toward damians coffin but the bed blocked my view shit i said softly jeanclaude says that you can practice going longer between feedings nathaniel said but i have to feed now i sounded disappointed and couldnt help it having sex when you wanted to was one thing being forced to have sex because you might die was different i didnt like to be forced to do anything even things i enjoyed ill take travis to the food area and ill clean up he looked at the two men still beside me i caught a quick flash of feeling he was out of here he could stand his ground when he needed to but nathaniel didnt really like to play the kingofthehill games especially when i was the hill he knew it pissed me off so he opted out most of the time micah too sometimes they lived with me which meant they had to understand me better than some of the other men in my life okay better than richard there id said it at least in my head he usually turned everything into a pissing contest trouble was i felt like i was the one getting pissed on who did you feed on last richard asked me micah said and looked at the other man they had a moment where they just looked at each other and like last night in the bed i felt superfluous i dont know how to do this richard said just say it micah said i dont want to have to ask your permission to have sex with anita micah laughed then a sharp surprised burst of sound i cant believe you said that well i dont richard said its not my permission you need richard micah said then richard seemed to get it because he looked at me he actually had the grace to look embarrassed i didnt mean it that way how did you mean it i asked and tried to keep the words as neutral as i could im trying to get along with the other men in your life i dont know how to do that anita i want to ask you to feed on me but i feel like i have to ask for everyones okay not just yours am i wrong i felt my face soften he was trying so hard i touched his hair there was an edge of drying goop in it i guess i was a bigger mess since travis had been practically on top of me when he shifted violent shifting is always messier we need to get cleaned up i said he gave me uncertain eyes ill go with nathaniel to the showers micah said standing up he petted traviss back come on ol lion well get you fed micah bent over and gave me a quick kiss and a reassuring smile he did his best to let me know it was all right with him one of my favorite things about micah was that he usually made things better easier not worse he walked out with the huge slinking form of the lion on one side and nathaniel on the other nathaniel blew me a kiss from the door but didnt try for a kiss on the lips i wasnt sure why but id have liked the kiss richard touched my arm gently it made me look at him whatever he saw on my face didnt make him happy his eyes showed it since i didnt know what was in my eyes i couldnt change it whatever he saw on my face was what was there to see he gave a smile that left his eyes sad lets use the bathtub and clean up he looked down his hair sliding around his face he took a breath deep enough that it moved his shoulders up and down if thats all right with you i touched his arm a nice hot bath would help with the aches does it hurt this much to shift completely richard frowned thinking then shook his head no i mean it hurts while youre doing it sometimes but with practice no you seem to be stuck at the early stages when it hurts the most great i said i heard water running in the bathroom remus or claudia had sent someone in to start the bath the tub was big it took a while to fill richard stood up and offered me a hand hed moved so that i had his body in profilethe smooth strong line of his hip to stare at instead of other things i appreciated the modesty sometimes when he wasnt modest i just didnt think very clearly of course it wasnt just his manhood that made me go wow i stared up the line of his body from feet to the muscled swell of calf thigh the tight curve of his ass the waist that led up to the swell of that chest those shoulders he held one muscled arm down at me and i followed that arm to the face that face it wasnt just that he was handsome or that his newly long hair framed it all but the eyes pure brown deep rich and full of a weight that was just richard a weight of personality and strength that once id thought would be enough to sustain me i saw all of it in seconds so that i was able to not just give him my hand in his but wrap my other hand around his wrist a wrist thick enough that i couldnt hold it between thumb and forefinger he was just too big he pulled me gently to my feet it hurt to stand and i swayed clutching at him he put his other hand at my back to steady me let me pick you up anita please he knew i didnt like to be carried it made me feel weak but tonight i hurt and i knew that it would mean something to him to do it i whispered yes he smiled that smile that brightened his whole face he picked me up in his arms and i cuddled in against the strength of him just holding me in his arms i could feel the potential in his body so strong i let my head rest in the curve of his shoulder and didnt fight the fact that i was small in his arms once it had bothered me but some part of me had grown up or accepted it maybe i just didnt need to be the biggest baddest ass in the room anymore maybe i was finally old enough to let someone else be the one in charge maybe i draped an arm around his neck and breathed in the scent of him it loosened something tight and frightened in the center of my being it felt a little like the rabbit was cuddling with the wolf but if a lion can lie down with a lamb why not chapter fifteen one of the younger guards was bent over the tub i couldnt remember his name in that moment he looked up and seemed startled as if he hadnt expected us remus told me to fill the tub he sounded a little breathy i remembered his name then cisco he was eighteen and id declared him too young to guard my body but it hadnt been his age alone that had made me suggest he go elsewhere hed had problems around the sex and me apparently he was getting his second chance to see if he could be cool around the sex well take it from here richard said remus was really clear that i am to follow every order exactly i sighed cisco just go he took his hand out of the water shaking droplets off it okay his eyes were too wide his face too bothered by us he was a wererat no lycanthrope should have this much problem around nudity but it wasnt the nudity i didnt think but the fact that we were going to have sex that bothered him id declared that i was a twentyoneorolder zone ciscos face made me think i needed to make that rule stick i got a flash of the gun at his hip as he moved past us remus said cisco had one of the best scores on the firing range of any guard but high scores werent the only thing you needed to be a bodyguard the bathroom door closed firmly richard stood there holding me as if it were effortless as if i weighed nothing and he could have done it all night sometimes it bugged me to know how much stronger the men were than i was but not this morning this morning it seemed comforting can i say something without you getting mad richard asked i tensed i couldnt help it i dont know he sighed but he said it cisco seems too young to be doing this i agree he moved his head against the top of mine as if hed glance down at me if my face was where he could have seen it you agree yeah hes been weird around me sincei didnt say it out loud because i didnt want to upset richard either but cisco had been in the room when id had sex with london one of our british vamps for the first time cisco had had trouble not seeing me as a piece of ass since that moment he was young young in ways that werent just about how old he was since he saw some stuff i finished and hoped richard would let it be he did he carried me to the edge of the tub the water was very loud rushing into the huge tub jeanclaude had explained to me that the swan spout that filled it was hooked up to a system that filled the tub extra fast i had a tub almost that big at home and apparently my system was like his a quick fill since i had bought the house with the tub and system in place i hadnt realized there was anything special about it hightech tubs who knew richard hugged me and again i got a flash of that amazing strength i want to check the water but im really enjoying carrying you me too i said he rested his face against my hair really yes i said and i would have whispered it except the water was loud enough that true whispering wasnt possible he stepped into the water with me in his arms i laughed and lifted enough to see his face shouldnt you check the temperature first the look on his face made the laughter leak away eager amazed just so many emotions lately when wed been together the only thing id seen in his face had been lust wed both shut down our emotions kept ourselves safe it had had that feel of sex at the end of a relationship when sex is all you have left and it isnt enough the temperatures fine he said his voice soft he knelt down still holding me he folded all that six feet and change down into the water and just above his waist the water hit me it was warm almost hot the water slid over my body like another set of hands gliding exploring he was right the temperature was fine he whispered against my hair how much do you hurt i ache all over well get cleaned up first then let your body soak in the water hot water helps he kissed my forehead then lowered us both down into the water so that he was almost floating with me held across his chest he let go of me with one arm so he could halfswim halfpull us to the water faucet my legs trailed out into the water but the rest of me was held tight to his chest he sat down against the side of the tub the water came to his upper chest which meant it was almost chin deep to me he kept me pinned to the front of his body and i was okay with that touching was good enough water he made it a question yes i said he reached back and turned off the water then settled down with me cuddled against the front of his body the height difference was enough that to keep my chin above water i couldnt cup my body against anything but his chest and stomach with the rest of my body mostly floating it was probably just as well if too much of him touched me i tended to get distracted we were going to let some of the aches and pains drift away before we got distracted he kissed the side of my face and i settled into his arms and the warm warm water it was relaxing or should have been but there was a kernel of me that couldnt relax completely what was wrong whats wrong richard asked nothing youre tense i sighed i dont know his hand slid down the side of my body to cup my hip it seems like unless were having sex you get tense when were alone i dont mean to i said he wrapped his arms around me and forced my body lower as he rose so that certain parts of his anatomy were touching me he wasnt as hard as he got but even partially erect he was a special treat the feel of him pressed to the back of my butt felt wonderful it made me writhe against him which made his body react growing moving against my body it was all involuntary and i loved knowing that i affected him like that he pushed against me and it brought a small sound from my lips so quick so eager god i do love that about you he whispered it against my face i wanted to make love to you months before youd say yes i was afraid he nuzzled my neck biting just a little that little biting made me writhe more the aches and pains were starting to fade under the first wave of endorphins those happy little chemicals afraid of what i whispered he bit harder and my spine bowed with it you why he cupped his mouth around the side of my throat and bit down i cried out for him my nails clawed at his arms i finally had to say enough enough he eased back and turned me in the water so that i was facing him he drew me in against the front of his body and he was hard and eager now the feel of him against the front of my body made me cry out he cupped my ass pressed me harder against the front of him i pushed at his body almost like i wanted to get away but that wasnt what i was thinking it was just almost too much for some reason the feel of him so eager so big trapped between our bodies it was almost too much he shuddered head back his voice panting god anita god i love the way you react to me i do love it i wrapped my body around him pressed the length of him against the most intimate part of me it made me cry out and press myself tighter against him he pushed me against the side of the tub and moved his hips away enough to try to angle himself for my opening i didnt protest until the tip of him started inside and my body let me know that the combination of waterwhich is not a lubricantlack of foreplay and his size meant this wasnt going to work i halfpatted halfslapped his chest too big youre too big the water he said breathy he leaned his hands on the sides of the tub face down the head of him still inside me if you release the ardeur we can do it but ill be sore afterward and so will you he moved his hips a little and the sensation even tight made me catch my breath not too sore he said yes i said trust me i dont want to be walking funny tomorrow he raised his head enough to frown at me weve never done it before like thishow can you be so sure shit i stared up at him with his body halfway inside mine and didnt know what to say the truth was micah and i had done it but that seemed impolitic to say the least in this moment i tried to think of something that wouldnt make him feel bad but i waited too long he said just say it anita just say it i want to make love with you richard i dont want to fight he pulled back enough so he wasnt inside me anymore he stayed with his arms on either side of the tub framing me the look on his face was cautious now almost as if he were steeling himself for bad news it wasnt the look i wanted on his face right now say it anita his voice sounded tired i tried it with someone else why did it hurt dont make me say this richard please say it and his voice was harsher now i sighed fine because he was too big for it not to hurt who dont do this richard who this time it was a demand i gave him angry eyes who do you think i dont know youve added at least two men to your list and ive never seen either of them erect i ducked under his arm and halfswam to the other side of the tub tell me what you want me to say richard is it your two new vampires are you wanting to know how you measure up to requiem and london is that what youre actually wanting to know he nodded yeah i guess i do i crossed my arms under my breasts the water helping since they floated i cannot believe youre asking this its an easy question anita do you actually want to know if youre bigger than they are im so jealous of them that i cant see straight so yeah i want to know i want to know that im still the bestendowed man in your bed you know i dont actually get out a ruler and measure everybody so they are big jesus mary and joseph i covered my face with my hands no no they arent as well endowed as you are happy i lowered my hands and found that it wasnt a happy look on his face then who is id managed for months not to have this discussion this specifically with anyone of course it would be richard who pushed it micah okay micah is that why you love him jesus no richard you should know better than most that a really big cock is not enough to win my heart then why him why are you living with him and not me i sighed we werent going to have sex we were going to have therapy sweet mary mother of god i did not want to do this dont do this not now not today i need to understand what went wrong before i can move on anita im sorry but i do i shook my head and tried to settle into the water but it wasnt soothing anymore it was just wet fine do remember im living with nathaniel too you always seem to forget him or discount him hes not dominant anita in the world of wereanimals that makes him discountable but in the world of my affections richard he is not discountable i dont understand i know you dont and im sorry you dont but its still the truth im living with micah and nathaniel not just micah the fact that nathaniel isnt a dominant doesnt make me love him less how can you sit there like this and tell me you love someone else dont you know how much that hurts me you wanted this talk not me i wanted to make love i wanted to clean up feed the ardeur and be together but you had to get all hung up on the size of everyones equipment i know its a guy thing to worry about that but this wasnt the time to bring it up youre right it was stupid but im stupid around you anita you make me say things do things that i know are bad for the relationship i dont make you do anything you choose to say and do things that spoil stuff your choice not mine fine youre right i choose to say and do this shit i could have let it go and wed be having sex right now and it would be great sex but i really do want to know what micah has that i dont what magic does he have that made you move him into your house live with him when you wouldnt do it for me god we were going to do the big fight the fight i did not want to do this ever but i especially didnt want to do this with the harlequin in town and heaven knew what nasty surprises headed our way jeanclaude explained to you that it was partly vampire powers that drew micah and me together youre a succubus a vampire that feeds on sex yeah he told me i saw something on his face you dont believe him i dont believe its permanent i think if you could get enough space between yourself and jeanclaudes power it would go away richard this isnt jeanclaudes power anymore its mine he shook his head his arms crossing over that lovely chest you arent a vampire anita you cant have vampire powers theyre still part of the triumvirate we have with jeanclaude richard this is real you cant wish it away what that youre some kind of sexcrazed demon i dont believe that its more of jeanclaudes power or belle mortes or even marmee noir jesus anita you have had so many vampires running through your mind you dont know what is you and what is them anymore there was some truth to what he was saying but richard i have forged a triumvirate of power with nathaniel and damian thats me not jeanclaude thats real he shook his head again theres got to be a way to undo it i just stared at him this was not the talk i thought wed be having richard i am a succubus me not jeanclaude not belle morte not mommie dark me humans cant be succubi maybe not but then humans cant have a vampire servant or an animal to call and i have both of those because youre jeanclaudes human servant richard you saw what happened when i tried to undo that connection i would have died and taken nathaniel and damian with me he settled back into the water giving me angry eyes jeanclaude told me the theory that your version of the ardeur helps you see the deepest desire in someones heart and grant it and make them into what you most need micah needed his people safe you killed chimera for him you needed what from micah a helpmate a partner someone to help me run the furry coalition and help me run the wereleopards that id inherited when i killed their old master i could have been your partner he said you didnt want to be my partner you want your own life not to be just an adjunct to mine what does that mean that i wont give up my job for you that i needed someone to do the coalition full time and you have your career that cant be all micah is to you hes there for me richard hes there for me and the people i love he doesnt fight me all the time he says yes more than he says no and i just say no sometimes nathaniel needed to belong to someone now he belongs to you i get that but what did he do for you i needed a wife i said what i needed a s wife to make my life run smooth i needed someone to be my wife and hes really good at it and i want you to be my wife is that it something like that yeah why didnt your ardeur look into my heart and see what i most needed and make us into the perfect couple too i thought jeanclaude explained all this to you i asked him why not me and he said the power was unpredictable but that wasnt the truth was it not all of it i said and cursed my vampire lover for being a chickenshit tell me all of it richard said micah knew what he wanted his people safe at any cost he said from the moment he came to me that hed do anything be anything to be in my life the ardeur made that happen for him nathaniel wanted a home and to be loved for himself not just for sex and the ardeur made that happen both of those desires are very clear do you know what you want most richard do you have one single hearts desire i want you i shook my head thats not your deepest darkest wish richard i should know what my deepest wish is anita richard if a genie appeared before you right now what would you wish really truly if you could have anything what would it be you liar i said he sat up and that otherworldly energy swirled through the room how dare you richard be honest with yourself what would you have if you could have anything no matter how impossible he blinked at me and the energy level in the room seeped away he stared at me i dont want to be a werewolf thats your deepest wish richard and the ardeur cant give you that i cant be that for you so the ardeur doesnt work between you and me because what you want most doesnt have anything to do with sex and love he stared at me and sat back in the water almost like he was faint oh my god he whispered it we thought at first you were just too conflicted for the ardeur to pick and choose but i was the one who figured it out youre right he said a look of soft horror covered his face he looked at me and such pain filled his eyes i did this to myself i shrugged i was so afraid id become a monster that i took the inoculations against lycanthropy thats how i caught it i know i said softly and i lost you because i hate what i am more than i want you you havent lost me richard he looked at me and i had to fight to keep meeting that look youll never be just mine well never have a life together we can be part of each others lives richard not in the way i want maybe not but richard dont throw away what we have was it so bad last night sleeping with all of us was that so awful no he said and if i hadnt been in bed with you then marmee noir could have done something awful to you you need me to protect you sometimes yes but i cant live with two other men anita i cant share my bed with them every night i just cant my eyes felt hot my throat was tight damn it i would not cry i managed to say i know then where do i fit in your life where do i fit in yours i asked he nodded thats fair but that was all he said i sat on my side of the tub feeling lost and horrible only richard could make me feel this bad only he managed to cut me this deep damn it i felt nathaniel like a distant tug he wasnt feeling well which meant that damian in his coffin would be feeling worse damian hadnt woken for the day yet and i needed to feed the ardeur before he tried to wake jeanclaude had explained to me that if one morning i didnt have enough energy to make damians body wake he would never wake again he would simply remain dead forever ive got to feed richard now nathaniel is starting to feel bad and i wont risk killing damian richard nodded i expected him to say hed get someone else for me to feed on but he didnt we need to do enough foreplay so you can feed from me were fighting thats not good foreplay are you saying you dont want to be with me now he said it low careful as if he were balancing a world of emotions on a very thin stick one wrong comment and the stick would break and the world would fall shit im saying i dont have time for lengthy foreplay i need to feed right away im trying not to cry thats not conducive to sex not for me at least im sorry anita dont be sorry richard fix it fix yourself fix us or dont fix us but whatever youre going to do we need to do it now i wont risk lives because were having another fight he nodded his head as if that were fair maybe it was he started moving toward me through the water what are you doing i asked and sounded suspicious i want you to feed off me anita im pissed and hurt and that doesnt lead to sex for me if i leave youll still be pissed and hurt youll still have trouble concentrating on the sex wont you i couldnt argue his logic i almost said but the others are smaller than you and this is one situation where bigger isnt better but i didnt say it out loud i didnt want to hurt him that badly i also knew that if richard and i couldnt come to some kind of understanding one day wed be finished as a couple hed always be jeanclaudes wolf to call hed always be bound to us in a triumvirate of power but wed be broken up it would be like being trapped in a relationship with someone youd divorced but could never completely get rid of a little slice of hell that he was kneeling in front of me the water just above his waist the edges of his hair were wet but the top was still dry and still held some of the slick stuff that had gotten on us when i ripped travis into his animal form truthfully a little mess wasnt enough to take away from how handsome he was but the constant fighting was the picking at it all and his deep unhappiness with being a werewolf that was unattractive i gazed up at him all that way to the nearly heartstopping face so handsome handsome enough that id have been embarrassed around him in high school but handsome and wellendowed wasnt enough to keep letting him hurt me like this i stared up at him and for the first time my heart did not leap up and neither did my libido i was tired of the fighting i was tired of his inability to accept our reality he didnt believe i was a succubus he thought it was something that would go away if we got me away from jeanclaude didnt he understand that there was no going away from jeanclaude not for either of us his comments said no he didnt understand that and that made me sad he stood up he stood up with water dripping down his body i was suddenly staring at a certain part of his anatomy with water drops decorating it we all have our weaknesses and one of mine was water richard had dated me long enough to know that he was betting that seeing him wet was enough to distract me from being mad at him i had a moment to decide to hold on to that angry sadness or do what i wanted to do do what the suddenly rapid pulse in my neck wanted to do i felt nathaniel sway against a wall i went to my knees steadied my hands against the warm wet sides of richards thighs and lowered my mouth to his body chapter sixteen i licked the water off him with the tip of my tongue i drank water from the looseness of his body licking water from the testicles where they hung so heavy and large i licked and drank the water until his body lengthened and hardened i couldnt reach the tip of him now not without wrapping my hand around the base of him and lowering all that hardness toward my mouth he made small noises for me and when i gazed up his body the eyes that looked back had changed to wolf amber sex was supposed to be about losing control but all lycanthropes could never completely lose controlbecause to lose control for them meant to change shape at least once a year some new lycanthrope lost control and cut up a lover during sex sometimes the lover survived sometimes they didnt sometimes they got to be furry too i drove my mouth over him until my lips met my own hand i used the hand to squeeze and pulse around him but it also kept me from having to try to take all of him in my mouth i could deepthroat but it wasnt always the most comfortable position not with someone richards size i could raise the ardeur and do it do it all but i rose off his body enough to talk id raise the ardeur and finish like this but youre too strong you keep me out except during intercourse he looked down at me and it was almost a look of pain i want you to do whatever you want to do will you lower your shields and let me feed ill try i shook my head and squeezed him tight at the same time it threw his head back made his hands reach to empty air for something to hold on to he liked to hold on to things when we did this but his hands found only air and he looked down at me with a shudder that ran up the length of his body just feeling him shudder in my hand brought a cry from me god richard god he reached down and grabbed my arms pulled me up out of the water i had to let go of him as he came out of the water with me in his arms he threw me onto the marble around the tub edge it was cold and hard and i started to protest richards fingers found my opening he shoved his finger inside me and just doing oral sex on him made me wet but the water had kept me tight even one finger seemed big he moved it in and out and around and i cried out for him he put two fingers inside me and he actually closed his eyes concentrating searching until he found that spot no bigger than a fiftycent piece that spot just inside and to the front of the opening he found it and flicked his fingers back and forth across it there hadnt been enough foreplay for a fullblown gspot orgasm but it still felt good so good it made me spread my legs wider for him made me angle my hips for him he took that for the invitation it was and drove his fingers inside me harder and faster until i cried out for him again youre wet he said in a voice that was a little strangled with need i nodded breathless he started to angle himself to enter me but i put a hand on his chest condom shit he said but he went to his knees and riffled through the pile of towels behind us condoms lived in the bathrooms and bedrooms of any place i was alone with the men the pregnancy scare in november had made me unwilling to count on just the birthcontrol pill he was cursing under his breath by the time he got the condom on but he turned back to me his body hard eager just the sight of him like that knowing what we were about to do made things low in my body tighten small orgasms before he even entered me even wet and eager he had to work himself inside me i writhed around him just from the feel of him working his way inside i gazed up at him let my eyes see his face the wolf eyes in his face as he fought himself his arms supporting him above me so that most of his body was above me so that i could see him as he pushed his way into me feed anita feed please a please like that usually meant that a man was close i called the ardeur to life i called it like coaxing a spark to life to flame to burn the power spilled over me through me and into him the ardeur poured over us in a warm wash of power it opened my body to him so that he could push in and out of me i could watch him in the mirrored walls around us his body above mine pushing in and out in and out he knew with the ardeur on us he didnt have to be careful and he wasnt he pushed all that length into me as hard and fast as he could he grabbed my hips lifted my lower body off the marble held me in his big hands as he pounded himself into me so hard and fast that our bodies made a wet thudding noise the end of him found the end of me so that each stroke hit as far into my body as it could and still he came in and in so hard so fast he was almost a blur in the mirrors he wasnt human and he had speed and strength that wasnt human once hed worried that hed hurt me but wed found that i wasnt humanfragile anymore wed found that richard could be as rough as he wanted and he wouldnt break me he was that rough now then he found a new speed a new hardness it was as if hed always been holding back and i just hadnt known it faster harder until he was a blur in the mirrors pounding himself inside me until i cried out orgasming around him body spasming i felt his body spasm inside me felt his body buck against mine all movement ceased his head flung backward eyes closing his fingers dug into my ass holding us both in that moment as his body spasmed and went inside mine with him buried as deeply inside my body as was possible to be in that frozen moment as our bodies rode each other the ardeur fed i fed i fed on richards energy fed on the part of him that was wolf and human i fed on all of him took in every last delicious inch of his power as i took in every last delicious inch of his body when he let himself go like this he gave so much energy he lowered me back to the edge of the marble tub he slid out of me and even that made me writhe he collapsed onto his side because there wasnt enough room for his shoulders otherwise he lay gasping with his head near my waist i managed to move my hand enough to touch his hair but that was all i could manage my pulse was still thundering in my ears he found his voice first did i hurt you i started to say no but the endorphins were fading around the edges there was already an ache beginning between my legs to micah i would have said a little but to richard i said no he had more issues than micah did i felt his hand slide clumsily over my thigh as if he couldnt quite make his hand work just yet he brushed between my legs i said in a voice that was halflaughing not again not yet he raised his hand so i could see that he had blood on his fingertips did i hurt you his voice sounded surer of itself and less postcoital yes and no i said he managed to raise himself up on one elbow youre bleeding anita i hurt you i looked at his fingertips a little but its a good hurt ill remember what we did with every ache his face closed down and he stared at the blood on his fingertips as if it were an accusation richard it was wonderful amazing i didnt know youd been holding so much of yourself back i should have kept holding back i touched his shoulder richard dont do this dont make it bad when it was good youre bleeding anita i fucked you so hard youre bleeding i thought of one thing to say but wasnt sure if it would make things better or worse he moved away from me to sit on the edge of the tub with his legs dangling over the side he washed the blood away ill be all right richard honest you cant know that he said i rose and i ached deep inside my body maybe more than normal i rose enough to see the blood on the marble but there wasnt much of it if this is all the blood then ill be fine anita youve never bled after sex before truth time i prayed that it was the right choice yeah i have he looked at me frowning no you havent yeah i have just not with you he started to say who micah he said the word like he wasnt happy to say it yes this much blood he asked i nodded and sat up now that the endorphins were leaving at a rapid rate the marble felt cold i held my hand out to him help me back into the tub he took my hand almost automatically as if he did it because it was there more than because he wanted to he helped me slide back into the tub i made a small pain noise i was hurt no doubt about that but i wasnt broken id had this hurt before with micah i didnt want it this rough every night but i could do it and when it was the right time it was amazing has he hurt you this badly before it isnt hurt the way you say it richard im not hurt i hurt its not the same thing i dont see the difference i lay back in the water easing into it letting the abused parts of my anatomy relax a little at a time strangely the ache inside me was the only ache the muscle soreness was gone washed away on a wave of sex and the ardeur good for that i wanted to fuck you anita i wanted to fuck you as hard and fast as i could and i did didnt it feel wonderful i asked he nodded it did but if i hurt you then think what i could do to someone who doesnt have vampire marks to make them harder to hurt think what i could do to a human woman i settled back into the water enough to wet all my hair then sat up so i could look at him he looked so sad lost ive heard the stories richard broken pelvises crushed organs women and men who needed surgery to put themselves back together when were with humans we always have to be careful of them so ive been told i didnt know if you could take this anita i didnt know if i would break you the thought that i might fuck you until i pushed my way into parts of your body that should never be touched excited me i didnt want to do it but the possibility of it excited the hell out of me how sick is that i blinked at him not sure what to say im not sure its sick at all you didnt do it you just thought about it the thought excited you but you didnt rip me apart to make it come true i think maybe its like a lot of violent fantasies if the reality happened it wouldnt be sexy at all but the thought of it a violent thought in the middle of sex can drive the sex to the next level werent you afraid of me no why not i trusted you not to hurt me i said he took off the condom and said theres blood on the condom im not hurt richard or at least no more than i wanted to be truthfully maybe i was more hurt than i wanted to be a pleasant ache between the legs was fine but i was starting to hurt somewhere close to my belly button that usually meant youd overdone it but i couldnt say that to richard he looked at me you flinched just now i closed my eyes and floated back in the water i dont know what youre talking about i said i felt the water move knew hed gotten in the tub i sat up but he was already standing over me there was something menacing about the way he loomed over me most of the time i could ignore how physically large he was in every way but sometimes like now he made me see it he wasnt trying to be intimidating or i didnt think he was not on purpose anyway that otherworldly energy began to flow off him as if the water were getting reheated i moved so i was sitting against the side of the tub standing up wouldnt help hed still loom over me besides my stomach or rather lower things were beginning to cramp i wasnt entirely certain i could stand up without bending over that wouldnt help the situation was i hurt was i really hurt not a question i wanted to have to ask youre hurt really hurt arent you his question was a little too close to what id just thought we could accidentally share thoughts and feelings i fought to put the shields back in place sex can bring them crashing down he knelt in the water putting an arm on either side of me he leaned in the heat of his power beating against my body it made things low in my body tense and that hurt i fought not to make little pain sounds i managed not to but richard put his face against the side of mine and whispered are you hurt please richard i whispered it are you hurt his power pulsed through me and this time i made a small sound but not a good one youre going to raise my wolf if you dont control your power better i said it through gritted teeth one i was hurting two i was getting angry he leaned in against my face and drew a deep breath he was smelling my skin his power was like a warm wet heat pushing against me i was shielding as hard as i could against him his power all of it i thought of rock stone walls to hide behind and put them in his metaphysical way he spoke against my cheek his breath hot on my skin pain has a smell to it did you know that no yes id smelled it myself once twice when the beast was first prowling around inside me are you hurt he said each word slowly carefully his lips brushing against my cheek as he spoke another cramp hit me and i fought not to bend over my stomach i fought to sit in the water with him pressed against me and not react hed implied he could smell i was hurt most lycanthropes can smell a lie i said the only thing i could say yes he kissed my cheek and said thank you then he stood up and climbed out of the tub he reached for one of the towels in the pile that always seemed to be in the bathroom where are you going i asked though frankly i was ready for him to go away from you he said i let myself fold over the next cramp i didnt fight that it hurt he wanted to be a bastard fine when i looked up again he had the towel wrapped around his waist hed swallowed all that otherworldly energy as if when he covered his nakedness hed covered more than just his body ill send for a doctor no not yet why not yet because it may pass he frowned at me you sound like youve done this before ive had cramping beforenot this bad truthfullybut it faded micah he said the name like it was a curse yes i was tired of protecting richards ego frankly in that moment i was tired of richard he always gets there before i do there isnt a single thing that micah got to do that you didnt have the chance to do first my fault again he said your choices i said i couldnt keep the strain out of my voice fine let him know how much i was hurting i love that he said i frowned up at him my hands pressed over my abdomen what that sound in your voice i love it the last time i heard it was in rainas voice i frowned harder what are you talking about you know that she was a sexual sadist and god knows she was but she also liked pain she liked rough sex from both sides dishing it out and being the dish i couldnt frown harder so i said i actually did know that i have some of her memories remember thats right you carry her munin her ghostly memory the munin were the ancestral memories of the werewolves when a wolf died they ate a little bit of the deceased and made them a permanent group memory for real not just ritualthough most werewolves couldnt talk as directly as i could with rainas munin it was supposed to enable you to access memories get advice but raina had done her best to try to possess me for real i had almost complete ability to keep her contained inside me she wasnt like the beasts or the ardeur raina was something i could keep caged using her powers that was chancier you used her to heal the cross burn in your hand maybe you could use her to heal yourself now i looked at him the crossshaped burn on my hand was a shiny permanent scar rainas ability to heal was something i had retained it had been one of the reasons that richard had made her munin instead of leaving her body to rot shed been a sexual sadist and tried to kill us both but she had been powerful so i could sometimes use her abilities to heal myself and others but the cost was always high i could cage her inside me ignore her but if i let her out well she demanded payment her payment was usually painful or sexual or both i shook my head i dont think that would be a good idea right now have you ever seen memories of her and me together some i try to steer clear of them the last time i was able to do what we did today was with her he looked at me his face almost peaceful waiting you miss her i miss some things about her remember anita i was a virgin i didnt understand how unusual what she was teaching me was nothing to compare it to i said exactly there are other sexual positions where you can be as rough as you want and i wont hurt this much afterward richard part of it is that you dont do it this rough during the ardeur the ardeur steals my ability to guard myself dont you understand anita i hate and i love that i hurt you i love the sound of strain in your voice i love the thought that my body did this to you that just flat does it for me that i was so big so powerful so violent that youre hurt inside youre right if i hurt you enough for hospitals it wouldnt be fun that i wouldnt enjoy raina tried to get me to enjoy that level but for that she had to turn to gabriel gabriel had been in charge of the local wereleopards before i had to kill him hed being trying to rape and kill me on film at the time raina had been offstage urging him on theyd made a lovely couple in that lowercircleofhell sort of way id sent them to hell together on the same night talk about a double date yeah gabriel liked it serialkiller bad so did raina richard said though not her body not for the worst of it im told a good dominant in the bondage and submission scene never asks of their sub what they arent willing to do to their own body thats the rule richard said but we both know that raina wasnt a good dominant no i said she wasnt the cramping easing he made it a question yeah how did you know your face is smoothing out youre not clutching as much at your stomach and i watched raina work through the same kind of pain a lot she said one of the things she liked about me was that i could be as rough as she wanted in exactly the way she wanted it for future reference dont ever fuck me this hard in that position again okay he nodded what position do you like i opened my mouth closed it tried to think of how to phrase it i dont like it this rough on a nightly basis after a session even close to this rough it takes a day or two to feel like doing it again youll have to feed the ardeur in a few hours there are gentler ways to feed it richard not with micah there isnt wellendowed doesnt mean you cant be gentle richard he nodded youre right we stared at each other a moment something on his face made me say raina really fucked you up didnt she he nodded yes she did when she found out i enjoyed it rough she wanted to make sure id never be able to get my needs met anywhere but with her she meant to keep me anita and if she hadnt tried to include gabriel i might have stayed with her no you wouldnt have i said he gave me sad eyes how can you be so sure because youre a good person and if it hadnt been gabriel it would have been someone or something else raina couldnt resist pushing people past their boundaries shed have kept pushing until she broke you its what she did he nodded and took in a breath deep enough that it rocked his broad shoulders ill clean up in the group showers i wanted him to go but hed tried so hard hed actually saved me from marmee noir you can clean up here he shook his head no i cant the way he said it seemed odd why not because i like the idea i hurt you i like it a lot i dont trust myself not to hurt you again id say no richard you respect no he nodded but i also know the effect we have on each other i dont trust myself not to try to seduce you again so that i can push myself inside you while youre still bleeding from the first time he closed his eyes and a shudder ran down him from head to feet i didnt think it was because he was repulsed by what he wanted to do no it was a shudder of anticipation he was being honest with me with himself about what he wanted i like it rough sometimes richard but not that rough sorry he nodded and gave me a sad smile raina helped me enjoy intercourse too rough for anyone else she made nathaniel like pain in a way that most people wouldnt even survive i know he shook his head no you dont you think you know but you cant imagine it i saw some of what she taught him to enjoy he doesnt talk like you ever saw him with her i said blindfolds earplugs nose plugs you cant see hear or smell whos in the room she invited me over once tried to get me to help her but torturing was never anything i liked raina found that disappointing i swallowed and tried to think of something useful to say nothing came to mind i dont know what to say to that i dont know why i told you that did i want to shock you did i want you to think less of nathaniel less of me he shook his head and started for the door again i was ready for him to leave because i didnt know what to do with the mood he was in and i really didnt want more sex the hard cramps had passed but i was hurting and would be for a while he stopped with his hand on the doorknob do you realize that most of the men in your bed are ones that she was with i hadnt thought about it he turned and looked over his shoulder at me jeanclaude was with her and gabriel it was the price she demanded from him you know she made jason a werewolf yeah id actually shared that memory with jason shed tied him to a bed and cut him up while she fucked him she hadnt cared whether he lived or died id been inside her head on the memory and she hadnt cared she really was serialkiller material because her pleasure had meant more to her than jasons life i got a whisper through my head think harder anita i shivered and that made my lower body hurt go richard go okay whats wrong i think i need not to think about her so hard she talked to you i nodded you think you have her under control and maybe you do but you might just think on this jeanclaude me jason nathaniel all of us were hers first maybe theres a reason youre attracted to her old lovers with that very unsettling thought he left closing the door behind him i was happy that richard was doing therapy it was helping honest the trouble was he seemed to want me to do therapy with him and that i wasnt ready for chapter seventeen i did a quick cleanup and then realized i had no clothes in the bathroom my robe was lying in a heap beside the bed great i wrapped the towel more securely around my hair then wrapped one of the bigger towels around my body one of the good things about being short was that the towel covered me from armpits to ankles the funny thing was that almost no matter who was in the other room theyd probably seen me nude at least once i should have just walked out and gotten my clothes out of the armoire and ignored everybody but i couldnt do it i just couldnt do it i wasnt that comfortable around my own nudity there were days when i was pretty sure id never be that comfortable worse yet my gun was outside in the bedroom my clothes i could live without but that id left my gun in the other room said just how much richard affected me he made me forget myself even the parts of me that almost no one else could drive from my mind for some reason i just couldnt go out there unarmed i dont know why i just couldnt do it i was still aching all the way up to almost my belly button the cramping had mostly stopped but i was feeling stupid and vulnerable i wanted a gun it would make me feel better there that was the truth id started hiding guns in the places where i spent a lot of time they were for emergencies this wasnt an emergency but hell with it it was my gun if i felt the need screw it i knelt down by the sink and opened the cabinet doors i had to reach back and up into the plumbing to find it but there was my firestar ducttaped among the pipes thered been a couple of times when id been separated from my carry guns and needed a gun so id given into my paranoia and hidden a few around the firestar wasnt my main backup gun anymore so it lived here as the ultimate hideaway i brought the gun out into the light and laughed there was writing on the tape it read anitas gun in nathaniels handwriting hed been with me the day i did it apparently hed added his own little touch when i wasnt looking hed handed me the pieces of tape had he written on it then and i just hadnt noticed or had he come back later id ask him it left me smiling and shaking my head as i took the tape off the gun id have put it in my pocket if id had one the gun was very visible against the white towel i tried the grip in my hand squeezed it a little a tightness in the center of my body eased what does it say about your life when a gun makes you feel this much safer i checked to make sure the gun was still loaded because any time a gun has been out of your sight you damn well better check never trust anyone else that a gun is either loaded or unloaded check it yourself gun safety towel tucked tight under my arms and gun in hand i opened the door i thought for a moment the bedroom was empty but then clay and graham stood up near the fireplace theyd been sitting in the rooms only chairs clay shouldnt you be in bed somewhere you just got off work at guilty pleasures i looked at the bed and found it stripped down to the slightly singed mattress my gun had been there somewhere as if he read my mind clay said your gun is in the bedside table i didnt check to make sure he was telling the truth one i trusted clay two i had a gun in one hand and the other hand helped hold the towel in place i was armed and out of hands thanks but why arent you in bed after they found the bugs in all the businesses jeanclaude asked us to do double shifts he ran his hand through his short blond curls early twenties looked better on no sleep but he still looked tired dont i even get a hello graham asked i looked at him and couldnt fight a frown he was about the same size as clay six feet tall but his shoulders were much broader graham was muscled in a way that only serious weight lifting would give you his black hair was so long on top that his dark eyes peered out from the hair the bottom of his hair was freshly shaved very short so that it looked like two different haircuts put together he wasnt wearing the black tshirt that was standard bodyguard wear he was wearing red the red shirt was a new addition to the bodyguard uniform most of them were still in black some with the appropriate club name and security written on them or just plain black red meant the guard was okay with being emergency food for the ardeur it had been remuss idea originally hed come up with it after id nearly killed damian nathaniel and myself from not feeding the ardeur enough i thought the red shirt idea was a joke until the first guard showed up wearing one strangely since the red shirt policy went into effect id gained a much better control over the ardeur lets hear it for fear embarrassment and sheer stubbornness graham had been trying to get into my pants for months so no big surprise that he volunteered what creeped me out was some of the other guards whod done it men i hadnt known thought of me in a sexual way i mean its one thing to suspect a man lusts after you but absolute confirmation well that made me uncomfortable hey graham nice shirt i said and i was happy that it sounded hostile why are you mad at me its not my rule be mad at remus or claudia or jeanclaude its their rule that you are not to be alone in a room unless accompanied by a man willing to feed the ardeur since when i asked since this mysterious bad guy came to town no ones giving details but apparently the people who give us orders are worried that the bad guys will use magic to make the ardeur go out of control so you have to have food at all times he didnt sound happy about it maybe my being pissy was finally rubbing off on graham good were short of red shirts today anita clay said why because the guard is doubled around all of jeanclaudes businesses hes having to renegotiate with rafael and narcissus for more people i guess we pay more money we get more men i said the two men exchanged a look maybe clay said i was getting cold standing there in nothing but a towel so i went to the armoire for clothes what else could they be negotiating for except money i said i stared at the double door of the armoire because the towel was slipping and i had a gun in the other hand id never been good at getting a towel to stay fastened it wasnt like both of the men hadnt seen me naked but damn it power clay said everyone wants a closer tie to jeanclaude now that hes his own vampire bloodline and narcissus is seriously freaked that ashers new animal to call is hyena freaked how i asked i tucked the arm with the gun tight on the towel and tugged on the door of the armoire it stuck were wolves not hyenas so this is all secondhand clay said narcissus wants guarantees that asher wont try to run his clan i finally got the door opened yea for me asher isnt powerful enough to do that maybe clay said but narcissus is worried about it he wants to negotiate now before its an issue i had black jeans in hand but i really needed the second hand to get the other clothes oh for gods sake graham said he stalked toward me he was angry enough that as he got closer i got little bits of it like embers from a fire hitting my skin he grabbed the edge of the jeans in my hand i held on we glared at each other ill just hold the clothes for you anita thats it okay it was a reasonable idea it was helpful so why didnt i want to do it because graham seriously bugged me his persistent pursuit of sex with me with no pretense of emotion let alone love really hit my buttons wrong of course if hed lied about me being the love of his life that would have pissed me off more god i let go of the jeans i took a deep breath let it out slowly and said thank you graham blinked down at me as if id never said thank you to him before maybe i hadnt shame on me then he put his life on the line to keep me safe so he was a lech at least he was an honest lech i looked up at him this close i could see the slight uptilt of his brown eyes his mother was japanese which got him the hair and eyes the rest of him looked like his blond and blueeyed father had cloned himself meeting his parents by accident one night hadnt made me like him better in fact it had made it worse his parents seemed like good people would they be ashamed to know how much of a horndog their only child was it seemed likely i shook my head and turned back to the armoire id concentrate on getting dressed that would help me feel better i always felt better with clothes on grandma blakes influence there was a woman who thought naked meant bad i was getting low on shirts here my choices were black or red black made me look like one of the bodyguards and red well red looked like all the red shirts were my people like a special anita blake uniform i picked up one of the black shirts put it back picked up a red shirt put it back anita just pick a shirt graham said i hadnt realized until this moment that my normal offduty clothes are the same as the uniform for you guys why is that a problem he asked i dont know i said and that was the truth then pick red i promise that just because were dressed like we match its not a date okay he finally sounded angry i sighed im sorry that it bugs me that the red shirts mean that people want to fuck me it does bug me it really does the color of my shirt didnt change anything about how i interact with you graham said ive been honest from the beginning about what id like to do i nodded you know graham i was just thinking that youve been honest i say i like honest but i guess i dont like honest past a certain point i grabbed the red shirt i needed to grow up about this issue and buy some differentcolored clothes i added jogging socks and black jogging shoes to the pile in grahams arms i did the mental list and finally realized i didnt have any underwear in the pile i opened the bottom drawer in the armoire strangely there was plenty of lingerie jeanclaude had gotten me to the point where i didnt own any simple underwear everything had lace or fishnet or something on it i had learned to buy two to three pairs of the panties to one matching bra you could wear bras longer than underwear i finally stood up with bra and panties in hand i started to put them on the pile but caught grahams look id picked a red bra to go under the red shirt it was one of the thinner red babydoll tees so id picked something that wouldnt show through the bra and panties were both red satin the bra was a pushup bra because it got my breasts up and out of the way of my shoulder holster or rather out of the way of drawing the gun a moment ago i hadnt thought a thing about it id picked what worked under the shirt now i was suddenly very aware that the underwear was nice underwear i met grahams eyes and there was such heat in them it was written all over his face that he wanted to see me in the bra and panties bare on his face in his eyes that hed give a great deal to see me in the lingerie and do something about it heat washed up my face i blushed embarrassingly easily sometimes this was one of those times if hed been one of my boyfriends id have reacted to that look that demand we could have gone into the bathroom and let that heat wash over both of us maybe but he wasnt my boyfriend and his wanting to fuck me wasnt enough reason for me to fuck him when id had the pregnancy scare last month the fact that i hadnt had sex with graham that he wasnt on the maybedaddy list had filled me with such relief that i knew he wasnt going to be one of my sweeties the pregnancy scare had put a lot of things in perspective i was now back to looking at men thinking if i got pregnant by accident how big a disaster would it be maybe a few months from now i wouldnt be so freaked and that wouldnt be a question that i thought of so strongly then again maybe it still would be i had had a false positive on a pregnancy test it had scared the hell out of me i looked up into his face he was handsome there was nothing wrong with him exactly but i still remembered how happy i was that he wasnt on the list of men who might have made me pregnant if you get knocked up it should be by someone whos at least a good friend and graham wasnt even that he was my bodyguard and hed been emergency food but he wasnt my friend he wanted to fuck me too badly to be my friend any man who would rather have sex with you than anything else is never going to be your friend friends want whats best for you more than they want sex grahams priorities were there on his face in his eyes in the tension of his body as he held my clothes youre blushing he said and his voice sounded hoarse i nodded and looked down away from that look maybe the blushing would stop if i wasnt meeting his eyes he touched my face the barest tips of his fingers on my chin after everything ive seen you do with all the other men youre blushing because im looking too hard at you his voice was softer now you think i cant be embarrassed because im a whore not true he tried to turn my face up to his i stepped back from him so he couldnt touch my face isnt it i asked and this time the face i gave him held the beginnings of anger i see you with the other men and i want youwhy is that wrong ive watched you have sex with multiple men while im in the room what am i supposed to think oh graham this from clay hed stayed on the far side of the room out of it but those two words let me know that clay got it clay understood the mistake that graham had just made i can fix that graham fix what fix it so youre not conflicted anymore about me what are you talking about the fact that he hadnt realized where i was going was also a point against him he wasnt a quick thinker youre off my detail he clutched the clothes to his ohsobroad chest what do you mean i cant guarantee that the ardeur wont get out of hand and ill lose control enough to fuck in front of my guards again since it bothers you so much graham i can fix it so you never have to watch again i dontthe first hint of unhappiness came over him he finally saw where we were going you are off my detail put my clothes in the bathroom on the edge of the sink and go find remus or claudia tell them that you need to be replaced im sure that there are places you can guard that will be far enough away from me anita i didnt mean it the way the way it sounded i finished for him yeah you did please anita please i put the clothes in the bathroom and go tell someone that you need to be replaced do it now he looked behind him at clay clay put his hands up in a pushaway gesture as if to say dont look at me this isnt fair graham said what are you five fair fuck fair you just said out loud that watching me fuck other men makes you want to fuck me i can fix that you dont have to watch anymore do you really think any man whos watched you fuck someone didnt want to be that man all of us think the same thing im just honest about it i looked across the room at clay that true clay oh please do not drag me into this i gave him a hard look he sighed no actually thats not how all of us feel for myself im scared shitless of your idea of sex the ardeur scares me how can you say that graham asked he turned toward the other man with my clothes still clutched in his big arms because its the truth graham and if you would think with something higher than your belt buckle youd be scared too scared of what graham said its the most mindblowing sex that any vampire line can give a mortal ive had more of a taste of it than you have trust me clay if shed ever fed off you even a little youd want more thats exactly what scares me clay said i had a thought a bad one i had fed on graham in small ways when the ardeur was new id given him the smallest taste of it that i could we had never been naked together we had never touched each other in any area that was considered sexual but just because i thought it hadnt been enough contact to addict him to the ardeur didnt mean i was right the ardeur could act like a drug and id learned through some of the vampires that how easily addicted to it you were varied from person to person had i addicted graham to the ardeur without meaning to was his reaction to me my fault shit graham turned back to me with my clothes crushed against his chest he looked panic stricken please anita please dont do this im sorry okay im sorry his eyes glittered through the fringe of his hair i think he was on the verge of tears i was reminded that he was under twentyfive by a few years he was so physically big that sometimes you forgot how young he was we were only about four or five years apart but his eyes showed that he was younger than i had been at the same age i wanted to touch his arm comfort him apologize to him tell him i hadnt meant this to happen but i was afraid to touch him i was afraid id make things worse somehow graham and my voice sounded gentle a voice for soothing frightened children and ledge jumpers i need you to find remus or claudia and bring them to me okay i need to talk to them about some of the things that happened last night can you do that for me can you find one of them and bring them to me he swallowed hard enough that it sounded painful you wont kick me off your detail no i said he nodded too fast too often over and over he actually started for the door with my clothes still in his hands it was clay who took the clothes from him when the door closed behind him clay turned to me we stared at each other hes addicted isnt he clay asked i nodded i think so you didnt know either i shook my head you look pale he said you too i said you havent fed that much from him right i mean you didnt even get naked together right no we didnt i thought it took more than that to addict someone to it so did i i said clay seemed to shake himself like a dog coming out of water ill put your clothes in the bathroom for you ill call claudia and tell her we need a new red shirt i think once she sees graham shell figure it out he hid it pretty well anita i think by the time he finds them hell have his shit together it may not show i nodded youre right i mean he has a radio on him too he didnt think to use it the radios are new i said the wererats have been handing the radio setups to some of the guards when they found all the hightech listening devices i think they decided that we needed to go highertech ourselves sounds reasonable i said i felt jeanclaude wake felt it like a hand caressing my body it caught my breath in my throat whats wrong clay asked jeanclaudes awake good i nodded good was right i let jeanclaude feel how much i wanted him to be with me i wanted him to hold me and tell me it was all going to be all right in that moment i wanted him to comfort me even if it was all lies grahams face had been all the truth i wanted for a little while chapter eighteen i was dressed by the time jeanclaude knocked on the bathroom door his ma petite may i come in was uncertain of its welcome i guess he thought id blame him for the ardeur having addicted graham thered been a time not too long ago that i might have but it was too late for blame blame wouldnt fix it and i wanted it fixed i wanted graham free of the ardeur if we could manage it id freed others of the ardeur but theyd been completely rolled by it id never had anyone this addicted from such a small piece of it or maybe i had and they were hiding it too god i wish i hadnt thought of that ma petite yes i mean come in god please come in the door opened he stood framed for a moment before i flung myself onto him burying my face against the furred lapels of his robe i clutched at the heavy black brocade pressing myself tight against him his arms enfolded me lifted me off the ground and moved us both inside the room one arm held me close the other hand reached back and closed the door behind us the move was so fast i didnt have time to protest or think about it he let my feet touch the floor ma petite ma petite what is so very wrong me i said im wrong i spoke calmly i didnt yell i just happened to be talking with my face against his robe he drew me away from him enough for him to see my face ma petite i felt your distress but i do not know what has caused it graham is addicted to the ardeur when did this happen he asked his face gone to careful blankness he was probably unsure what expression wouldnt upset me i dont know he studied my face and even that careful blankness could not hide his concern when did you give graham a stronger taste of the ardeur i didnt i swear i havent touched him again ive worked really hard not to touch him the words came faster and faster until even to me it sounded hysterical but i couldnt stop jeanclaude put a finger on my lips and stopped all the protest if you have not touched him again ma petite then he cannot be addicted to the ardeur i tried to say something but he kept his finger touching my mouth the fact that graham wants you is not proof of addiction ma petite you underestimate the pull of your sweet self i shook my head and moved my face back so i could speak hes addicted damn it i know the difference between lust and addiction ask clay if you dont trust me i pulled away from him it didnt feel comforting to touch him anymore i trust you ma petite he was frowning now then take my word for it graham is addicted and i dont know when it happened do you understand ive avoided him ive done everything i can to keep him away from the ardeur and still let him be a bodyguard today i tried to fire him from my guard detail what did he say to that he was panic stricken he was nearly in tears ive never seen him like that he only calmed down when i told him i wouldnt replace him on my detail the ardeur is not so easily caught ma petite the few touches that graham has had are not enough to addict him i saw it i was pacing the room now i think you need a cross ma petite what i asked he went to the door opened it could you please get one of the extra crosses out of the bedside table i caught a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror the red shirt seemed to blaze against my pale skin and dark hair the scarlet seemed to be some sort of accusation like a scarlet woman the scarlet letter the last thought stopped me as if the hysteria had hit a stumbling block i could think for a second scarlet woman the scarlet letter this wasnt me thinking shit i was being messed with my gun and holster were still beside the sink i hadnt had time to put it on before jeanclaude came i put my hand on the butt of the gun and squeezed that was me i was me the gun wasnt a magical talisman but sometimes all you need to get someone out of your head is to remind yourself who you arewho you really are not who they think you are or who they think you think you are but you the real you the gun in my hand was me ma petite i would prefer you step away from the gun until you are wearing a cross i nodded im being messed with arent i i believe so its daylight early daylight if the vampires that are messing with us are in town they shouldnt be able to do this they are the harlequin ma petite now you begin to see what that means i nodded again clutching at the gun as id clutched at jeanclaude earlier ma petite if you would step away from the gun the gun is helping jeanclaude its reminding me that all the hysterics isnt me humor me ma petite i looked at him his face was still that beautiful blankness but there was a tension to his shoulders the way he held his body clay was behind him in the doorway and he wasnt even trying to hide that he was worried ive got the cross he said i nodded again give it to me he glanced at jeanclaude who nodded clay walked forward with his hand in a fist you may want to step outside jeanclaude he said i cannot leave you alone with her wont the cross react to you non for i am doing nothing to her i held my left hand out toward clay just give me the cross by the chain jeanclaude said good thinking i said i dont need another crossshaped burn scar clay held his fist out to me then opened it so that the cross dangled from a thin gold chain if a vampire had been in the room causing trouble that would have been enough to make the cross glow hell even in clays hand it might have glowed the cross just hung there were we wrong was i wrong touch only the chain ma petite caution is better if he hadnt repeated that i might have just grabbed the cross but at the last second i touched the chain clay let it go and it swung delicate and golden in my hand for a heartbeat i thought wed been wrong then the cross burst into a brilliant yellow glow i had to turn my eyes away from it i had a thought of what it might be doing to jeanclaude but i could see nothing past the golden light i called to him jeanclaude a male voice that i wasnt sure of said hes out of the room hes safe i yelled clay claudia i wanted a voice i knew out of the brilliant yellow light claudias voice a little farther away clay got jeanclaude out with that worry out of the way i could concentrate on the other problem if the vampire that had been messing with me was in the room then the cross would have driven him away hell when marmee noir messed with me a cross like this had driven her away so why wasnt this working on the harlequin the chain grew warm in my hand if this kept up it would get hot shit if i threw the cross down it would stop glowing but would the vampire attack again would he enter my mind again without my knowing it god these guys were good scary good anita what can i do to help the mans voice again i recognized the voice now jake one of our newer bodyguards i dont know i said i yelled it as if the light were sound and i was having trouble hearing over it i prayed help me help me figure this out i dont know if it was the prayer or if the prayer helped me think chickenegg i think but i knew what to do with the cross blazing in my hand i could feel the vampire now that i thought to look for it i was a necromancer and that meant i had an affinity with the dead i could feel the others power like a seed in my back as if hed marked me somehow that seed had let him inside me over and over since the movies last night i wanted that seed gone i thrust my power into that spot but i should have known better with jeanclaudes power i might have just ripped it out of me cast it aside but my power was different my power liked the dead i touched the mark the vampire had made in my body i didnt understand how hed done it and i didnt care i wanted it gone but the moment my necromancy touched it it was as if a door blew open inside my head i caught a glimpse of stone walls and a male figure i smelled wolf i tried to see clearly but it was as if darkness ate at the edges of the picture i concentrated on that image willed it to be clear willed the man to turn and show me he turned but there was no face i was looking at a black mask with a huge false nose i thought for a moment i could see his eyes then the eyes filled with silver light almost a soft light then that soft silver light shot out of the mask and slammed into me i came back to myself airborne falling i didnt even have time to be afraid chapter nineteen i had a blurred image of black marble glass a second to realize that i was about to hit the mirrors around jeanclaudes tub i tried to both tense and relax for the impact a dark blur passed me and when i smacked into the mirrors there was a body behind me a body that wrapped itself around me and took the impact as we hit the glass and the wall underneath i heard the glass break and we slid in a heap at the edge of the tub i lay there stunned breath knocked out of me it suddenly seemed very important to hear my own heartbeat i blinked at nothing for a moment or two only when the body under me groaned did i turn my head enough to see in the mirrors that werent cracked who id landed on jake lay in a heap against the spiderweb cracks of the glass he was one of the newest members of richards pack though not new to being a werewolf and had only been a bodyguard for a few weeks his eyes were closed blood trickled down from his short dark curls he wasnt moving i gazed up past us and saw that some of the jagged pieces were missing there was a huge piece that sparkled as it moved away from the wall and begin to fall toward us i grabbed jake and pulled with everything i had i pulled like i didnt expect him to move but i forgot that i was more than human strong i pulled and he moved moved so hard and sudden that we ended up in the bathtub i was suddenly underwater with his weight on top of me before i could panic he startled awake grabbing my arms and jerked us both to the surface we came up gasping as the glass tinkled like sharp raindrops where wed just been lying shit this from the doorway i blinked water out of my eyes to see claudia in the room there were more guards crowding in behind her claudia strode into the room and lifted me bodily out of the tub other hands lifted jake he fell to his knees when they got him out it took two of them to carry him into the bedroom i walked on my own but claudia kept her hand on my arm i think she expected me to collapse too other than being wet everything seemed to be working but i didnt bother telling her to let go of me with the grip she had call it a hunch but she wouldnt have done it anyway id learned to argue carefully with claudia it upped my chances of winning the arguments claudia halfled halfpulled me into the bedroom the room was nearly black with bodyguards a handful of red shirts stood out like berries in a muffinthough muffin didnt quite cover the level of adrenalinecharged readiness there was so much tension it felt as if i should have been able to walk across it some of them had guns out pointed at the floor or ceiling i stood there dripping wet searching the crowd for jeanclaude as if she understood what i was doing claudia said i sent jeanclaude outside hes safe anita i promise graham stepped out from the crowd we thought it might be a plot to hurt him he looked and sounded fine now there was no sign of the earlier panic how you feeling i asked he gave me a puzzled grin shouldnt i be asking you that a chill ran through me that had nothing to do with standing wet in the colder air you dont remember do you remember what he asked shit i said claudia turned me toward her whats going on anita hang on a minute okay her grip on my arm tightened enough that it hurt she probably could have crushed it if shed been this muscled and human but combine the workout with being a wererat and she was very strong watch the grip claudia i said she let me go and wiped her hand against her jeans to get rid of the water sorry its okay i said a sound of ripping cloth took my attention from graham jake was on his knees by the armoire someone had ripped his shirt down the back the bare back was bleeding a lot cisco one of the youngest of the wererats was picking glass out of that oncesmooth skin jake was a werewolf and he was this hurt it meant that if it had been my back id be going to the hospital thanks jake i said just doing my job maam his voice hesitated at the end as cisco and another guard started picking glass out of him did anyone check his scalp for glass claudia asked no one said yes she called out juanito check him for glass juanito was another newer guard id been introduced to some of them when the word went out that we needed more men but the tall dark handsome man was a stranger to me id nodded at him that was about it at least jake had been here a few weeks juanito meant little juan but he didnt match his name he was six feet at least slender but muscular he was not a little anything as far as i could tell im not a medic he said i didnt ask claudia said he just stood there staring at her clearly not happy i gave you an order follow it she said i hadnt heard that tone in claudias voice often if id been him id have done what she said he moved to the kneeling werewolf and started picking through the wet curls he didnt do it like his heart was in it though cisco and the other guard seemed to be taking their job seriously graham brought a large towel from the bathroom and started picking up the bloody pieces of glass that were already on the floor cisco and the others started dropping the glass onto the towel it looked like red rain and sharp little pieces of hail how bad is jake hurt i asked claudia not bad but we dont want the skin healing over the glass that happen often i asked often enough she said i looked back at the men and found that jakes back was smoothing even as i watched is it just me or is he healing fast even for a shapeshifter its not just you claudia said he heals faster than almost anyone ive ever met the three guards were searching frantically along his body trying to stay ahead of his skin as it flowed over the wounds juanito had gotten over his reluctance and was now searching jakes hair with fumbling fingers desperately searching through the curls im not going to get them all hes healing too fast the glass you miss you get to cut out claudia said shit he said and worked faster jake made almost no sound while everyone picked at his wounds he stayed silent and motionless under their hands id have been cursing and at least flinching graham had apparently picked up all the stray glass he could find because he wiped his fingers on the towel and stood up graham you wearing a holy item i hoped hed say no no he said relief flooded through me and i shivered i was cold from the wet clothes and the reaction to the accident no not accident the harlequin had tried to kill me fuck i hadnt understood even with everyones warnings i hadnt understood i was like a kid whod poked a kitten with a stick and found a tiger staring at me talk to us anita claudia said there were so many people in the room that they couldnt all know about the harlequin how to explain without overexplaining the bad guys messed with graham a lot and he doesnt remember it what are you talking about graham asked no ones messed with me ask clay i said he saw it too claudia hit the radio in her hand and called for clay to join us when he could then she turned to me from the top anita all of it i cant give you all of it until i talk to jeanclaude this cloakanddagger shit is getting old this from fredo slender not too tall and dangerous he was the only wererat who carried a gun sometimes but preferred knives lots of them for me too i said but you guys have to know about graham now not later were listening claudia said she was very serious almost threatening she didnt like the cloakanddagger stuff either i didnt blame her i told them though i toned it down for grahams embarrassments sake claudia said a vampire in daylight from a distance messed with graham yes i said that shouldnt be possible she said not in daylight from a distance no it shouldnt be youre telling me as a vampire executioner that youve never seen anything like this i started to say no then stopped ive had a few masters of the city mess with me from a distance when i was sleeping and in their territory but that was at night she said true i said we stared at each other are you saying these guysshe stopped herself i waited for her to finish when she didnt i said holy objects need to be mandatory for everyone it didnt help you much just now she said it kept them from messing with my head as bad as they messed with grahams he doesnt even remember i know you wouldnt lie graham said but because i dont remember i dont believe it thats what makes vampire mind tricks so dangerous i said that very thing the victim doesnt remember so it didnt happen jakes voice came with only a slight edge of strain to it what did you do to get the cross to do that it wasnt the cross i said there was a flash of blade as juanito searched jakes dark curls for the right spot apparently they were going to have to cut some of the glass out i wanted to look away but i couldnt let myself do that jake had gotten hurt because of me the least i could do was watch the cleanup what was it then he asked the last word hissed as the blade cut into his scalp i im not sure how to explain it try he said through gritted teeth i tried to fight back with my necromancy and they he didnt like it juanito shook the piece of glass onto the bloody towel then turned back to search through the nowbloody curls he claudia asked yeah definitely he did you see him jake asked and his breath went out sharp as another piece of glass went on the towel not exactly see but i felt him the energy was definitely male how was it male jake asked his voice thin with pain i thought about it i thought i saw a male figure for an instant and thei almost said mask and stopped myself but that could have been illusion except that the power felt male what else did you get his body shuddered as cisco worked on his back apparently finding more glass hed missed crap i answered though i probably shouldnt have but hed taken my hit i felt like i owed him wolf i smelled wolf he cried out under the knives that hurt im sorry cisco muttered im really sorry juanito said got it he raised bloody fingers from jakes hair something glittered in his hands that wasnt the knife thats the last of it all i can find hope i can return the favor sometime jake said if i apologized like cisco would you be less pissed yes jake said fine i apologize i accept it cisco moved back from him and laid something that looked like solid blood on the towel thats it for your back too thanks jake said he tried to get to his feet but fell against the armoire so hard it shuddered hands reached to help him covering his arms in bloody prints of his own blood he pushed them away im all right then he fell to his knees help him claudia said cisco and juanito reached for him again jake waved them away i walked the few feet to them i knelt in front of jake so that i could meet his eyes without him straining he rolled brown eyes up to me his normally handsome face seemed strained and tired he was a little too masculine handsome for my tastes i liked men a little softer looking but i could still appreciate the view except now the view was hurting too badly to be admired id be in the hospital or worse now jake thank you like i said its my job but his voice was strained let them help you please he looked at me for a long moment what do you think the wolf smell meant i think it was the vamps animal to call some vamps smell like their animal most vampires smell like vampires to me he said ive met a couple that smelled like their animals to call i didnt add out loud that those had been auggie master of chicago and marmee noir auggie was about two thousand years old and mommie dearest was older than dirt which put this vampire in very powerful company youre thinking something what is it he asked i might not have answered him except hed gotten himself hurt protecting me it made me feel guilty that the only two vamps ive ever known who smelled that much like their animals were auggie master of chicago and the mother of all darkness ive heard of augustine but the mother of all darkness im not sure who that is shes the mother of all vampires i said his eyes widened then flinched powerful shit yeah i said powerful shit let them take you to the doc okay he gave a small nod okay cisco and juanito picked him up under the arms they did it like he wasnt tall and muscled and weighed at least two hundred pounds superstrength did come in handy he got his feet sort of under him as the guards parted and let them through by the time they had the door jake was almost walking upright almost chapter twenty this time i chose a black shirt because my last clean bra was hanging up to dry in the bathroom i was never entirely comfortable without a bra i wasnt sure whether the fact that the black babydoll shirt was tight enough that it helped support my breasts was a good thing or not i think i would have preferred the shirt to be looser tight felt better but it looked like id done it on purpose rather than just running out of clothes also braless the shoulder holster fit but if i had to draw the gun id brush the edge of my breast it was a small irritation but it could make you hesitate for a second sometimes a second was enough to get you killed i stood in the bathroom grumpy and uncomfortable it was like my skin was too small itchy with embarrassment and swallowed anger i searched myself with the same eyes that let you see images in your head for that spot where the harlequin had marked me it was gone but i could still see the spot like a bruise a metaphysical bruise as if their touch had hurt me in a way that would last i dried my hair a little more with a towel and actually scrunched some haircare product in the curls i was half embarrassed that i used stuff on my hair but jeanclaude had convinced me there was no shame to a little pampering it still felt girlie to do it should you be worried about your hair frizzing when you wear a gun at least twelve of any given twentyfour hours seemed like you shouldnt there was a soft knock on the door what i asked and even to me it sounded angry shit im sorry anita but jeanclaude sent me to check on you sorry clay its just been one of those days already breakfast is waiting in the living room he said through the closed door is there coffee i asked fresh from the guards break room i took in a deep breath let it out and went for the door coffee everything would be better after coffee i expected graham to be with clay but it was sampson he wasnt a guard in fact he was sort of a visiting prince he was the eldest son of the master vampire of cape cod samuel their vampire group wanted a closer tie with us and one way to do that was for sampson to audition as my new pomme de sang apple of blood like a kept mistress it had been nathaniels job until he moved up the power structure to my animal to call now i needed a new snacky bit whether i liked it or whether i didnt the ardeur needed more food so far id managed to avoid having sex with sampson since he was almost as embarrassed about the whole situation as i was well it hadnt been that hard to avoid it wasnt that he wasnt handsome he was tall broadshouldered with a fall of dark curls that were identical to his fathers he even had his fathers hazel eyes in fact he was one of those sons who looked like the father had cloned himself except he was a few inches taller and somehow softer but then samuel was over a thousand years old you didnt survive that long in vampire society by being soft you certainly didnt rise to be master of the city by being soft and you sure as hell didnt stay there by being anything but hard sampson smiled at me and it was a nice smile boyish a little bashful he was wearing a white buttonup shirt with the sleeves rolled back and the collar loose the shirt was untucked over dress slacks he was barefoot his mother was a mermaid a siren and it made sampson react more like a shapeshifter sometimes he didnt like shoes though he did like clothes better than my furry friends maybe water is colder were shorthanded remember clay said i remember though i didnt sound happy about it am i that big a disappointment sampson asked but his smile widened and his eyes twinkled with it he never seemed to take my bad moods personally of course id met his mother thea she was like the ocean calm one minute rising up to kill you the next i think shed sort of broken him to the thought that women were moody thanks for volunteering to be food so the red shirt guards could be elsewhere i said and my voice sounded nicely dry and sarcastic i heard youd already fed the ardeur he said i nodded he held his arm out to me then allow me to escort you to your master and real food i sighed but i took his arm sampson was supposed to have been a shortterm loan to the larger vampire community he was here to try out for the position of pomme de sang that was half the truth the other half was that his mother was a siren and the last of her kind she was a genetic queen among the merfolk magical powerful and most of that magic was sexual in nature all mermaids could be alluring to mortals but sirens could force you to wreck your ship they could call you down to the sea and drown you and youd enjoy it they were sort of like master vampires except more specialized and more rare like i said thea was the last of her kind unless her sons could be brought into their full power problem was the only way to bring a siren into their power was sex with another siren since thea was the last of her kind and her sons were the last potential of her bloodline well it was all too oedipus rex for comfort she actually had no problem with doing the job herself shed been worshipped as a goddess once a few thousand years ago gods and goddesses married each other all the time or at least fucked but samuel though a thousand years old was more conventional he told her if she approached sampson again for it hed kill her furthermore if she approached their seventeenyearold twin sons at all hed kill her again so greek tragedy but if their sons could be as powerful as thea or even close then suddenly samuels family would rule the east coast they just would they were our allies and friends jeanclaude had called samuel friend for a few centuries them powerful didnt seem like a bad idea the idea was that the ardeur might be similar enough to siren power that i might be able to bring sampson into his sirenhood if i could great if i couldnt then thea had promised to leave her sons alone and accept that she was the last of the sirens that her sons being half human or half vampire depending on how you looked at it meant they werent mermaid enough to be what she was see why id agreed to keeping sampson around for a while i mean i was like their only chance to avoid a family tragedy of epic proportions but it still made me feel squeachy but i slid my left arm through his arm i let him lead me to the door with clay ahead of us doing the bodyguard thing though frankly since i was the only one armed i didnt feel all that protected the only wolf id seen with a gun had been jake jake had a military background so richard had given him permission to carry weaponry id asked richards permission to take some of the wolf guards to the shooting range and see who could handle a gun hed said hed think about it i had no idea why he had a problem with the werewolves being armed but he was ulfric wolf king and his word was law i was lupa but in wolf society thats more like an ubergirlfriend its not a queen and its not equal i preferred leopard society it was less sexist nimirra truly was equal to nimirraj we were still in the stone corridor with the draped walls of the living room in sight when i heard enough voices to know it was a lot more than jeanclaude waiting for me clay lifted to one side the heavy spill of drapes that made up the living room walls so sampson and i could enter jeanclaude and richard had to turn on the couch to look as we entered jeanclaudes face remained pleasant and welcoming as he stood richards face clouded over his gaze flicking to sampson on my arm richard fought to control his emotions the effort visible on his face and in the set of his shoulders the way his hands flexed i appreciated that he was trying i appreciated the effort enough that i let go of sampsons arm and went to richard i leaned over the couch and kissed him on the cheek he looked surprised as if it had been a long time since i had kissed him first there were after all so many choices micah stood across the room setting his plate down on the glass coffee table with the rest of the food that someone had brought into the underground nathaniel was sitting on the floor by the table he smiled at me but he stayed where he was hed wait his turn for his greeting i went to jeanclaude next because he was closest if we were doing formal we did the greetings more formally but at breakfast with just us we tried not to sweat the niceties sampson had been raised in a kiss of vampires that did it oldschool which meant they all did the miss manners version vampire style no matter the hour or the event by those rules id already made three mistakes one i had let go of sampsons arm you stayed on your escorts arm until someone more powerful got you off that arm or until your escort introduced you to someone he was willing to give you up to two id greeted someone in the room before id greeted the master of the city three id greeted a wereanimal ruler before greeting the highestranking vamp in the room oldschool meant that no one was more important than the vampires the exception to this rule at sampsons home was his mother thea technically she was samuels animal to call but if sampsons father had any weakness it was thea so you ignored her at your peril she was queen to samuels king no matter what vampire rules said jeanclaude was in one of his very formal white shirts with a real cravat held in place with a silver and sapphire stickpin on his chest hed even put on a black velvet jacket with matching silver buttons it was very militaristic the shirt id seen before or one like it the jacket was newto me at least i hadnt seen it yet but i was pretty sure somewhere in the underground there was a huge room full of nothing but jeanclaudes clothes the pants were actually cloth but fit tighter than any dress slacks id ever seen the tight pants smoothed into thighhigh boots that were black and leather and had silver buckles up the side of them from ankle to midthigh he was way too dressed up for just a family breakfast when he drew me into his arms the curls that brushed my face were still damp from the shower if he took the time to bathe hed take the time to dry his hair you seem tense ma petite he whispered into my own damp hair youre way too well dressed for breakfast and your hair is still damp which means you dressed in a hurry why the rush he kissed me gently but i didnt close my eyes or relax into the kiss he sighed you are too observant for comfort at times ma petite we were going to allow you to finish your breakfast before we discussed business what business i asked micah came up beside us i went from jeanclaudes arms to his and found that micah too was too dressed up he was in charcoalgray dress pants and a pale green silk shirt tucked into the pants he was even wearing shiny dress shoes that were a few shades darker than the pants someone had frenchbraided his stilldamp hair which gave the illusion that his hair was very short and close to his head it left his face bare so that all i could see was how very pretty he was the bones of his face were damn near feminine somehow with some of his curls to distract the eye you didnt notice it as much the green shirt made his chartreuse eyes green green like seawater with sunlight through it swimmingly green with gold light caught in it i had to close my eyes to say what business rafael has requested a breakfast meeting micah said that made me open my eyes clay told me rafael was wanting something other than money for the extra guards micah nodded rafael is our ally and our friend right why are you guys dressed up and all serious i looked around the room when i caught sight of claudia she looked away she looked uncomfortable as if whatever rafael wanted embarrassed her what the hell could it be nathaniel came to us his anklelength hair unbound and still heavy with water hed dried it but it just took a while for that much hair to dry completely this wet the hair looked closer to a simple deep brown than the nearly copper auburn that it was he was still carrying the couch cushion hed been balancing his plate on though the plate was on the table he carried the cushion in front of his waist and groin all i could see below the cushion was a pair of creamcolored leather boots that hit him midthigh what arent you wearing behind that cushion he threw the cushion behind him with a flourish and a grin he was wearing a gstring that matched the boots and that was it id seen the outfit before but never this early in the morning not that i dont appreciate the view because i do but isnt it a little early for fetish wear all my dress shirts here are silk my hairs so wet it would stain them he pressed himself into my arms and my hands curved under all that heavy hair and found it was still very wet so wet that the skin of his naked back was cool and slightly damp to the touch he was right silk would have been ruined my hands curved lower until i found the round tight bareness of his buttocks he flexed under my hands and i had to close my eyes and take a breath before i could say why are you wearing this for a meeting with rafael micah answered we thought it might remind rafael what exactly being close to us means rumor has it hes vanilla i stepped back from nathaniel because i had trouble thinking when i was touching any of my men naked say that again richards voice so unhappy that i knew the news was bad rafael wants you too im lost i said rafael has put himself forward as a candidate to be your new pomme de sang jeanclaude said his voice as bland and emptily pleasant as he could make it i just gaped at him i couldnt even think of anything to say nathaniel touched my chin and closed my mouth gently he kissed my cheek and said its okay anita i swallowed and stared into that peaceful face he smiled gently at me i shook my head why would he ask this rafael doesnt do anything without a reason claudia cleared her throat sharply we all turned to her she looked as embarrassed as id ever seen her hes afraid that ashers ties to the werehyenas will make them have closer ties to jeanclaude and you than we do the rats hes my friend richard said i am not friends with the werehyenas leader but rafael isnt friends with jeanclaude or anita its just a business arrangement with them asher is their lover and his animal to call is the hyena now so that makes the hyenas more essential to your plans than us the rats are our allies and friends i said and nothing personal to the hyenas but i trust the rats a heck of a lot more oneonone as guards than most of the hyenas claudia nodded with a few exceptions the hyenas are amateur muscle and rafael doesnt recruit amateurs you guys are important to us claudia where the hell did rafael get the idea that wed dump him for narcissus i asked she shrugged those wonderfully muscled shoulders as much as the muscles would allow he wants a closer tie to jeanclaude thats all i know i looked at jeanclaude and richard i dont have to do this right no ma petite you do not but we must hear his case for it i agree with not doing it i think the other wereanimals would take it badly if you made someones king your new pomme de sang the other wereanimals are already jealous of anitas ties to the wereleopards and the wolves sampson said hed walked around us to help himself to food and to take one of the chairs by the fireplace id sort of forgotten he was there he had that ability to blend into the woodwork when he wanted to not magic just tact what do you mean i asked those are our animals to call were supposed to have a tighter bind to them true but you anita carry the strain for lion and at least one other lycanthrope strain there are those among the community who believe they know why the doctors cant identify that fourth strain in your body he took a bite of croissant and i was suddenly hungry with all that was happening my stomach rolled and let me know there were other hungers besides the ardeur whats their theory i asked i went to the table and started putting food on one of the white china plates we had takeout food every morning but by god we ate off real plates with real silverware though the silverware was actually goldplated so that there was no problem with everyone using the utensils real silver can burn the skin of a lycanthrope not burn as in blister but burn as in itch and hurt chimera attacked you in lion form which explains the lion lycanthropy but he was also a panwere youve discussed that you may be able to add new types of lycanthropy until you shapeshift for the first time havent you sampson asked yeah weve discussed it as a theory i said some in the shapeshifter community would like you to try to take on as many of their beasts as you can before you shift so that theyll have a tighter alliance with jeanclaude i looked at claudia is that true have people been suggesting that there has been talk is that really what rafael wants i asked i mean he knows that richard and i dont want to put him in my bed but is that just a ruse he offers sex i say no and then he does a counterproposal of what trying to give me ratbased lycanthropy im not sure what he plans to say she said i looked at sampson how do you know all this i was raised in what amounts to a royal court anita you live and die on your intelligence information ive noticed that sampson has an almost uncanny ability to elicit confidences jeanclaude said you rolling them with mermaid tricks i asked he shrugged and took another bite of croissant using mind tricks on people without their permission is punishable by law i said the law actually states that its illegal to use vampire tricks telepathy or witchcraft to elicit information without permission im not using any of the three i could make a court case that mermaid power is a form of telepathy but im not reading their minds theyre volunteering information to me thats not telepathy at all besides this isnt a court case this is about how to swim through the rocks in your path and you have a suggestion i said and let it sound as suspicious as i wanted it to he laughed and wiped his hands on the white napkin in his lap you can avoid the sex question by saying that im the next candidate which is true i can simply not give up my place as next in your bed their king knows i am the eldest son of another master of the city and i have prior claim to your affections and it will get you in her bed sooner richard said he sounded suspicious too sampson gave him a patient look with just an edge of impatience i have been here for months and not pushed my claim partly because until anita tries to bring me into my siren abilities my mother will leave my brothers alone im not at all convinced that the ardeur is similiar enough to my mothers powers that anita can awaken me to that other power if i sleep with anita and it doesnt work then my family is back to the same problem your mother promised that if i couldnt bring you into your sirenhood shed accept that she was the last siren and shed leave you and your brothers alone he laughed and shook his head shes not human anita or a vampire her word doesnt mean what you think it means she wants us to be sirens and i dont believe shell accept your failure gracefully but as long as im here trying then shell wait and shell leave your little brothers alone i said he nodded but my mother wont wait forever anita one of the reasons she traded perdita to you as a blood donor was so perdy could keep an eye on me shes a spy i made it a question i know shes enjoying dating your jason but yes shes a spy my father will accept and encourage that ive been a gentleman about everything but my mother will lose patience with it we can send perdita back when you go richard said shes spying on me not on you your mom doesnt trust you not to fudge on this i said no she doesnt she knows how much i want to avoid her doing anything that will force my father to kill her he adores her but if she forces sex on me or my brothers he will do what he vowed he will slay the woman he loves above all others it would destroy him and our family you have been most patient jeanclaude said i wanted to argue but couldnt i nodded you have been so just like that he gets to fuck you richard said i sighed youve done so well today richard dont spoil it and how would you feel if i picked one of the women here in the underground to have sex with while you fuck sampson i looked at him i thought of several things to say none of them helpful you wouldnt like it would you he said no i said not sure what else to say then dont expect me to enjoy sharing you i dont expect you to like it richard i dont think jeanclaude likes it either or micah i looked at nathaniel i both frowned and smiled i like sharing he said with a smile good for you richard said i dont youre having sex with the human women youre dating i said some of them yes i am youre doing that by choice im doing this because i have to youll still enjoy it he said would it make you happier if the sex were bad yes he stood up and let me finally see that he was wearing nice jeans and a red tshirt hed probably refused fetish wear and i didnt think he had any dress clothes here yes it would make me feel better if i didnt know youd enjoy it i dont know what to say to that richard i really dont im not having sex with anyone but anita and i dont have a problem with this micah said no of course you dont because youre perfect richard said micah looked at me as if asking how much fight to have dont fight i said lets eat then well talk about what to say to rafael and just because she says dont fight you wont fight will you richard asked usually no micah said sometimes micah i hate you richard said right back at you micah said with a smile richards power slapped along my skin like tiny bites of heat but micah was closer and when his power flared too it was like standing too close to an open oven stop it both of you mon chat mon ami we do not have time for this i am not your friend richard said i am your wolf to call but that does not make us friends jeanclaude took a deep breath let it out and went very still still in that way that the old ones could go so that you felt if you looked away theyd vanish even though they were standing right there his voice when it came was neutral pleasant in an empty impersonal way as you like richard mon chat and mon lupe we do not have time for this richard turned toward him his power filling up the room like hot bathwater that had gotten out of hand you thought you were having a nice relaxing bath and suddenly you were drowning my pulse sped up and the wolf inside me stirred i closed my eyes and started breathing deep and even breathing from the soles of my feet to the top of my chest deep cleansing breaths to still that movement deep inside me to isolate me from what richard was doing it was his power not mine i did not have to respond to it part of me believed that but part of me knew better his power and mine had married too tightly dont call me that richard said if you are only my wolf to call and you are not my friend then what else can i call you jeanclaudes voice was very flat when he said it i realized suddenly that he was angry too angry at rafael angry at the harlequin angry at everything not that not just wolf you take insult where none is intended but if you will find insult where none is meant then perhaps i should try harder to insult on purpose the sound of the heavy outer door banged loud in the charged silence it made me jump rafael is here claudia said her voice managed to sound relieved and worried all at the same time as if she was happy to cut the fight short but worried what her king would do richard was glaring at jeanclaude and the vampire was finally letting his anger show on his face when rafael walked through the far drapes rafael was tall dark and handsome there was absolutely nothing wrong with the sixfoot darkly hispanic man in his nicely cut business suit hed left the tie off so that the white dress shirt framed the hollow of his neck like an invitation that last thought didnt sound like my own i glanced at jeanclaude wondering if it was his hed fed on someones blood today i could tell that much but i knew that sometimes he lusted after powerful blood the way that other men lusted after pretty women what i hadnt known until that moment was that he lusted after rafael as food another surprise was behind him louie fane dr louis fane teacher of biology at washington university and livein boyfriend of one of my best friends ronnie veronica sims would probably have told me boyfriend sounded too junior high school shed have probably preferred the term lover but it was my interior dialogue so i could use the words i wanted besides ronnies continuing campaign to make her and louies relationship about sex and not emotion was her problem not mine though sometimes she made it mine louie was five foot six slender but not weak looking today his arms were covered but when they were bare fine muscles played in his forearms his hair was straight and dark and cut short freshly so because id seen him only last week and it had been past his ears now it wasnt his face was softly squared almost the only hint that his mother had been from ecuador that and the black eyes darker even than my own i was surprised to see louie dont know why he was rafaels secondincommand how did a mildmannered college prof get to be second banana in an animal group made up mostly of mercs and excriminals by being smart and not nearly as soft as he looked rafael king of the rodere of st louis welcome jeanclaude said the formality of the greeting set the tone jeanclaude master of the city of st louis i am honored that you have invited me into your home his gaze went to richard ulfric of the thronnos rokke clan friend and ally thank you for seeing me so early in the day i was close enough to hear the sharp intake of breath and i thought richard would say something that went with that almost violent breath but he let the air out slowly it shuddered a little on its way out and he spoke almost normally rafael king of rats friend and ally theres plenty of food help yourself thank you rafael said and some tension i hadnt realized was there went out of his broad shoulders as if hed worried about richards reaction too louie went to richard and they did that guy handshakehug where you grip forearms and sort of bump shoulders i heard him say sorry about this if richard said anything i didnt hear it because micah was talking to rafael are the leopards so unimportant that you do not even greet their king or queen of all the people in the room i hadnt expected problems from micah from the look on rafaels face him either i meant no disrespect nimirraj yes you did micah said micahi said he shook his head at me no anita we cant let an insult like this go we cant richard said you finally find something worth fighting for micah he gave richard a cold look what would you do if rafael had ignored you and greeted every other leader in the room anger flashed over richards face then smoothed out i wouldnt like it jeanclaude you need to teach your cats better manners rafael said that got my attention and not in a good way i moved to stand by micah nathaniel moved up with us though a little behind us we were king and queen you didnt stand in front of the royalty even if you were living with them we arent pets i said you are jeanclaudes human servant and the leopards have no connection to the master of the city except through you anita they are not linked directly to the vampires of this city i felt movement around us as the bodyguards shifted nervously rafael didnt even look at them i did i looked at claudia and she actually blushed whose side are you on if the flags go up i asked do you actually believe you could challenge me rafael said and he sounded amused i ignored him and kept my gaze on claudia micah had his attention on rafael and i knew hed let me know if i needed to look at the big man come on claudia fredo talk to me youre our bodyguards but hes your king if it goes bad can we depend on you or not they are my people rafael said they owe their loyalty to me i finally looked at him it was not a friendly look then they need to leave this room now we need hyena and wolves in here now they are no match for my people rafael said maybe not but at least i can trust who theyll jump for clay had hit his radio and was relaying my request rafael looked at jeanclaude are the leopards in charge here jeanclaude it is what i had heard but i had not believed it he had turned away from us as if we didnt matter i had a horrible urge to draw my gun but knew id never get it out in time not with claudia and fredo in the room and besides i wouldnt really shoot him over an insult and you never draw a gun unless youre willing to use it i wasnt willing to use it but i was really wanting a way to wipe that arrogance off rafaels face wolves and hyenas spilled into the room at a run we now had more of our people in the room than we did wererats the tightness in my stomach eased a little rafael richard said why are you doing this doing what he asked treating the leopards as the lesser power they are supposed to be richard let his face show the surprise he felt are you purposefully trying to bait anita i have come to negotiate with the master of the city and his triumvirate of power his animal to call and his human servant im also the leopards queen and they are my animal to call i said you cant insult one half of my power base while you try to negotiate with the other exactly rafael said what i asked you have made your point rafael jeanclaude said i looked from one to the other not to me he hasnt im confused too richard said i have worked for years to build the wererats into a force to be reckoned with bargained with a force not to be treated lightly though i may dislike narcissus he in his own way has also built the werehyenas up into a force to be reckoned with he motioned at us the only three leopards in the room the leopards were the playthings of the wolves when raina was their lupa gabriel the leader of the leopards was her pawn then anita killed both of them she became lupa to the wolves and tried to protect the leopards i was happy that the leopards had a true protector someone who did not just use them no group deserves the treatment that they suffered at gabriels hands he walked toward us slowly nothing menacing in that movement but i fought an urge to step back somehow i wasnt sure i wanted him that close to me to us rafael spoke as he moved calmly toward us then anita became more than just a human with extraordinary powers by all accounts she may truly be a shapeshifter one of these moons so what i asked so what if i finally turn furry for real leopard is not jeanclaudes animal to call it is yours yet you are not a vampire you are leopard queen but not a wereleopard the wolves lupa but not a werewolf now the lions are yours to call if joseph and his pride would only give you someone worthy to choose you would have another animal to bind to you the lions are weaker even than the leopards but if you find a mate among them they will move up they will be powerful and they do not deserve it i was beginning to see what his point was and i even understood why hed put himself forward as food you do everything according to the rules i said and then this metaphysical wild card comes out of nowhere and suddenly animal groups that are weak by your standards have more ties to jeanclaude the leopards are a small group but theyre intimate with the vampires so theyre powerful you think the same thing will happen with the lions yes rafael said you are serious about being anitas pomme de sang richard said because its the only way you can see getting closer to the power structure rafael nodded and looked at the other man i am sorry my friend but if i cannot guarantee my peoples safety through strength of arms and traditional methods then i am willing to whore myself for their safety i do not hold the leopards above you in esteem jeanclaude said if there was a choice between saving the rats and saving the leopards who would you choose there will not be a choice like that jeanclaude said perhaps not but there might be a choice between the hyenas and the rats narcissus is not my friend and now ashers animal to call is his people asher is not master here jeanclaude said no but you love him have loved him for centuries that is a powerful bond jeanclaude if asher whispered sweetly enough would you deny him and his animals or would you side with him over my people are you planning on challenging the hyenas to a war jeanclaude asked it almost jokingly but i knew that tone of voice it was the tone he used when he was worried he was right no but we are not animals any of us rafael said our master would not start a war with you rat king this from remus rafael shook his head you are one of the reasons that i fear a war remus when your oba your leader was only recruiting martial artists and weight lifters pretty muscle that had never known a real fight without referees i did not worry but you are the real thing remus he has hired several exmilitary expolice he did that because of what happened when chimera took over his men i said narcissus learned the difference between a bouncer and a soldier he learned it the hard way he lost a lot of his men to chimera and you killed chimera for him rafael said giving me all the attention of those dark eyes i killed him for all of us he wouldnt have left the rats alone either rafael came to stand in front of us i fought the urge to grab micahs hand rafael hadnt done anything threatening just being six feet tall and standing over us usually tall didnt intimidate me but there was something about him today something bad we were too powerful for chimera to attack and he did not hold rat lycanthropy in his body he tried to take over several groups that he didnt hold the lycanthropy for i said if i had any liking for men id offer myself to jeanclaude and be done with it i didnt even try to keep the shock off my face i did grab micahs hand as if the world had gotten shaky and i needed something to cling to rafael did not say things like this but men do not interest me so i do the next best thing i offer myself to you anita because you protect those in your bed and something about you brings power to your lovers i do not understand it but nathaniel is the perfect example of one of the least wereanimals becoming something so much more just because of you anita nathaniel moved to touch my shoulder i jumped then eased into the touch and a little away from this strange version of rafael he was afraid i could feel it what has narcissus done to make you think your rats are in danger jeanclaude said rafael glanced at him what have you heard nothing i give you my word of honor that i have heard nothing but you are cautious and thoughtful this is not like you rafael only something serious and dangerous could make you come to us like this jeanclaude sat down on the couch and said sit with us eat and tell us what narcissus has said or done to make you willing to say such things to ma petite rafael closed his eyes his hands in fists your word of honor that you dont know then it cant be true what cannot be true mon ami talk to us we are allies and friends posturing and threats do not become us micah pulled me away from rafael and closer to the food we werent backing away from the rat king we were just going to eat sure but it saved face and i was hungry no matter what emergency was happening i still hadnt even had coffee one of the side effects of the ardeur and the almostlycanthropy was that i couldnt not eat not without consequences like sex id regret later or having my body almost tear itself apart because it couldnt decide what animal it most wanted to be we actually got everyone settled with food and rafael stopped being all strange and scary he sat on the love seat with louie with his guards at his back we took the couch it was big enough that everyone but nathaniel had a seat he curled up at my feet and made the scanty leather outfit work for him the only one in the room who knew how to be more seductive at the drop of a hat was jeanclaude and he was all business though to him sometimes seduction was business but not this morning i nibbled on a croissant and a variety of cheese and fruit and for the dozenth time wondered how to put a real kitchen into the circus underground breakfast takeout was too damn limited but the coffee was good i sipped it black because the first cup should always be black its the morning slap in the face that lets you know youre awake now said jeanclaude rafael my friend talk to us what has narcissus said or done to alarm you so he said that he would offer himself to anita as a pomme de sang and with that and his tie to your love asher he would be the second most powerful animal group in st louis after the wolves he said this to you jeanclaude asked not to me personally no then how did you hear of it one of my rats likes the way that narcissus makes love narcissus is beside himself now that ashers animal to call is hyena he had offered himself to asher as ashers animal to call and been turned down news to me i thought asher was flattered jeanclaude said but we both felt it would make the other groups nervous if narcissus was so honored i fought not to look at jeanclaude because shouldnt someone have mentioned it to me i sipped coffee and tried to keep my face blank not always my best thing i drank the coffee too fast to enjoy it but it kept me from giving anything away or i hoped it did but asher goes to narcissuss club and he enjoys the entertainment rafael said narcissuss club was a bondage and submission club and entertainment could cover a lot of ground i hadnt known that asher was going over there i know that it feels good to be around your animal i liked being around the leopards and the wolves and even the lions but it was like a lot was happening and id been out of the loop i didnt like that asher enjoys what the club has to offer but he has turned down narcissuss more personal offers again because he thought other animal groups might take it badly if he were to show such favor to narcissus jeanclaude said narcissus seems to think that its only a matter of time before asher gives in to his charms he does not know asher as well as he believes jeanclaude said asher enjoys the bondage rafael said jeanclaude shrugged that wonderful gallic movement that meant everything and nothing which meant rafael might be right again news to me what else was my vampire master keeping from me if narcissus can seduce your asher he will do so he will try to seduce you rafael said narcissus has tried to seduce me in the past he failed jeanclaude said he says the old master of the city nikolaos gave you to him several times he has bragged of your body and what he did to it rafael studied jeanclaudes face as he said it as hed studied mine it looked like he was even making eye contact not always wise with a vampire jeanclaude gave him a lovely blank face he has not bragged to you you are certain of that rafael said very he had a tendency to talk during during he might have talked of me while he was doing similar things to someone else in fact i would be surprised if he had not he enjoyed comparing and contrasting his lovers and his victims so you were his lover no i was his victim nikolaos gave me to him with no safe word no way to stop him from doing what he wished with me except my own poor art of persuasion rafael laughed an abrupt and unhappy sound poor art false modesty from what i hear narcissus would give a great deal to have you back as his victim so he has said he seems confident that asher is the key to your bed and if not asher then anita he believes sincerely that he will find a way to your libido again through them finally something i could address without revealing that i wasnt entirely sure what was happening with asher and the hyenas you dont have to worry about me and narcissus hes really not my cup of tea rafael nodded his face still serious we couldnt seem to get a smile out of him this morning am i your cup of tea anita i felt richard stiffen beside me i glanced around him to jeanclaude can i talk plainly without upsetting the political apple cart here talk and we shall see not a rousing endorsement but id take what i could get youre handsome and if it was a date we could talk but you want to skip to sex and im just not that casual about it he gave me a look it was a very judgmental look i gave him an unhappy look back yeah i have a lot of lovers but they arent casual lovers rafael he let out a breath sipped some coffee then said perhaps not but there is something about being your lover that seems to up the power level of every man that you give yourself to not true i said name a single lover you have had who has not gained power from it i can name three london requiem and byron i said the first two were master vampires before you slept with them its hard to judge how much power they arrived in st louis with and how much they may have gained byron you slept with only once once doesnt seem to be enough he sat his coffee down on his plate fine your regular lovers gain power i think you overestimate me rafael handed his plate to louie who stood and put it on the coffee table as if hed been told to do it rafael looked at me he looked at me as if he would see through me to the other side it was a look to study weigh and measure a person i tried not to squirm under that gaze but it was hard work what i asked he looked at jeanclaude she doesnt know does she i am not certain that i know what you mean jeanclaude said jeanclaude every lover anita has gains power asher was a master vampire in name only almost but since hes been in her bed hes gained enough power to have his own territory if he didnt love you both too much to leave nathaniel was everyones victim now he is becoming someone to be reckoned with you personally have gained more power than you ever dreamed and you believe that it is ma petite who has given me power not that i have shared my power with her she has her own triumvirate of power jeanclaude her own vampire servant in damian i am not the power behind the throne rafael trust me jeanclaude is plenty powerful enough for both of us he is but he gained most of that power after you became his lover i gained powers after he made me his servant i said not the other way around ive been talking to some of the wererats in europe rafael said they speak of your belle morte the creator of your bloodline they say that she could give power to her lovers if she chose belle morte does not choose to share power with anyone jeanclaude said no but she can through sex she can make her lovers more powerful legend has it that once she made kings and emperors through her touch she changed the face of europe through her bed she ruled from her bedroom that is true but not in the way you think she chose only the powerful only those who could give her something she wanted and i did not gain power in her bed i was her pawn for centuries as was asher masters of the city often kill their own vampire children if they become too powerful true rafael said some do but isnt it strange that so many of the vampires who were nearly powerless around belle morte have gained power the longer they are away from her what are you saying rafael i have heard rumors that some masters can retard the powers of their followers some can but i do not believe belle is one of them why not he gave that shrug again frankly the rats were a little too well informed for comfort id seen a master vampire gain new powers once in america and far enough away from his old master but i wasnt sure it was on purpose id actually begun to wonder if some powerful masters gave off a sort of hormone that retarded the power of those around them no way to test it but id seen some of what rafael was saying there are rats in every city sampson said and like last time it was as if wed all forgotten him rafael nodded there are i had this image of hundreds of rats scampering in the walls hearing things and what they heard the rat king heard did it work that way for real i wanted to ask but in this mood i wasnt sure how hed take the question i am the son of two powers but you did not concern yourself that you had insulted me sampson said i dont know what you are to jeanclaude and anita so you would ignore me and see if it got a reaction rafael nodded i am the next lover in line for anita why have you waited so long it is the ladys privilege to keep a man waiting they were supposed to be talking about me but it was like i was missing the conversation or not truly understanding it all would you allow me to jump ahead of you in line sampson shook his head no he looked at jeanclaude is this your final word that the sea kings son is more important than i am than my rats are to you that is not what is being said here rafael jeanclaude said i believe that any animal that comes to your bed or anitas bed is more important to you jeanclaude deny it if you like but the proof is in the pudding eh the proof is in the eating of it jeanclaude said for all puddings look sweet do i or any of my people look sweet to you he asked i felt claudias reaction from across the room a flare of power like a metaphysical slap to remind us how really powerful she was that one splash of heated energy said loud and clear that it didnt matter how tasty anyone thought she was she wasnt playing rafael let out a careful breath and rotated his neck as if that slap of energy had been more energetic the closer youd been to it i would not force any of my rats into someones bed but if some would choose it would you take them as blood or flesh donors define flesh i said sex he said richard shifted beside me on the couch the rats dont give blood to anyone it was one of your first rules as king nikolaos tortured you because you forbade your rats to feed her vampires she was unstable and farther away from her was safer for my people closer to jeanclaude seems safer youd really let your rats be blood whores richard sounded almost shocked i would you think that if some of your rats come into our bedrooms your people will be that much safer micah asked if our positions were reversed what would you do not this richard said i am asking the nimirraj rafael said richard shifted uncomfortably on one side of me while micah seemed to settle back more comfortably ive already done what youre suggesting rafael nodded you offered yourself to anita and jeanclaude and now your pard though one of the smallest groups in the area is one of the most secure groups in all of st louis how many of your leopards donate blood to the vampires most of them rafael spread his hands as if to say see i wanted to argue with them but i tried to be honest was his reasoning sound through us micah was in charge of the furry coalition hotline which meant he was beginning to be the goto guy for most of the lycanthropy community he was the liaison between us and the larger community his television time was even going up he gave good sound bite the leopards had fewer members than almost any other group yet no one messed with them because i or jeanclaude or our people kept killing anyone who fucked with them i looked at the rat king damn i said softly yes he said i glanced down the couch at richard and jeanclaude hes not wrong is he i cannot argue with some of his reasoning jeanclaude said no richard said hes not right i didnt say he was right richard just that hes not wrong i said that makes no sense if rafael isnt wrong then he has to be right richard turned his body so he was facing me and blocked my view of jeanclaudethose broad shoulders of his getting in the way hes right that our lovers are safer hes wrong if he thinks wed leave the rats out to dry if someone threatened them you are tied to us only by money and contracts rafael said i would feel better if you were tied with more intimate things you have our word that we will honor our treaty with you jeanclaude said but you have a treaty with the hyenas as well and i do not believe that asher will keep refusing the bounty that narcissus is shoving at him do not make the mistake of thinking asher is weak he is not jeanclaude said you are in love with him you do not see him clearly i could say to you that you are not in love with him and you do not see him clearly because of it order him not to be intimate with the hyenas and i will be content with it i would rather not give such an order jeanclaude said you have no right to ask that of jeanclaude or asher micah said what would you do if you were me nimirraj i would have offered myself less confrontationally if refused id have offered others of my people until some became food and hopefully one or more would catch someones eye for sex am i going about this wrong yes it is an area of politics i am unprepared for rafael said teach me micah help me micah sighed he scooted to the edge of the couch and looked past richard to jeanclaude what do you want me to do help him if you can micah leaned back and looked at me he just looked at me and the look was enough between us i shrugged and said help him i guess micah settled back against the couch and put an arm across my shoulders which made richard move a little farther away i dont think micah meant to make richard move i think he wanted to touch me and after last night thered been the possibility that richard wouldnt mind an accidental touch but apparently rafaels issues had raised some of richards own hell it had raised some of mine i just wasnt sure which ones yet blood donors would be welcome micah said and some of your rats have already offered to feed the ardeur for anita but she has touched none of them rafael said you havent sent her anyone she likes enough yet help me pick them guys i said guys i am still sitting right here okay dont talk about me like im not here then you pick he said i slumped and let my hair hide my face shit that isnt what i meant she likes pretty men richard said and thats not what you hire for i looked up at him sitting right beside me talking about what kind of man i liked i thought youd be having a fit about this i said he frowned but said i dont like it but rafael is right about us keeping our lovers closer and safer if you care for someone enough to have sex with them then youre supposed to take care of them i said exactly richard said its how you feel about it and whats wrong with the way i feel about it nothing he said but it means rafael is right you do take care of your lovers you just do dont you i asked he looked surprised for a second then gave a smile that left his eyes tired and more cynical than id ever seen him no sometimes its just about fucking i gave him wide eyes id love it to always be hearts and flowers but the one woman i love more than any other doesnt want me so what am i supposed to do while you sleep with six or seven other guys wait my turn watch we had company or i might have pointed out to him that he had watched before and he had waited his turn and hed even helped jeanclaude make love to me but we had company and i didnt want to fight with him so you dont take care of everyone that comes to your bed i take care of my wolves but if they arent pack sometimes the sex proves that it wont work so you break up with them after the sex sometimes i gave him a look you know who i keep comparing them to anita it wasnt my fault that i didnt want to marry richard i was allowed to want the men i wanted and love who i wanted so its my fault that youre sleeping around and that youve turned into one of those men who break up with a woman after one night of sex he gave me a long look out of those chocolatebrown eyes if the shoe fitshe said with an unpleasant smile i guess we were going to fight after all it isnt me you keep comparing everybody to richard its raina he actually blushed under the permanent tan of his skin it was maybe the second time id ever seen him blush dont anita micah had gone very still beside me as if he were wondering if he should take his arm out from between us you back off of me and ill back off of you i said richard it was louie we had this talk remember richard stood up and his power washed around the room like a wind from the mouth of hell it actually hurt where it touched i remember the talk he stared down at me and there was such hatred on his face i tried last night anita i really tried my throat was tight and my eyes burned i was already regretting what id said would have done anything to take it back i know you did richard my voice sounded small but its never enough is it i took a deep breath and stood up we faced each other i wanted to run away but i stood there and watched the hate and pain on his face the way his big hands kept flexing into fists his anger breathed through the room like some sort of invisible burning beast i dont know what to say richard what would be enough he asked what i asked what would be enough move in with you and micah and nathaniel move in here with you and jeanclaude what do i have to do to win with you anita it isnt about winning richard god dont you understand that no he said i dont he pointed at jeanclaude him i get i feel his pull too hes my master too he pointed at micah but him i dont get him hes in my place in your life dont you understand that i nodded and tried to breathe past the tight burning in my throat and eyes i would not cry damn it i understand that i said he pointed at nathaniel whod gone very still beside the couch how can you share her with that it was micah who figured out that he was the one richard was talking to nathaniel is not a that richard micahs voice held a thread of anger do you fuck him do you let him fuck you or do you just fuck anita at the same time the unshed tears were going away on a hot wave of anger i fed the anger embraced it called it sweet names because id rather fight than cry the way you and jeani started to say jeanclaude called the fight he called it with a push of power that staggered both of us i nearly fell and richard looked ashen we both turned and looked at the vampire his eyes were glittering blue pools like the night sky was on fire enough of this his voice whispered through the room like an echo of bats bouncing off the curtains i knew he was our master but id never felt him do anything like this to us never felt him simply throw his power into us and stop us in our tracks i hadnt known he had it in him we are in danger here do you not understand that most of our guards are wererats if rafael pulls them out we do not have enough guards to keep ourselves safe he uncurled from the couch and walked toward us his long black curls moving in the wind of his own power we watched him come toward us like small birds that wanted to fly from the snake but couldnt make ourselves move i am sorry mon lupe that you wish her to marry you and abandon the rest of us i am sorry ma petite that you still love him and that some part of you wishes you could do exactly what he wants i am sorry that i have bound you together into such pain but there is no time for this we need rafael and his people he knows that or he would not have come like this jeanclaude stood in front of us and his power pushed so that i swayed in the wind of it i knew hed gained in power but i hadnt understood until that moment just how much i will pick a blood donor among the rats i will urge others of my vampires to do the same you ma petite must choose one of his people for food you must embrace sampson or do something for him that will allow his honor to step aside and let you take one of the wererats ahead of him as food for your ardeur he stopped in front of us close enough that he could have touched us for the first time in years i prayed that he wouldnt touch me if he did id do anything he asked he touched richards arm and he shuddered under that light touch he closed his eyes and swayed i touched richards other arm and i thought no no dont do this my necromancy opened inside me in a rush that left me wideeyed openmouthed because it wasnt just my necromancy i felt it like an offering to jeanclaude if he could figure out how to use it it was his to command while he touched us richard breathed dont please dont i wasnt sure which of us he was talking to i stared at jeanclaude and felt my eyes go i saw the room through that vampiric flame but it wasnt someone elses powers taking over my eyes it was me if thered been a mirror i knew my eyes would have been filled with a blackbrown light of my own eyes as if i were the vampire richard collapsed to his knees between us with our hands still on his arms he whispered oh god i looked down at him and he gazed up at me with eyes turned to brown flame not my fire taking over him but his own true brown eyes turned to vampire fire chapter twentyone richard was staring at himself in the bathroom mirror his big hands clung to the marble sink edge as if he were trying to leave an imprint of his hands on the stone id tried to be comforting id tried to be reassuring nothing i said had helped jeanclaude had been with us but richard truly didnt want to talk to him he seemed to blame jeanclaude for this new sign that his humanity was slipping away the glow will fade richard i said not for the first time since he wouldnt let me touch him i was left to lean against the far side of the sink and wall arms crossed under my breasts id already checked on my bra that was hanging by the towels it was still too wet to wear he shook his head this is what my eyes would look like if i were the vampire i wasnt sure it was a question but i answered it anyway yes he looked at me and it was unsettling to see his tanned and very alive face set with eyes that id only seen in the faces of the undead it didnt match that life and those eyes his fear came off him in waves so that his power bit and flitted against my skin like hot ash from a windy fire youre not afraid of this why why arent you afraid of this he asked i shrugged and tried to put into words something i was trying not to think about im treating this the way i treat an emergency in the middle of a police investigation richard you dont get too hung up on the horrible details or you stop being able to function you keep moving forward because you have to this isnt your job anita this isnt my job the air was suddenly close and hot i was bathed in his power and it was hard to breathe past it the wolf that was always inside me now stirred youre going to raise my wolf richard he looked away from me and nodded mine too the wolf began to pad up that metaphorical corridor inside me i shivered and started to back away toward the door i needed out of this hot bath of power youre the ulfric richard control yourself he turned and looked at me through a curtain of his own thick hair his eyes were still glowing but now they were wolf amber like twin suns in his face a low threatening growl trickled from his lips richard and it was a whisper i could make you change he said in a voice that was more growl than word what i whispered i can force my wolves to shift i can smell your wolf anita i can smell her i swallowed a lump that hurt and bumped into the door it made me jump i hadnt realized i was that close to it i reached back for the knob and richard was suddenly there towering over me i hadnt seen him move had i closed my eyes for a second had he played with my mind or had he just been that quick his power pressed against me like a hot mattress like i was being suffocated by it i managed to breathe out his name richard please he leaned over me lowered that handsome face with those sundrenched eyes to my face please what please stop or please dont stop i shook my head i couldnt get enough air to speak my wolf hit the surface of my body and the impact of it drove me off my feet richard caught me hands on my arms kept me on my feet the wolf inside me started digging it wanted out i tried to scream and it was as if with every breath i was breathing in more of richards power he jerked me off my feet wrapped me against his body i could feel something moving low in my stomach i swear i could feel the wolfs claws digging through my flesh trying to meet richards body it was trying to get to him trying to answer the call of its ulfric the pain was incredible it was like being ripped apart from the navel outward like some horrible parody of giving birth i screamed not with air but with my mind i sent every metaphysical ability i had and screamed for help i heard voices shouting on the other side of the door but it was as if voices didnt mean anything to me anymore as if it were just noise but i could smell richards skin smell the musk of the wolf inside him he lowered his face to mine and i smelled my skin through his mind soap shampoo the haircare product but underneath that was me my skin my scent he drew a sharper breath cupping his hand against my skin so the scent blew back into his face he drew it in as if it were the sweetest of perfumes wolf i smelled of wolf and forest and pack the door shuddered against my back something heavy thudded against it richard picked me up arms around my thighs putting my upper body by his face he didnt ask in words he asked with his eyes with his power with that smell of wolf he asked me to come to him he called to that part of me that had stopped scratching and was listening smelling him he called to the wolf inside me in ways that my human brain couldnt even begin to understand i was still too human to answer him in the way he wanted still too human still too human but the wolf wasnt human and it answered him it threw itself against the wall of my body as if i were a door and all it had to do was get through it it threw itself against my flesh so that it staggered richard backward into the room as he tried to hold me while the wolf tore at me his power pressed down my throat like a hand that was trying to help the beast and stole my air my words it was as if hot burning liquid ran through my veins i burned with it but i knew what that heat was beast wolf i knew now why the lycanthropes ran hot close to the moon they were burning up with their beast it was a new pain a pain that my wolf and i shared as if she was burning up too i didnt know the door had burst inward the first hint i had that the guards were in the room was them standing around us i couldnt hear anything but the pounding of blood and heartbeats in my head they pulled at richard tried to tear me out of his arms and he wouldnt let me go finally a fist smashed into his face blood ran in a crimson wash and his beast poured over him and me the fire poured out from underneath my nails i raised my hands in front of my face wondering how fire was pouring out from underneath my nails but it was blood blood pouring like burning rain from underneath my nails richards body like thick water against me fur flowed muscles shifted and it was as if his beast was tied to mine so that as he shifted he was dragging my wolf with him dragging it in blood and fire out of my body i would have done anything agreed to anything if the pain would only stop i wasnt thinking that if i shifted i would lose my leopards i wasnt thinking that if i shifted richard would win i wasnt thinking anything but make it stop please god make it stop if someone had said the only way to make it stop was to be a wolf i wouldnt have argued id have grabbed it just make it stop i felt jeanclaudes power felt it like a cool soothing wind i still hurt the wolf was still there trying to fit all that tooth and claw into my smaller body but it was better i could hear again and what i heard was chaos screams shouts claudias voice above the rest ulfric dont do this jeanclaudes voice floated through my head and through richards because richard had tied us that close my marks keep her human richard all you can do is destroy her richard bellowed shes mine he was standing over me i didnt even remember being on the floor richard wasnt human anymore he was that movie wolfman except that his fur was the color of cinnamon and he was very male not that smooth sexless barbiedoll look from the movies from my angle everything about him looked monstrously large partly the angle and partly the pain the wolf inside me stretched my body trying to force claws out from under my nails trying to stretch more body out than i had to give it i had air now thanks to jeanclaude and i used it to scream i finally screamed the pain shrieked it and somehow it helped i was still human i could still speak i screamed nooo clay appeared above me face scared give me your wolf anita a clawed hand appeared and jerked him back out of sight richard had pulled him back no he growled no my pack does not stop this not your pack jeanclaudes voice now in the room somewhere my pack for all that is yours is mine by vampire law they are my wolves not yours i turned my face and saw him in the doorway he stood there beautiful cold his eyes glittering with that cool fire i reached out to him with my bloody hands i screamed help me richard was suddenly airborne too quick for the bodyguards too quick for anyone he hit jeanclaude and they both rolled out of sight into the bedroom beyond clay was back at my side he was bloody and i couldnt tell if he was wounded or had just gotten blood on him give me your beast he said he was disobeying a direct order from his ulfric but in that moment i didnt care i grabbed his arm and he pressed himself to my mouth let me kiss him more than ever before i felt the wolf pour out of my mouth i choked on fur and blood and things that couldnt be real i choked and clay stayed pinned to me while his body struggled to get away he forced himself to stay against me forced his body to take my beast but it hurt too much not to struggle i knew now just how much it hurt and i was sorry but i didnt stop his body exploded above mine wet thick things covered my eyes and only my hands told me that fur and muscle were above me now my body still ached but the wolf was gone gone like a hole in my heart an empty space where something should have been someone elses hand smoothed the gunk from my eyes so i could blink up into rafaels face he was crying id never seen him do that it scared me what would make rafael cry what was happening gunshots exploded in the other room so loud so horribly loud i sat up and fell back down help me i said to rafael he picked me up as if i were a child and carried me to the other room i didnt protest i would have been too slow but what i saw in the bedroom said that wed all been too slow the first thing i saw was jeanclaude sitting on the floor his white shirt in bloody tatters blood trickling from his mouth the guards were standing in a semicircle with guns out richards wolf form was crouched at the center of that circle i could see his heart thudding frantically in the open air it was a killing wound but he still crouched there growling at them i could see him about to spring and i knew that the guards wouldnt let that happen it was one of those moments when everything slows down when the world becomes crystaledged the colors brighter the edges of everything sharper you see everything in painful clarity seconds to see my world about to go up in flames jeanclaudes voice whispered through my head i am sorry ma petite there is no time i thought he was apologizing for the fact that they were going to shoot richard until i felt his power it didnt wash over me it didnt press against me like richards had his power simply was there and did what it wanted i felt it almost like a series of tumblers in a lock click and he took richards blood lust like a cup in his hand click and he turned that blood lust into another kind of lust click and he spilled it into me there was a blink where i saw richards head go down watched his body begin to change back to human knew they wouldnt have to shoot him now a blink to be relieved then the ardeur ripped through me as surely as the beast had done earlier my body forgot that it hurt my body forgot that it was bloody and aching my body forgot everything except one thing the ardeur did what it always did it washed over the man i was touching and carried him away with me i was already on the floor with him on top of me before i remembered who id be looking up at rafael the rat king who was going to get to be food after all chapter twentytwo rafael carried me out to the hallway with my legs wrapped around his waist my arms around his shoulders my mouth feeding at his he stumbled at the door and almost fell having to catch his hands on the doorjamb he put a hurried hand around me but he was in no danger of dropping me hed have had to pry me off him for me to fall i was drowning in the taste of his mouth the scent of his skin he smelled smoky not like cigarettes but wood smoke and salt like some food that had been smoked and salted until the meat was flavored and tender and so ready to eat i felt his need i just knew that it had been a long time for him so much need so much power so long denied he was a feast waiting to be eaten the last wasnt my thought we fell against the wall outside the door the sensation of him falling against me bruising me into the wall made me cry out he leaned heavier against me and even through our clothes i could feel him hard and ready i cried out again and pressed myself against him but there were too many clothes in the way i moaned into his mouth too eager for words rafael tore himself from my lips he used one hand to keep my face from touching his so he could look into my eyes your eyes he whispered like blue fire blue but my eyes were brown i thought then jeanclaudes power washed the hesitation away he filled my head as he filled my eyes it was my mouth but jeanclaudes words that said a fire that burns just for you rafael just for you in that moment it was true we wanted only rafael needed only him i felt him fall into our eyes there was a moment when he swayed forward his hand catching on the stone wall behind me he stared into our eyes and his face didnt smooth out and become empty waiting for orders like every other vampire victim id seenno his face filled with need want months years of denial all there in his face and a heartbeat later it was in his hands where they tore my shirt his mouth fed at my breasts biting sucking rough enough that he drew back and tried to fight clear of our power a small spark inside him was afraid hed hurt us we laughed and it was an odd mixture of jeanclaude and me so that for a moment my laugh slithered over rafaels body and made him shiver i bit his neck sudden and sharp digging my teeth into that smooth dark flesh he balled his hand in my hair and pried me off him his neck bled where id bitten him he drove his mouth into mine so hard that teeth grazed on teeth he kissed me with tongue and lips until he ate the taste of his own blood from my mouth he ripped my jeans apart at the seam my body jerked with the strength of it the sensation of the heavy cloth tearing around my body brought a small noise from me my panties ripped and again the feel of it made me cry out i ground myself against the front of him but all i could touch was cloth that hard eager flesh was still out of reach i cried my frustration and he fumbled at his belt onehanded he was making small frustrated noises by the time he got the belt open the pants unbuttoned but i was too tight against him for him to unzip climb me he said in a voice choked with need i managed to say what before his hands showed me what he wanted he lifted me up a little higher on his body i used my hands and arms on his broad shoulders to help climb a little higher i wrapped my legs higher on his body so he was left to unzip without seeing what he was doing his hands feeling around my naked ass as he tried to free himself of his pants he made a sound that was half shout and half word i think the word was please but i wasnt sure the tip of him brushed along my bare skin and i let my body slide those few inches lower so he could guide himself to my opening it was not a good angle for the first time we didnt know the exact angle to have without being able to see what we were doing he made a small inarticulate sound then i felt the head of him enter me i froze with him barely breaking the surface of my body froze so he could push his way inside he hesitated in the middle of that first thrust stopped with most of him still outside me his body shuddered his hands balancing against the wall and the other hand finally free to touch my body again his eyes closed as he traced his hand up my nearly bare back he whispered through gritted teeth so tight so wet i wont last long normally longer was better but in that moment i knew that we needed to feed jeanclaude let me know that we needed this energy we needed him to give us what he had to give fuck me i said and drove my body down the length of his and found there was even more of him than id thought when he was pressed as tight as i could make him it was my turn to close my eyes and shudder my turn to whisper fuck me rafael feed me fuck me rafael feed me with every word i drove my body up and down on his drove him in and out of me the angle was not the best for me to move without his help but with the last word he used his hands to cup my ass and drive my body into the stone wall with one hard thrust of his body he drove himself into me over and over grinding me into the stones and the roughness of the stones it was what i wanted too i wanted him to take me to drive all that need all that denial into my body the ardeur tried to feed but he was a king and it could not get past his shields a tiny thought of panic from jeanclaude quickly swallowed but he was urgent that we break rafael i might have protested but the ardeur was all i could feel and it wanted to break him rafael was so hard so very hard the kind of hard a man only gets when hes denied himself a very long time he drove all that hard long length into and out of me fast and faster hard and harder his breathing changed and i said yes yes please rafael please part of that please was please let us feed let us in drop all that protection let us in let us in i tried to find a rhythm but his body his hands pinned my lower body against the wall he would do the work he didnt want the help thrust after hard thrust and i felt my body filling up with the pleasure of his body pounding inside mine his hands so strong pinning me his body as hard and eager inside me as any man id ever felt and just like that the pleasure took me brought me brought me screaming clawing biting brought me writhing and dancing around him he cried out and his body gave one last deep thrust that made me scream again he shivered against me eyes fluttering and his shields crashed down the ardeur fed on his body on the warmth of him inside me on his need and his release in the midst of that pleasure that made me tear rafaels skin and cry out as his body spasmed inside mine i felt jeanclaude hed chosen rafael because he was king and through their king we could feed on his people jeanclaude reached through rafaels body our bodies to the wererats as wed fed once on augustine and his people now we fed on rafael and his i felt claudia stagger felt lisandro fall to his knees felt the wererats try to run or fight or keep us out but they couldnt theyd given their protection over to their king when he fell they were ours ours for the taking ours for the raping ours for the eating we fed and fed and fed some faces i knew some faces i didnt they became a blur of startled eyes and upturned faces we fed on them all rafael felt what was happening and tried to protect them to fight us but it was too late his body was married to mine and all that hardwon control was gone inside my body in the feel of his hands on me jeanclaude took that power and threw it into our vampires all those in the city who owed their life spark to his power as master of the city he forced them all awake some ten hours or more earlier than theyd ever woken from death i didnt understand why hed used the power for that until when the last vampire had come clawing to wakefulness he let the power go back to him and richard and he let me feel how terribly hurt they were hed used the power to force the lesser vampires awake because if he lost consciousness he was afraid he would drain them of power and they would all die for good he was afraid that he would drain them dry through his ties as master of the city in much the same way wed been able to feed on rafaels rats except the vampires would die i couldnt breathe my heart was touching stone and i couldnt breathe richards body oh god oh god he was dying jeanclaude tried to heal him and that forced me to feel what richards claws had done to the vampires body his heart stuttered hesitated sweet jesus no richard had stabbed him in the heart jeanclaude fed the power wed taken into their injuries and it should have been enough but it was as if there was something in richards injuries that ate the power but didnt heal him i saw something like a shadow on richards back jeanclaude whispered harlequin we were dying my chest squeezed tight and tighter i couldnt breathe i only halffelt when rafael lowered me to the floor and tried to get me to say something to him i used my last bit of air to whisper help us rafael said anything his shields were still down i took their energy again but not to feed to strike out jeanclaude cried out in my mind non ma petite but it was too late with my last thought before darkness swallowed us all i took the power of rafael and the wererats and i struck out at that phantom on richards back if i could have thought clearly i might have thought die but the darkness was eating us and all i had time to do was strike i saw herno themtwo cloaked figures in a dark room a dark hotel room two white masks lay beside them on the bed one sat the other knelt behind her they were both petite and darkhaired they looked up startled as if they could see me and what came with me i got a good look at the pale upturned faces the long brown hair one a shade darker than the other one with brown eyes one gray both glowing with power theyd combined their powers somehow theyd combined to hit us i dont know what they saw but they both cried out the kneeling one tried to shield the other with her body and then the power hit them it sent them crashing to the floor and into the nightstand the lamp fell over on top of them and shattered it knocked over the phone and a notepad i read the name of the hotel on the notepad i knew where they were they fell into a heap and didnt move again my last waking thought was good chapter twentythree pain pain and lights stabbing into my eyes voices ive got a pulse anita anita can you hear me i wanted to say yes but i couldnt remember where my mouth was or how to use it darkness again then pain shot through the dark again i came to my body convulsing on a gurney there were people all around me i should have known one of them but i couldnt remember who she was only that i should have remembered who she was my chest hurt i smelled burning something was burning i saw those little flat paddles id had used once before on my chest i realized i was what was burning the thought didnt mean much to me i wasnt afraid or even excited nothing seemed real even the pain in my chest was fading the world started going gray and soft around the edges someone slapped me hard across the face the world was real again i blinked up into the face of the woman i should have known and didnt she yelled my name anita anita stay with us damn it everything went soft again the gray ate the world like mist someone hit me again i blinked up into the womans face again dont you die on me damn it she hit me again and the world hadnt even gone gray i knew her now doc lillian i tried to say stop hitting me but i couldnt seem to figure out how to say the words i did my best to frown up at her though a mans voice said shes stable lillian smiled down at me youre breathing for three anita if you keep breathing they wont die i didnt know what she meant i wanted to ask who wont die then something cold and liquid seemed to flow through my veins id had something like it before and my last thought before a different kind of darkness took me was why was lillian giving me morphine i dreamed or maybe i didnt but if it was heaven it was too scary and if it was hell it wasnt quite scary enough i was at a ball everyone in glittering clothes centuries before i was born then the first couple turned to me and they were masked everyone was wearing the harlequins white masks i stumbled back from the dancers and found that i was wearing a silverandwhite dress that was too wide to be graceful and too tight through the ribs to let me breathe well one of the couples bumped me and my heart was suddenly in my throat my chest was tight and tighter as if some huge fist were crushing my ribs i fell to my knees and the dancers moved wide around me in a spill of skirts and petticoats their dresses brushed me as they whirled faceless around me a voice came to the dream belle mortes purring contralto ma petite you are dying the hem of a crimson dress was at my hands she knelt beside me she was still the brunette beauty who had nearly conquered all of europe once all that dark hair piled atop her head leaving her neck in that pale white curve that wed always loved we i tried to feel the rest of that we but where jeanclaude should have been was awful blankness she leaned over me as i fell to the floor he is almost gone our jeanclaude she said her amberbrown eyes didnt seem worried she was simply making an observation why do you not ask for my help ma petite i wanted to say why would you help us but there was no air to say anything my spine tried to bow in the tightness of the corset as i gasped like a fish left to die on the shore oh she said and with a flick of her will the dream changed we were in her bedroom on her huge fourposter bed she knelt above me with a huge knife in her hand the world was going gray i wasnt even afraid my body jerked the corset gave and i could suddenly breathe a little better my chest still hurt and i breathed too shallowly but i could breathe i looked down to find that she had cut the bodice of the dress all the way through the corset so that there was a line of bare skin from my neck to my waist she laid the knife beside her knees and spread the stays of the corset a little wider as if she meant to skin me out of the dress but she went back to kneeling beside me in her red red dress her skin seemed to glow against the crimson cloth what happens in my dreams can be very real ma petite corsets here made your breathing there harder you dont have enough breath to spare whats happening she lay down beside me her head on the pillow i was lying upon a little too close for comfort but i didnt have the energy to spare for moving i felt jeanclaudes light snuffed out hes not dead i whispered can you sense him it must have shown on my face because she said shhh you are correct he is not gone completely but he is close to the edge you are keeping him both of them alive you and your second triumvirate of power something jeanclaude did in this new emergency has taught you better control of the power between you and your other triumvirate your kitty and your vampire i swallowed and it hurt though i couldnt remember why it should nathaniel damian i was feeling a little better well enough to be afraid id almost drained both of them to death once or twice do not fear for them they are well enough but they are feeding for you giving you their energy as they are supposed to do in emergencies she said and stroked my forehead tracing down the edge of my jaw it was an idle movement like the way youd stroke the curve of a couch you were sitting on the masks of the harlequin were in your mind ma petite have they come to your territory i wanted to tell her to stop calling me ma petite but air was precious so i answered yes show me she said not tell me but show me i said how you are of belle mortes line how do we trade power i frowned up at her kiss me and but think of it and i will know what you know i dont know if i would have kissed her voluntarily because i didnt get a chance to decide she pressed those ruby lips to my mouth and i was suffocating again i couldnt breathe i pushed at her and she thought inside my head think of the harlequin it was as if it were an order and my mind did what she asked i thought of the meeting with malcolm and his fear i went back through the date with nathaniel and the mask in the bathroom the second mask with the musical notes on it and the meeting planned the mark on me and the scent of wolf and jake keeping me safe then the last memory where i saw my men dying and the ghost on richard and the feeding with rafael she slowed the memory there lingering on the rat kings powers then let the memories go back to speeding along and using rafaels power to attack the one that had attacked us it was the last memory that she slowed down completely she stared at the pale faces of the vampires the long dark hair the glowing eyes brown and gray respectively belle morte studied the faces of the other vampires she whispered mercia and nivia the memory ended and belle morte was simply lying beside me propped on the pillows i whispered you know them yes but not that they were harlequin it is a deep dark secret who is and who is not one of them they are spies and secrecy is their life blood by their hands the harlequin have broken their most profound taboo what taboo i asked they are neutral ma petite utterly neutral or how can they dispense justice did they give you a black mask i did not see it in your memories no only the two white she laughed and her face shone with joy my heart hurt but not from a physical blow it hurt the way it sometimes does when you see someone you once adored do something to remind you why you loved them and you know that that laugh will never again be for you they have broken the law then the law they swore to uphold unless they deliver the black mask they are not allowed to bring death for mercia and nivia it means true death but for their fellow harlequin it means something worse what i asked disbandment they will be no more and those who are not killed will be forced to go back to their bloodlines their old masters to be neutral the harlequin are freed of their ties to their creators they are a law unto themselves but if they are breaking the law then they will be broken why does thati had to draw a breath to finishmake you so happy she pouted out that full lower lip and said poor thing so hurt i will help you appreciate the offer butand i had to work for breathhelp us why because you alive are witness enough to destroy the power of the harlequin why breath do you care they were once the private guards of the mistress of the dark she is waking i know that now but when she wakes breath she wont have them precisement belle said but you need me us alive yes she said and she looked at me the way that a hawk must look at a wounded mouse eager anticipatory make you mad i whispered and had to cough it wasnt my throat that was closing off i didnt think it was jeanclaudes something bad was happening to richard i dont hate you ma petite she said i dont hate anything that is useful to me and you are about to be very useful ma petite anita i whispered anita anita she purred as she leaned our faces closer if i want you to be my ma petite you will be jeanclaude is near death and he protected you from me i will save you all but i will do it in a way that you will not like she leaned our faces close and the hand that had been caressing my face was suddenly firm and solid as metal against my cheek keeping me turned toward that lovely face she began to lean in for a kiss i spoke before our mouths touched a winwin situation for you oh yes she whispered it against my lips then kissed me but she didnt just kiss me she opened the ardeur between us one moment all i could think about was breathing just keep breathing and that i really didnt want her to touch me and the next she was kissing me and i was kissing her back my hands slid over that satin dress and the body underneath and my hands knew that bodythough my hands were smaller than they should have been jeanclaudes memories kept getting in the way coloring what was happening when her mouth found my breast and sucked it startled me because the body i was remembering didnt have breasts she bit me driving dainty fangs around my nipple it made me cry out brought my body writhing off the bed she raised a bloody mouth and smiled at me her eyes filled with amber light she climbed my body and pressed that bloody mouth to mine i kissed that mouth as if it were air and food and water all rolled into one i marveled at how small her mouth was how dainty how id longed to kiss this mouth again i knew in this moment what i had never known from jeanclaude how much it had cost him to leave her they say that once you love belle morte you never stop and i knew in that kiss with her body on top of mine that it was true he still loved her would always love her and nothing would change that not even me the ardeur started to feed then at that bloody kiss but this was belle morte the creator of the ardeur you did not feed from her and stop you fed until she stopped you the knife cut us out of the dresses and where it nicked the skin we licked and drank each others blood and it didnt seem wrong or a bad thing to do the taste of her blood was sweet and slow and i knew that vampire blood was not a meal but it could be foreplay i ended up on top of her and my body kept forgetting that it wasnt male i pressed her to the bed with my body between her legs but i could not do what i was remembering i swore in frustration because more than anything in the world in that moment i wanted to pierce her body i wanted to plunge parts that i did not have into parts of her that i did she lay underneath me with that dark hair spilling around her body across the silk of the pillows her lips parted her eyes filled with that eager light i knew what she was knew it better through jeanclaude than most i knew that she would slit my throat and make love in the blood while i died but in that moment with her looking up at us i didnt care i just wanted her to keep giving us that look she laid me back against the sheets and began to kiss her way down my body i watched her eyes roll up watching my face as she licked and bit and drew small pinpricks of blood where dainty fangs pierced too close it wasnt my memory that made me writhe at the sight of her over my groin at first it felt wrong because i was expecting a different sensation but belle had spent two thousand years learning about pleasure and she knew this pleasure too i gazed down at her with her mouth between my legs and her tongue found me traced me licked me and finally she sucked me lightly at first then deeper and deeper until fangs bit deep as she sucked me and i wasnt certain if it was the pleasure that brought the orgasm or the pain the ardeur fed and fed and fed i screamed and writhed and clawed at the pillows and only after i lay back boneless eyes fluttering blind with pleasure did she raise her face from my body she stared up at me with eyes that glowed so bright she looked blind with power she laughed and the sound trailed down my body and made me cry out again i do see what he sees in you ma petite i truly do i have fed you enough to keep you all alive but mercia and nivia and any of the harlequin that took part in this will have to kill you before you can testify against them they will not know that i know i tried to say tell people but my mouth couldnt work quite yet hell if thered been an emergency i couldnt have rolled off the bed and it wasnt the medical emergency part that kept me lying there it was a few thousand years of practiced sex that made me lie there and look at her or try to look at her the world was still whiteedged with orgasm i believe that they have allies for their illegal activities among the council so i must go slowly here but you need to be well there she smiled at me and it was the smile that eve must have used in the garden of eden want a bite of apple little girl i will send a call out to my bloodline in your territory jeanclaude is still too hurt to stop it i will talk to them as of old before they had jeanclaudes new power to hide behind when you wake you will need powerful food for the ardeur you must share that power with jeanclaude and your wolf i managed to whisper i dont know how to do that you will she said and she came to straddle my body leaning in until our lips met i could taste my body on her mouth we kissed and the dream broke and i woke with the taste of her kiss on my lips chapter twentyfour i woke gasping in a room that was too bright too white there was something in my arm that hurt when i tried to move it i couldnt think where i was couldnt think about anything but the smell and taste and feel of belle morte i woke crying her name or trying to my voice was a harsh croak of sound cherrys face appeared beside the bed her ultrashort blond hair and overly dark goth makeup couldnt quite hide the fact that she was pretty she was also a registered nurse though she had lost her job at the local hospital when they found out she was a wereleopard anita oh my god oh my god i tried to say her name and couldnt make words dont try to talk ill send for the doctor she got me water and one of those bendy straws and let me take a minute sip i heard a door open and close running feet getting farther away who had she sent for the doctor cherrys eyes were shiny and only after her eyeliner began to run in black tears down the pale makeup did i realize she was crying they say its waterproof but they so lie she let me have another sip of water i managed to croak why does my throat hurt ishe looked solemn again we had to intubate richard intubate i made it a question put a tube down his throat a machine is doing his breathing for him shit i whispered she wiped at the black tears again smearing them worse but youre awake youre all right she nodded over and over as if that would make it more true i was almost sure that away from me her leopard queen she was more controlled as a nurse but she sure did cry easily for a medical professional there were soft footfalls and doctor lillian was at my bedside her graying hair was in a careless knot at the back of her neck with strands of hair flying about her slender face her pale eyes smiled along with her lips relief was plain on her face for a moment did you slap me i asked i didnt think youd remember that you did slap me didnt you it was a close thing anita we almost lost you all cherry says richard is hooked up to machines that hes not breathing on his own thats right shouldnt he have healed by now its only the night of the same day anita you havent been out that long it feels longer she smiled im sure it does i think now that weve got his body breathing he will heal but if we hadnt been able to keep his heart and lungs going youre worried his heart stopped anita if he were human id be worried about brain damage from lack of oxygen but hes not human i said no but he is very hurt he should heal perfectly but in truth ive never seen a lycanthrope come back from an injury this severe his heart was pierced by a silver bullet it was a killing shot but hes not dead i said no hes not i looked up at her jesus you dont give good medical blank face either jeanclaude is in a sort of coma asher tells me that it is a type of hibernation while he heals himself but truthfully vampire medicine is confusing theyre dead so how unhealthy can they be we hooked him up to brainwave monitors and thats letting us know hes still in there but if you didnt have the monitors i asked id think he was dead she said were not dead she smiled no youre not nathaniel has been eating for five and hes still lost two pounds in less than a day damian has taken more blood than any vampire should be able to hold and still he feeds asher says they are helping fuel the three of you i nodded remembering what belle had said hes right i thought about letting my thoughts of nathaniel and damian find them for me let me see them but i was afraid id mess it up afraid that somehow id cut off the energy they were feeding us or take too much apparently it was working and i was simply grateful that it was working the way it was supposed to belle had said that id learned from jeanclaude how to do it but she was wrong i think jeanclaude had done it for us before he passed out because i had no idea how it was working i very carefully didnt make my shields between me and the boys any stronger or weaker i just tried to maintain it was working dont fuck with it the vampires are worried that if the lesser vamps go to sleep for the day jeanclaude is so injured that he wont have enough energy to wake them again i nodded and swallowed past a sore throat that wasnt my sore throat but it felt like it like i was trying to swallow past something huge and hard and plastic richard is awake enough to feel the tube in his throat because i can feel it i dont know if thats good news or bad anita it will be a while before his body catches up with the machines i think we need jeanclaude awake before dawn awake enough so he doesnt drain the little vamps to death i said she looked at me very seriously that is what the vampires have been discussing i felt vampires i felt them outside the door i heard voices arguing men arguing i said tell the guards to let asher and the others in she looked a question at me but went to the door but seeing who came through the door first made me smile and somehow i felt it would all work out we would be safe because edward was here chapter twentyfive he smiled down at me shaking his head standing there looking down at me he looked pleasant and like the end product of a few generations of wasp breeding blond hair blue eyes maybe a little short at five foot eight but he would have fit in in so many places then the polished charm began to melt away like magic i watched the real edward fill his eyes and turn them from warm to cold as a deep winter sky the color of his eyes was the same but the look in them wasnt the face was still and showed nothing if i hadnt had vampires to compare with id have said edward gave better empty face than anyone i knew once seeing edward at my bedside would have meant hed come to kill me now it meant i was safe we were all safe or as safe as we could be edward couldnt do much about metaphysical powers but i trusted him to take care of the harlequins weapons and fighting skills the magic was my department but no one did armed combat better than edward hey i said and my voice still sounded dry his lips twitched couldnt stay alive for just a few more hours huh his voice held an edge of the smile that had been there then settled to that empty middleofnowhere voice no accent no hint of where hed started life im alive i said they had to restart your heart twice anita lillian who had made herself scarce came to stand beside him id appreciate it if you didnt scare my patient she likes the truth he said without even looking at her hes right doc i said she sighed fine but lets ease her into it shes been mostly dead all day it took me a second to realize shed made a joke edward gave her a look then turned back to me according to the vamps we dont have time to ease you into it tell me whats been happening i said theres too much anita if i tell you everything it will be dawn and your little vampires will be dead for good tell me what i need to know then i said jeanclaude used a lot of energy to wake every vamp in the city before he passed out i was there when he did it dont interrupt and he was way too solemn for my comfort the vamps and shapeshifters came up with a plan that they think will net the most power for you to feed into jeanclaude and richard in the shortest amount of time why are you telling me this why not asher or you interrupted he said eyes cold and face still so serious sorry i said lillian made a noise that made us both look at her you said shed take the news better from you but i didnt believe you i believe you now he gave her a look sorry ill stand over here and stop wasting time she moved away from us he continued i dont like the plan and youre going to hate it but ive listened to their reasoning and its the best plan weve got i raised a hand he actually smiled but it never quite reached his eyes yes you think its a good plan i asked i couldnt come up with a better one i looked at him really he nodded really the fact that he couldnt come up with a better plan said a lot said enough that i didnt argue okay tell me the plan i said you feed the ardeur on the head of another animal group and take their energy the way you did the wererats he didnt flinch or hesitate even though hed only known about the ardeur for a few hours hed landed in the middle of a crisis of metaphysical proportions and it hadnt fazed him or if it had it didnt show in that moment i loved him in a guybuddy sort of way hed never fail me or fuck with me and i loved him for it which animal group i asked the swans he said i gave him surprised face say again he smiled that cold smile but it was a real smile he was amused i take it the swan king is not your buddy not in that way he and all the heads of the animal groups have been over to the house for dinner buti shook my head and swallowed past that feeling of something in my throat that wasnt there like a phantom pain ive never thought of him in that way and there are larger more powerful groups in st louis than the swans you knocked most of the wererats cold when you fed on their king edward said i did what you heard me i remembered jeanclaudes voice in my head saying no when i went back for that last bit of energy from rafael i didnt mean to i said lillian peered around edwards shoulder youre just lucky i was one of the few who didnt go down why didnt you she looked thoughtful and sad and then shook her head i dont know we dont have time to worry about the why edward said agreed lillian said i just nodded the wererats still arent a hundred percent anita you did a real number on them we cant afford for you to do the same to the werehyenas not a problem narcissus is sooo not on my todo list his lips twitched almost a smile and then he gave in and laughed ive met him now andhe just shook his head and said i wouldnt want to do him either but he did come through for us he let us have all the werehyenas that we asked for a thought occurred to me if most of our muscle were knocked out why didnt the harlequin attack us he nodded i dont know why they didnt attack theyre supposed to be this uberfighting team sort of you as a vampirethey should have attacked asher and the other vampires have speculated a lot why the harlequin didnt push the advantage ill tell you all of it later but right nowhe made a movement as if hed take my hand and then his hands fell back do you trust me he asked i frowned at him you know i do then ive got the defenses covered anita but only you can channel enough energy to jeanclaude to keep the little vampires alive i wanted to ask so many things but he was right i had to trust edward to do his job and i did but there arent that many swanmanes in the city i said we asked the werelions first but their rex refused joseph refused to help us i was shocked and let it show yes weve bent over backward for the lions hell i saved his life once or twice his wife said he wasnt having sex with anyone but her this isnt about sex edward he shrugged the lions would let the vampires die i said it out loud because i needed to hear it i couldnt quite believe it thats how id take it he said we looked at each other and i felt my eyes go as cold as his i think we were thinking the same thing the lions would suffer for this ungrateful bastards less than two hours anita he said i nodded which means we dont have time to be wrong edward are the swans enough energy donovan reece is the king of every swanmane in this country i know he has to travel from group to group looking in on them settling problems hes also begun talking to other cities about how well our furry coalition is doing here hes not trying to start another coalition just talking about it weve actually had some phone calls from other cities wanting details about how it works a politician edward said i nodded being swan king is an inborn power i think you actually do come with the skills you need donovan says that usually a swan queen is born in the same generation so they rule together but for whatever reason there was no baby born with the birthmark or the power to help him it means he has double the duty he says that he leaves his swan maidens in the care of your leopards when hes gone for a while i nodded theres only three of them in town theyve stayed over at your house edward said yeah why they need someone to look after them sometimes donovan said that that you took care of his people he says you rescued them once and almost got killed doing it yeah i said he says that if you risk your life for his people he would do the same for you so whats a little sex between allies he didnt say that last part i said edward grinned and shook his head okay but he did say i would risk my life for anita and her people this is a small thing you ask of me that sounds like donovan i said hes offering to let you feed on every swanmane in the united states theres maybe one to six in most major cities i had no idea there were that many of them i dont think anyone did but donovan he gave up a lot of intelligence anita he didnt make me promise not to use it against him if i got a contract from someone who wanted me to go swan hunting edward he held up a hand stopping me ill promise you if you ask we looked at each other a second and then i said promise me you wont use anything youve learned against any of the animal groups i wont hunt any more swans he said no edward i mean it youre going to have to learn things about vampires and the shapeshifters that you could use against them i need your word of honor that what you learn wont come back to haunt them or me his face went to that cold empty look it was almost the look he used when he killed except for a hint of anger in his eyes even the lions he asked theyre members of our coalition that mean theyre off limits no it means we have to kick them out of the coalition before we do anything to them he smiled then so honorable a girls got to have standards i said he nodded as long as the lions answer for it im cool one crisis at a time but yeah theyll answer for it he gave that cold pleased smile it was edwards usual smile the real one the smile that said the monster was home and happy to be there i didnt need a mirror to know that the smile i gave back was almost a match for it i used to worry about becoming like edward lately i counted on it chapter twentysix whatever we were going to do with the local lion pride had to wait one emergency at a time funny how when edward comes into my life or i come into his were almost always running from one emergency to the other the difference this time was that the emergency couldnt be handled at the point of a knife or gun barrel a flamethrower wouldnt even help though edward had probably brought one how would he get it through airport security its edward if he wanted to hed manage to get a sherman tank through security i had less than two hours to feed less than two hours to keep willie mccoy with his loud suits and louder ties alive the love of his life candy tall and blond and gorgeous and so in love with the small notsohandsome vampire i thought of avery seabrook who id stolen away from the church of eternal life avery with his gentle eyes so newly dead that even to me he still felt alive sometimes i thought of so many of the lesser vamps who had jumped ship from malcolms church to us in the last few months i couldnt let them die not if i could save them but i so didnt want to have sex with donovan reece there was nothing wrong with him he was tall pale and handsome in a preppy cleancut sort of way he was an inch shy of six feet broad shoulders tucked into a babyblue sweater that complemented a milkandcream complexion so perfect it looked artificial but it wasnt the faint pink blush on his cheeks was just his own blood flowing under that white white skin he was as pale as a caucasian vampire before theyd fed but there was nothing dead about donovan no there was something incredibly alive about him as if at a glance you could tell that his blood ran hotter not hot as in passion but hot as in hot to the touch as though if you spilled it into your mouth it would be hot like sweet metallic cocoa i had to close my eyes and hold up a hand before he got right beside the bed i spoke with my eyes still closed im sorry donovan but you hit the radar as food im supposed to be food i shook my head not food for the ardeur but foodfood im wondering what your blood would taste like going down i was afraid of this a female voice i opened my eyes to see sylvie richards secondincommand his freki she was a little taller than me short brown hair a face that could be pretty in makeup but she usually didnt sweat it so that your eyes had to adjust to the plainness of her eyes and skin before you could realize that she was pretty just as she was with the right makeup shed have been beautiful i wondered if people thought that about me sometimes since i was wearing a hospital gown and probably looked like shit who was i to comment sylvie filled the room with a prickling run of energy she was small and female and had managed to fight her way to secondincommand of a large pack of werewolves shed have probably been in charge if i hadnt interfered a few times richard could have beaten her physically but sylvie had the will to win the will to kill and there are fights when that will win the day over superior strength then a while back richard had called her challenge and he had hurt her badly hed proven that he had the will to back the strength on one hand i was glad it meant the question was answered on the other hand it had cost richard a piece of himself that hed never get back i mourned that piece of him almost as much as he did you were afraid of what edward asked from near the door i hadnt realized hed followed donovan back in anita is like a new lycanthrope it means her hungers are not under her control completely donovan may be powerful but hes a prey animal and her beasts smell that sylvie said i nodded from the bed my hand falling to the white sheet what she said donovan looked at me his bluegray eyes as changeable as the sky had gone to rainy gray would you really tear my throat out probably a gut wound actually soft underbelly he raised those soft pale eyebrows no oral sex sylvie said and anyone else would have said it with humor she was utterly serious the door opened behind them i got a glimpse of some tall darkhaired man who i didnt recognize he looked too young to be standing there but then there were a couple of other guards that i thought the same thing about then the doorway was full of people and i had to look at them but i promised myself that id talk to claudia about putting an age limit on the guards here id voted out cisco for being eighteen but apparently i hadnt made it clear that it was the age not cisco himself that was the problem if we all survived today id make that more clear no not if when when we survived to think anything else well it had to be when i looked for asher in the vampires who came first through the door but he wasnt there it was as if requiem read my mind or at least my face because he said oh my evening star you look eagerly past me as if i am not here asher wakes seventh among us when dawn comes he will die but those who stand before you now have a chance to remain awake long enough to see this through his face was a glimpse of white flesh between the black of his hooded cloak and the beard and mustache his hair was lost in the blackness of the hood the only true color to his face was the brilliant blue of his eyes with that hint of green in them like sea water in the sunlight he would never see again london with his short dark curls and blackonblack suit and shirt came next he always looked like a cross between an executive goth and a movie hit man his nickname for centuries had been the dark knight yeah long before batman there was london he was also almost perfect food for the ardeur feeding me actually gained him power instead of draining him but like all the secondary abilities in belle mortes bloodline it was a doubleedged blade he was the perfect food but he was also almost instantly addicted to the ardeur one feeding had undone centuries of abstinence when hed fled belles slavery one feeding and hed been more tightly bound to me than any civil ceremony could have made us but feeding even from london wouldnt be enough for what we needed now he smiled at me and came to take my hand he knew he wasnt the love of my life nor i his and we were both okay with that he would be the leading contender to be my pomme de sang if only he were available in daylight his hand was warm in mine which meant hed fed on some willing donor so many people were willing to open a vein these days there was no reason to force anyone people lined up for it he raised my hand and laid a gentle kiss on the knuckles we are here to see that you do not eat the swan king for real his smile widened and filled his dark eyes with happiness requiem and other vamps who had come from england with him said theyd never seen him this relaxed and hadnt even known he could smile i smiled back at him and nodded that would be bad jason peeked around the much taller man he grinned at me but there was a flinching around his springblue eyes a hollow look that said hed been crying i held out my other hand to him london moved out of the way so jason could hug me he practically climbed into the bed to do it we were friends and sometimes lovers but his reaction surprised me i patted the top of his short blond hair sort of awkwardly and it wasnt just the iv that made it awkward though that pulled that was sooo going to have to come out before i fed on donovan jason i said its all right he shook his head against my shoulder and raised a tearstained face his voice was thick with tears as he said liar he tried to smile but didnt quite make it i touched his face with my free hand jason ii didnt even know what to say this reaction was more than a friends reaction then i thought maybe the grief wasnt for me his ulfric and his master were both near death if they died his world would never be the same the next master of the city might not have a use for him as a pomme de sang i tried to cup his face but the iv caught again can someone get this out of me i cant feed the ardeur hooked up to tubes lillian threaded her way through the growing crowd and took out the needle i carefully looked away at the crucial moment i was better than i used to be but i still didnt like seeing needles go in or out of my flesh it just creeped me jason moved away enough for the doctor to work but he kept my hand like it was a lifeline jason was usually so together that sometimes i forgot that he was only twentytwo he was actually the same age as some of the werelion college students that joseph had let me choose from his excuse on the age had been that older lions had jobs and families at the time i hadnt questioned but now well id probably be questioning everything the lions did for a while im your wolf in case your beast decides to rise jason said i thought sylvie she spoke from in back of the crowd of shapeshifters with the ardeur raised in the room im not staying nothing personal anita i mean youre cute but i dont do women and with you this weak and jeanclaude out of it i dont want to take the chance that this thing spreads through the room she came to the bed and patted my shoulder a little awkwardly she wasnt much better at the buddy thing than i was the wolves will do everything they can to get you all through this better than the lions i said its not their rex in the next room its our ulfric she said and there was a flare of her beast like the hot breath of the monster in the dark i shivered and she shut the power down sorry im going with that she went for the door as she went out someone else came in and i cried out micah he didnt exactly run to me but it was close he was still wearing the dress shirt and slacks id last seen him in but they were covered in dried stains blood dried to black and brick red maybe i stared at the bloodstains because he unbuttoned it as he came and threw it on the floor for once seeing his chest and shoulders bare didnt make me think of sex all i could think of was whose blood it was richards or jeanclaudes micah said dont reach out to them with power anita how did you know thats what i was thinking i asked he smiled but his eyes were tired relieved to see me up and around but tired im your nimirraj that was often his answer to things when i asked how he read me so well he was nimirraj to my nimirra and that seemed answer enough for him he kissed me and i expected jason to let go of my hand so i could hug micah but he didnt micah and i glanced at him and i saw the fear naked in jasons eyes for a moment id never seen his eyes like that that one look let me know how terribly close wed come to dying and how close we still were one look and i knew that we werent out of the woods yet i looked up into micahs chartreuse eyes its not just the little vampires that the energy is supposed to save is it jasons hand tightened on mine micah hugged me and i put my free hand over that smooth warm permanently tanned skin i breathed in the scent of his neck so precious to me tell me i whispered he drew back enough to see my face when jeanclaude dies at dawn he could take you and richard with him i searched his solemn face and found only truth there truth and fear behind his eyes hiding better but it was there i called out lillian she was there yes anita how likely is it that jeanclaude will drag us with him truthfully we dont know but its a possibility and wed rather not find out she touched my forehead the way a mother takes a temperature feed on donovan anita take the energy he offers so we dont have to worry about it youre not sure this will work are you of course we are i dont need to be a vamp or a shapeshifter to know that was a lie i said she stepped back suddenly brisk and all professional fine we arent certain but it will be enough energy to save some of you whether all of you will be saved we just dont know this is new science here anita new metaphysical science which is always an uncertain thing i nodded thanks for telling me the truth you asked she said edward came up through the crowd they told me it would work we said it was the best idea we had lillian said that is not the same thing edward nodded all right i heard what i wanted to hear he gave me a very serious look dont die on me the other bodyguards would never let me live it down i smiled ill do my best to protect your reputation i had a thought now you get to wait outside what he said i dont think i can have sex in the room while you watch sorry he grinned at me i guess id have trouble in front of you too then he did something that surprised me he moved jason away from my hand and took it firm and certain in his he held my hand and we looked at each other for a long moment he opened his mouth closed it shook his head if you die i promise the harlequin will pay for it apparently the secret was out and we were just calling a spade a scary shovel i nodded you didnt have to say it i knew you would he smiled squeezed my hand and left i almost called him back surrounded by men i loved and had sex with but strangely i felt safer with edward in the room but the danger i was about to face wasnt his kind of danger in the room or out of it edward couldnt help me now chapter twentyseven i didnt so much raise the ardeur as simply stop fighting it my control of it had grown to the point where i had to give it permission to feed i had to unleash it maybe if the beasts inside me hadnt risen at nearly the same time i wouldnt have thought of the ardeur as something on a leash something on a chain yeah a chain with a leather collar at the end of it yeah something leather and metal studded and tight id thought they had too many guards in the room until i got close to donovan reece then part of me thought sex and three or four other parts of me wondered what the flesh under all that skin would feel like between my teeth donovan had requested that the other men turn their backs and give us what privacy they could theyd done it some had done it with a look that said it was silly but theyd done it then donovan took his clothes off he stripped like a pale white dream the ardeur had made certain that his body was ready for me he lay against the front of his body like something carved of ivory and blushed with the first pink of sunrise he was as pale as a vampire but he was dawn he was sunlight on water he was moonlight on wings i heard the sound of birds calling in the night id never known swans had a voice almost like geese but no no not geese swans donovans voice came strained youve undone my control of my power something about the ardeur has stripped me bare of more than my clothes i found i could still talk above the feel of a nights sky and moonlight though it was like seeing double as if the vision in my head threatened to be more real than the man beside me my version of the ardeur gives you what you want most sometimes i leaned in beside his cheek and whispered into that perfect curve of ear what do you want most donovan reece he turned to me and his eyes were a dull gray not to be king he rolled us over so that he was suddenly looking down at me his body was still pressed to the front of mine not inside but the sensation of him hard and firm trapped between our bodies made me cry out he leaned over me pressing that weight against me he wrapped his arms around me which put my face into his chest id have trouble breathing with him on top but he seemed to realize it and raised his upper body enough to curl around me until his face was next to mine can you give me what i most want anita i dont know i whispered try it may not work the way you think it will i tried to think past the ardeur past the feel of his body against mine tried to think past the warm scent of his skin the ardeur had a mind of its own and a funny way of granting desires i didnt trust what would happen if that was what he truly wanted give me what i want anita he raised his upper body above me i cant control the ardeur that well donovan he raised himself so that his upper body was in a half pushup which pushed his lower body harder against mine i whimpered for him did i hurt you he asked i had to open my eyes to answer him not hurt no something in my voice in my unfocused gaze made him smile no not hurt he said smiling down at me his eyes were bluer than id ever seen them as if something about this moment had chased the gray from his eyes i realized that his request to not be king had made me tone back the ardeur it scared me because the ardeur was a power unto itself it did things decided things that i didnt understand if jeanclaude had been able i would have asked him of course i had people i could ask it was just going to be awkward to ask one of the other reasons that requiem and london were in the room was that they had more centuries of experience with the ardeur than i did as victims true but still they knew it in ways id only begun to glimpse i put a hand on donovans chest to push him away to give me breathing space we were in a hurry but we werent in such a hurry were we i mean if he were dead he wouldnt be king sometimes the ardeur was a very literal thing but id forgotten that the white hairs on his chest werent hair but feathers the moment my palm touched the silk of the feathers and the heat of his chest i forgot what i was going to ask my hands found his body and he was hot to the touch as if his temperature had spiked your skin its hot i told you you took my control away he leaned in as he said it keeping his shoulders up but lowering his head for a kiss i could feel his heart thudding against the palm of my hand i could feel it in a way that i hadnt been able to feel since the ardeur was new to me i felt his heart like it was something holdable as if i could reach into his chest and cup it caress it i was suddenly very aware of all the blood rushing through his body i could hear it feel it like warm ribbons running just under his skin i could smell it hot metallic sweet i had closed my eyes so i wouldnt see his face watch him kiss me but it wasnt the human part of me that was the problem closing my eyes didnt take away the feel the weight the scent of his skin and of what lay so close under all that flesh he kissed me he kissed me for the very first time and i didnt care i moved away from those soft lips and kissed my way along the line of his jaw kissed my way onto his neck he seemed to take it as an invitation because the hard length of him pushed between my legs i opened for him but put my hand on the back of his neck holding his neck close to my kisses his hair was the softest id ever touched but it meant almost nothing to me i could smell what i wanted smell it like candy just under his skin he pulled against my hand his voice was strained as he said anita i need a better angle i kept my hand pressed into his neck brushed by that soft hair held him where a few kisses more would put me where i wanted to be i felt him now pushing against my opening but not quite there normally that distracted me from other things but not tonight almost without thinking i moved my hips my legs angled my body for him he entered me and that did distract me it made my eyes fly open wide made me cry out and writhe underneath him but i never let go of the back of his neck i pressed my face in tight against his as i raised my hips off the bed my legs in the air so he could push himself in and out of me i cried out under the strength of his body let me rise anita let me look at you no i whispered not yet he pushed against my hand at his neck again i put my other hand on his back i held him in place and kissed over the pulse in his neck it jumped and beat against my lips like something alive like a trapped bird in a cage of flesh i would set it free i would let it pour into my mouth and there was a moment of sanity a heartbeat of no then jeanclaudes power breathed through me his hunger both his hungers and there was no more doubt there was only the press of donovans pulse against my mouth his body thrusting inside mine my hips rising to meet him and my mouth on his neck i bit him and tried to be gentle but gentle wasnt what i wanted wasnt how i felt the sensation of his flesh in my mouth caught between my teeth as i bit slowly down harder and harder felt so good but what i wanted to do was bite more take more of his flesh into my mouth into me the fluttering heat of his pulse like a frightened butterfly beat against the roof of my mouth it was like a caress urging me on begging me to free that dancing bit of life donovan lifted me up off the bed his arms locked around me as he went to his knees the movement startled me made me ease back from the biting his voice was shaky too much teeth anita he knelt on the narrow bed his arms wrapped around me his body no longer inside me my legs were wrapped around his waist i must have done it automatically when he moved hed stopped making love to get me to stop trying to eat him his neck had a perfect impression of my teeth like a purplishred bruise in the white perfection of his flesh blood traced down his shoulder and back where my nails had gone into that smooth skin i could have said so many things but the one thing i said was the one that amazed me most you broke the ardeurs hold i may not be a predator anita but im still a king that means i have to give myself to you you cant just take it im sorry i said its all right im not angry just dont tear my throat out or carve my back up okay im not sure she can help it micah said i looked out from the man in my arms to find not just micah but all the men crowded around the bed remus seemed to be arguing with requiem and london too low to hear but body language said it all i met micahs eyes and asked for help with a look id thought of donovan as just meat just food the sex hadnt been enough to distract me from blood and meat donovan asked what can i do to keep myself safe requiem came to the bed his black cloak tight around him if you are strong enough to sit up with her as you did then you are strong enough to hold her down we cant guarantee your safety reece remus said donovan looked at the guard he shifted his grip from my waist to lower but there was no wavering as if he could have held me forever it answered whether the swanmanes were stronger than normal humans they were i know you cannot guarantee my safety she could tear your throat out before we could move remus said if it gets that out of hand we interfere micah said interfere how remus asked grab her help donovan hold her down the ardeur will spread to anyone who touches her remus said micah nodded i know remus shook his head a little too rapidly i cant do my job then i cant keep reece safe because you wont risk the ardeur spreading to you micah made it a statement not a question yes remus said then leave london said we need a senior guard in here remus said who do i send in my place bobby lee is still in south america claudia no who replaces me he sounded tormented torn between duty and what duty and fear duty and the ardeur we are out of time for niceties anita requiem said i speak for the vampires if the lesser among us are to be saved it must be now there wasnt a poetic allusion in the statement things were bad when requiem stopped quoting poetry it was almost as if his words brought the ardeur crashing back one moment i was almost neutral in donovans arms the next i was kissing him as if id crawl into his mouth my nails just seemed to automatically dig into his back again the feel of his flesh parting under my nails made me cry out in pleasure and him in pain i tried to tone down what i wanted to do to him i tried not to bite at his mouth but only kiss but the effort had me making small frustrated noises against his lips he pressed us back to the bed his weight suddenly pinning me down my legs were still wrapped around his waist so his body was already pushing against my opening i fought to concentrate on the sex instead of flesh and blood but the sex was tangled up with the feel of my nails in his back my mouth at his lips i wanted that hard press of flesh to shove its way inside me but almost more i wanted to bite his lips and draw blood i wanted blood more than sex i was feeding for jeanclaude but the ardeur wasnt his first hunger i licked donovans lower lip drew it into my mouth so full so rich so i bit down on his lip hard and sharp blood sweet metallic warm blood filled my mouth and the world vanished in a dance of light flashes and pleasure it wasnt sex or orgasm but it was as if that sip of blood ate the world in a red wash of pleasure id had the world go red from anger but never from sheer joy it was as if every piece of my body filled with warmth and happiness all at once it was orgasmic and not but whatever it was it was amazing i was left gasping and almost limp underneath donovan it was as if id lost time because he had my wrists pinned his body trying for the right angle to enter me i blinked up at him as if i didnt remember how i got there his chin was covered in bright crimson blood his lower lip was shredded had i done that then he found his angle and was pushing his way into my body i gazed down the length of our bodies to watch him plunge himself into me the sight of it made me cry out and raise my hips to meet his thrust his eyes fluttered shut and he gasped you take all my control away fuck me donovan i whispered he looked down at me with blood spilling down his face but his eyes filled with that look that a man gets that look that says mine sex more less than that his eyes were bluer than id ever seen them as he began to shove himself in and out of my body he found his rhythm quick fast over and over i watched all that pale hard length plunge in and out of me i felt the warmth begin to build i whispered soon your eyes he whispered your eyes like blue flame i might have asked what he meant by that but one last thrust and the orgasm hit me i screamed and struggled underneath him he fought to hold my hands down fought to pin my lower body fought to keep me where he had me as his body thrust inside me in one last powerful movement that brought me screaming again or maybe i hadnt stopped screaming from the first time the ardeur fed fed on his body plunged inside mine fed on the strength of his hands on my wrists fed on the heat of him and then i felt the swans the three women i knew in st louis were in a small bedroom they stared up at me as if i were something they could see something that had come to get them then other faces more startled eyes some cried out some slumped on their couches fell from chairs others writhed on their beds i fed we fed the ardeur fed dozens of faces of bodies and i felt jeanclaude wake felt it like a jolt through my belly and groin he took control of the energy and i might have tried to stop but it was too late to stop we fed on the swans we fed on them all so much power so much life we ate them down while they stumbled in midstep while they slid down walls and none of them fought us they just gave it up an army of prey an army of food a glorious rush of power richard woke i felt his eyes flash open felt him begin to choke and fight the tube in his throat jeanclaude drew me back from him enough so i did not choke with him i saw the white coats pile around richard as he began to struggle then it was night and moonlight and wings strong wings beating against so much air the ardeur hit those wings like an arrow through his heart one pulse beat it was feathers and wings the next pulse it was a man falling to earth the ardeur took his power drank down that pale body that dark hair the mix of pleasure and terror as he plummeted richards power burst over me through me in a rush of heat and electricity he reached out to the falling man and simply thoughtchange he called the mans beast called that energy and covered the flesh in feathers turned the arms to wings in time for him to turn and skim over the treetops i felt leaves brush our feet as wings beat frantically to gain height but frantic didnt quite cover all that smooth muscled power when all we could feel was wind and space we left him and i had a moment of staring into richards face a moment to see his chest covered in healing scars then i was back in the narrow bed with donovan on top of me his body poised above me spine bowed hands gripping my wrists as if i were the last solid thing in the world his eyes were closed blood dripped from his mouth onto my skin like red flowers exploding on my body i breathed his name donovan he opened his eyes and they were solid black and no longer human he threw his head back and screamed the sound was high and piteous the sound froze my heart in my throat i had time to think ive hurt him and then that pale perfect body began to thrust into me all over again as if we hadnt just made love but before hed been gentle careful there was nothing gentle this time he plunged into me as hard and fast as he could he brought me screaming writhing underneath him his hands bruised my wrists held me in place as his rhythm became frantic his breathing ragged and feathers flowed around his body like a nimbus of white light i had a second to think angel and then all i could see was feathers brushing me covering me like a blanket he cried out again and his body thrust into mine he brought me one last time covered in feathers blinded by them breathing them in his hands vanished and i could move my hands but all i could touch were feathers and bones too delicate to be human huge wings beat the air above me and i could finally see a long graceful neck the head the beak i was trapped at the center of a storm of wingbeats and feathers as he fought for lift i covered my face with my arms because a swan can break the arm of a grown man with one blow then he was off almost hovering but the ceiling was too low he crashed to the floor i was left buffeted breathless heart hammering in my chest a single feather longer than my hand lay across my stomach i managed to prop myself up the feather fluttering down between my legs to land beside the condom that lay discarded on the bed it had been the only clothes hed been wearing jeanclaudes voice eased through me je taime ma petite je taime i love you too i whispered then dawn came and i felt him die felt that wonderful person i loved go away i heard the sound of a body hitting the ground requiem was a heap of black cloak one of the guards had managed to catch london and was lowering him to the ground a little more gently the vampires were dead for the day all of them we had hours of daylight to find the harlequin and kill them im not sure thats what jeanclaude and the other vampires would have wanted but the vampires were down for the count until nightfall it was daylight and the humans were in charge thanks to jeanclaude i was the top human in our city thanks to richards selfloathing the guards would listen to me instead of him all right except for the wolves the wolves were his but that was okay i needed professionals not gifted amateurs i needed edward and his backup at that moment i would have welcomed any backup he thought could handle the job chapter twentyeight i was wrong i didnt want to welcome edwards backup one of them i wanted to send back to his mommy the other i wanted to put a bullet in his brain or heart he was human so either would do the job at least i was dressed for the fight i never fight as well naked i would so not have been comfy naked in front of edward let alone in front of his backup what the fuck were you thinking i shouted at him yeah it was one of those kinds of fights edwards face was blank empty peaceful it was one of the faces he killed with when he wasnt enjoying the kill olaf is good backup for this anita hes got the skills we need a covert spook any weapon you care to name handtohand and better with explosives than i am hes also a fucking serial killer whose victims of choice are petite brunette women i slapped my upper chest sound like anyone you know he let out a breath if it had been anyone else i would have said he sighed hes a good match for this job anita i swear that he is but he wasnt my choice not exactly i stopped pacing and came to stand in front of him id kicked everyone out except micah when he handed me the overnight bag full of clothes and weapons i loved a man who knew how to pack for me when id stepped out into the hallway and seen olaf and peter id gone back in the room kicked micah out too and invited edward in what does that mean he wasnt your choice exactly you just said his skills match this job they do but do you really think id have brought him within a hundred miles of you anita olaf likes you likes you in a way ive never seen him like a woman he has whores and he has victims but whatever he feels for you is different are you saying he loves me olaf doesnt love anybody but he feels something for you he wants me to play serial killer with him edward edward nodded the last time he saw you you and he killed a vampire together you decapitated it and he cut out its heart how do you know what we did you were in the hospital trying not to die i heard about it later from the local cops they were creeped by the way you butchered the vampire said you were both real good at cutting up the body im a legal vampire executioner edward its what i do he nodded again and olaf has been a specialops assassin for most of his adult life i dont hold his day job against him edward its his damn hobby that i dont like hobby you call the fact that hes a serial killer his hobby i shrugged i think thats how he sees it he smiled i think you may be right dont you smile at me dont you fucking smile at me you hinted that you didnt want to bring him on this job so why did you his face sobered he wanted to come to st louis to see youhe put air quotes around the see on his own i told him if he came near you id kill him he believed me but he said that if i ever got called to back you up again i had to include him if i didnt hed come on his own and take his chances with me later later later after what edward gave me a look out of those blue eyes that were some of the coldest i ever looked into so hes here to what kill me he doesnt kill women anita he butchers them i shuddered because id seen olaf at a serialkiller crime scene not his own work hed been helping edward and me track down a different killer but the victim had been just a pile of meat it had been one of the worst things id ever seen done to a human being olaf had looked up from that pile of carnage and the look in his face had been sexual as if what lay on that table was the biggest turnon hed ever had hed looked at me and hed been thinking sex yeah but hed been thinking sex not just without my clothes but as if he wondered what id look like without my skin most humans didnt scare me anymore but olaf scared me edward said anita you look like youve seen a ghost id rather see a ghost than him he smiled again rather see a ghost i keep forgetting that youre not just a pretty face i frowned at him youre smiling this fight isnt even close to over i had to invite olaf to play anita this way i have his word that hell behave himself define behave himself no serial killing on your turf period so im off the menu too he wants to help you slaughter your victim of choice vampires hell even help you kill men he said i shivered rubbing my arms squeezing tight so the gun in its shoulder holster dug into my breast a little i liked the discomfort i wasnt helpless it was just that olaf was six feet plus of trained muscle i was stronger and faster than a normal human thanks to jeanclaudes vampire marks but i still knew enough about physical potential to know that olaf was a very dangerous man he was crazy and trained to kill that seemed an unfair advantage to me you think he would have come on his own by now if you hadnt given him your word i asked yes he wasnt smiling when he said that last he was as serious as id ever seen him i would never have invited him to that last case in new mexico if id thought i would be needing your help please believe that the last thing i wanted was for him to meet you i knew it would be a disaster i just didnt expect you to charm him i didnt know there was a woman on the planet that could have made him feel anything close tohe searched for a wordhe wants to help you hunt and slaughter these vampires i dont want him here edward i know but this was the best compromise i could make with him anita actually i hoped hed be out of the country so far away that the fireworks would be over before he could get back to the united states he took a job with a government agency to help train up some of their new antiterrorist infiltration groups he took a job that hes qualified forhe speaks more middle eastern languages than i dobut it wasnt a job that let him exercise his urges you mean hes not been allowed to kill anyone he nodded why would he take a job that didnt let him slaughter people because he knew if he went out of the country hed never make it back in time to be in st louis when you needed me i stared at edward are you saying that olaf took a job that he didnt want so hed be closer to me that is exactly what im saying this last year and some change is probably the longest hes ever gone without killing someone if youd asked me id have said he couldnt go this long without killing someone how do you know he didnt hes got a deal with our government he doesnt play serial killer on american soil they look the other way as long as he abides by that i hugged myself tight again i didnt ask olaf to be a good boy edward i know you didnt why does the fact that hes behaved himself on the off chance that he can come play with me scare me because youre smart explain to me why it makes my skin run cold that hes gone to this much effort for me he is crazy anita which means that you never know what will trigger him with a woman he likes you as much as ive ever seen him like a woman but he has high standards for women what does that mean it means that when he saw you almost two years ago you werent sleeping around now you are im a little worried that that will change his opinion of you he kills whores i said my voice flat i did not call you a whore you said i sleep around you have half a dozen regular lovers and you just had sex with a new one give me another way to say it i thought about it then shook my head and almost smiled a full dance card oh hell edward fine im sleeping with a lot of men which brought me to another thought god peter was in the hallway while donovan and i were in herei felt myself blush and couldnt stop it i figured you for a screamer i gave him a very unfriendly look sorry but peter was embarrassed what else do you want me to say say why you brought him say why the hell would you involve him in this dangerous mess short version because weve only got a few hours to find these bastards i agree weve got a ticking clock but you have to explain peter being here i cant just let him go hunting vampires with us edward hes sixteen years old for gods sake it was the phone call when you talked to him he knew you were in trouble short version he wanted to return the favor you rescued him he wanted to help rescue you i dont need rescuing i need people to help me kill other people i dont want peter to get better at killing people i watched him kill the woman who raped him i watched him blow her face to red sauce i shook my head and started pacing the room again how could you do this to him edward if i had left him home he just would have followed me he knew where i was going this way i can keep an eye on him no you cant we cant do this job and babysit at the same time they almost killed all three of us richard jeanclaude and me were kind of hard to kill edward these guys are good dangerous good do you really want peters first real job to be against something this scary no edward said but he was coming i had the choice of bringing him with me or letting him find his own way hes sixteen edward youre his father you say no and you make it stick im not married to his mother yet anita im not his official stepanything he sees you as his dad not when he doesnt want to what does that mean it means that i dont have the authority that a real dad would have over him sometimes it means that ill always wonder if hed been mine from the beginning if hed be different or if wed have ended up here anyway hes out there in the hallway armed hes carrying more than one gun and at least one knife hes carrying them like hes done it before what the hell have you been teaching him edward what any father teaches his son which is what he knows i just stared at him knowing my face held a soft growing horror edward you cant make him into a little you he was scared all the time anita after the attack his therapist thought that martial arts training training him to take care of himself would help it did he stopped having the nightmares after a while training him to take care of himself is different from whats standing out in that hallway theres a loss of innocence in his eyes a oh hell i dont know what is missing or whats there that shouldnt be but i know it when i see it its the look that you have in your eyes anita its the look that i have in mine he is not like us i said hes killed twice he killed the wereanimal that killed his father and would have slaughtered them all he killed the woman who raped him its pretty to think that it matters why you take a life i guess it does but what the taking of a life does to you inside doesnt care why you did it you either can kill and sleep nights or you cant peter isnt bothered by the killing anita hes bothered by what the bitch did to him hes bothered by the fact that he couldnt protect his sister no one sexually abused becca i said no thank god but her hand is still stiff sometimes she has to do handstrengthening exercises the hand works but its not a hundred percent and the man who tortured her is dead i said edward gave me those cold blue eyes you killed him for me you were a little busy i said yeah dying you didnt die i said i came as close as ive ever come but i knew youd save the kids i knew that you would see it right edward dont do this to me dont do what he asked dont make me part of taking peters childhood away from him hes not a child anita hes not a grownup either i said and how do you grow up if no one shows you how edward were going up against some of the most dangerous vampires that you and i have ever faced peter cant be that good yet he cant be up to that skill level no matter how much youve taught him if you want to get him killed fine hes your kid but i will not be a part of it i will not help you get him killed in some macho bullshit initiation thing i wont do it do you understand me i wont allow it maybe you cant send him home but i can how he asked what do you mean how i tell him to go the fuck home before he gets himself killed he wont go i can demonstrate that hes out of his depth edward dont humiliate him anita please it was the please that got me youd rather he die than get humiliated edward swallowed hard enough that i heard it he turned away so i couldnt see his face not a good sign when i was sixteen id rather have died than have a woman i loved humiliate me hes sixteen and male dont do that to him wait what did you say i said hes sixteen and male dont humiliate him i went to him walked around so that he had to meet my eyes not that part edward looked at me and there was real anguish in his eyes jesus edward what is it his therapist says that an event like what happened to him just as his sexuality was awakening can be a defining event what does that mean i asked it means that his view of sex and violence is all mixed up together okay what does that mean exactly it means hes had two girlfriends in the last year the first one was perfect she was quiet respectful pretty they were sweet together what happened i asked her parents called one night and asked what kind of monster our son was that hed hurt their daughter hurt her how the usual she was a virgin and they didnt do enough foreplay it happens i said but the girl claimed that when she told him it hurt he didnt stop sounds like buyers remorse to me edward i thought so too until the second girl she was rough trade anita as bad as the first girl had been good she slept around and everyone knew it she broke up with peter said he was a freak this girl was a freak anita she was all leather and spikes and piercings and it wasnt just for show she said he hurt her what did peter say he said he didnt do anything she didnt ask him to do what does that mean i wish i knew he wont tell you i asked no edward said why not i think its rough sex i think hes embarrassed to talk about it or what they did was bad enough that he thinks i will think hes a freak too he doesnt want me to think that i didnt know what to say so i said nothing sometimes silence is the best you can do then i thought of something worth saying liking rough sex doesnt make you a freak he looked at me it doesnt i said and i felt myself begin to blush its not my thing anita it just doesnt move me everyone has things that do it for them edward rough does it for you sometimes when a kid is abused they can react a lot of different ways two of the choices are that they identify with the abuser and become abusers or they embrace the role of victim he didnt embrace the role of victim anita what are you saying edward i dont know yet but his therapist says that hes also identified with his savior you he has another option besides just victim or abuser he has you what does that mean he has me you saved him anita you took off the ropes the blindfold hed just had the first sex of his life and he looks up and sees you he was raped i said its still sex everyone likes to pretend that its not but it is it may be about dominance and pain but its still sex id take it away make it so it never happened but i cant donna cant his therapist cant peter cant my eyes were burning damn it i would not cry but i remembered a fourteenyearold boy who id had to watch be abused on camera theyd done it so id do what they wanted done it to prove that if i failed them i wouldnt be the one who suffered i had failed peter i had saved him but not in time i had got him out but not before i cant save him anita we already saved him as much as we can edward no you saved him i realized in that one statement that edward blamed himself too wed both failed him then you were saving becca at the time yes but what that bitch did to peter is still happening its still inside him in his eyes i cant fix it his hands clenched into fists i cant fix it i touched his arm he flinched but didnt pull away you dont fix shit like this edward not outside television sitcoms in real life you dont fix this you can make it better you can heal but it doesnt just go away real life doesnt fix that easy im his father or all the father he has if i dont fix it who can no one i said i shook my head sometimes you just accept your losses and move on peters scarred but hes not broken beyond repair ive talked to him on the phone ive looked in his eyes i see the person hes becoming and its a strong person a good person good he laughed and it was a harsh sound i can only teach him what i am and im not good honorable then i said he thought about that then nodded honorable ill take that i guess strong and honorable is not a bad legacy edward he looked at me legacy huh yeah i shouldnt have brought peter no you shouldnt have his skills arent a good match for this job he said no i said they arent you cant send him home anita youd really rather see him dead than humiliated if you humiliate him it will destroy him anita it will destroy that part of him that wants to save people and not hurt them if he gives up that part of himself im afraid that all that will be left is a predator in training why do i feel like youre leaving out stuff because this is the short version remember i nodded then shook my head jesus edward if this is the short version im not sure my nerves can take the long one well keep peter in the background as much as we can ive got more backup on the way but im not sure theyll get here in time he glanced at his watch were running out of time lets do this with peter and olaf he made it a question hes your kid and olaf is good in a fight if olaf gets out of hand we kill him edward nodded my thought exactly i wanted to let it go god knew i did but i couldnt i was a girl and i couldnt let it go did you say that peter was in love with me i wondered if youd heard that i understand why he has a crush on me i guess i saved him you heroworship someone who saves you it may be a crush or hero worship but remember anita that its the strongest emotion hes ever had for a woman it may not be love but if youve never felt anything stronger how do you tell the difference the answer was you dont i just didnt like that answer not one little bit chapter twentynine chapter autbody contents autbody chapter autbodyi hadnt recognized peter at first because hed done that growth spurt thing that teenage boys do sometimes hed been a little taller than me when i last saw him now he was damn close to six feet his hair had been chestnut brown last time i saw him now it was darker a brown that was almost black it wasnt a dye job just a childs hair darkening to the color it would be as an adult his shoulders had broadened and he looked older than sixteen if you looked only at muscle development but the face the face hadnt caught up to the body the face still looked young unfinished until you hit the eyes the eyes were young one minute and cynical and old as hell the next it would have been unnerving enough to see peter under these circumstances but edwards little talk hadnt helped my nerves at all it made me look for signs that peter was what edward feared a junior predator if i hadnt had edwards warning in my head would i have noticed that look that gesture would i have scrutinized him trying to see the damage maybe but i cursed edward for oversharing cursed him loud and long in my head peter wasnt peter parnell he was peter black he even had id to prove it the id said he was eighteen too the id looked damned good edward and i were sooo going to talk about peters educational experiences if we could just avoid getting him killed here and now and that was the real danger to peter being here edward and i needed to concentrate on the bad guys but wed both be worried about peter we just would it was going to fuck with our concentration maybe i could persuade peter to stay out of the action by telling him he might get us both killed it might be the truth olaf stood against the far wall in a ring of bodyguards they hadnt disarmed him yet but my reaction to him coming through the door had made them not like him at all or maybe it was the fact that he was taller than claudia which put him perilously close to seven feet tall he wasnt thin but id seen him shirtless and knew that there was nothing but muscle under that pale skin a lot of muscle but it was lean muscle muscle that could move fast even standing still there was a potential in olaf that just about raised the hairs on your neck he was still perfectly bald with a dark shadow of almostbeard on chin and jaws and upper lip he was one of those men who needed to shave twice a day to stay perfectly shaved his eyes were so deep set it was like staring into twin caves dark eyes set deep in a pale face his eyebrows were black above them he was dressed in the same black id seen him in almost two years ago black tshirt black leather jacket black jeans over black boots i wanted to ask him if he owned anything with color to it but i didnt want to tease him one he didnt like to be teased two i wasnt sure if hed think i was flirting i just didnt understand olaf enough to mess with him he was trying to be neutral in the circle of bodyguards but there was something in him that was never truly neutral most serial killers make the neighbors say he was such a quiet man a nice boy so surprised olaf had never been a nice boy id seen him vanish into a nighttime field in plain sight like magic not supernatural powers but military training edward had called him a specialops spook and id seen it work i knew that all that tall muscled violence could melt into the night what i didnt believe was that it could pretend to be harmless and do undercover work edward did that kind of work and was fabulous at it but edward was sane and olaf wasnt crazy people have trouble stopping the crazy long enough to blend in with the normals he put that cavedweller gaze on me i shivered because i couldnt help it he actually smiled he liked that i was afraid of him he liked that a lot a part of me screamed kill him now the rest of me really didnt disagree with that little voice we need the muscle edward said at my side youre reading my mind i said i know you i nodded yeah you know me i glared at him and yet this is who you bring to my party he had no choice olaf said in that deep rumbling voice that seemed to come from the very center of that big chest i heard that i said claudia said anita what is he she jerked a thumb at him backup i said she gave me a look hes given his word of honor that hell behave himself while hes in our city behave himself how remus asked i looked at edward you explain it i need to get some paperwork from jeanclaudes room paperwork he said i nodded i think ive got warrants of execution for the two vamps that fucked us earlier i thought no one knew they were in town he said theyve been setting up some of the vamps from the church of eternal life busy girls edward said they were women these vampires olaf asked his voice was neutral id give him that i hated to answer his question because if the drivers license photos looked as much like the vampires mercia and nivia as i remembered then i knew why two of malcolms people had been naughty the harlequin were spies and covert ops a little playacting was right up their alley was i certain that mercia and nivia had pretended to be sally hunter and jennifer hummel no was i almost sure yes was i sure enough to use the warrants to kill them oh yes yes they were both female i said and i didnt look at him as i said it are we going to kill them probably what do they look like he asked and his voice was losing its neutral edge why does that matter to you claudia asked i forced myself to look up and meet olafs gaze i fought to watch his face while i said they fit your vic profile if thats what you want to know one of them maybe a little tall but the other one is juuust right the look on his face such joy such anticipation it made me want to cry or scream or shoot him vic profile claudia said what are you saying olaf is special ops hes an assassin and a soldier and a spook and hes good at all of it not just good he said i am the best ill let you and edward discuss that someday but hes good claudia hes backed my play before and he was useful i licked my lips but no woman of any description is to be alone with him at any time why she asked i gave my word olaf said im going to treat you like a recovering alcoholic olaf lets just keep temptation out of reach okay we are going to slaughter these two women together correct he asked i licked my suddenly dry lips again then nodded i think so then i will not be tempted elsewhere normally id have just used silver shot and blown holes through the vampires until i saw daylight or maybe a good oldfashioned staking but they were harlequin i would have to treat them as if they were master vamps heavy hitters which meant shoot them with silver shot then decapitate them take the heart out and burn them both you burn the body in a separate fire then you scatter the ashes in running water different bodies of running water if you want to be truly paranoid was i paranoid or just cautious these two vampires had almost killed jeanclaude richard and me from a distance using powers id never seen before paranoid it wasnt it was a messy dirty job to decapitate and take a heart there were vampire executioners who quit after having to do it a few times just didnt have the stomach for it did i have the stomach for it yes would i let olaf help me who the hell else would volunteer edward would do it if i asked but truthfully olaf was better at taking the body apart i guess practice makes perfect and olaf had had a lot of practice claudia asked again what do you mean hes like an alcoholic you tell her edward im going to go check my paperwork not without guards you arent he said fine i said send guards with me where is the paperwork he asked in my briefcase in jeanclaudes place you cant go to the circus of the damned without me anita or me olaf said if i said or me would you get mad peter said i frowned at him yes he grinned at me he was entirely too pleased to be here with his guns and knives strapped to his body he was even wearing a black tshirt but at least his jeans were blue though his leather jacket was black the boots were brown and looked like edwards real cowboy boots not boots youd wear to go dancing like olafs though the fact that i thought olafs boots were club boots was probably a fact best kept to myself i have to vote with them claudia said no one asked your opinion woman olaf said lets get this clear right now i said claudia is one of our officers you dont like it i know that but i trust her with my life she nearly got you killed didnt i end up in the hospital a couple of times in new mexico when you were supposed to be watching my back anger flared across his face thinning out his lips making his eyes look even more cavernous dont bitch at claudia if you cant do better the moment i said it i knew i shouldnt have i can do better than a woman shit i said anita claudia said yeah i said let me prove it i sighed as amusing as the thought of you and olaf going at it is please dont i know where the two bad vamps are and i have current warrants of execution how do you know where they are edward asked i saw hotel stationery fall from a table in the vision if they didnt wake up and move their asses we got em i looked at olaf if you dont slow me down by picking fights with my guards then we get to kill two vampires today theyre powerful enough that well have to take their heads and hearts like we did in new mexico he said and there was an eager purr to that deep voice i nodded swallowing past a feeling that might have been nausea yes to hunt with you again anita i will let this one believe what she likes i understood what a huge concession that was for olaf claudia said i dont believe it big man i know it claudia i said please oh hell just dont be around him okay he cant seem to help how he feels about women just dont crowd him and well get this done okay she didnt like it but she nodded great edward you fill in the guards on why olaf isnt to be alone with the women i want to see richard alive not just in a vision when youre done telling everyone what a big bad man he is come find me and you can drive me to the circus of the damned for the warrants i dont want you going out of my sight without guards anita jesus edward its daylight yeah and you know better than i do that master vamps have human servants animals to protect them and just plain human victims who will do anything theyre told i nodded a little too fast a little too often fine fine youre right im tired and im oh hell just pick some guards so i can go see richard i should have understood if he picked guards who one of them would be just shadowing me to richards hospital room was an easy job a safe job or should have been i went for the far door with one bodyguard in front of me and one behind the one bringing up the rear was peter chapter thirty outside richards room i had a fight with my guards the other guard was cisco who was all of eighteen i felt like a chaperone at a prom but the fact that they were both still teenagers didnt make them less stubborn hell maybe it made them more stubborn standing orders cisco said are that you are not to go anywhere without at least one guard with you at all times he ran his hand through his carefully blondtipped hair and frowned he wasnt happy i dont need an audience to see my boyfriend orders are orders he said i looked up at peter i still wasnt used to having to look up at him id visualized him over the phone as my size with that brown hair cut in a standard short cut but the brunette do was cut short but longer on top not exactly a skaters cut but close it was more modern more teenager less little boy i didnt like it i need a little privacy peter you understand that he smiled and shook his head im not fourteen now anita what does that mean it means im sympathetic but not stupid edward gave the orders and claudia and remus backed them up they were both young enough that i thought i might be able to embarrass them into letting me talk to richard alone fine which of you wants to see me get all emotional with richard they exchanged looks how emotional cisco asked i dont know maybe ill cry maybe well have a fight you never know with richard and me cisco spoke to peter like i wasnt there they are pretty weird around each other weird how peter asked i am standing right here i said cisco looked at me with those big dark eyes you and richard are like scary weird together as a couple come on its true i had to smile scary weird huh cisco nodded i sighed fine i guess so but i would like privacy come on he almost died and so did i im sorry anita cisco said i cant do it one of us has to be in the room with you dont i have any seniority here claudia and remus both made it really clear that if i fuck up again im gone like fired gone im not going to fuck up again whatd you do peter asked then actually blushed sorry sorry not my business later cisco nodded later cisco sniffed the air and turned toward the far end of the hallway soledad came around the corner she saw us and her face looked suddenly stricken she dropped to all fours and started to crawl toward us not in that almost sexual way the lycanthropes could but broken as if it hurt her to move whats up i asked her voice came as broken as her movements i shot richard im sorry you shot richard i said i looked at cisco he shrugged and gave me a look as if to say yeah i think if she hadnt shot him he might have just torn jeanclaudes heart out im sorry soledad said i didnt know what else to do she had stopped a few feet from us her hand held out in the air her head down id seen a similar gesture among the lions it was a way of asking to come closer when you were pretty sure the dominant in question didnt like you id been told that a guard shot richard and that it had saved jeanclaudes life but no one had told me who had done it i stared at the woman holding out that hand asking for forgiveness shed done her job sort of what would i have done in her place frozen i wouldnt have been able to shoot richard to save jeanclaude id have frozen and jeanclaude would have died which would have probably killed both richard and me shit they took her weapons cisco said until they review it all like when a cop is involved in a shooting i said a lot of us are expolice now cisco said and he gave me a look as if to say well what are you going to do what was i going to do i sighed hung my head and started forward why was it that in the middle of every crisis i always seemed to be babysitting someones emotions usually someone who was dangerous armed or should have been some kind of tough guy or girl the monsters were a lot softer than they seemed i went to her and gave her my left hand most people did it like they were shaking hands but i kept my gun hand free just habit soledad made a sound like a sob as she gripped my hand i had a moment to feel how terribly strong she was as she crawled close enough to put her face against my hand she rubbed her cheeks against my hand and lower arm and murmured thank you thank you anita im so sorry so sorry her tears were cool against my skin funny tears were always colder than blood shouldnt they both feel the same her power flared across my skin like a giants breath so hot and so everywhere any strong emotion can undo a shapeshifters control she drew a shuddering sob and threw herself around my waist her long arms clutching me she was practically wailing i didnt know what else to do with richard its okay soledad its okay i patted her hair and started to turn in her arms i didnt know her well enough to be this up close and personal and the emotional content was a little much for near strangers hell i wouldnt have wanted this much emotional content from close friends i had actually turned around with her hands only lightly on me when she moved she grabbed me around the waist lifted me in front of her face and chest and i blocked the clawed hand that had gone for my throat with my arm claws dug into my side just below the ribs the pain was sharp and immediate and i suddenly had two goals i strained to keep her hand from my throat and gripped her wrist at my waist to keep her from slicing open my belly her voice growled from behind me im sorry you have to die anita chapter thirtyone cisco and peter both had their guns out id have loved to go for a gun or a knife but wrestling the weretiger took both my hands she wasnt trying that hard to close on my throat and the hand at my belly was almost immobile except for the fact that the hooked claws shed conjured from her skin had pierced my side she called to the boys dont yell for help or shes dead i dont want her dead just let me leave with her and i wont hurt her youve already hurt her i can smell the blood cisco said his gun was very steady on us but shed taken all his kill shots if they only wounded her she would have time to kill me before they could kill her a little prick thats all she likes pricks dont you anita my voice was a little strained from keeping her hand from my throat the claws werent as big as they seemed they only looked huge because the human flesh didnt cover the bone of the tiger claw but they were plenty big enough to tear out my throat i might survive the gut wound but the throat would be fatal i managed to say through gritted teeth if youre going to kill me do it but dont make fun of me too she laughed a throaty sound her power flared hot so hot almost burning hot liquid burst over my back and hair my first thought was blood but i knew better it was that clear liquid that shifters lost when they changed when the change was smooth it was like heated water when it wasnt smooth it was gelatinous and chunky this flowed like water she never hesitated or stumbled as her body reformed around me fur and muscle flowed under my hands her power ran over my body like biting insects so much power it hurt had she thought id panic and let go she had the wrong girl for panic i kept my grip on her as fur replaced bare skin i didnt let go even as my skin danced and jerked as if shed laid a live wire against me jesus the control she had to be able to shift this smoothly she was better than micah and that was saying something it would have been impressive if i hadnt been wondering how close her new fangs were to my spine part of me noticed that her fur was the wrong color she was striped pale lemon gold and white werent tigers orange and black if i lived id ask someone youre one of the harlequins animals to call cisco said she growled yes youll never make it out of here if you hurt anita cisco said she knows where my mistress rests in the day i cant let her share that knowledge can i cisco he flinched at her using his name always harder to kill someone you know because if your master dies you die peter said it he was pointing his gun at the floor as if he knew he didnt have a shot he could take remus had told me that cisco had some of the highest scores on the gun range of any guard i was about to bet my life on his skill her hand strained toward my neck again and i put a lot of effort into holding it off her arm was a steady push mine was shaking you belong to mercia i said no she growled and eased a few sliding steps backward cisco and peter moved the same space forward it was like an awkward dance nivia i said how do you know the names does it matter i asked yes she whispered tell me whos talked to you jesus soledad dont make me do this cisco said soledad stopped whispering to me and called to cisco youre a good shot cisco but are you that good are you sure youre that good it was plain on his face that in that moment he wasnt sure i guess i wouldnt have been either id have given a great deal for edward in that moment or remus or claudia peter said whats the rule cisco almost glanced at him but remembered and kept his eyes on us his gun steady but he didnt have a killing shot and he knew it soledad began to back down the hallway with me in her arms just a few steps but slow and steady cisco and peter moved with us cisco had his gun pointed but frankly he was as likely to hit me as the weretiger no more likely peters gun was still pointed at the floor he didnt seem to know what to do peter said the rule is that if they have a weapon and want to take you someplace else its so they can kill you slower his voice was almost a monotone as if he were reciting i thought i understood what he meant i hoped i did because i was about to encourage him youre right peter i said he looked up his eyes met mine cisco said god i threw my head back used all that long hair to cover her eyes for a second peter dropped to one knee and shot at her legs the shots reverberated in the hallway soledad dropped abruptly to her knees but claws curled deeper inside me her other hand trying for my throat for real this time i made a choice i let go of the wrist at my stomach and used both hands to keep her from tearing out my throat twohanded to her one and i was losing she clawed at my side and stomach it felt like shed hit me with a baseball bat so much damage like a blow it stole my breath or id have screamed cisco and peter were there standing over us there still wasnt a clear shot she tried to crawl backward on her wounded legs while i held on to her hand and held it a fraction away from my throat cisco was still trying to find a shot peter threw himself onto us he just jumped us and we were all on the ground with her underneath us she stopped trying for my throat and reached for peter i was suddenly trying to wrestle her hand away from him instead of me her hand wasnt on my stomach anymore peters body reacted as if something hurt but i kept her off his throat it was all i could do i had a moment of being pressed between them and then the gunshots exploded just behind my head it was insanely loud that close to me i kept my grip on her as the inside of my head rocked with the sound of gunfire beside it her body jerked and still she tried for my throat again the change of angle startled me and she might have nicked me but i didnt feel it peter kept firing his gun must have been pressed into her head we ended up on the ground in a breathless deaf heap he was up on one arm his gun still shoved into her face peters tshirt was in rags over his stomach cisco was above us his lips were moving but i couldnt hear him i rolled free of the pile i had my gun out and pointed before my back hit the wall before i could truly see what was happening soledads head was a red mass there was no face left brains were leaking all over the floor her brains even for a weretiger this was dead peter was still over the body his gun pumping into that mass of tissue i think he was dryfiring by now but i couldnt hear well enough to say cisco knelt beside him his lips moving but i couldnt make out the words he got peter to stop firing into the body then tried to ease peter off her peter let him ease him back onto his knees then peter popped his empty magazine out put it in his left jacket pocket got a spare clip out of his righthand pocket and reloaded his stock was pretty high with me right then the reload made it go higher maybe we wouldnt get him killed cisco tried to get him to stand up and move away from the body i think cisco was worried about how peter would react when the shock wore off it made me think better of cisco then a lot of things happened at once i couldnt hear it but i must have seen movement out of the corner of my eye because i turned to see edward and company come barreling down the hallway guns drawn the door to richards room was open and he was leaning in it his beautiful chest was a mass of scars on one side he was pale as death and looked as if the only thing keeping him upright was the doorway the scars showed where the bullets had taken a chunk out of all that nice muscled flesh sometimes silver scars he mouthed something but i still couldnt hear anything but the ringing silence in my own head gunshot too close to the ear id be lucky if my hearing wasnt permanently damaged i felt movement nearer to me and turned but i was slow i think peter wasnt the only one in shock cisco was pulling peter to his feet by the collar of his jacket cisco was shouting something i couldnt see what the problem wasthere was nothing but soledads body then i looked at the body and realized that she was still in tiger form her body hadnt reverted to human form dead shapeshifters always revert to human form i raised my gun and had it aimed when the body sprang up and threw itself at peter and cisco chapter thirtytwo cisco fouled peters shot by throwing his body in the way of the claws i got off two shots before the faceless body brought them to the floor and i was suddenly having the same problem theyd just had trying to find a place to fire into that fur that wouldnt hit the two boys underneath it they had saved my life and i still thought boys claudia and remus got there first because you just cant outrun a shapeshifter edward and olaf were close behind but they didnt get there first it was claudia and remus who joined me around the struggling pile a gun fired up through the tigers chest claudia actually pushed me out of the way hard enough that i fell against the wall too many guns in too small a space friendly fire was as dangerous to us as soledad whoever was shooting was trying to make a hole through her chest her body jerked and jumped with the power of it she staggered to her feet i swear that i could see the hallway through the hole in her lower chest but even as i watched the muscle began to flow like water healing shit it was peter who had shot a hole through her cisco was trying to breathe through a throat that wasnt there anymore edward and olaf were beside each other firing into soledads body like they were on a shooting range so cool so professional so accurate it was a little hard to miss her at this range some of the guards had gone to their knees around edward olaf remus and claudia some standing some kneeling so they wouldnt get in each others way a very organized slaughter the tigers body jumped and danced with the bullets like some sort of spasming puppet but she didnt go down i fired from the wall where claudia had thrown me i emptied my clip into soledad and watched her body and fur flow over the wounds it was fucking silver and she was treating it like it was ordinary bullets id never seen a shapeshifter able to do that even fairies once you opened a hole in them that big didnt heal like this i emptied my clip and did almost exactly what peter had done earlier except that my extra clip was attached to my belt she wasnt acting like a wereanything she was acting like a rotting vampire that special kind of undead that were rare in the united states of course her master wasnt from around here my hearing was coming back in my left ear because i could hear screaming distantly as if they werent all standing right next to me my right ear was still a buzzing silence i yelled fire we need to set her on fire i must have yelled it too loud because they all looked at me i yelled burn her olaf took off running back down the corridor seeing him run away actually distracted me enough that i jumped when the guns started firing again i turned back to the action and found the body up and moving again the face had grown back but the chest was a gaping wound her lungs had to be gone but she moved she jumped at me in one of those long arcs that made her body a golden smear of light i fired at that blur until my gun clicked empty i dropped the empty gun and went for a blade and knew id never make it a second blur was in front of me and we were crashing back into the wall hard enough that i saw stars before i realized that the second blur was claudia shed thrown her body in the way and was slugging it out hand to claw she must have been out of ammo too those claws sliced up her chest and she went into a defensive crouch protecting herself as well as she could the tiger screamed or roared at us and then turned and ran the other way it was almost funny because for a breath we all just stood there then almost as a mass we ran after her my stomach didnt so much hurt as twinge as if the muscles werent working quite right it made me stumble then i found my feet and i ran if i could run i couldnt be that hurt right i could feel blood flowing down the front of me soaking into my jeans if soledad got out she might move the vamps or warn someone or set up an ambush we had to stop her had to but we couldnt run like the shapeshifters ran remus and the others passed edward and me as if we were standing still they bayed her at the double glass doors they bayed her within sight of the parking lot in sight of freedom remus was cut up now too they formed a circle around her double thick in front of the doors she crouched in the center of that circle snarling at them she was all gold and white and even after everything i could still see that she was beautiful graceful in that way that the cat lycanthropes seemed to be her tail twitched tight and angry edward popped a fresh magazine home he pulled the slide back and put one in the chamber the sound echoed around the circle not everyone had more clips some like me were out but enough of them did that it was eerie and businesslike soledad snarled with her tiger fangs my death will not stop the harlequin from killing you my mistresss death will not protect you from the wild hunt that is coming you didnt give us a black mask i said her orangeyellow eyes turned to me she made a noise that was between a growl and a purr the sound of it raised the hairs on the back of my neck you will die the vampire council is all about rules soledad its against your own laws to kill us when youve only given us white masks something about fair play and all that i wasnt great at reading even people i knew in animal form but i thought she looked afraid if you kill us the rest of them will hunt you down anita it is against vampire law to slay the harlequin im not killing you as jeanclaudes vampire servant im killing you and your mistress as a federal marshal and a legal vampire executioner i know your laws anita you have no warrant for us i have two warrants for two vampires that look a damned sight like your mercia and your mistress again there was that flinching through her alien eyes i was just getting better at reading furry faces bully for me the warrants list names of church members soledad purred but the warrant is worded sort of vaguely it states that i can kill the vampire responsible for the death of the victim and that i can at my discretion kill anyone who assisted in that death it also allows me to kill anyone who tries to impede me in carrying out my courtappointed duty i looked into that strangely beautiful face which means you olaf was beside edward he had a can of wd in his hand and a torch made of rags bound to what looked like the end of a metal mop handle there was a sharp oily smell from it all he said in that deep voice i was going to go for the ordnance in the car but the janitors closet was closer i almost asked what he meant by ordnance but was probably glad i didnt know though maybe what they had in their car would have been quicker than what we were about to do to her olaf had edward light the torch apparently hed soaked it in something because it burned clear and bright claudia told the people on the far side of the room to clear a space they parted like a curtain and left soledad in a clear kill space the guards formed two lines one kneeling and one standing they took their stances and edward joined them claudia yelled head or heart soledad leapt not toward the double line of doors and freedom or the firing squad but the thinner line that led back down the hall the guns all seemed to sound at once that liquid leap of gold and silver crumbled to the floor she could heal but the initial injury was real they fired into her until she twitched but didnt try to rise again olaf turned so i could see the gun tucked in the back of his belt cover me i kept expecting my wound to catch up with me but the adrenaline was carrying me id pay for it later but right now i felt fine i wrapped my hand around the gun and pulled it free of the inner pants holster id expected olaf to go for something big but it wasnt it was an h k usp compact id looked at one before i settled on the kahr i clasped it in a twohanded grip and aimed it at the fallen weretiger ready when you are i said olaf glided into the circle with his torch and his squeezy can of accelerant i didnt glide i just walked but i was at his side when he got to her i was at his side when he sprayed accelerant over her ruined face and chest the world suddenly smelled thick and oily she reacted to the liquid or the smell reaching out at us i shot her in the face the gun jumped in my hands so it was pointed at the ceiling before it came back down to point at her what the fuck is in this i asked he shoved the torch into the wound id made and she started to scream the smell of burning hair was strong and bitter it began to overwhelm the scent of the accelerant he set her afire he covered her in the thick oily liquid and burned her she was too hurt to do much but she could scream and writhe it looked like it hurt it smelled like burning hair and finally when she stopped moving it smelled like burning meat and oil she made a highpitched keening noise for a very very long time edward had moved up beside me to aim his gun with the one olaf had loaned me the three of us stood there while soledad died by pieces when she stopped moving stopped making noise i said get an axe i think i actually said it in a normal voice i could hear out of one ear at least the one that peter had shot beside was still out for the count it made sound echo oddly in my head what edward asked she heals like one of the vampires that descends from the lover of death i do not know this name olaf said rotting vampires she heals like one of the rotting vamps even sunlight isnt a sure thing i need an axe and a knife a big sharp one you will take her head olaf asked yeah you can do the heart if you want he looked down at the body she was human now lying on her back legs spread most of her face was gone and her lower chest one breast was burned and blasted away but the other one was still pale and perky one side of her hair the yellow of her tiger fur was still there there was no face no eyes to stare up at us i might have been grateful for that except that staring into the blackened peeling ruin of her face wasnt really an improvement i swallowed hard enough that it hurt my throat burned as if breakfast might be trying to come back up i tried a deep breath but the smell of burnt flesh also wasnt an improvement i ended up breathing shallow and trying not to think too hard i will find her heart for you olaf said and i was glad my hearing wasnt quite working right it made his voice sound flat and lose a lot of the inflection if id heard all the longing in his voice that i saw on his face i might have shot him i was betting his special ammo would have made a really big hole in a human body i thought about it i really did but in the end i gave him back his gun he extinguished his torch someone brought us an axe and a freshly sharpened knife i was really missing my vampire kit but it was at home no at the circus her spine was brittle from the fire easiest decapitation id ever done olaf was having to dig in her chest to find the pieces of burnt and bloody heart wed made a mess of her i kicked the head a little ways from the body yeah i wanted to burn the head and heart and scatter the ashes over moving water but she was dead i kicked the head again so that it skittered across the floor too burned to bleed my knees wouldnt hold me anymore i collapsed where i was standing with the axe still in my hands edward knelt beside me he touched the front of my shirt his hand came away crimson like hed dipped it in red paint he ripped my shirt open to my chest the claw marks looked like angry jagged mouths there was something pink and bloody and shiny bulging out of one of the mouths like a swollen tongue shit i said does it hurt yet he asked no and my voice sounded amazingly calm shock was a wonderful thing we need to get you to a doctor before that changes he said and his voice was calm too he wrapped his arms around me and stood cradling me he started back the way wed come at a fast walk does that hurt he asked no i said again my voice distant and too calm even i knew i was too calm but i felt sort of distant and unreal lets hear it for shock he started running down the hallway with me in his arms does it hurt now he asked no he ran faster chapter thirtythree edward hit the door to the main trauma room with his shoulder we were inside but there was no one to pay attention to me there was a white wall of doctors and nurses and some of them in civilian clothes but they were all around one gurney their voices held that frantic calm that you never want to hear when youre on your back looking up at doctors a spike of fear got through the shockpeter it had to be peter the adrenaline rush of it stabbed through my stomach like a fresh blow edward turned and i could see more of the room it wasnt peter he was lying on a different gurney not that far away from the one that had everyones interest who the fuck was it we didnt have any more humans on our side the only person with peter was nathaniel he was holding the boys free hand the other hand was hooked up to an iv nathaniel looked at me and his face showed fear enough that peter fought to turn and see what was coming through the door nathaniel touched his chest held him down its anita and your edward i think hed been about to say your dad i heard peters voice as we got closer your face whats wrong with them nathaniel said i didnt think there was anything wrong with my face he tried to make a joke of it but the noises from the other side of the room made humor sort of hard i couldnt see past all the white coats who is it i asked nathaniel answered its cisco cisco he wasnt hurt that badly id seen shapeshifters heal throat wounds that bad were there more bad guys in here with us how did he get hurt i asked peter actually tried to sit up and nathaniel kept him down with that hand on his chest as if hed been having to pin peter to the gurney for a while anita peter said edward put me on the nearest empty gurney and the movement didnt so much hurt as let me know that it was going to hurt it was as if things shifted around that i shouldnt have been able to feel i had a moment of nausea and knew that that was just me thinking too hard or hoped it was edward moved me so peter could see me without moving it meant that i could see peter his jacket and shirt were gone but bulky bandages were taped across his stomach more of them were on his left shoulder and upper arm his weapons and jacket and the remains of his bloody shirt were on the floor under his gurney itd be my turn next what happened to cisco i asked peter said youre both hurt im fine edward said its not my blood peter looked at me his eyes too wide face sickly pale he got his throat torn out i remember but he should be able to heal that i said not all of us are that good at healing anita nathaniel said i looked at him now the fact that i hadnt truly looked at him said clearly how much i was hurt he was wearing one of his pairs of jogging shorts that left very little to the imagination his hair was back in a tight braid i met his eyes and i still loved him but for once my body didnt react to the sight of him edward came to stand by peter and nathaniel came to me an exchange of emotional prisoners nathaniel took my hand and gave me as chaste a kiss as wed ever exchanged his lavender eyes held the worry that hed been hiding from peter or trying to hide from him he leaned over my body and i heard him draw in a big breath of air nothings perforated he whispered until he said it i hadnt thought about it my intestines could have been perforated or hell my stomach if id had to get clawed up it wasnt a bad place for it it wasnt a fatal hit not right away not if things werent spilling out of me they were bulging out not spilling there was a difference is peter not perforated either you were both lucky i knew he was right but the voices had risen in pitch across the room when the doctors start sounding that panicked things are very bad cisco shit it was cherry who peeled away from the crowd around him and came to me she had thrown a white coat over the usual black goth outfit her heavy eyeliner had run down her face like black tears she touched peters shoulder as she went past and said let the drugs work peter you cant help him by fighting to stay awake she was trying for me he said she was reaching for me he put himself in her way he saved me she patted his shoulder and checked the iv almost automatically but she also adjusted the little knobby thing on it the liquid began to drip a little faster she patted him again and came to the other side of the gurney so that she could look at nathaniel across me or maybe so she could keep an eye on what was happening to cisco there were so many people around him that it looked like they were getting in each others way she said nothing i can do over there she said it almost to herself as if she were trying to convince herself she put on a fresh pair of gloves before she looked at my stomach there was blood on the sleeve of the white coat she was wearing she seemed to see it at about the same time i did she just stripped off the coat tossed it in the little hamper they had for washables threw the clean gloves away got another pair of clean gloves and came back to me her eyes stared at the wound not at me her face had gone to concentrating on her job if she just concentrated on her job then she wouldnt fall apart i knew the look i had one like it i tried to do something else while she looked at the wounds somehow i didnt want to see my insides on the outside again but it was like a train wreck you couldnt quite look away what is that i asked intestine she said in a voice that held no emotion i heard someone shout clear the crowd around cisco cleared and i saw lillian using the crash cart on his chest she was about to try to jumpstart his heart fuck micah was in the crowd he turned and looked at me his mouth and chin covered in blood as if nathaniel read my mind he said he was trying to call flesh and help cisco heal the wound micah could help a healing wound heal faster by licking it hed done it for me once he wiped the blood off his face as he looked at me across the room the look on his face was anguish hed tried lillian hit ciscos chest three times four but that highpitched alarm sound just kept going flatline i didnt hear the door open but richard came through leaning so heavily on jamil one of his bodyguards that he was being halfcarried jamil put him by the gurney their bodies blocked me from seeing what was happening cherry was swabbing my hand she had a covered iv needle in her other hand i looked away richards power ran over my skin like heat nathaniel shivered where he held my hand i glanced at him his body was covered in goose bumps you feel it i asked we all do cherry said and the needle bit home in my hand i squeezed nathaniels hand hard and kept staring at richards broad back micah came to stand at the head of my gurney hed wiped most of the blood off but his eyes held defeat if id had a spare hand i would have offered it he laid his face against the top of my head it was the best we could do jamil stumbled away from richard leaving him to halfcollapse across the gurney jamils body exploded one second he was tall dark handsome the next he was the blackfurred werewolf that had saved my life once lillian fell to the floor her body writhing twisting she was suddenly grayfurred she lay on the floor with her newly ratty face turned up to the gurney the other doctors and nurses kept their distance richard was trying to bring ciscos beast trying to help him heal by forcing him to shift but the alarm was still screaming still letting us know that ciscos heart wasnt beating richard clutched at the gurney with one hand and cisco with the other his power spread through the room as if someone had forgotten to turn off some invisible hot bath and it was filling up the room micah stood up put his hand against my head i felt his power spring to life felt him throw it around the four of us like a shield keeping richards power out most of the time micah could protect the other wereleopards but my ties to richard were too strong it worked today today micah held me in the calm of his power along with nathaniel and cherry richard screamed a long loud anguished sound he collapsed to his knees one hand still clinging to ciscos arm the arm flopped limp dead richards back rippled as if some giant hand were pushing out from the inside he threw his head back and screamed again but before the echo had died the scream turned into a howl fur poured over richards body it was as if his human body were ice melting to reveal fur and muscle his human form just melted into a wolf the size of a pony id never seen him in full wolf form only the halfandhalf the wolf threw its head back and howled long and mournful it turned a head as big as my entire chest to look at me the eyes were all wolf amber and alien but the look in them was not a wolfs look it held too much understanding of the loss that lay on the gurney one of the other white coats started turning off the machines the scream of the alarm went silent except for the ringing in my one ear the room was deathly quiet then everyone began to move the doctors and nurses started pulling things out of ciscos body he lay on his back eyes closed i remembered seeing spine in the throat wound now the bone was covered hed been healing but not fast enough jamil climbed to his furry feet and put a half claw half hand on the wolfs back he said in a voice gone to growl ill take us to feed one of the doctors helped lillian to her feet she seemed more shaken than jamil was but then im not sure shed ever had someone rip her beast from her human form jamil had been on the wrong end of richards anger more than once come with us lillian he said and the wolfish muzzle had trouble with the double l sound she nodded and took the hand he offered the darkhaired man who had turned off the alarm said well take care of the other patients lillian her own voice sounded highpitched and nasal thank you chris the three of them walked out together leaving the others to begin to clean up why did he die i asked he bled out faster than his body could heal cherry said ive seen you guys heal from worse i said you hang around with too many big dogs anita cherry said we dont all heal like micah and richard she had the iv on its little metal hat rack she reached up for the knob that would start the drip wait will that put me out i asked yes she said then i need to make some phone calls first youre not hurting too much yet then she made it half question half statement no not yet it aches but it doesnt exactly hurt it will she said and when it does youll want the painkillers i nodded swallowed nodded again i know but we still have soledads masters out there we need them dead you arent slaying any vamps today she said i know but ted forrester still can edward looked at me at the mention of his alter ego his hand was on peters hair as if he were a much younger boy and edward had just come in to tuck him in for the night i need you to take over my warrants i said he nodded his eyes werent cold they were ragefilled i wasnt used to seeing this much heat from edward he was a cold creature but what blazed in his eyes now was hot enough to burn a hole through me how is peter he asked cherry now that hes out well sew him up he should be fine edward looked at me ill kill the vampires for you we will kill them for you olafs voice from the door he must have arrived in time to hear the last few comments i hadnt heard him come in not good not good that i hadnt heard olaf but not good that it could have been someone else something else i trusted edward to see me safe but i was usually more help to myself than this admittedly i was having a bad day the dull ache in my stomach was beginning to have twinges of something sharp it was like a promise of what the pain would be in a little while i looked down my body i couldnt help it cherry blocked my view with her arm turned my face to her dont look youll sleep the doctor will look at you youll wake up better she smiled at me it was a gentle smile but it left her eyes haunted when had cherry gotten that look in her eyes someone found a cell phone i dialed zerbrowski directly the regional preternatural investigation team rpit was who i should have called and i should have probably started by talking to lieutenant rudolph storr but i just wasnt feeling well enough to argue with dolph about who and what was or wasnt a monster zerbrowski answered with his usual zerbrowski its anita i said blake whats shaking there was a thread of laughter to his voice the beginnings of his usual teasing i didnt have time today im about to get sewed back up what happened the teasing note was gone i gave him the shortest version i could and left out lots but i gave him the important parts two vamps maybe with more servants masquerading as two upstanding vampire citizens to get us to kill the two upstanding citizens they must have thought i was close because they sent one of their animals to kill me how hurt are you im not hunting any vampires today what do you need from me i need you to get cops around the hotel i need you to make sure these two dont get outside shouldnt they be dead to the world no pun intended they should but after what i saw in the servant i wouldnt bet anyones life on it call in mobile reserve if it goes wrong youll want the firepower dr chris came to stand over me he was a little under six feet but seemed taller because he was so thin one of those men who just couldnt seem to put on muscle mass id have called him willowy if hed been a girl he said get off the phone anita i need to look at your wounds im almost done i said what zerbrowski said the docs here hes wanting me off the phone tell me whos going to be processing your warrants and do what the doctor says youve got to be healed by the time we do the barbecue at my house i finally got the wife talked into letting you bring both your livein boyfriends dont make me waste all that persuasion i almost laughed but thought it might hurt so i swallowed it that sort of hurt too ill do my best off the phone anita dr chris said again ted forrester will have the warrants i said we didnt know he was in town just got here funny how it all goes pearshaped when he blows into town i only call him in when its already gone to hell zerbrowski youre reversing cause and effect says you hes a federal marshal just like me a hand scooped the phone out of my hand dr chris was a lycanthrope but still i should have at least seen it coming this is anitas doctor she needs to go now im going to put the other marshal on you two play nice im going to make ms blake go nightnight he hesitated then said shell be fine yes guaranteed now let me tend my patient he handed the phone to edward edward put on his ted forrester goodolboy voice sergeant zerbrowski ted forrester here dr chris shooed edward farther away so i couldnt hear what he was saying he turned the knob on the iv and said youre going to sleep now ms blake trust me youll enjoy the examination more that way but let it go ms blake youre hurt you have to let someone else hunt the vampires today i started to say something probably to argue but i never finished the thought one minute i was staring up at dr chris the nextnothing the world went poof chapter thirtyfour i woke up which was nice i was blinking up at a ceiling id seen before but couldnt quite place i was not in the room that i remembered last this room was painted an offwhite and there were pipes in the ceiling pipes that should have meant something but i was still a little fuzzy around the edges she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience i knew who it was before he stepped beside the bed requiem i smiled up at him and reached out to him with my right hand the other one was full of needles reaching for him made my stomach ache a little but not that bad it made me wonder how long id been out or what drugs were coming through the iv tube requiem took my hand in his and bent over it to lay a kiss on the back i was happy to see him hell i was happy to see anyone i dont know the quote i said the words of a worthless friar he said sorry still a little fuzzy i said he held my hand underneath his cloak against his chest his blue blue eyes glittered in the overhead fluorescents perhaps this will help a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story i finished with him of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo he laughed then and it transformed his face from a thing of cold beauty to something livable lovable more touchable you should laugh more often it becomes you i said the laughter leeched away as if the two reddish tears that slid down the white perfection of his cheeks stole his joy away as they fell down his face by the time the tears melted into the dark line of his beard his face had its usual melancholy handsomeness id been happy to take his hand happy to touch someone i cared for but there was something in the weight of that oceanblueandgreen gaze that made me take my hand back i had other lovers who would look at me that way but the look in his eyes was one that requiem had not earned or that our relationship didnt deserve he was requiem he wasnt a light comedic sort of person no he was definitely a lover of tragedies wheres jeanclaude did you expect him to wait by your bedside maybe he and asher are busy elsewhere together i was left to tend you while they had more important things to do i stared at him was it on purpose was he trying to make me doubt them id nearly died and was still hooked up to tubes fuck it id ask are you implying that theyre having sex together somewhere and that that is more important to them than me he looked down i think he was trying to be coy they are off together and they left me to tend you i think the situation speaks for itself you really shouldnt try to play coy requiem youre not good at it he gave me the full weight of those blue blue eyes with that swimming shadow of green around the iris eyes you could sink into and swim away in or be drowned in i actually looked down rather than meet his gaze normally he wasnt a problem but i was hurt weak and i didnt like his mood my evening star you are thinking too hard let us rejoice that you live that we all live that gave me other questions to ask maybe since they werent about jeanclaude hed answer them then peter is all right his face went blank even that pressing need in his eyes fading away he is in a room nearby is he all right he will heal i dont like how youre saying that requiem i heard the door open as a male voice said god you are a gloomy bastard graham strode into the room i watched him for signs that the harlequin were messing with his mind signs of that panicked false addiction he was his usual smiling self okay his usual self when he wasnt feeling grumpy about me not fucking him are you wearing a cross i asked he drew a chain out of his shirt and on the end of it was a tiny buddha i stared at it youre a buddhist yep you do violence you cant be a buddhist i said so im a bad buddhist but it was still the way i was raised and i do believe in the chubby little guy will it work if youre not following the tenets of the faith it represents i asked i could ask you the same question anita did he have a point or not fine i just wouldnt have pegged you for a buddhist neither would my parents but when claudia told us to get a holy item i realized i didnt believe in the jewish carpenter never raised in that faith he shook the little buddha at me this i believe in i gave a small nod okay whatever works he grinned at me first peter will be fine but he heals humanslow how hurt is he about as hurt as you were but not healing as fast graham came to stand beside requiem he was still in the red shirt and dark pants but somehow it didnt bug me now graham would answer questions better than requiem he also seemed to be himself while the vampire was being weird even for him i started to ask how fast i was healing but i wanted to know about peter before i asked questions about me i felt amazingly well im going to ask this again and i want a straight answer how hurt is peter graham sighed he got a lot of stitcheslike thedoctorlostcount stitches hes going to be fine honest but hes going to have some manly scars shit i said tell her the rest requiem said i glared at graham yeah tell me the rest i was getting to it he flashed an unfriendly look at the vampire requiem gave a small nod almost a bow and moved back from the bed then get to it graham i said the doctors are offering him the chance for the new antilycanthropy therapy you mean the inoculation they offer no something brand new he said brand new as if he had a bad taste in his mouth how new st louis is one of only a handful of cities that are experimenting with it they cant experiment on an underage kid underage he made it a question i thought peter was eighteen shit i thought apparently peter black was holding up as a secret identity yeah i mean shit fine if hes eighteen then he can give permission for it graham gave me a funny look as he said it as if he wanted to ask why i didnt believe peter was eighteen or maybe he didnt either give permission for what exactly i asked theyre offering him a vaccine like i said graham theyve been offering a vaccine against lycanthropy for years not the one that they used to offer in college not since that bad batch turned a lot of nice upperclass college students into monsters about ten years back he said it without referencing richardwho had been one of those college students i wondered if graham didnt know not my place to share so i let it go the vaccines a dead organism now not live and kicking i said did you get it he asked i had to smile no most people wont volunteer for it he said yeah theres a bill wandering around washington dc right now to force inoculation against lycanthropy on teenagers they claim its safe now yeah they claim grahams face said how much he believed in the claim i shook my head moved a little too much in the bed and found that my stomach gave a twinge however healed i was it wasnt perfect yet i took in a deep breath let it out and forced myself not to move around so much there that was better but peter has already been attacked the inoculation is only effective before an attack they want to give him a live shot what i said and it was almost a yell yeah graham said but that will give him whatever lycanthropy is in the shot not if hes already got tiger lycanthropy graham said what apparently they had some people who were attacked by more than one beast in a single night the two different strains canceled each other out they came up clean and completely human but its not dead certain that hell get tiger lycanthropy i said no most of the feline strains are harder to catch than canine you cant even reliably test for catbased lycanthropy for at least seventytwo hours if they give him this shot and hes not going to be a tiger then he will be whatever the shot is i said and therein lies the problem graham said therein requiem said his voice softly mocking graham flashed him another unfriendly look i try to improve my vocabulary and you make fun of me what kind of encouragement is that requiem gave a full bow graceful with one hand sweeping outward that hand always seemed to cry out for a hat with a plume as if the gesture was only half finished without the right clothing he stood i beg pardon graham for you are quite right i do wish to encourage you in your improvements it was churlish of me and i apologize why is it that when you apologize you never seem to mean it graham asked back to the main problem boys i said whats happening with peter ted forrester federal marshalhe said it the way youd say superman man of steelis with him he seems to be helping him choose but he may be fine and the shot will guarantee the very thing they dont want to happen graham shrugged like i said its a new thing its an experimental thing i said he nodded that too what kind of lycanthropy is in the shot i asked they dont want to say but its probably one of the catbased lycanthropies and it wont be tiger lets hope not i said they make vaccines in big batches are they positive what kind of kitty theyve got in the shot graham looked at me as if that hadnt occurred to him you arent saying that theyd give him tiger twice i mean that wouldnt work at all that would guarantee that hed be tiger yeah has anyone asked them what flavor of kitty it is the look on grahams face said no one had asked in his hearing i looked at requiem i have been in attendance upon your bedside i have not seen the boy graham go ask and make sure ted knows i wanted to know graham actually didnt argue he just nodded and went for the door good because i knew where i was now i was in the basement of what used to be a hospital but the lower levels had been turned into a place where you kept suspected vampire corpses if you didnt think youd get to them before nightfall and where you held lycanthrope victims or injured shapeshifters themselves until they were well enough to leave or you could force them into one of the government prisonsoh safe houses the aclu was about to be heard by the supreme court on just how many constitutional rights the safe houses violated being admitted was voluntaryif you were eighteen or over anyway they told shapeshifters that theyd let them out once they learned to control their beast but somehow people went in and never came out most hospitals had an isolation ward for shapeshifters and vampires who got injured but this was the place they sent you if they were truly worried how the hell did we end up here requiem i said he came to the side of the bed his hooded cloak back to being tight around him only a pale glimpse of face was visible yes my evening star why does that sound more and more sarcastic when you say it he blinked so that those vivid blue eyes were shielded for a moment i will endeavor to say it as i mean it my evening star this time it was soft and romantic i didnt like that either but i didnt say so out loud id complain later when i figured out how to get any use out of it i asked you once where jeanclaude is now ill ask again where is he and whats he doing can you not sense him i thought about it and shook my head no i cant a spurt of fear ran through me like fine champagne it must have shown on my face because requiem touched my arm he is well but he is shielding mightily to keep the harlequin from reading him or you or the wolf king so there were more than just the two of them in town i said why would you assume only two its all i saw i said saw how again i didnt like the question and how he asked it does it matter perhaps not but yes jeanclaude has detected more than two in your fair city im impressed that jeanclaude can keep them out of us all i said requiems hand tightened on my arm as are we all he took his hand back and it vanished under the black cloak again tell me what ive missed of the vampire end of things wait how long have i been out it is only the night of the day you were injured you have been out as you put it for only a few hours a few hours not days i asked no i touched my stomach and it didnt hurt the way it should have i started to raise the hospital gown i was wearing i hesitated glancing at the man he was my lover but there was always something about requiem that made me less than perfectly comfortable around him micah nathaniel jeanclaude asher even jason i would have simply looked at the wound richard maybe i wouldnt have but requiem made me hesitate for different reasons look at your wound anita i will not ravish you from the sight of your nakedness he sounded like id insulted him since he was an old vampire that i could hear that much emotion in his voice meant one of two things either he allowed me to hear the emotion or he was so upset he couldnt control himself i compromised i raised the gown and kept the sheet over my lower extremities i am not an animal anita i can bear your nakedness without being affected the anger and disdain were so thick in his voice that i knew it was lack of control i never doubt your control requiem but theres no way to be nude in front of you and have it be casual i need to just look at my body and see whats wrong and right with the wound i dont want to make a big deal out of it or a romantic deal out of it would it not be a big deal if jeanclaude were here in my stead jeanclaude would concentrate on business and worry about the romance later is he that cold hes that practical i said i like that in a man i know you do not like me my evening star again the emotion was thick on the ground i did the only thing i could i ignored him once i saw my stomach it wasnt that hard to ignore him i had pinkish scars where shed clawed me open it was weeks worth of healing i ran my hands over the skin and it felt smoother almost as if the shininess of it could be a texture how many hours i asked it is now nine oclock in the evening ten hours i said it soft like i didnt believe it about that yes all this healing in ten hours it would seem so he said there was still a thread of anger to his voice but it was less how should i quote to you there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy or should i simply say i do not know the i dont know would be fine but at least i know youre quoting from hamlet now tell me whats been happening while i slept he glided to the bedside a slight smile curving his lips your friends slew a member of the harlequin while she slept though the tall one olaf or otto complained that she was dead when they arrived he wanted her to be squirming when they cut her up i shivered and put my gown back in place i tried to ignore the whole creepy olaf thing and concentrate on business there should have been two members dead you admit it he said you admit that you sent them to slay members of the harlequin admit it hell yes jeanclaude is locked in arguments with the council even now on whether the harlequin are within their rights to slay us all for what you have done if they dont give a black mask first but they kill not in selfdefense then its a death sentence for them who told you that i debated on whether to admit it but finally shrugged and said belle morte when has our beautiful death spoken to you she came to me in a vision when when the three of us were dying she helped feed me enough energy to come back and keep us all alive why would she help jeanclaude if it had been jeanclaude id have told the truth all of it but it wasnt requiem was well being his usual weird self i wasnt certain that belle would want her reasoning blabbed around why does belle do anything you are lying she told you her reason great he knew i was lying the shapeshifters say that i dont smell like im lying anymore my respiration rate doesnt even change i am not smelling or listening to your body anita i simply feel the lie why do you not tell me the truth ill tell jeanclaude and if he says its okay to tell everyone then i will so you will keep secrets from me you know requiem we have a lot of bad shit happening and you seem more interested in your own hurt feelings than in the lifeanddeath stuff he nodded i feel raw tonight undone i have felt that way since earlier in jeanclaudes office we were being messed with then i said but there is no holy object that i can wear my evening star no refuge that i can take from what the harlequin have done to me are they messing with you now no but they showed me certain truths about myself and i cannot seem to unknow what i have learned you dont sound like yourself requiem do i not he said and again there was too much emotion in his voice i wanted graham back here or someone back here requiem thought they werent messing with his head but i was betting the harlequin were playing scrabble with his thoughts right now he undid his cloak and flung it backward onto the floor id seen him do a similar gesture on stage at guilty pleasures near the end of his strip act he was fully clothed in elegant gray dress slacks and a shirt that was a clear cornflower blue that turned his eyes as blue as blue could be id looked into a lot of blue eyes but none quite the color of his it was a startling blue a color that had made belle morte try to collect him and add him to her collection of blueeyed lovers he flung his long straight black hair behind his shoulders i would not have left your side for any business my star if you would but love me as i love you nothing would be more important to me than you i called graham it wasnt a yell but it was close to one was i afraid a little maybe i could use necromancy to knock the harlequin out of requiem but last time i tried i nearly got myself killed id like to heal from one attack before i got hurt againselfish but there you go the door opened but it wasnt graham it wasnt even edward it was dolph lieutenant rudolph storr head of the regional preternatural investigation team and paranoid hater of all things monster shit chapter thirtyfive requiem didnt even turn around he just said leave us but he said it in that voice that powerridden voice that some vamps have that voice that was supposed to bespell and bemuse i saw the flare of dolphs cross around his neck it made a halo around requiems body i could see dolph over requiems head because he had eight inches on the sixfoottall vampire i didnt like the look on dolphs face hes my friend dolph but the bad guys have him bespelled my voice held more fear now than it had when id called for graham the look on dolphs face made me afraid one vampire cant bespell another dolph said i saw his arms move and knew before he moved around the vampires body that hed drawn his gun he moved so that if he had to shoot he wouldnt risk me his cross stayed at a steady white light not too brightafter all the vampire who was being bad wasnt actually in the room these vampires can i swear to you dolph requiem is being controlled by one of the bad guys is that what is happening to me requiem asked and he looked confused hes a vampire anita he is a bad guy theyre brainwashing you requiem i said and reached out to him dont touch him dolph said his gun up and pointed requiems hand closed over mine his skin was cool to the touch as if he hadnt fed but he had fed id felt his power if you shoot him now like this its murder dolph he hasnt done anything wrong i drew a breath of my own power my necromancy and tried to look at requiem gently if i had a repeat of being thrown across the room by metaphysics i was afraid dolph would blame requiem and shoot him youre the one who taught me that if my cross glows theyre fucking with me they are fucking with you and with requiem theyre messing with you both im still wearing a cross anita my mind is my own you taught me that too or did you forget everything about monster hunting when you started fucking them i was too scared to be insulted listen to yourself dolph please they are messing with your thoughts i traced my power over requiem as delicate a brush of power as id ever attempted i felt the power and i knew the taste of it it was mercia if we all survived id ask edward how he managed to miss her but it was like chasing a ghost her power withdrew before me she just gave him up and left maybe she didnt want to risk another metaphysical knockout requiem swayed grabbing the rail and my hand to keep from falling get away from her now dolph said the bad vamp is gone dolph i said requiem said give me but a moment and i will do as you ask officer i am unwell he kept his face averted from the cross that was still glowing soft and steady it wasnt glowing because of requiem edward came slowly through the door olaf loomed behind him hey lieutenant whats going on this vamp is trying to mindfuck me dolphs voice was low and even with a thread of anger to it like a fuse waiting to be lit he was holding a twohanded shooting stance the gun looked strangely small in his hands anita edward called requiem is fine now the bad vamps were messing with him but its over lieutenant storr we dont have a warrant of execution on this vampire kill him now and its murder edwards voice was his goodolboy best apologetic somehow implying by tone that he thought it was a shame too that they couldnt just kill all the vampires but shucks it just didnt work that way edward and olaf eased into the room edward hadnt gone for a weapon there was already one too many guns in this room i had an idea dolph this vampire messed with me while i wore a cross she makes your feelings stronger you hate vampires and shes feeding that feeling requiem is jealous of jeanclaude and she was feeding that theres nothing wrong with me dolph said youre about to shoot an unarmed civilian edward said in his goodolboy voice is that a good thing lieutenant or a bad thing dolph frowned and the tip of the gun wavered hes not a civilian well now edward said i agree with you but legally hes a citizen with rights you kill him and youre up on charges if youre going to go down for killing one of them why not make it one thats actually breaking the law lose your badge saving some innocent human from a bloodsucker about to munch on em thatd be satisfyin edwards downhome accent was growing thicker as he talked he was also easing deeper into the room he waved olaf to stay near the door then crept closer to dolph dolph didnt seem to notice he just stood there frowning as if he were listening to things i couldnt hear his cross kept up a steady white light he shook his head as if trying to chase off some buzzing thing his gun pointed at the floor and he looked up the cross faded but it had never had the light it should have for such an attack it was almost as if whatever mercias powers were they somehow didnt set off holy objects as much as they should have dolph looked first at edward im okay now marshal forrester edward with teds smiling face said if you dont mind lieutenant id feel better if you came out of the room dolph nodded then put the safety on his gun and handed it butt first to edward edward let his face show surprise i didnt try to hide the shock i felt no cop gives up his gun voluntarily least of all dolph edward took the gun you still not feelin okay lieutenant storr im okay at the moment but if this vampire can get past my cross once it can do it again i almost shot him he jerked a thumb in requiems direction i want to talk to marshal blake alone edward gave him all the doubt on his face and said im not so sure thats a good idea lieutenant dolph looked at me we need to talk not alone requiem said dolph didnt even look at him but kept those dark angry eyes on me anita dolph this bad vamp wants me dead even unarmed you outmuscle me id rather we had company for the talk he pointed a finger at requiem not him fine but someone he looked at edward you seem to feel like i do about them theyre not my favorite thing edward said and the good ol boy was starting to fray around the edges fine you stay he looked at olaf and the people in the hallway beyond just the marshals edward said something low to olaf who nodded he started to close the door dolph said no the vampire leaves too his names requiem i said requiem squeezed my hand and gave me one of his rare smiles i take no offense my evening star he hates what i am many people do he raised my hand and gave it a kiss then picked up his cloak from the floor and moved toward the door he stopped closer to the door and edward away from dolph but turned to the big man darkling i listen and for many a time i have been half in love with easeful death calld him soft names in many a mused rhyme are you threatening me dolph asked in a voice gone cold not you i said i dont think he was threatening you then what did he mean by that hes quoting keats ode to a nightingale i think i said requiem looked back at me and nodded making it almost a bow he kept looking at me and there was too much intensity in that gaze i met it but it took effort i dont care what hes quoting anita i want to know what he meant by it what it means i said meeting requiems blue blue gaze at a guess is that hes halfwishing youd pulled the trigger requiem bowed then a fullout sweeping movement using his cloak as part of the theatre of it it was a lovely graceful show of body hair and all of him but it made my throat tight and my stomach jump my stomach didnt like that and i winced requiem put his cloak on drawing the hood around his face he gave me the full force of that handsome face those eyes and said i saw pale kings and princes too pale warriors deathpale were they all they cried la belle dame sans merci hath thee in thrall dolph looked at me then then back at the vampire requiem glided out the door all black cloak and melancholy dolph looked back at me i dont think he likes you very much i dont think thats the problem i said he wants to pick out curtains edward said from where he was slouched beside the door he only slouched when he was pretending to be ted forrester something like that i said you fucking him dolph asked i gave him the look the question deserved that is none of your damn business thats a yes he said and his face was taking on that look that disapproving look i glared at him though frankly its hard to glare in a hospital bed hooked up to tubes it always makes you feel so vulnerable hard to be tough when youre feeling weak i said what i meant dolph you only get defensive when the answers yes he said the disapproving look was sliding into his angry look my answers always defensive when someone asks me if im fucking someone try asking if im dating him or hell even if hes my lover try being polite about it its still none of your business but i might might answer the question if you werent ugly about it he took in a lot of air which with his chest was a whole lot and let it out very slowly olaf was taller but dolph was bigger beefier built like an oldstyle wrestler before they all went to heavy bodybuilding he actually closed his eyes and took another breath he let that out and nodded youre right you are right glad to hear it i said are you dating him im seeing him yes what do you do on dates with a vampire it seemed to be a real question or maybe he was just trying to make up for being pissy pretty much what you do on a date with any guy except the hickeys are really spectacular it took him a second and then he stared at me he tried to frown then laughed and shook his head i hate that you date the monsters i hate that you are fucking them i think it compromises you anita i think it makes you have to choose where your loyalties lie and i dont think us mere humans always win the coin toss i nodded and found that it didnt hurt my stomach to do it had i healed more in the little bit wed been talking im sorry thats how you feel you arent going to deny it im not going to react all angry and defensive youre being reasonable about your feelings so ill be reasonable back i dont shortchange the humans dolph i do a lot to make sure that the citizens of our fair city stay upright and mobile the living and the dead the furry and the notsofurry i hear youre still dating that junior high teacher richard zeeman yeah i said it carefully trying not to act tense about it to my knowledge the police didnt know richard was a werewolf was his secret identity about to be revealed i rubbed my hand over my stomach to give my eyes somewhere else to look and hoped that any tension in my body would be attributed to the wounds hoped i asked you once if you were dating any humans and you said no i fought not to look too relaxed or too tense this was richards world i was playing with you probably asked during one of our many breakups were pretty on and off why why all the questions about my love life we have a dangerous vampire out there to catch to kill he said i nodded to kill so why all the questions about who im dating why dont you want to answer questions about mr zeeman we were on dangerous ground dolph hated the monsters all monsters his son was engaged to a vampire and she was trying to talk the son into joining her as undead it had made dolphs attitude toward the preternatural citizens go from cynical and dark to downright dangerous did he know about richard or suspect truthfully richard was who i thought id spend my life with and the fact that we seem to be headed for the big breakup still hurts okay he gave me cop eyes as if he were tasting the truth and weighing the lie what changed i thought about how to answer that the first time wed broken up had been after i saw richard eat someone it had been a bad guy but still a girls got to have standards or thats what i thought at the time if i had it to do over again would i have made a different choice maybe dolph was beside the bed now anita what changed me i said softly i changed we broke up and i started dating jeanclaude i went back and forth between them for a while and finally richard just couldnt take me not deciding so he decided for us for me if i couldnt choose hed take away one of my choices he didnt want to share you no but hes dating you again now some i so did not like where this conversation was going edward must not have liked it either because he interrupted not that this isnt fascinating lieutenant but we still have a very powerful vamp out there shes killed or helped kill at least two women that we know of one bev leveto and margaret ross i think he used their names to make them more real to dolph names have a way of doing that shouldnt we be concentrating on catching the bad vampire instead of quizzing the marshal here about her dates he said it all with a smile and a face full of downhome charm i would never be the actor that edward was but damn there were moments when i wished i could be how did you manage not to catch both of the vampires in the hotel room i asked maybe if we concentrated on crimestopping dolph would let the other topic go edward did his aw shucks look like he was embarrassed the reaction wasnt his but maybe the emotion was it was incredibly rare for edward to miss a target he came to stand by the head of the bed one so i could see him around dolphs broad build but two i think so dolph wouldnt be able to scrutinize my reactions so damn closely when we got to the hotel room there was only one vampire in the room she was dead when we got there but we took her head and heart just like were supposed to i know that dead doesnt always mean dead for these guys that must have been nivia how did you know her name dolph asked i opened my mouth closed it and said an informant who anita he said i shook my head dont ask and i wont have to lie to you you have someone who knows more about these murderers and you wont bring them in so we can all question them you and just you get to do the interrogation it wasnt like that youre good at your job anita but youre not a better cop than i am or zerbrowski is i never said i was but you exclude us you keep secrets from us yeah just like you keep them from me i know you dont call me in all the time anymore you dont trust me do you trust me he asked i trust you dolph but i dont trust the hate in you i dont hate you anita no but you hate some of the people i love and that makes it hard dolph ive never hurt any of your boyfriends no but you hate them hate them for just being what they are who they are youre like an oldtime racist dolph your hate blinds you he looked down took another deep breath ive been to the company shrink im trying to come to an understanding withhe looked at edward who looked innocently back at him your family i finished for him so he wouldnt have to go into details he nodded im glad dolph really lucilles beeni shrugged what was i supposed to say that his wife lucille had been frantic afraid for him and of him his rages had trashed a room or two of their house much like hed done to an interrogation room with me in it once hed manhandled me at a crime scene dolph was close to losing his badge if he didnt get a grip she said youve been helpful about it her i nodded if edward hadnt been in the room id have said your sons fiancée im glad i could help i will never be okay with you dating the monsters thats fine as long as you dont let it rain all over police business fine police business he glanced at edward then reached into his suit coat and got out his notebook what killed the vampire in the hotel room when her animal to call died the master didnt survive it it happens like that sometimes kill one and they all die the police have killed wereanimals that were guarding vampire lairs and the master vampire didnt die most master vamps have an animal that they can control but the phrase an animal to call means its the furry equivalent of a human servant a human thats helping a vampire because of mind tricks he made it a question i thought that once too but a human servant is more than that its a human with a preternatural connection a mystical connection with the vampire sometimes the vampire survives the death of its servant but the servant usually doesnt survive the death of the vampire ive also seen the body survive but the human servant driven crazy by the masters death but this weretiger had healing abilities that it shouldnt have had it was almost like it had the best of both worlds on healing the lycanthropy healing and the rotting vampires ability to laugh off bullets even silver i thought you just woke up dolph said i did how did you know she rotted i didnt but her animal healed like a rotting vampire so i assumed she was one of them but even if she was her animal to call should not have had that close a tie with the vampires powers its unusual very unusual as if the tie between master and servant was closer even than normal she started to rot as soon as we took her head edward said ol otto must have been disappointed i said he was but at least they dont smell like they look why is that edward asked not complaining mind you but why dont they smell like a rotting corpse i dont know i think maybe because they arent really rotting its like they the vampires went to a certain stage of rotting then stopped the smell is from decomposition if the vampire isnt actually rotting then no decomp no smell i shrugged truthfully thats just theory i dont know for sure i dont think ive seen more than a handful of them it doesnt seem to be a common type of vamp at least not in this country theyre all rotting corpses anita dolph said no i said and met his eyes just fine no they arent most vampires if you ever see them rotting like that looking like that they are well and truly dead but the rotting ones can actually rot around you then sort of heal themselves they can go from looking like the walking dead to looking normal normal dolph said and made a sound normal as they started i said i turned to edward do we know where the other vamp went dolph answered we know that a white male late twenties early thirties brown hair cut short jeans jean jacket carried a large duffel bag out to his car and drove away while two uniforms watched they watched i said civilians who saw the incident said the man told the officersdolph flipped back through his notebook then readyoure going to let me go to my car arent you the policemen replied yes we are shit he pulled an obiwan i said what edward and dolph said together you know from star wars these are not the droids youre looking for edward grinned yeah while otto and i were taking the other vampire apart the man pulled an obiwan he had to do it to several officers or some version of it dolph said by the time he drove off there were police all over that hotel i thought daylight wasnt good for vamps i think the vampire was in the duffel bag my guess and its only a guess is that as the weretiger shared her masters healing ability so the human servant of this other one shared her mind powers ive never heard of anything like it but it makes sense if i think of another theory that makes more sense ill let you know how did you know they would be at the hotel anita dolph asked i told you an informant was the informant a vampire no i said no he said no i said was the informant human im not giving you the name so it doesnt matter does it how many vampires are involved with these murders two that im sure of how close is your tie to your master anita what i just stared at him he looked at me and there was no anger in his eyes just a demand he repeated the question my pulse was in my throat and i couldnt help it my voice was almost normal when i said are we going to catch these bastards or are you going to go back to obsessing on how up close and personal i am with the vampires im sorry that ive disappointed you dolph im sorry that you disapprove of my personal life but we have dead on the ground we have injured people can we please please concentrate on that instead of your obsession with my love life he blinked slow over those cool cop eyes fine how did peter black get injured and who exactly is he i looked at edward because i had no idea what story hed come up with i doubted the truth the whole truth had been involved now lieutenant edward said i told you all this i want to hear anitas version my version like you know its a version and not the truth i said i dont think youve told me the whole truth about anything since you started dating that bloodsucking son of a bitch politically that bloodsucking son of a bitch is the master of the city is he your master anita what are you the human servant of the master of this city id outed myself once in front of detective smith id done it to save the life of a vampire good samaritan apparently smith hadnt ratted me out i owed him a beer i needed a moment to think how to answer dolph edward gave me that moment you know lieutenant your persistent interest in marshal blakes personal life is a little disturbing especially as it seems to be distracting you from the investigation and capture of a double murderer dolph ignored him and kept those cool cop eyes on me if id been sure how the federal marshal program would have handled my being jeanclaudes human servant i might have just said yes but i wasnt sure so i had to lie or distract him you know dolph ive tried to be professional here but youve asked me if ive fucked someone youve persistently asked personal and sexual questions did you miss the day they covered sexual harassment you are you really belong to him dont you i dont belong to anyone dolph im so my own woman that im chasing some of them away requiem wants to own me thats the vampire who just left if you didnt catch his name i dont want to be owned not by anybody jeanclaude understands that better than any human i ever dated maybe thats what your son sees in his fiancée dolph maybe she understands him in ways you never will that last was mean and meant to be but we had to end this conversation you leave my family out of this his voice was low and careful i will if you will your obsession with vampires and my personal life started about the time your son got engaged to a vampire its not my fault i didnt introduce them i didnt even know hed done it until you told me the master of the city knew he just didnt tell you dolph said is that what youve been thinking that jeanclaude somehow sicced a vampire on your son so shed seduce him he gave me a look youre not the only vampire hunter in this country now anita youre not even the only one with a badge they tell me that the master of the city has absolute authority that no local vamp does anything without permission if only that were true but your sons fiancée belongs to the church of eternal life shes malcolms problem right now not jeanclaudes the church of eternal life is its own little universe in vampireland frankly the other vamps are a little puzzled on how to deal with the church when its members do stupid stuff like dating a policemans son why was it stupid because most police still hate the vampires its just better policy to leave the cops alone if you can none of jeanclaudes vampires have gone near a police person of any kind for anything hes gone near you dolph said i wasnt officially a cop when we started dating no you were a vampire executioner he shouldnt have come near you and you should have known better than to go near him who i date is not your business dolph it is if it affects how you do your job i do my job better because im up close and personal with the monsters i struggled to sit up a little tired of him looming over me my stomach was tight but it didnt hurt you count on me knowing more about the monsters hell every cop that comes near me for help counts on me knowing more about the monsters than they do how the hell do you think i found all that out by keeping them at arms length and hating them the way you do they dont like talking to people who treat them like shit they dont volunteer information to people they know hate them if you want someones help you have to reach out to them how many have you reached out to anita such innocent words but he made it sound ugly enough so i could help you every time you called he closed his eyes then balled his fist around his notebook until something in it ripped if id left you where i found you raising the dead jeanclaude would never have met you you went into his club on police business the first time on my business he opened his eyes and there was such pain in them i reached out to touch his arm but he moved back out of reach we did our jobs dolph when you look in the mirror is that enough anita at the end of the day is that enough that we do our jobs sometimes sometimes not are you a lycanthrope no i said your blood work says different my blood work is puzzling the hell out of the lab and itll puzzle the hell out of any lab you send it to you know youre carrying lycanthropy yeah im carrying four different kinds of lycanthropy you knew i found out when i ended up in the hospital in philadelphia after that zombie case with the fbi you didnt mention it to anyone here you hated me for dating shapeshifters if you found out i was carrying iti spread my handsi couldnt depend on how youd react he nodded youre right you were right not to tell me but you could have told zerbrowski or someone it doesnt affect my job dolph ive got a disease that im mostly asymptomatic for its no ones business unless it impacts the job in my head i wondered what would happen if the almostbeasts that i carried inside me got out of control on a case that would be bad i almost had the ardeur under control and now i had something else that might keep me from being able to do my police work anita did you hear what i said im sorry no i didnt i said how do you know it doesnt affect the job how do you know that your ties to the monsters dont color your choices im tired dolph im tired and i need to rest why hadnt i thought of that before i was in a hospital i could have just cried hurt damn i was slow tonight he uncrumpled his notebook tried to smooth it out as best he could he tried to fit it back in his suit pocket but hed damaged it so bad it wouldnt fit he finally just took it in his hand ill want to talk to you when youve rested there comes a point anita when you have enough secrets from your friends that they begin to wonder where your loyalties lie get out dolph just go but he gets to stay and he pointed at edward he hasnt insulted me hes been nothing but professional i guess i deserve that he seemed about to say something else he held his hand out edward hesitated then gave dolph back his gun dolph just left closing the door softly behind him edward holstered his gun and we waited a few seconds then looked at each other you are not going to be able to avoid answering him for very long anita i know its not just you thats going to be in trouble i nodded richard he was hinting if he knew hed do more than hint lieutenant storr isnt stupid i never thought he was his hatred makes him stupid in some ways but it also makes him very determined if that determination gets turned on you and your friends well i know edward i know what are you going to do there isnt a law on the books that says i cant date the monsters legally it would be like telling a federal agent he cant date someone whos not white it would be a public relations nightmare but the human servant bit thats an area they havent covered in the federal regulations youve checked i asked before i took the badge yeah i read up nothing says you cant be jeanclaudes human servant and a federal marshal because the laws havent caught up to themselves it doesnt matter anita it still means even if dolph finds out youre covered im covered legally but there are other ways to be gotten rid of if cops want you gone like not calling you in on cases dolphs already doing that frankly i think they see you sleeping with the enemy as being just as bad as any metaphysical stuff or worse i thought about it they dont really understand the metaphysics but they understand fucking your lieutenant seems almost as worried that youre sleeping around as who youre sleeping around with a lot of police are prudes at heart i think lieutenant storr would almost be as disappointed with you if you were just sleeping around with humans i think he sees himself as sort of a surrogate father figure how do you see him my boss sort of once i thought he was my friend youre sitting updoes it hurt i thought about it letting myself feel my body sort of searching it for pain i took a deep breath all the way down to my stomach its tight but not painful it has that tight feeling that it gets if you dont stretch the scar tissue out you know i know you dont have any scars as bad as mine do you only donna knows he smiled how is peter really brave i meant oh hell edward is he going to get the injection or not still debating you have to tell donna shed take the injection legally its her decision one of the reasons we kept him peter black was so he could make the decision ive been talking to your furry friends tiger lycanthropy is one of the hardertocatch ones its also one of the few that runs in families and can be inherited as well as caught thats actually news to me i said apparently the tigers keep it a close family secret ive been talking to the only other weretiger in town christine i said he nodded did you know she ran to a town with no tigers to escape being forced to marry into a clan of weretigers i didnt knowwait i remember claudia saying that soledad had come to st louis to probably escape an arranged marriage something about the tigers liking to keep it in the family that was her cover story how good was her cover it was good ive seen her documents they look real they were excellent forgeries and i know what im talking about ill just bet you do i said he gave me a look the real edward began to peek out ted forrester melting from the eyes outward it was always his eyes that reverted back to real first sort of the way most lycanthropes shifted interestingly enough thanks for sending graham when you did the shot they had was tiger its their standard because its so rare theyre sending for a different batch not tiger this time will he take the shot if you were him what would you do i thought about it im not the one to ask edward ive been cut up a lot and ive taken my chances so far so good but the shot didnt exist last time would you have taken it i wont make this decision for you or for peter hes not my kid the other shapeshifters make weretigers sound like the last thing youd want to be how so like i said they try to force you to marry into the clan to keep everyone related theyd find peter and theyd offer him girls try to lure him in if he wouldnt be lured theyve been known to abduct illegal i said most of them homeschool their kids very isolationist i said peter doesnt like the sound of being a weretiger hes not very big on other people telling him what to do hes sixteen i said no sixteenyearold likes to be bossed around i dont think hes going to grow out of it he takes orders from you and from claudia he takes them from people he respects but you have to earn it i wouldnt let some clan of weretigers take him anita they cant force you or peter christine has lived in st louis for years and never been bothered that im aware of apparently therere only four clans of tigers in the united states they all keep to themselves their culture is also divided about purebloods inherited lycanthropy and attacks being given tiger lycanthropy is seen as a reward for a job well done they think its a sin to give it to someone you dont value sounds sort of vampirelike i said they feel the same way about human servants and animals to call but ive seen my share of both that were forced and didnt go willingly were you willing he asked and it was all edward in those eyes now i sighed if i say no are you going to do something stupid no you love him i see it i dont understand it but i see it i dont get you and donna either i know i wasnt willing at first but somehow it just happened where we are now wasnt forced on me rumor has it that youre the power behind the throne the one pulling his strings dont believe every rumor you hear if i believed them all id be too afraid to be alone with you i stared at him trying to read that face that unreadable face do i want to know what people are saying about me behind my back no he said i nodded fine get a doctor see if i can get up and mobile its been ten hours anita you cant be healed lets find out i said if you get out of bed this quick some of those rumors are going to get confirmed are the police talking to you about me not everyone knows that were friends okay what rumors that youre a shapeshifter some of my best friends are shapeshifters i said meaning meaning get a doctor im not going to stay in bed just to keep people from thinking what they already think truthfully ive had actual shapeshifters think im one of them just from the way my energy feels would it hurt you to stay in bed why do you care if people think im a shapeshifter i care because if peter finds out youre already out of bed hell feel weak hell want to be all macho too if the doctor tells me im too sick to move ill stay in bed im not being macho no but peter has similar injuries to yours and he knows how he feels his wounds arent healing faster than normal i asked they dont seem to be why its not a certainty but often if a victim is going to get lycanthropy wounds heal more than humanfast always he asked no but sometimes critical wounds that would cause death will heal faster smaller wounds sometimes heal faster sometimes not what do i tell peter about the injection i shook my head i cant make that call i wont make that call i looked at him studied a face that didnt have the cheerfulness of ted or the coldness of edward there was real anguish there guilt maybe since i thought hed been foolish to bring peter into this mess i couldnt help him peter hadnt been ready for this much action the shame of it was that in a few years he might have been youre thinking i was wrong to bring him that he wasnt ready hey i told you that when i saw him you dont have to read my mind edward ill usually tell you what i think okay what do you think well shit i said and sighed fine fine of course you shouldnt have brought him i was impressed with him in the middle of the fight he held his ground he remembered his training in a few years if he wants to follow in his fathers footsteps then fine but he needs a few more years of practice and training he needs a little seasoning before you throw him to the wolves again edward nodded i was weak ive never been weak before anita donna becca and peter they make me weak they make me back down they make me flinch they dont make you do anything edward your reaction to them your feelings for them has changed you im not sure i like the change i sighed again i know the feeling i let you down i didnt mean that i lay back down on the bed sitting up didnt hurt but it didnt exactly feel good either what i meant was that loving people changes you its changed me too im softer in some ways harder in others i havent compromised myself as much as you have what do you mean by that im not trying to live with someone who doesnt know who and what i am im not driving an eightyearold to ballet class my schedules easier to move around than donnas i know she runs her own metaphysical store i remember but thats not the point edward the point is that im not trying to live a normal life im not even trying to pretend that what i do and what i am is normal if you had kids youd have to try i nodded the pregnancy scare last month made me have to look at that i dont see myself ever getting pregnant on purpose if it happens accidentally well deal but my life doesnt work with babies youre saying mine doesnt either he sounded sad and i hadnt expected that no i mean i dont know it doesnt work for me because im the girl im the one pregnant and god forbid nursing sheer biology makes it harder for me to combine gunplay and kids i cant marry donna can i the voice in my head screamed nooo you cant but out loud i said again i cant answer that hell edward i have enough trouble with my own life i cant run yours he gave me a look it was an edward look but there was something in the eyes something that wasnt cold no it was definitely warm hot even i watched the force of personality that could kill gather in his eyes but what was it gathering for edward i said softly dont do anything right now that youll regret later we kill the vampire that caused this he said well of course i said i meant dont make any hasty decisions about donna and the kids i dont know much but i do know that if peter does turn furry theyll need you more than ever if he does turn furry can i bring him up here to talk to your friends yes of course he nodded he looked at me his eyes softening a little i know you think i should leave donna and the kids youve always thought it was a bad idea maybe but you love them and they love you loves hard to come by edward you should never throw it away just because its a bad idea he laughed that made no sense at all im trying here what i meant to say was that you all love each other if you can just make peter stay home long enough to finish his training i think in a few years if he still wants to he can join the family business but he isnt ready now put your foot down and explain it like that and make it stick he nodded you think he can do it what we do i think so if this little adventure didnt take all the fun out of it for him he nodded again ill go find a doctor he walked out without a backward glance i lay in the bed listening to the sudden whispering silence of the room i prayed that peter wouldnt be a lycanthrope i prayed that the council wouldnt let the harlequin declare war on us i prayed that wed all survive well i guess it was too late for cisco i hadnt known him that well but hed died defending me hed died at eighteen doing his job defending the people hed signed up to defend it was an honorable death a good death so why didnt that make me feel better did he have family was he somebodys little boy someones sweetheart who was crying right now for him or was there no one to mourn him were we his coworkers and friends all he had strangely that thought made me more sad than any of the thoughts that had come before chapter thirtysix there was a soft knock at the door edward wouldnt knock and if a doctor knocks its followed with an opening door who knocks in a hospital i asked who is it the answer came its truth a second voice called and wicked they were brothers and vampires and had only recently joined jeanclaudes group the first time id met them truth had nearly died trying to help me catch a bad guy theyd been warriors and mercenaries for centuries now they were ours jeanclaudes and mine wicked came through the door first in his palebrown designer suit tailored to the wide sweep of shoulder and the strain of muscles in his arms and legs he actually went to the gym and had added some bulk to the muscles theyd both started with his shirt was buttoned up tight with an elegant tie and a gold tie clip his blond hair was cut long enough to cover his ears but still had a few inches to go before it reached shoulder length he was cleanshaven so that the deep dimple in his chin showed he was handsome utterly masculine and utterly modern from his haircut to his shined shoes only the sword hilt peeking from behind one shoulder spoiled the modern effect truth followed at his brothers side as he usually did he had the same halfgrowth of dark beard hed had since i met him it wasnt a beard just as if when hed died he hadnt shaved in a while and hed never gotten around to changing it the almostbeard hid the clean perfect masculine face the dimple that they shared you had to stare at them sidebyside for a while to realize how terribly much alike they looked truths hair was shoulder length a dark nondescript brown that was almost black the hair wasnt exactly stringy but it was far from his brothers shining halo of hair he wore leather but it wasnt goth leather it was like fifteenthcentury battlehardened leather crossed with modern motorcycle leather his boots were knee high and they had a look about them that said they might be as old as he was but they fit they were comfortable and they were just his boots he liked them in the way that some men like that favorite chair that has molded to their bodies so what if they were a little patched and worn they were comfy truth had a sword at his back too i knew they both were carrying gunsone hidden under the beautiful suit jacket the other hidden under a leather jacket that had seen better days the brothers were always well armed requiem said he didnt trust himself around you so jeanclaude sent us wicked said he said it with a smile that filled his blue eyes with speculation why would requiem say that truth asked his eyes were the mirrors of his brothers but the expression in them was totally different truth was so sincere it almost hurt wicked always seemed to be laughing at me or at himself or the world in general the harlequin messed with his mind so he didnt trust himself to keep you safe truth said something like that i said there was another knock on the door but graham opened it and peeked through weve got company out here wicked and truth were suddenly on alert it was hard to explain but cops do it too one minute normal ordinary then suddenly they were on they were ready who i asked the lions rex i blinked at graham you mean joseph graham nodded whats that bastard doing here wicked asked i think thats my line i said wicked gave me a small halfbow sorry about that i said what does he want graham leaned the door closed and licked his lips i think he wants to beg your forgiveness or something like that i dont feel very forgiving i said i smoothed down the sheets on my hospital bed no i didnt feel very forgiving i know graham said but hes out here alone the lions left you and the vampires and our ulfric to die you dont owe them anything then why tell her hes outside wicked asked graham licked his lips again because if i didnt tell anita and she found out later hed come to see her shed be mad why would i be mad i asked because of what joseph thinks is about to happen to his lions his lions are no concern of mine anymore i said and i believed that down to the hard cold feeling in my heart graham nodded okay but dont say later that i didnt tell you because i did he moved away from the door so he could open it wait i said graham turned and looked at me hand on the door handle what do you mean whats about to happen to the lions its not our concern you said so truth said i looked at the tall vampire shook my head and then looked back to graham i feel like im missing something just in case i do care a little someone explain what im missing asher invited the lions from chicago back graham said when did this happen i asked when you and jeanclaude were dying truth said and richard graham added our ulfric was dying too truth gave a small bow from the neck i meant no offense wolf graham said grudgingly its okay the vampires would not have listened to your ulfric wicked said there was something in the way he said it the way he stood that said he wanted a fight dont pick a fight wicked i said he turned just enough to give me a little bit of his eyes thats not picking i dont feel well enough to mess with it i need everyone to be a grownup okay wicked gave me a look that wasnt entirely friendly but he didnt say anything else id take sullen silence the brothers were an asset the muscle wed needed for a while but they bothered me too there was always this feeling that they werent quite the obedient little vampires they might have been maybe it was the fact that i knew theyd spent centuries with all vampires turned against them theyd killed the head of their bloodline when he went crazy and sent his vampires out to slaughter humans their crime hadnt been slaying him because the vampire council had decided he needed killing their crime had been surviving his death superstition said that lesser vampires died when the head of their bloodline died jeanclaude said it was true of weaker vampires but it was supposed to be true of all vampires i think it was a way to discourage palace coups but wicked and truth were proof that it wasnt true not if you were powerful enough and of course only the very powerful would attempt to overthrow their creator i had given the brothers shelter a master to call their own truth would have died if i hadnt shared jeanclaudes power with him and where one brother went they both went so wicked was ours too tell me about the lions i said asher was in charge of the city as jeanclaudes témoin his secondincommand truth said so he is not the second most powerful vampire in st louis we thoughtand by we he always meant his brother and himselfthat sentimentality had clouded jeanclaudes judgment but there are other qualities in a leader than vampire powers he was decisive ruthless and swift what was he decisive ruthless and swift about i asked we needed extra muscle graham said you said that graham nodded just tell me i wont be mad wicked laughed a loud bray of sound that was nothing like the perfect masculine chuckle he usually allowed himself dont promise until you know ill know if you tell me i said and already there was a thread of anger in my tone damn it asher called augustine in chicago he asked for soldiers wicked said he let auggie send his werelions back into our territory i said wicked and truth nodded truth asked do you understand what that means for st louiss rex and his pride i lay in the bed and thought about it i did know i sent auggies lions back to chicago in november because they would have taken over josephs pride he doesnt have anyone strong enough to protect them from the brutes that auggie has im not sure theyd like being called brutes wicked said but its accurate he smiled a most unpleasant smile that turned his handsome face to something else something more basic less practiced more real wicked and truth had honor you could bank on that honor trust it if theyd been one inch less honorable they would have been totally untrustworthy and too dangerous to keep have they moved on josephs pride i asked not yet graham said i think theyre waiting to talk to you first me not jeanclaude i said they talked to jeanclaude hes removed his protection from the lions its all up to you babe wicked said micah is the head of the furry coalition i said micah kicked them out unless you make him put them back in graham said when your nimirraj found out what the st louis lions had done he accused them of having broken the treaty with both the wolves and the leopards truth said wicked continued the story since they broke the treaty they are no longer allies of the coalition so the coalition members dont owe them anything so when auggies lions attack no one will come to their aid i said my voice soft exactly wicked said he seemed pleased graham said joseph is outside alone he thinks you will be the weak link i looked at graham because it was odd wording you think i should let joseph and his people fry they betrayed us graham said i saw something in his face then a hardness that i hadnt noticed before he could be a good bodyguard when he wasnt trying to fuck something but he wasnt hard or ruthless not until now i remembered what id said to edward id planned on taking revenge on the werelions edward was going to help me but id met joseph and his people knew them they were real and they werent all a waste of time travis and noel had helped feed me for months while i tried to find a more permanent lion they were too weak to satisfy my lioness but they were good kids do i send him away graham asked as if that was what he wanted to do i thought about it it would be so easy to just refuse to see him then i could be ruthless and hardhearted and not have to look the man in the face who i was condemning to death i might be able to keep auggies lions from slaughtering all the pride but one death would be an absolute mustjosephs send him in i said you think thats a good idea wicked asked he managed to keep his voice neutral itd be easier not to see him i said then why see him wicked said because it would be easier that makes no sense it makes sense to me truth said i looked up at the other vampire we exchanged a long look he understood why i had to turn joseph away in person because if i couldnt look him in the eye and tell him the truth then maybe it was the wrong thing to do i had to see him to know whether i could stand by and let nature take its course with the lions in our city the lions werent my problem damn it they had betrayed us they would have let us all die their moral superiority had been worth more to them than the lives of our vampires i wouldnt cause them harm but i was done stepping in and saving them or thats what i told myself when i told graham to open the door chapter thirtyseven i watched joseph walk toward the bed he was tall with dark blond hair cut short he was dressed for a business meeting in a suit complete with tie i was betting his wife julia had picked the outfit he started undoing the tie before he got to wicked and truth they stopped him a little short of the bed normally i might have thought they were being overly cautious but my body agreed with them i was healing but only through a miracle of metaphysics eventually you run out of miracles anita how are you doing he tried for a neutral tone but it came out nervous ted forrester has gone to find a doc i may get out of bed today thats great and the relief chased over his face his hands flexed and unflexed julia said youd be all right she said that youd find someone else to feed on she said you would all be all right and you are he was talking a little too fast as if even he didnt believe it who are you trying to convince joseph me or you my voice was flat and my eyes empty id had dinner with him at my house id thought he was a good man but in the end hed let us die anita he tried to step closer to the bed but the vampires stopped him youre close enough wicked said i would never harm her i raised the hospital gown showed him the healing wounds that crossed my stomach and ribs the only thing that made me powerful enough to heal this was donovan reeces letting me feed on every swanmane in this country he gave me the power to live through this josephs face had paled im married anita julia and i take our vows very seriously if you were human that would be fine joseph but you arent human youre a werelion a werelion who owed allegiance to his allies we needed you and you failed us he went to his knees do you want me to beg ill beg i shook my head my lioness has never wanted you joseph had you ever wondered why why wouldnt she want the strongest lion she could find thats what shes programmed to do i felt the lioness stir down that long dark tunnel in my head or in my gut i thought calm thoughts at her and she stilled i was almost surprised that it worked i said a little prayer of thanks and went back to paying attention to the lion in front of me i thought you left me alone out of respect for my wife i looked at him there was nothing wrong with him he was good looking enough if a little too masculine for my preferences but he had never moved me my lioness had never even tried for him my lioness reacted to your lion the way she does to all the lions but she was never drawn to you the way she was drawn to some of the chicago lions you react to the chicago lions because you slept with them and their master vampire is that what everyones saying i asked he looked puzzled its the truth no its half the truth augustine yes but i was very careful with his lions i was careful because i didnt want to fuck up your lions i left his lions very alone because i was worried about you and yours i knew you sent them back to chicago but i thought i am grateful that you turned them down for us in my head i could admit that it hadnt been entirely for joseph and his people the lion that most attracted my lioness had sooo been bad news i did it because you were my ally and i thought it was somehow my fault that the other werelions were going to come and take over your pride ive learned since then that augustine has had your pride on his todo list for a while now because you and your lions are too weak to defend yourselves and all the other lions know it i kept my people safe he said no i kept them safe jeanclaude kept them safe richard kept them safe the wererats have died keeping your city safe the leopards nearly lost their queen the swans risked everything where were the lions while the rest of us bled and died if you had asked we would have fought for you why would we want the lions to fight for us joseph youre too weak you dont train in combat or weapons you are werelions so fucking what were all wereanimals but we offer more than just teeth and claws what do the lions offer us joseph the anger stirred that place inside me and i had to close my eyes and count slowly breathe slowly the stirring eased again two times in a row the beasts had quieted because id asked or concentrated on being calm maybe i was finally getting the hang of this we are lions he said but his voice was soft you are weak and my voice was soft too soft because i couldnt afford the anger joseph reached his hands out toward me between truth and wickeds legs do not let them kill us am i your rex am i your regina no he said and his hands began to lower then why do you turn to me for help because i have nowhere else to turn whose fault is that joseph whose fault is it that after this many years your pride is so weak that you have to turn to humans and vampires and other animal groups for safety his hands were on his thighs now mine he said no not just yours im betting your wife had something to do with it every time someone remotely stronger than you and your brother came along she said no didnt she she said that you didnt need them didnt she yes he said if youd let some strength into your pride you would have learned how to be a better king or they would have killed me and taken the pride taken your wife i said he nodded i heard that some of the lion takeovers work like that i can see where she wouldnt want to take the chance then you understand i shook my head i cant afford to understand joseph i cant afford to let you hide behind my skirts anymore micah kicked you out of our alliance i looked across the room to graham by the door graham did the other animal groups vote with the leopards they said pretty much what youve said that they have all lost people or had injuries and the lions just take resources and dont give anything back i gave anita the choice of all our unattached young men i paraded them out for her like some kind of slave auction id been fighting off feeling bad about this decision until that moment slave auction is that how you saw it youre picking men who will have to have sex with you if you have no choice then youre just a slave i havent fucked any of your young lions he looked at me like he didnt believe that at all didnt you ask them what they did for me we felt bad enough giving them to you we didnt need to hear any details you selfrighteous prig i didnt sleep with them because most of them are virgins or damn close to it corrupting the young just doesnt appeal to me there was a knock on the door who could it be this time graham opened the door and standing in the doorway was the reason for josephs fear and the other reason for me sending the lions back to chicago that first time haven alias cookie monster walked into the room chapter thirtyeight he was tall and a little slender for my tastes but a leather trench coat gave him more bulk through the shoulders than i knew he had his short spiked hair was still shades of blue like cookie monster and spring skies his eyes were still blue and laughing he was still handsome he was still dangerous joseph got to his feet wicked and truth put a hand on either of his arms he didnt fight them about it they just looked toward the other man they were actually blocking my view at that point i was okay with that the less i saw of him the better its against the rules for you to hold him for me havens voice was pleasant as if he were asking about the weather he probably had a pleasant face to go with the pleasant voice he could look pleasant and amused right up to the time he hurt you he was a professional thug and had been for all his adult life he was a mob enforcer and a werelion like i said dangerous i beat you last time joseph said that was true you got lucky haven said and the voice was sliding down to something less pleasant but i didnt even know you were here i came to see anita truth and wicked stepped aside taking joseph with them i was suddenly lying there staring up at the other man i had a moment of staring up into that deceptively blue gaze such an innocent color and then his gaze slid down my body it wasnt sexual id forgotten to lower my gown so the wounds were still visible his face was very serious and on the edge of that came a flash of anger through those skyblue eyes weretiger huh yeah he reached out as if he would touch the wounds i drew the gown back over my skin he looked me in the face again there was a look in his eyes that i couldnt decipher it was a serious look whatever it meant something stirred inside me something that flashed tawny and gold in the dark end of the tunnel i suddenly smelled dry grass and heat so hot it had a smell to it i smelled lion im trying to be good here haven said if you go all lioness on me i cant promise to be good i appreciate that i said out loud but my hand ached to reach out to him he was toning down his power level and i was toning down mine but the urge to touch him was still there micah had figured it out that my power wasnt seeking a lion to be another animal to call like nathaniel the power was seeking what micah was to me a rex to my regina chimera had been the same way i guess hed been the dominant in whatever group he took over the mix of panwere and belle mortes line of vamps seemed to have changed it from me trying to be dominant to everyone into trying to be a dominant couple with everyone take his hand i blinked up at them truth repeated take his hand im not sure thats a good idea haven reached out to me i could have moved back but i was just a little late in moving maybe it was a freudian slip or maybe it was an entire wardrobe his hand wrapped around mine with room to spare his hands were as big as richards the fingers longer closer to the way jeanclaudes hands looked but the size was all richard the feel of his hand in mine made something tight in my chest loosen i had enough men in my life damn it all i had to do was let go of his hand but i didnt let go haven was staring down at our clasped hands as if he didnt know what they were he sounded distracted like he was thinking about something very different from what his words said your nimirraj has kicked joseph and his lions out of the coalition ive checked with the wererats the werehyenas and your ulfric theyre all cool with me doing what needs doing it was good of you to check with everyone truth said the animal groups in your coalition with jeanclaude are still united i didnt want to piss everyone off the first day back he was rubbing his thumb across my knuckles as he talked i just need to ask you how you feel about it and i can get started anita please joseph said he was still being held between the two vampires no one in the coalition trusts you anymore joseph i dont trust you either so you wont care what i do haven asked he was looking at my face now his face was more serious than id ever seen it there are some lions in his group that are weak but theyre still valuable give them a chance to join you valuable how they have jobs they bring income into the pride so that others dont have to work money wont be a problem auggie bankrolled us until things got up and running and thats another thing ill try not to interfere in how you run the pride but i cant let you bring new mob connections to st louis you know thats one of the main reasons auggie wanted us down here i figured it was but weve got enough crime without adding ill let the lions do what lions do but the mob is human and im a federal marshal dont make me have to choose ill have to talk to auggie he was just holding my hand not meeting my eyes again ill talk to him if you want or jeanclaude can jeanclaude probably can come up with a compromise that auggie will listen to haven said remember the two lions you almost broke when you were here last time the college kids yeah theyve helped me keep my beast under control in fact joseph has a lot of young people in college let them finish their degrees help bring in legitimate money his hand squeezed around mine not hard but firm did you sleep with them i started to ask why but there was something about the way he was standing there some quality of stillness that made me afraid to tease i said the truth no none of them he said no but if youre not into sharing then you are holding the hand of the wrong girl i know how many you got on your plate but they arent lions and if i had slept with any of the other lions he gave me a look there was nothing comforting in that look hell there was nothing very human in that look i wont share with another lion ill need more than one of each of my beasts you cant be with me twentyfourseven he frowned no i cant also ive got micah as my nimirraj then nathaniel came as my leopard to call it may work that way with all my animals you only have the ulfric not true graham said she sees a lot of jason hes jeanclaudes pomme de sang i said thats why hes around a lot but thats not why you do him all the time thanks for putting it that way graham funny how graham reminded me often why he wasnt getting sex from me hes also nathaniels best friend wicked added that can we please change the subject i said but jason isnt her animal to call truth said then why does she have a leopard but not a wolf to call graham asked we dont know wicked said guys enough already i said shes right haven said he looked at joseph we cant settle this right now so go go tell your pride that you failed them tell them that well give them tonight safe what happens tomorrow joseph asked haven gave that unpleasant smile again why then you and i find out if you can get lucky again or if your lucks run out you will make him your rex jeanclaudes rex joseph said he looked at the werelion are you prepared to do what the nimirraj and the ulfric do whats that sleep with her master sleep with jeanclaude funny how some rumors never die no matter how many times you try to kill them before i could say anything haven answered do you believe every rumor you hear they are not rumors if they are true you thought i was sleeping with your little lions and i wasnt you say you werent get him out of here haven said the vampires looked at me i nodded they started escorting joseph to the door you condemn me to death anita he called back over his shoulder i didnt know what to say to that so i said nothing you cant save everybody and we couldnt afford to have any ally that wasnt with us completely it wasnt just the sex thered been no lion in his pride good enough to be a bodyguard not a single one you couldnt be that weak and survive wicked was saying something to joseph low and urgent his grip on the mans arm was tight enough to show at a distance whatever he said quieted the protests and sent him out the door what did you say to him wicked i asked i told him that the werelion had given him tonight to be safe but if he kept saying mean things about our masters id just do him tonight its my fight haven said i said that id do him not that id kill him after everything hed just said i figured rape would scare him enough to get him out of here you dont like guys i said you dont know what i like youve worked hard not to know my prides hurt but ill get over it but joseph would believe anything of jeanclaudes people even maleonmale rape so there really is a rumor that no one gets to join jeanclaudes kiss without fucking him or you truth said im really disappointed that one isnt true by the way wicked said with a grin me too graham said i gave them both the look they deserved i do not wish to truth said they looked at him why not graham asked because i am already much in thrall to anita if i bedded her i would be little more than the slave joseph accused us of being trust me guys youre overestimating my appeal i said i dont know about that haven said he spread my hand on his palm and touched my hand with the fingers of his other hand you have such small hands delicate and dangerous wicked said haven started talking almost as if to himself im not a complicated guy i know that im not stupid but im not exactly a brain trust either i know that too i like being a guy i like being muscle i like hurting people i dont mind killing people i like my job i like drinking with the guys a little poker and strip clubs fucking it was a good life you make it sound like its over i said i went back to chicago to my life but it didnt work anymore i still liked hurting people but i started wondering if youd hate me for doing some of the stuff auggie had me doing i kept thinking what would she think wondering what youd think started getting in the way of my job auggie noticed it i sent you back home haven i didnt make you think about me i tried to take my hand back but he wrapped those long fingers around me and i didnt fight it yeah you did anita maybe not on purpose but you did first it fucked up my job then it fucked up my fun i started looking at my friends and what we did and thought shed be disappointed shed think it was stupid he shook his head damn it ive never let any woman mess me up like this haven i let me finish he said i wasnt sure i wanted him to finish but i let him women are just for fucking or marrying so you can have kids if you want them women dont count not in my world not in auggies world but you counted to him and to me but especially to me no matter what woman i was with or how good the sex was the moment it was over it felt bad it wasnt enough damn you damn you i started thinking about relationships having a girl to talk to stupid shit that i gave up before i hit fifteen and suddenly it was all back i was this kid again thinking there was more to life than being muscle for auggie there isnt more to life anita there isnt anymore his voice had sunk to a low growl i didnt know what to say sorry seemed lame and its not my fault seemed worse i didnt mean to fuck up your life seemed the most accurate i finally settled for i didnt make you rethink your life haven yeah you did auggie says you did he says you didnt mean to do it but you mindfucked me just like belle morte does or can im your lion anita im yours yours in a way ive never been anyones you make me want to be a better person how fucking lame is that truths quiet voice came a lady always makes a man want to be better than he is belle morte did not make anyone want to be better she made you obsess about her follow her like a dog but you did not think will she think less of me if i do this awful thing she did things so much worse than anything we were willing to do even wicked found her immoral auggie said it was the same mindfucking shit that belle morte did your attraction to anita may have been vampire powers but your reaction to her beyond that is not wicked said and there was a note of almost sadness to his voice what does that mean haven asked his voice irritated it means my good fellow wicked said youre in love with the woman no haven said only love of a good woman will make a man question every choice every action only love makes a warrior hesitate for fear that his lady will find him cruel only love makes a man both the best he will ever be and the weakest sometimes all in the same moment i didnt know what to say it seemed like i should say something maybe i wasnt in love with him or maybe it was just lust or but one thing had to be clear between us i appreciate all the honesty haven really i do but i need to be certain you understand a few things he gave me a look that was both angry and uneasy what things youve done good you checked with all the other group leaders that was great but i havent said id make you one of my boyfriends he squeezed my hand traced his fingers across my wrist i had to fight not to shiver under even that small touch i knew this reaction it was too close to how micah had affected me too damn close but when micah came into my life the ardeur was brand new and so was having my own beasts i wasnt new at controlling all of it now thank god your pulse speeds up just from that little touch how can you say you dont want me i didnt say i didnt want you but my life works mostly i like living with micah and nathaniel i like bunking over with jeanclaude and asher i dont need another man in my life who wont share frankly im trying to thin down the number of men in my life i really dont want another one what are you saying im saying dont come down here thinking its a done deal between us dont take it for granted that youll be able to fit into my life he let go of my hand then and the look was so cold i talk to you like ive never talked to another woman and this is what i get yeah because my life works the coalition works the power structure in this territory works i wont jeopardize it not for lust or even for love ask her how she feels about you truth said haven shook his head tell him how you feel anita i didnt want to but truth was right one haven had been honest with me two a mans ego is a fragile thing sometimes the toughest men sometimes are the easiest hurt and hardest to heal i didnt know what haven and i would be doing with each other but whatever we were going to do it needed to be honest i thought about you while you were in chicago but not to the extent you thought about me i sent you away because i wanted to touch you i wanted to be naked with you and do all the things you do when the clothes come off youre saying you wanted like its past i still feel the attraction trust me but the initial attraction is the most overwhelming it was like that with micah too if i can get a little distance between me and the man then apparently i get better control i wonder how your control would be if i werent shielding my lion from you youre hurt you need to heal but when youre well i want to see how your control holds up to my lion dont threaten me haven i dont react well to that its not a threat anita i am being so good right now you have no idea how good i appreciate that i said but im not good im bad i think like a bad guy you keep pushing me away and all my good resolutions will go out the window what does that mean i asked it means that once i kill joseph and take over his pride ill be a permanent member of your coalition ill be the local rex once i take over josephs pride i cant go back to chicago the human part of me the commonsense part of me said send his ass back home the coldly practical part said who else is going to run the lions here there were no other candidates the lioness in me wanted to know if he was as good as his brag not just about sex but power the lioness more than any other of my beasts wanted a mate that could protect her keep up with her none of my other beasts were as competitive as the lion i got a distant swirl of tiger like a dream of a dream tiger wanted to be left alone fine with me im scared of you haven scared that you being my lion will fuck up my life i know youre bad and youve been bad your entire adult life thats a lot of bad habits to break im not sure i know how to be good i know do i stay decide now anita because once the pride is mine the choice is gone i thought about it id have been fine with him coming in as the new rex but coming in as a new boyfriend well that just had disaster written all over it i opened my mouth to say go but my lioness swiped a claw up inside me like she was playing with my liver it made me writhe on the bed and not in a good way i was suddenly getting asked by a lot of people anita are you all right i nodded i had more control over my beasts i really did but apparently i didnt have complete control would the lioness let me send haven back to chicago or would she tear me apart i dont know what i would have said to haven because i didnt get a chance the door opened and it was dolph again but with more police at his back everybody in here carrying a weapon but not carrying a badge out since that was everybody but graham they went dolph was pissed that theyd managed to get past everyone in the first place apparently heads were going to fly at least figuratively edward came back into the room while dolph was giving each of the armed guards a police escort off hospital grounds dolph decided that ted forrester and his german friend in the hallway were enough muscle to keep me safe so graham didnt need to be here either dolph graham isnt even armed youve got forrester and otto jeffries to guard your back or is there something going on in our city so dangerous that you need all this firepower he gave me those searching cop eyes that always seemed to see everything i shook my head i told truth wicked haven and graham to go with the nice police officers they went because dolph was right with edward and olaf i was safe enough at least from our enemies id seen olaf use a gun i knew he was a good man in a fight but somehow i just never felt entirely safe from olaf with olaf nearby funny that chapter thirtynine the doctor told me i could go that if i exercised and didnt let the scar tissue harden up on me id be fine he also assumed i was a shapeshifter a new kind of shapeshifter that could do different animals he actually used the term panwere it was the first time id heard anyone but a shapeshifter say it the doctor had never actually seen one until me i told him he still hadnt seen one but nothing i said persuaded him different so i gave up if people wont believe the truth and you dont want to lie then youre out of options chimera had been the real deal a true panwere and one of the scariest beings id ever met i wondered what the doctor would have made of him i walked down the hall to peters room with edward leading the way olaf brought up the rear i didnt like him behind me but he wasnt doing anything wrong for him he was positively being a good boy the fact that i could feel the weight of his gaze on my back almost like a hand pressing between my shoulder blades wasnt something i could really bitch about i mean what was i supposed to say stop looking at me it was a little too childish for me to say it out loud no matter how true it felt it didnt help that olaf and i were dressed alike sort of edward was in his white buttondown shirt and jeans and cowboy boots ted forrester dressed to be comfortable olaf dressed either to intimidate or because he liked the goth assassin look i hadnt picked my clothes nathaniel had black jeans tight enough that the inner pants holster dug in a little but they tucked nicely into the laceup boots the black tshirt was scoopnecked and the pushup bra that was under it made sure i had plenty of scoop to show my cross sat on my breasts rather than hanging in front of them how did i know nathaniel had packed the bag and not micah first the panties and bra matched and the panties were perfect for the lower waistline of the jeans second the shirt and bra showed a lot of cleavage third the boots maybe my nikes were covered in blood they probably were and the boots were comfy and low heeled but nathaniel was twenty and male and often looked at clothes from the perspective of his job micah had a tendency to not match everything perfectly he would have just put on an ambisexual tshirt from the tshirt drawer we shared the outfit wouldnt have looked so terribly like an outfit if micah had done it id have to talk to nathaniel about picking out things with this much cleavage when i was working with the cops i had my backup shoulder holster instead of the custommade leather one which probably meant hospital efficiency had destroyed it that would be the second or third one that had gotten cut to pieces in an emergency room i felt heat or air movement or something i turned and must have done it fast enough to catch olaf in midmotion pulling his hand back he had almost touched me i glared at him and he stared at me those dark deepset eyes stared at my face and then his gaze slid down the front of my body in that way that men can do that look that slides over you so that you know theyre thinking about you naked or worse in olafs case it was probably worse stop looking at me like that i said edward was watching us both every man who sees you tonight will be looking at you like that he made a gesture in the vague direction of my chest how can they not i felt the heat run up my face and spoke through gritted teeth nathaniel picked the clothes to bring to the hospital not me did he buy the shirt and the bra olaf asked no i said i did he shrugged then do not blame the boy yeah but theyre date clothes and i dont think theres going to be time for a date tonight will we be hunting the vampire that escaped us he asked i nodded yeah if we can figure out where she and her human servant have gotten to yeah he smiled what i said because the smile didnt match what we were talking about if things work out as i hope i may owe your boy a thankyou i shook my head i dont understand edward touched my arm and i jumped you dont want to understand he led me down the hallway his hand on my arm olaf stayed where he was staring at us with that strange halfsmile on his face what i asked edward he leaned in close speaking low and quick while you were unconscious olaf came into the room you were covered in blood and theyd cut off most of what you were wearing he touched you anita the doctors and guards chased him back and i got him out of the room but i stumbled because i was trying to stop and he kept us moving touched me where i asked the stomach i dont understand and then i did the wounds he touched the wounds yes edward said and stopped us outside a door i swallowed hard both my pulse and a certain nausea were trying to climb up my throat i looked down the hallway where olaf was still standing i knew my face showed fear i couldnt help it he drew his lower lip under and bit it i think it was an unconscious gesture a gesture you make when you are moved to the point where you dont think about how you look or whos looking then he moved down the hallway toward us like some black movie monster the kind that looks human and is human but in their mind theres nothing human left to talk to edward opened the door and drew me inside apparently we werent waiting on olaf fine with me i stumbled over the doorsill his hand tightened steadying me the door closed on the sight of olaf gliding up the hallway he moved like all his muscles knew what they were doing almost like one of the shapeshifters he so needed killing i must have looked pale because micah came across the room and took me in his arms he whispered against my cheek whats wrong he hugged me tighter youre shivering i wrapped my arms around him and pressed as much of me against as much of him as i could it was one of those hugs when it feels almost like youre trying to meld yourself into the other person sometimes its sexual but sometimes its because the world has gone too wrong and you need something to cling to i clung to micah like he was the last solid thing in the world i buried my face against the curve of his neck and drew in the scent of his skin he didnt ask again what was wrong he just held me close other arms hugged me from behind another body pressed tight against me i didnt need to open my eyes and see nathaniel to know it was him i didnt even need the faint hint of vanilla i knew the feel of his body against mine i knew the feel of them holding me together another body came in from the side of us i did turn to see and found it was cherry she put an arm around both men i realized with a start that she wasnt taller than nathaniel now whats wrong she asked dark eyes worried what did i say that i was afraid of olaf that the thought that hed caressed my wounds creeped me that i wondered if hed touched that bulge of intestine the way a man touches a breast that i wanted to know and didnt want to know the door opened behind us edward nodded at me and went to the opening door he spoke softly then walked out the door to talk to olaf in private or maybe to simply keep him away from me for a while whichever i was grateful of course that left me with edwards other backup i looked past micahs shoulder and cherrys arm to the bed in the room pain had brought more of the shadow of that boy id first met into peters face he looked pale and terribly young lying there hooked up to tubes and monitors when i woke up i hadnt been hooked up to anything that monitored my vitals how much worse off was he than me i whispered i dont think i can explain whats wrong cherry gave me narrow eyes ill try to explain later promise she frowned at me but stepped back as if she knew what i was going to do maybe she did id probably made some small movement toward the bed or turned my body as if prepping to move most people wouldnt notice but a lot of the shapeshifters would i hugged micah again a little less intensely and he kissed me it was a gentle lingering kiss if peter hadnt been watching i might have made it more but he was and edward was taking care of big and scary in the hallway that left me with not so big but scary in a very different way i leaned back to look over my shoulder at nathaniel he kissed my cheek putting his hand against the other side of my face so he could press our faces together i turned so he could get more of a kiss but he gave me one of the most delicate gentlemanly kisses hed ever given me i drew back giving him puzzled eyes his lavender gaze flicked across the room toward the bed i got it and didnt something about peter watching made nathaniel behave himself but i didnt know why or what i mean it was a kiss not making out i pushed the thought away into the crowd of other confusing thoughts there were so many of them i felt like i needed a cage to hold them in so that all the things i didnt understand wouldnt overwhelm me i got a better look at nathaniels clothes and realized hed dressed himself almost exactly as hed dressed me except his tshirt was a boys and he wasnt wearing any weapons we looked like we should be going clubbing hard to complain about how someone dresses you when theyre wearing the same outfit the clothes were minor problems compared to what was waiting i took a deep breath and pushed out of the circle of comforting hands i moved out of that circle of warmth to face the current confusing thought this one was staring at me with brown eyes that looked like islands in the pale skin of his face peter wasnt naturally pale not like i was or edward was but he was pale now blood loss and pain will do that to you i walked toward the bed in that moment i would rather have faced peter than olaf was i being a coward or was edward the one being the coward i was betting that hed rather face a thousand olafs than one almoststepson right now the look on peters face changed as i walked toward the bed he was still hurt but his gaze seemed to be drawn to something other than my face by the time i got to the bedside he wasnt as pale hed found enough blood somewhere to blush chapter forty hey peter i said he turned his head so he was looking up at the ceiling apparently he didnt trust himself not to stare at my chest and wasnt sure how id react i wasnt sure either i thought you were hurt he said i was he turned to look at me frowning but youre up i feel awful i nodded im a little surprised myself truthfully his gaze had drifted down again olaf was crazy and mean but he was right about one thing men would stare some on purpose to be rude but not all some like peter well it was as if my chest were a magnet and their gaze iron it just attracted it i was sooo going to have to talk to nathaniel about what clothes to pack next time next time i got so hurt i ended up unconscious in the hospital i simply assumed thered be a next time unless i changed jobs there would be the thought startled me was i thinking about giving up the vampire hunting was i really truly considering it maybe maybe i was i shook my head and pushed the thought into that cage with all the other thoughts the cage was getting awfully damn full anita peter made it a question sorry thinking too hard what about he was managing eye contact i felt like i should pet his head and give him a cookie good boy god i was in a strange mood tonight truthfully wondering if i want to keep hunting vampires his eyes went wide what are you talking about this is what you do no i raise zombies the vampire hunting is supposed to be a sideline sometimes the zombie thing gets me hurt but the vampire and rogue lycanthrope hunting are more likely to put me in the hospital maybe im just tired of waking up with new scars waking up is good though he said and his voice sounded fragile he wasnt staring at my face or my chest now he was looking into the distance with that look on the face that says youre seeing something unpleasant reliving it just a little you didnt think you were going to wake up i said and kept my voice gentle he looked at me eyes wide looking lost frightened no i thought this was it i thoughthe stopped and he wouldnt meet my eyes you thought you were going to die i finished for him he nodded then winced as if the movement hurt i knew i wouldnt die or you stomach wounds hurt like hell and they can take a lot of healing but theyre rarely fatal with modern antibiotics and prompt medical attention he looked at me uncomprehending were you really thinking all that as they put you under i thought about it not exactly but ive been hurt a lot peter ive lost count of the number of times ive lost consciousness and woken up in a hospital or somewhere worse i thought his eyes were on my chest again but he said the scar on your collarbone what did that another interesting sideline of wearing this much of my chest in full view was that some of my scars were on display id been more worried about my modesty than about the scars vampire i thought it was a shapeshifter bite nope vampire i showed him my arms with all their scars most of these are from vampires i touched one on my left arm claw marks this one was a shapeshifted witch which means her shapeshifting was a spell and not a disease i didnt know there was a difference well the spell isnt contagious and its not tied to the full moon at all in fact strong emotions dont cause you to shift or any of that you dont shift until you put on the item usually a fur belt or something do you have any scars from shapeshifters yes can i see truthfully the most permanent scars were claw marks on my ass they were almost delicate marks gabriel the wereleopard who had done it had considered it foreplay before he tried to rape me on film hed been the first person id ever killed with the big knife in its spine sheath i was going to have to figure out a different way to wear the knife until i could get the shoulder rig remade but i had new scars now ones i was willing to show peter it took a little work to get the tshirt out of the pants but somehow i didnt want to unbuckle or unzip anything i got the shirt up and raised it over my belly exposing the new wounds peter made a surprised sound that cant be real he whispered it he reached out as if hed try to touch then drew his hand back as if he wasnt sure what id say i stepped closer to the bed he took it as the invitation it was and ran his fingertips across the new pink scars the scars may disappear altogether or they may stay i wont know for a few days or weeks i said he drew his fingers back then put his whole hand across the biggest wound the one where it looked as if she had tried to take a chunk of flesh his hand was big enough to cover the mark and leave his fingers splayed out beyond the scars you cant have healed this in less than what twelve hours are you one of them you mean a shapeshifter i asked yes he whispered it as if it were a secret he slid his hand along my stomach tracing the ragged marks of claws no he ran his hand over my skin until he came to the edge of the scars where they dribbled away just past my belly button they just changed my dressing i look like shit youre healed he curved his hand around to the side of my waist that wasnt scarred his hand cupped my waist and his hand was big enough to do it that one gesture caught me off guard the only man i was dating whose hand was big enough to do that was richard it seemed wrong that peters hand was that big it made me move back from him and let my shirt drop over my stomach which embarrassed him which wasnt my intent i just suddenly realized i probably shouldnt let him touch me that much it hadnt moved me or made me uncomfortable until that moment he took his hand back and again wasted blood that he didnt have in blushing sorry he mumbled and wouldnt look at me as he said it its okay peter no harm no foul he gave me a quick upward glance of his brown eyes if youre not a shapeshifter how could you have healed like that truthfully it was probably because i was jeanclaudes human servant but since dolph was wanting to know that i just didnt want to share it with people who didnt know im carrying four different kinds of lycanthropy so far i dont turn furry but im carrying the doctors told me you cant get more than one kind of lycanthropy thats the point of the shot the two different kinds of lycanthropy cancel each other out he stopped at the end of the speech and took a deeperthannormal breath as if talking too much hurt i patted his shoulder dont talk if it hurts peter everything hurts he seemed to try to settle into the bed then stopped as if that had hurt too he looked up at me and the angry defiant face was like an echo of almost two years ago the kid id met was still in there hed just grown up it made my heart hurt would i ever get to see peter when he wasnt getting hurt i guess i could just go visit edward sometime but that was just weird we did not just visit each other we werent that kind of friends i know it hurts peter i didnt always heal this fast micah and nathaniel have been talking to me about weretigers and being a lycanthrope i nodded because i didnt know what else to say theyd know do they all heal as fast as you do some no some faster faster he said really i nodded his eyes filled with something i couldnt decipher cisco didnt heal ah no he didnt if he hadnt thrown himself between me and the weretiger id be dead now you couldnt have taken the damage that cisco took thats true youre not going to argue about it tell me it wasnt my fault it wasnt your fault i said but he did it to save me he did it to keep both my guards alive longer he did it to give us time for other guards to come and help us he did his job but i was there peter cisco did his job he didnt sacrifice himself to save you i wasnt entirely sure that was true but i kept talking i dont think he meant to sacrifice himself at all shapeshifters dont usually die that easily easily he had his throat ripped out ive seen both vampires and wereanimals heal from wounds like that he gave me a disbelieving face i crossed my heart and gave the boy scout salute that made him smile you were never a boy scout i wasnt even a girl scout but im still telling the truth i smiled hoping to encourage him to keep doing it healing like that would be cool i nodded it is cool but its not all cool there are some serious downsides to being a wereanimal micah told me some of it he and nathaniel have answered a lot of questions theyre good at that he glanced past me at the door i glanced where he looked micah and nathaniel had given us as much privacy as they could without leaving the room they were talking softly together cherry had actually left the room i hadnt heard her go the doctors want me to get the shot peter said i looked at him they would what would you do he asked i shook my head if youre old enough to have saved my life then youre old enough to decide this on your own his face crumbled around the edges not like he was going to cry but as if the child was peeking out did all teenagers do that one minute grownup the next so fragile like a dream of their younger selves im just asking your opinion i shook my head id say call your mom but edward doesnt want to he says donna will vote for the shot she would he sounded resentful face sullen hed been pretty moody at fourteen apparently that hadnt changed completely i wondered how donna was coping with this new more grownup son ill tell you what i told edward i wont give an opinion on this one micah says that i might not get the tiger lycanthropy even if i dont get the shot hes right he said fiftyfive percent of the people who get the shot dont get lycanthropy but that fortyfive percent get lycanthropy they get whats in the shot anita if i get the shot and catch whats in there it means if id just left it alone i wouldnt have gotten anything i didnt know the stats broke down that nicely but micah would know he says its his job to know i nodded he takes his job at the coalition as seriously as edward and i take ours nathaniel said hes an exotic dancer is that true its true i said he actually lowered his voice to say so hes a stripper yes i said and fought not to smile with everything that was going wrong in his life he was weirded out that my boyfriend was a stripper then i realized that he might not know that nathaniel was my boyfriend no wed kissed when i came through the door but then cherry had joined the hug oh hell now was not the time to try to explain my love life to him micah told me some of the jobs that other lycanthropes have nurses doctors but only if they dont find out i might not be able to join the armed forces any branch they consider lycanthropy a contagious disease so probably not in my head i remembered a talk micah and i had had about a rumor a rumor about the armed forces looking into deliberate recruiting of shapeshifters but it was a rumor he couldnt trace anyone who had actually been approached it was always a friend of a friends cousin did you get the shot they didnt offer its too late for me peter im carrying already but youre not a shapeshifter he made it a question i dont turn furry once a month or at all so no but youre carrying four different kinds at once the whole shot thing is based on the idea that thats impossible i nodded and shrugged im a medical miracle what can i say if i could heal like that and not turn furry that would be amazing you still wouldnt pass blood screenings for some jobs youd still hit the radar as a lycanthrope he frowned i guess so then he gave me that young face again that echo of before and it was a frightened face why wont you help me decide i leaned closer this is what it means to be grownup peter this is the bitch of it if youre playing eighteen then you have to decide if you want to fess up to your real age then everyone will treat you like a kid theyll make decisions for you im not a kid he said and he frowned going sullen on me i know that his frown slipped to puzzlement what do you mean you stood your ground today you didnt panic or lose it ive seen grown men lose it around lycanthropes when the situation wasnt as desperate most people are afraid of them i was afraid he said softly ive been afraid since i was a kid i had one of those moments of shit and aha the attack on your father i said how could i have forgotten that this wasnt the first lycanthropy attack hed survived he gave a small nod you were what eight yes his voice was soft his eyes staring into the distance again i didnt know what to say i cursed edward for not being here in that moment i might have traded a talk with olaf for this talk with peter i could always shoot olaf but no weapon would help me deal with peters pain anita he said i looked at him met his eyes his eyes reminded me of nathaniels eyes when i first met him eyes that were older than they should have been eyes that had seen things that older men would never see im here peter i said because i couldnt think what else to say i met his gaze and fought my face not to show how much it hurt me to see his eyes like that maybe theyd been that way years ago but it took dating nathaniel to teach me what eyes like that meant in a face that hadnt seen twenty yet i thought if i trained with edward that i wouldnt be so scared but i was i was scared just like last time it was like i was little and watching my dad die again i wanted to touch his shoulder take his hand but wasnt sure it was what he needed me to do so i kept my hands still i lost my mom when i was eight to a car wreck his eyes changed lost a little of that awful look were you there did you see i shook my head no she drove away and just never came back i saw my dad die i used to dream about it me too but you werent there what did you dream about some wellmeaning relative took me to see the car she died in i used to dream about touching the bloodstains i realized id never told anyone that what he said whats wrong i could have said so many things many of them sarcastic like im talking about my mothers death why wouldnt something be wrong i settled for the truth which crosses the lips like jagged glass as if you should bleed when you say it just realizing ive never told anyone about that dream not even micah and nathaniel apparently he did know they were my boyfriends no not even them mom made me go to therapy afterward i talked about it a lot good for donna i said why didnt your dad send you i shrugged i dont think it occurred to him i thought i could face my fears and i wouldnt be so afraid but i was afraid he looked away from me again i was so scared he whispered the last so was i i said he gave me a startled look you didnt look it neither did you it took him a moment but he finally smiled and looked down in that pleased way that young men do they seem to grow out of it but it was strangely charming you really think so peter you saved me today when you jumped on us in the hallway she was going to kill me as soon as she was out of sight of you guys edward told me that if a bad guy wants to remove you from the scene and is already threatening or has a weapon that most of the time they mean to kill you but if you go with them you die slower and more painfully i nodded i thought thats what you meant when you repeated the rule in the hallway you understood he said i encouraged you remember he searched my face as if trying to read something there you did didnt you edward and i know a lot of the same rules he said you think like him sometimes i said not always peter said not always i said i wont get the shot he said and his voice sounded firm why not i asked do you think i should get it i didnt say that i just want your reasoning if i dont get it and i turn into a weretiger well then i did it saving you if i dont get the shot and i dont turn into a weretiger then its good if i get the shot and i wasnt going to be a weretiger ill get whatevers in the shot and ill have turned into a shapeshifter because i was scared to be a shapeshifter that sounds stupid but if you are going to be a weretiger then the shot would stop it from happening you think i should take it he said i sighed honest honest would be good he said i didnt like the way you said that if you turn into a weretiger its good because you did it saving me i dont want you to think about me in this equation i want you be a selfish son of a bitch peter i want you to think about yourself and yourself alone what do you want to do what feels right to you honest he said yeah honest i said i think ive made up my mind then i go back and change it i think if i decided and they had the shot here and ready id just take it but they wont bring it until i say so he closed his eyes part of me wants to call my mom and let her decide for me part of me wants someone to blame if it goes wrong but a man doesnt do that a man makes his own decisions in this situation yes but dont imprint that whole lone gunman mentality too deep on your psyche why he asked i smiled i know from experience that its hard to be part of a couple when youre so damned independent ive had to learn how to share my decisions balance is what youre looking for i dont know how to balance anything anymore and his eyes were shiny peter i go okay he said in a voice that was too thick just go please i almost reached out and touched his shoulder i wanted to comfort him hell i wanted to go back in time and put his ass back on a plane home as soon as he showed up in st louis i wished i had humiliated him and sent him packing wasnt a bruised ego better than this hands came and touched me drew me back from the bed micah and nathaniel drew me away so peter could cry without me watching my throat was so tight it hurt to breathe fuck fuck fuck they got me outside in the hallway before the first tear slid hot and almost painful down my own face damn it i said micah tried to hug me but i pushed him away ill cry if you hug me anita just let it out i shook my head no dont you understand we have to kill her first ill cry when mercias dead you blame her for peter being hurt he said no i blame me and edward but i cant kill us so ill kill who i can if youre going to talk about killing people anita you might not want to do it in front of a policeman zerbrowski walked down the hallway with his usual smile he looked as he always did like hed slept in his suit though i knew he hadnt his dark curly hair had more gray in it but it was still the careless curls katie his wife hadnt made him cut it recently he was cheerfully messy and katie was one of the neatest people id ever met opposites attract i had a horrible urge to hug him he just looked so nicely normal coming down the hallway which made me turn to micah and nathaniel if i was thinking about falling into zerbrowskis arms i was badly in need of a hug all three of them had seen me cry before including zerbrowski i threw an arm around micah then held the other one out to nathaniel i let them hold me but i didnt cry my face felt hot but no more tears came i clung to them let them hold me i had this horrible urge to simply collapse to just fall apart in their arms but i couldnt do it i couldnt let myself do it ill give you some privacy zerbrowski said i shook my head and drew back from the men no we have to catch this bitch no ones seen her anita her or the man who we assume is her human servant he has to be her human servant to share her mind powers zerbrowski i tried to move farther away but nathaniels arm slipped around my shoulders drawing me back i patted his arm and said im okay now he whispered liar but maybe its me who needs to touch you he squeezed me tight his other arm sliding around my waist youve got to stop almost dying anita its hard on the heart somehow i didnt think he meant hard as in a heart attack there were so many more ways for a heart to break i let him press me back against his body i stroked my hands down his arms zerbrowski shook his head smiled you know katie feels the same way after i get hurt but shes too cool to do it in public i looked at him and it wasnt an entirely friendly look he held up his hands it wasnt a criticism anita nathaniel its just well hell i mean its interesting watching people be as open as you guys are is it a shapeshifter culture thing i thought about it yeah i guess it is if we dont have to play human micah said were very touchyfeely and we tend to wear our emotions out zerbrowski grinned damn that must have been an adjustment for you anita whats that supposed to mean it means youre like most cops i knowyou stuff your emotions does this mean if the boyfriends arent around at a crime scene some night i can look forward to you hanging all over me you wish i said and smiled at him i patted nathaniels arm and took a step forward he let me draw a little farther away from him but kept my hand i understood the need to touch and be touched it wasnt just the normal lycanthropy stuff i wanted to hug peter as if he were a little boy and tell him it would all be all right but it was a lie even if hed been a little boy it would still have been a lie i couldnt promise him anything thats an awful serious face for a woman who just got a hug from her sweetie im thinking about peter yeah you got cut up trying to save him i fought to keep my face neutral if we were going to change the story for the police then edward should have told me that he didnt tell me the official version and i hadnt asked said just how distracted the two of us were not good you saved his life anita thats the best you could do zerbrowski said i nodded and went for a hug from micah partially to hide my face because i still couldnt quite figure out how to look my guilt was because peter had gotten cut up saving me he wouldnt even get credit for it from the cops that seemed like insult to injury micah kissed the side of my face and whispered edward didnt tell you the official version no i whispered back micah spoke with me still in his arms i think anita also blames herself because she was already hunting the vampires she thinks they might not have reacted so violently if they hadnt known she was on their trail i turned still half in micahs arms when a person knows that theyre being tracked by someone who can kill them on sight zerbrowski what options does that leave them are you saying you disagree with the execution order he asked no not in this case but there are nights when i wish i had an option that was less than lethal force id love someone to do a study and see if the vampires get more violent in trying to stay alive than in the crimes they were originally condemned for have you had that happen zerbrowski asked no no i guess i havent most of them would have kept killing if we hadnt stopped them but still the vamp were hunting framed a vampire from the church of eternal life she helped frame two of them if i had just followed the trail they mapped out for us id have killed two innocent people isnt this the second time youve had the bad vampires frame the good vampires and try to use you as a murder weapon yes i said it is and if its happening to me then it may be happening to other vampire executioners but they may not be looking beyond the obvious you mean because they arent up close and personal with the vampires they just accept that a good vampire is a dead vampire yeah zerbrowski frowned at me dolph isnt the only one who thinks you living with thehe made a vague gesture at nathaniel and micahcompromises your ability to do your job but i dont think it does i think it makes you look at the vampires and shapeshifters the way the law says were supposed to now theyre supposed to be legal citizens people and you see them that way its what makes it harder and harder for you to kill them but it makes you a better cop you look for the truth catch the real bad guy punish the guilty the other executioners kill who theyre told to kill it makes them good killers but im not sure what good cops they are it was a long speech for zerbrowski youve put some thought into this he actually looked embarrassed i guess i have i spend a lot of time defending your honor with the other cops i can defend my own honor i said he grinned again no you cant you cant explain that you see the monsters as people without implying that the bigoted bastard that just said the stupid thing doesnt see them as people i can get away with it im zerbrowski i can say a lot of shit and not make people mad i go for the funny bone you go for the jugular it makes people pissy he really does know you well micah said i drew away enough to look back at him what the hell does that mean he grinned at me i found nathaniel fighting not to grin they were all grinning at me what my cell phone rang and then i realized i didnt have it on me it rang again and it was the ring tone that nathaniel had picked for my phone when i said i didnt care it was wild boys by duran duran id remember to care next time he asked micah fished the phone out of his pocket and handed it to me i didnt have time to ask when hed picked up my phone i just answered it hello a male voice said i do not have much time the voice was familiar but it was a strange monotone that made it sound like someone i should recognize and a stranger all at the same time the harlequin are at my church i started walking down the hallway away from everyone else it was zerbrowski i didnt want to overhear not until i knew that i wanted the police to know malcolm is this you the voice continued as if i hadnt spoken columbine says she will bloodoath my congregation or she will battle me with vampire powers for it is not illegal for a vampire to use vampire wiles on another vampire she claims to have done nothing illegal in our country she blames all crime on her dead partner i cannot win against her anita but i can give my congregation to jeanclaude bloodoath them any way you like but save them from the madness i sense in these two columbine and giovanni give me permission to tell them they must duel jeanclaude for these vampires and not me malcolm is this you the voice changed holding fear whats happening who is this avery avery seabrook i made it a question though i was almost a hundred percent certain it was him i could see his gentle brown eyes the short hair that young unfinished face he was in his twenties but tasted too innocent for comfort anita is that you its me what happened whats happening right now malcolm touched me and i dont remember what happened next i just sort of woke up on my cell phone in the back of the church his voice dropped to a whisper there are masked vampires here i dont know them malcolm seems afraid of them youre bloodoathed to jeanclaude they cant hold you what is going on anita what was i supposed to say youre such a weak vamp that malcolm mindfucked you like you were a human he sounded scared enough without me making him feel weaker malcolm sent me a message what then there was noise on the other end i heard averys voice a little distant as if hed taken the phone from his mouth to talk to someone there avery the voice that came on wasnt avery or malcolm who is speaking please it was male and i didnt know the voice i dont answer your questions you answer mine are you police he asked yes it was the truth we are breaking none of your laws youre trying to take over the church of eternal life here in my town id say thats illegal we have offered no violence to anyone this will be a contest of wills and magical power it is not illegal to use vampire powers on other vampires in your country we will not use our powers on the humans here i give you my word how about the vampires theyre legal citizens of this country too we will offer them no weapon no hand of violence your laws protect only humans from vampire powers in fact the law could be interpreted to exclude all supernatural citizens from the protection the law gives against vampire manipulation lycanthropes are still considered human under the letter of the law if you say so i say so give me your name i said i am known as giovanni i would like to know who i am speaking with frankly i wasnt sure that hed treat me like a cop or like jeanclaudes human servant i wasnt even sure which role would work best here im federal marshal anita blake ah the master of the citys human servant yeah that too we have done nothing my mistress and i to anger you in either of your roles that was a little too close for comfort to what id just been thinking had he read my mind and me not know it shit if columbine is your mistress then yeah she did piss me off we read your laws marshal columbine used her powers on you your master and his wolf she did not use her powers on humans she and her friend nivia framed two legal citizen vampires for murder and two humans died to do that nivia did that on her own my mistress was most upset when she found that nivia had done these horrible things he didnt even try to keep his voice from sounding fake he knew i couldnt prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it hadnt been just nivia who was conveniently dead it was her weretiger that had tried to kill peter a human again conveniently dead son of a bitch i said softly excuse me marshal i have a warrant of execution and it works just fine for you and your mistress but if you use it knowing that we did not do these crimes then you are a murderer perhaps you will never be tried as such but you will know that you have abused your powers and simply killed to protect your master like a good human servant but not a very good federal marshal youve done your homework i said micah was beside me now i held up a hand so he wouldnt try to talk to me i glanced back and found nathaniel still talking to zerbrowski whatever he was saying had the sergeants full attention we know you are honorable and your master is honorable we will not harm malcolm or his people we will simply challenge him for them and use only legal means to win the challenge avery seabrook is already bloodoathed to jeanclaude hes off limits very well but the others are no ones flock malcolm gave them to jeanclaude we havent bloodoathed them yet but they are ours lies do not become you marshal blake can you taste a lie in my voice i have that ability fine then listen carefully giovanni malcolm gave his entire congregation to jeanclaude and me they belong to the master of the city of st louis now you can defeat malcolm with your vampire wiles but it wont win you shit by vampire law you have to defeat the master that owns them before you can oath them to you he was quiet for a second i heard him breathing which isnt a vampire thing he was human somehow he was her human servant he had more powers than most human servants but then so did i i hear truth in your words but i heard truth in malcolms speech to my mistress only moments ago she forced him to tell truthfully if jeanclaude had a claim to his congregation he said jeanclaude did not you underestimated malcolms powers giovanni he got a message to us and you have a church full of legal american citizens with rights you have a church full of vampires who belong to the master of the city of st louis and they have rights under vampire law too youve been very careful that my status as a police officer isnt invoked here ill hold you to vampire law just as tight as human law you break either of them and i will rain all over your parade but as the laws constrain us they also constrain you anita blake yeah yeah you and the horse you rode in on i dont understand we have no horses sorry its slang i mean that i understand what you said and im not impressed malcolm used your young vampire here to somehow give you this message didnt he i dont have to give you information not by either set of laws true he said but if my mistress bloodoaths enough of these vampires then she will have enough power to defeat jeanclaude youre harlequin you cant kill anyone without giving them a black mask first we are not attacking as harlequin my mistress has grown weary of being a tool for the council she wishes to have her own lands in this new country of yours jeanclaude was harder to destroy with vampire powers than she anticipated youre supposed to give a formal challenge before you start battling to take over did jeanclaude give a formal challenge to nikolaos the old master of the city before you slew her for him i took a breath then didnt try to say anything truthfully i hadnt realized that killing nikolaos would make him master id just been trying to stay alive and keep her from killing other people but it had opened the way for jeanclaude to own the city saying it had been an accident would make us sound weak so i shut my mouth and tried to think micah was on his own cell phone i heard him say jeanclaude had micah heard enough to tell jeanclaude what he needed to know ill take that as a no giovanni said i thought the harlequin couldnt have a territory of their own theyre supposed to be neutral we grow weary of this wandering life we wish for a home you could petition jeanclaude to join his kiss my mistress wishes to rule not to serve i started walking toward the exit whatever we were going to do we needed to be at that church we needed to stop whatever they had planned somehow i didnt think they were done with their bid for power in st louis the council has forbidden war between master vamps in america right now only if the fight cannot be kept secret my master is confident this will be settled tonight quietly overconfidence giovanni itll get you killed nathaniel was alone at the end of the hallway i didnt know where zerbrowski had run off to but it was just as well i wasnt sure what my face looked like but i knew i didnt look happy i didnt want to lie to him and so far this was a party for monsters not cops we will try our powers against each vampire here in turn those that cannot withstand us will be bloodoathed to columbine you cant bloodoath someone elses vamps its against the rules think of it as the beginning of the duel between your master and mine the phone went dead shit i said micah handed me his phone its jeanclaude ive told him its the harlequin and its the church i took the phone and started talking jeanclaude listened and asked a few questions here and there maybe he felt my urgency over the phone or maybe hed spent too many centuries dealing with exactly this kind of shit will you bring human police ill bring edward and olaf but i dont know about the rest i cant prove theyve broken any human laws i will leave it to your discretion whether a he would be useful here you mean use the warrant even if im not certain she did it it is your honor that is at stake not my own i will call the wereanimals and my vampires be careful ma petite you too he hung up i stopped walking my pulse was suddenly in my throat panic screamed through me i was sure certain i would get everyone killed if i took the cops theyd die if i didnt invite the cops my other friends would die i couldnt do this i looked at micah this could turn into a hostage situation and im not trained for that theyve got a few hundred people in there what if i get them killed what if i make the wrong choice micah searched my face with his gaze first you need to shield better because this kind of selfdoubt isnt like you second she doesnt want them dead she wants to bloodoath them and that means she wants them healthy i nodded youre right youre right the tremble of panic in my gut was still there he was so right id had vampires mess with my mind before in all sorts of ways but mercias power was almost the most awful because it made you have to feel your own emotions intensified until you almost couldnt stand it i think id have rather dealt with a good oldfashioned attempt to control me with her thoughts than this emotional rape why isnt it affecting you i asked i dont think shes targeted me yet she targeted graham how did she know to target him soledad scouted for her maybe he said i nodded right right nathaniel came up to us alone i asked where did zerbrowski go i got him talking about the party at his house i asked what food his wife wanted us to bring i think hes more worried about you bringing us both to the party than he admits because it distracted him from your supersecret phone call whats really happening i told him im afraid no matter what cops i send in shell mindfuck them its so subtle she just emphasizes what youre already feeling it seems not to activate the holy items because shes not adding anything nathaniel said what i asked we all looked at him shes not putting power into you shes giving more power to whats already inside you maybe thats why the holy objects dont go off i smiled at him when did you get so smart he shrugged but looked pleased what if we call out mobile reserve and she fucks their minds i cant guarantee that she wont turn them against each other or more likely the congregation and once i call them they sort of take over ill lose control of the situation im not sure you have control of the situation now micah said thanks i said he touched my shoulder gently anita what youre really trying to decide is is it the police you need to be backup or is it jeanclaudes vampires and our shapeshifters i nodded youre right you are exactly right that is what im trying to decide wont zerbrowski and the rest of the uniforms suspect something when you run out of here nathaniel asked i have nearly total discretion on how any warrant of execution is served i dont have to include any other police but the harlequin have fixed it so that the warrant really isnt in effect here its a shame you cant deputize civilians like in the old movies nathaniel said i had the grace to look embarrassed i was sort of disappointed i couldnt do that too it would have been so damn convenient whatever you are going to do it has to be done now micah said i felt paralyzed i couldnt decide it wasnt like me in an emergency i stepped away from both of them so they werent touching me i took a deep calming breath and another all i could think about was how id almost gotten peter killed he might be a lycanthrope at sixteen would i get malcolm killed i didnt want to risk anyone else i couldnt bear the thought of zerbrowski dead and having to face his family i couldnt hands grabbed me and i was suddenly staring up into nathaniels face i can feel it he said shes shoving doubt into you his hands gripped my arms tight his face was so intense i was suddenly filled with certainty a certainty built of unshakable faith he believed in me he believed in me utterly and completely i tried to be frightened that anyone would believe so perfectly in me but the fear could not last on the tide of his belief he simply knew that i would do what was right he knew that i would save malcolm he knew that i would punish the bad and save the good he simply believed it was one of the most comforting things id ever felt there was a small part of me that screamed in the background his faith isnt in god its in you again i tried to be afraid or struggle against it but i couldnt i felt his certainty and there was no room for doubt in it i stared up at him and smiled thank you i said he gave me that smile the one that he might have had if his life had been gentler it was a smile that hed only found in the last few months id helped him find that smile me and micah micah came to stand close to us but made no move to touch the power is coming off you in waves it feels similar to what happens when you touch damian sometimes i nodded and looked back at nathaniel id never wondered what id gained from nathaniel being my animal to call damian as my vampire servant gave me his control honed over centuries of being at the mercy of one of the most sadistic vampire masters id ever heard of which was saying something pretty terrible id never thought to ask what jeanclaude gained from richard from me a certain ruthlessness we sort of doubled our natural practicality when wed all survived tonight id ask what he gained from richard but in that moment i simply kissed the man in my arms kissed him not for lust though that was always there but because no one else could have made me believe in myself chapter fortyone i thought id have trouble ditching the police but no one wanted to play with me i got nervous glances from some of them or ignored or even downright hostile stares no one questioned where i was going with micah and nathaniel none of the officers were ones that i knew well but it was still unnerving helpful in that moment but it didnt bode well for future police work they think youre one of us micah whispered and it makes that much difference to them i said apparently yes he said nathaniel hugged me onearmed as we walked past the people who had come here because a cop had been hurt theyd come because i was one of them the looks on their faces said clearly that i wasnt one of them anymore did it hurt my feelings yeah it did but id worry about my reputation later right now there was a fight to finish i realized i was about to walk out without the only police backup id be taking edward and oddly olaf i didnt want to be in a car with olaf the space was too small to share with him as if id thought too hard about him he walked through the doors of the exit edward was right behind him but for a moment olaf looked at me for a moment i saw his eyes bare no hiding the look in his eyes on his face stopped my breath in my throat there were so many things to be afraid of tonight but in that instant i was afraid of olaf truly and completely afraid micah started to step in front of me doing that guyprotection thing with almost anyone else id have let him do it but not for olaf i moved so that micah was beside me where hed started i stepped out in front of both my men so that the only target for olafs eyes was me me he liked he didnt like my boyfriends they were just in his way call it a hunch but i was betting that people who were just in olafs way didnt last long his eyes changed from that look that would haunt me to something that was almost almost admiration in some strange way i understood him better than most edward understood him too it should have worried both of us that we understood someone like olaf edward hurried to get ahead of the bigger man he was talking as he walked i think you need to get out there and rescue your friend from the lieutenant what friend graham he said and edwards eyes melted around the edges showing me the anger that was underneath anger about peter anger about olaf anger about what i couldnt ask and when i got a chance later hed probably lie anyway edward took my arm something he had never done that i could remember he took me by the elbow like i was a girl and needed to be led i might have protested except i caught sight of olafs face he watched edward touch me touch me like i was a girl which hed never seen before because it wasnt how edward touched me ever i was a lot of things to edward but i was never a girl edward led me past the looming presence of olaf micah and nathaniel trailed us olaf watched us with a considering look on his face i was through the doors and into the cold of the parking lot beyond before i realized that edward had done what i wouldnt let micah do hed protected me put himself between me and olaf it hadnt been as obvious as micahs attempt but i didnt pull free of edward even after i figured it out of all the men i knew edward could handle himself even against giantsized serial killers graham was a big guy knew it liked it but standing beside dolph he looked small it made me wonder for a second how tiny i must look standing beside dolph edward let go of my elbow as we got to the argument it wasnt quite a fight yet but it had the feel of something that might turn into one we didnt have time for this shit jeanclaude and his vampires were on their way to the church we had to go since when does a federal marshal need a bodyguard dolph asked his voice deepening with anger his big hands were already curled into fists the energy of grahams beast was trailing the air like tiny searching hands pats and tickles of energy touched my skin nathaniel shivered beside me micah would control it better but hed feel it too the fact that it was only small touches of power meant graham was really fighting to control himself i wasnt so sure the same could be said of dolph edward let me walk a little ahead of everyone so that i stood just out of reach but close enough to be heard by dolph and graham hey dolph ill take graham off your hands dolph gave me a glance but didnt seem to want to look away from the man in front of him id seen him try to pick a fight once with jason it hadnt worked because jason didnt get upset that easily graham did detective smith walked up beside me he was rubbing his arms as if he were cold it was december but it wasnt that kind of cold smith was psychically gifted no specific ability that i knew of but he sensed lycanthropes and other otherworldly stuff standing out here with an arguing werewolf had probably not been comfy for him but smith was a good sport lieutenant i think marshal blake is leaving shell take her guard with her and that way you wont have to worry about what hes doing here smith made his voice light trying to sound harmless he was pretty good at harmless not much taller than me blond hair young for his age he was the newest detective on the squad where was zerbrowski he was the best at managing dolphs moods i want to know why a federal marshal needs a bodyguard dolph said through gritted teeth graham looked at me the look said what do i say unless i was willing to fess up to being jeanclaudes human servant or richards lupa i didnt know what to say i seldom lie well if i dont see the lie coming a long way off micah stepped into the charged silence its my fault lieutenant i love her and she almost died im sorry if my hiring graham to be by her side upset you but i know youre married im sure you understand how frightened i was when i saw her lying in that bed sometimes i forgot how smoothly micah could lie of course the only real lie in the mix was that he had hired graham personally the rest was probably true you arent married to anita micahs been living with me for seven months talk to me when youve made a year he said you were always onto me to find a steady boyfriend who had a pulse i found one so now whats your problem when did humans stop being good enough for you anita i shook my head and made a pushaway gesture im not having this fight tonight dolph come on graham lets go we went dolph didnt have any reason to hold us except his hatred of the monsters but being hated isnt against the law good to know chapter fortytwo edward drove into the parking lot of the church of eternal life with olaf riding beside him id opted to sit in the middle seat with micah and nathaniel graham was in the back by himself edward hadnt even questioned why i let olaf ride shotgun i think he didnt want to watch olaf stare at me either it takes a lot to creep out edward but whatever olaf had done while i was cut open had done it the parking lot was so full that we had to park illegally close to the small green area with its benches and growing trees in the december cold it was a bleak little space or maybe my reaction was partly that the last time id stepped on the churchs grass id shot a vampire to death with a handgun it takes longer with a handgun they tend to squirm and cry not one of my best memories i shivered in the short leather jacket that nathaniel had brought for me the jacket would have been warmer if id been willing to zip it up but i wanted to be able to get to my weapons more than i wanted to be warm you could tell who was carrying weapons by whose coat was flapping open in the winter cold nathaniel was zipped tight but hed continued his matching theme with his short leather jacket so we still looked like we were going to a goth club prom the disturbing part was that olaf matched us black on black leather jacket boots nathaniel had zipped up olaf hadnt micah had belted his lined trench coat grahams leather was fastened tight too the church rose above us white and bare the lack of decoration always made the church seem unfinished to me no holy objects allowed when most of your congregation are vampires we walked up those wide white steps to the double doors graham insisted on opening the doors for us i didnt have patience to argue and i was pretty certain edward didnt argue because he knew cannon fodder when he saw it he was hardtokill cannon fodder but graham wasnt armed and i wasnt in love with him from edwards point of view it changed how he would treat him truthfully me too i wanted everyone to come out alive tonight but if it came to choices who you loved counted if youre not willing to admit that out loud inside your own head then you should stay out of firefights and keep your family at home be honest who would you save who would you sacrifice we let graham swing wide those double doors he didnt even try to take cover he stood framed in the light his body dark with that nimbus of brightness around it he turned back to me with a smile as if hed done a good thing i said a prayer that graham didnt get himself killed tonight yeah we were supposed to be doing metaphysical battle no weapons but there were ways to kill with metaphysics id seen it done hell id done it a time or two illegal that if its a human that dies i wont tell if you wont nathaniel reached for my left hand he was warm warmer than he should have been fever warm but there was no sweat on his palm it wasnt nerves it was power it climbed up my arm across my body in a wave of heat that made my skin dance in goose bumps i made a small stumble on the steps micah grabbed my arm he meant it to be helpful but the power leapt from me to him and it wasnt a power meant for him damian was meant to be on the other side of me for this he was meant to cool this fire but micahs was never a magic that cooled me down the power found the only thing it could recognize it found his beast i could actually see his leopard roaring up inside him like a black flame roaring to life spilling upward inside him micah could control it but the velvet pouring of his beast brought mine i was caught between two wereleopards there was no other animal to distract my beasts i almost screamed it not now olafs deep voice said what is that i didnt have time to look around and see if there was something else coming edward would take care of it i believed that micah managed to tear himself away from my arm he went to his knees on the steps as if he were having more trouble than normal controlling his own beast it wasnt close to full moon it shouldnt have been such an effort graham was coming toward us he was coming in a blur of speed but my leopard was rising faster it was tearing its way up through my body i needed to cool this heat i almost reached for jeanclaude he was vampire he was the chill of the grave but he never affected me that way he was always passion to me i needed to think i reached for my other vampire i reached out to damian i reached out with desperation i screamed in my head save me save us kill this heat i felt him stagger when my call hit him i knew someone grabbed his arm to keep him from falling but my power hit him and he gave me what i demanded he gave me that coolness that utter control that he had learned in years of servitude to the master that created him he gave me the control that had helped him survive and betray nothing by thought word deed or glance he gave me that control in a sweep of cold steely willpower the visual in my head was of my leopard finding a metal wall in her path she snarled at it and reacted like any selfrespecting leopard would if a giant wall suddenly appeared in the forest path she ran the leopard ran back the way she had come to hide in that empty full dark place where all the beasts seemed to wait inside me it was like the blackness of space before the light found it except it was inside me somewhere i dont explain the show sometimes i just watch it a womans voice half singing beautiful and pure and strangely joyous spoke from inside the open doors let it begin at last our contest jeanclaude your servant has struck the first blow i yelled it was an accident but it was too late i had done metaphysics either she didnt realize how little control i had over some of my powers or she was using it as an excuse to start the fight either way shit graham offered me his hand and i took it he dragged me and nathaniel up off the steps his hand in mine was just a hand just warmth maybe he wasnt armed and maybe he didnt understand how to take cover but in that moment no one else with us could have dragged me to my feet without complicating things i looked up and found edward with his hand on olafs stomach or lower chest olaf would have helped me off the steps and edward had stopped it he looked at me and the look was enough they werent psychic enough to tell the difference between beasts rising and the ardeur rising not in its early stages edward didnt want to have it spread to him and he was going to make certain it didnt spread to olaf i pushed the thought away into that crowded cage that all the other thoughts had gone into for the last few days and hours think about it later we were running up the steps graham had my right hand but we werent supposed to be pulling guns tonight right chapter fortythree faces turned to us as we stumbled through the door there was no vestibule so the three of us were just suddenly in view of the crowd nathaniel and i were breathing as if wed run a mile only graham was calm at my side edward and olaf fanned out to either side of us micah moved wide around us all was he still fighting off his beast i trusted him to handle it i had to trust him because there were things happening that i didnt trust anyone else to handle the area behind the pulpit had become a stage there were three people on stage in masks what could only be columbine and giovanni were to the left she was elegant in a skintight version of the harlequins motley all red blue white black and gold with a short half skirt to pretend at modesty a gold tricorn hat had multicolored balls to echo the colors of the rest her mask left a white chin and crimson mouth bare the man beside her was much taller than she was dressed in a white mask like the one theyd sent us in the first box his face was an empty blankness trapped in the black hooded cloak that covered him to his ankles a black tricorn hat completed the outfit they stood in a contrast of bright and dark color and not the third masked figure was on our side of the stage standing beside jeanclaude and his vampires damian and malcolm were close at his side behind asher but the last masked figure wasnt a vampire he looked more like he was about to do bondage than go to carnival the mask was leather and hid most of the face covering even the back of the head a hood instead of a mask it was the broad shoulders framed by the leather vest and the slightly paler version of his summer tan that let me know it was richard hed come to stand at jeanclaudes side after all jake and some of the other bodyguard werewolves stood behind him asher stood on the other side of jeanclaude his hair catching the lights like spun gold remus and a handful of other werehyenas stood behind him most of jeanclaudes vampires were scattered around the stage but elinore and a few others werent there because jeanclaude had made them stay away if we died tonight and managed to take the harlequin with us he trusted elinore to rebuild the citys vampires truth and wicked were there along with haven and his werelions rafael and his wererats were there on the stage there was an ocean of wereanimals around our side of the stage the two harlequin looked so outnumbered part of me was sad that it wasnt going to be a standup fight it looked like we might win that kind of fight of course the harlequin standing in the church had scouted us they knew our resources maybe there was more than one reason theyd offered a metaphysical fight instead of a physical one my pulse had started to slow we started up the aisle graham a little ahead of us all nathaniel and i still hand in hand micah was still giving us room id have loved to touch him but he was right we didnt need another visit from our leopards edward and olaf brought up the rear i thought wed get to the stage i thought id get to touch jeanclaude and damian but columbine thought otherwise her power poured over the congregation like invisible smoke my breath caught in my throat i felt her power touch some of the vampires they were choking on her power i was choking on her power i dropped nathaniels hand and grabbed for the back of a pew whatever was happening i didnt want it spreading to nathaniel anita he said whats wrong i feel power but i shook my head i couldnt talk past the feel of her power it was almost delicate like choking on feathers light airy and deadly vampires were standing in the pews or falling to the floor i fought to stand and stared at the vampire in her colored clown outfit if something that elegant could be called a clown i realized i wasnt choking it wasnt death the power offered but it was the end of free will her will was so large so powerful that it would be slavery i could feel it she would control us as surely as i could control a zombie that i had raised her power was something close to mine she could control vampires so why was it hitting me this hard her power was a dainty fingertip sticking into my mind pushing against my will be mine it whispered be mine nathaniel touched me his power shivered over my skin chasing back that cold touch i could think again feel again take a deep breath again my own power roared to life my necromancy and something else something that was necromancy and not i thrust that power into the delicate coaxing touch there was nothing delicate about what i did i smashed into her power with a hammer straight through that deceptive softness hit it and found the steel nail underneath the lie of gentleness it was all lies there was nothing gentle nothing kind submit the power breathed be mine ill take care of you ill take away all your problems be mine i screamed down those lying words i drowned her voice in my head in sheer power like dynamiting a hotel because you didnt like your room her power collapsed retreated and i was suddenly standing in the aisle when i hadnt realized id moved i was standing with nathaniels hand in mine i could taste pulses blood flowing sluggish in a dozen veins vampires turned and looked at me because they had no choice id smashed her power and replaced it with my own the dozen vamps hadnt fed yet tonight so slow the beat so sluggish the pulse we needed food nathaniels hand convulsed around mine bringing me back from that thought had he shared it i could suddenly smell their skin half a dozen different perfumes someones sweet shampoo the sharp scent of cigarettes aftershave i could smell their skin as if id put my face just above their arms their necks jeanclaude had kept me from drowning in the sensations of them last time id come to the church why wasnt he helping me now i turned to the stage and found him looking not at me but at columbine and giovanni something was happening were they talking i couldnt hear them it was as if all my senses were narrowed down to scent and touch and vision i felt her power draw inward like youd take a breath before blowing out a candle except this candle was a few hundred vampires that power spilled outward and it was like water moving around the rocks of the vampires that nathaniel and i could sense we could save them but the rest the rest were lost damian cried out in my head a scream nathaniel and i turned and found malcolm wrapped around damian malcolms mouth shoved into damians throat malcolm shoved his power into the less powerful vampire but taking his blood meant he was bloodoathing to him it made no sense then the power hit us hit me it was like a door blew open inside my head nathaniel cried out and i echoed him my power our power blew outward over the other vampires malcolm had created almost every vampire in here he had trusted no one else now he bloodoathed himself not to damian but to me he was using his power to send mine over the rest of his flock he was giving them all to me to keep columbine from taking them but i think malcolm didnt understand what bloodoathing to me could mean maybe he thought that blooding himself to me and not jeanclaude would make it a weaker bond but id never bloodoathed someone without jeanclaudes guidance i only knew one way to do anything and that was all the way in one of those moments that lasts forever and is the blink of an eye i saw inside malcolms mind he had thought me the lesser evil he had thought he could control me and retain some control of his people it wasnt words but more pictures like some dream shorthand if dreams could slap you as they ran across your mind id always wondered if malcolms motives were as pure as they seemed id assumed it was a bid for power all vampires wanted power but i saw him holding his people cradling them while they wept i saw him plunging fangs into their throats to give them that third bite i felt him treat it as a holy thing a ceremony as pure in his own heart as the marriage of a nun to god it was his fault that the joining was so complete his power thrusting into mine and not understanding that my necromancy was like the biggest gravity well that any vampire would ever touch it sucked him in and i could not stop it but i was of belle mortes line and all our talents are doubleedged blades i felt his power dive as deep inside me as mine in him and i couldnt keep it out and it wasnt just my mind nathaniels and damians memories flooded to the surface nathaniel as a little boy a man holding his hand food for a hungry stomach then hands where malcolm broke the memory before he went further he understood that i could not steer us through these waters he couldnt break what was happening but his centuries of being a master helped us skim along the surface and not drown damian on the deck of a ship in the sunlight the wind was so fresh the sea smelled so good the darkness of his creators dungeon that dark stairway the screams the smells malcolm drew us away from it my mothers funeral and i drew us away from that it was like blinking you see something you dont want to see and you blink and look away you look away and theres another picture malcolm thought of his congregation and just like that we had images to go with the scents and tactile explosion in our heads i knew that the girl who smelled of soap and some sweet shampoo wanted to go to college but was fighting to get enough nighttime classes to complete her degree i knew that the family of vampires was trying for a house in a neighborhood that did not want them i knew that the child was the master of the house malcolm gave us the problems and hopes what we gave him back was the scent of their skin the finger brush along a collar a dozen different aftershaves twenty different perfumes from powdery sweetness to an herbal cleanness that was almost bitter we gave him back sighs as our power swept over them we gave him back upturned faces as they shivered at the touch of power that was more sensuous than anything malcolm had shown them it didnt have to be sexual but it was a dance of the senses to be touched by belles line of vampires was to understand that someones breath against your arm just your arm could cover your body in shivers malcolm drew back from damians neck like a drowning man surfacing we all came to the surface of that binding nathaniel and i ended in a heap on the carpeted aisle hands had to catch damian or he would have fallen you have not saved them malcolm when i wrest them from you you will come with them like a dog on a leash the voice was clear and belllike echoing to the ends of the big church i didnt think it was vampire powers it was more like a voice that had been trained centuries before microphones existed jeanclaude touched malcolm to keep the other vampire from answering he answered with a voice that sounded almost ordinary compared to columbines it was as bland and empty as his voice got but somehow it filled the room we bargained that you would duel the first to use magic ma petite my servant did not know these rules we also promised not to use our servants to bolster our powers she said so i was not allowed to contact her mindtomind you might have plotted behind my back but you did not attack ma petite you struck at the congregation that seems as if you have broken the bargain first his voice held a shiver at the end and the entire congregation reacted to it shuddering they began to gaze at him some reluctantly but they heard him now felt him now in that moment i understood that malcolm had been right in one thing bloodoathing to me was bloodoathing to jeanclaude blood of my blood and all that your servant was using her leopards and her vampire i could have reached out to my servant giovanni but i kept to our bargain but if she was allowed to gain power from others then it seemed fair that i could do the same you can feed off the combined power of all the vampires jeanclaude made it a statement yes she said and sounded pleased with herself edward and olaf were standing on either side of us like good bodyguards it was micah who knelt and asked are you safe to touch i knew what he meant will whatever metaphysical crap is happening spread by touch i think im safe to touch he grabbed my elbow and lifted effortlessly graham offered nathaniel a hand we both swayed a little but we were upright yea columbine had meant to own the congregation and use them like a battery to make her own powers greater great enough to win a fight with jeanclaude maybe but now they were mine and through me jeanclaudes you are too late malcolm said i have given them to my master oh such bonds when fresh are not so firm she said bold words columbine jeanclaude said and his voice slid over my skin nathaniel shivered beside me i felt two hundred vampires or more react to that voice one vampire cried out malcolm save us from this lecher and his whore i turned and found the man who had spoken he was staring at malcolm his hand out beseeching i started to be angry but then sensed a thought and i could feel his fear jeanclaudes voice had made this heterosexual mans body react just the voice ordinary words jeanclaude wasnt even trying not yet how would i feel if it were a female vamp the thought made me think of belle morte shed done a lot more than use voice powers on me the thought brought heat in a rush up my face i burned at the thought of her body her hands on me then i could taste her mouth the sweetness of her lipstick the silk of her skin clung to my fingertips so that i rubbed them against the leather of my coat to get some other sensation but it didnt help the feel of her skin clung to my fingers like a cobweb that i could not brush away nathaniel started to touch me but i jerked back i was shaking my head i held my hands out to all of them and was backing down the aisle i needed jeanclaude or asher i needed someone who understood her power better than i did maybe it was just a reaction to what she had done to me in dream but i couldnt count on that if she was going to try to take me over i needed to be near someone who could help me fight i dont know if columbine understood what was happening or thought it was the ardeur but she seemed to think it was an opening a weakness she attacked the congregation again but what shed done before had been a feint shed just been pretending to try her power cut through the vampires like a burning sword where it touched they screamed and the ties that bound them to me to jeanclaude seared away it was as if she literally could cut the metaphysical bonds like rope that was too fragile to hold one of the vampires she cut free stumbled into the aisle and fell on all fours at my feet shrieking i couldnt feel what she was feeling but apparently it hurt a man reached out gray eyes wide he screamed master help me he didnt reach toward malcolm or jeanclaude he was inches away and he reached for me i took his hand i didnt even think about it his hand was bigger than mine so it was his hand that encircled mine but the moment he touched me he stopped screaming he came out of the pew and wrapped himself around me he held me as if i were the last safe thing in the world i hugged him back tight and the feel of belle mortes skin faded under the muscled realness of the man in my arms the girl on the floor crawled to me touched my leg she stopped screaming she wrapped herself around our legs the nameless vampire and me i was of belle mortes line i knew how to stop the pain i knew how to bring them back and make them mine i raised my face to the grayeyed man he bent toward me folded his tall frame downward i held his face in my hands and went up on tiptoe his mouth found mine and we kissed his lips were dry nervous afraid but i did something id never been able to do before i was able to draw a little bit of the ardeur i understood as if the light had finally dawned that the ardeur didnt have to be an ocean it could be a single drop of rain to wet the lips i gave that tiny bit of power to him breathed it into his mouth i found the broken piece inside him that columbine had cut she had cut it with pain and force and offered them a warning she had showed them torture fire to burn and destroy them if they refused her i offered a kiss i offered gentleness i offered love if i hadnt tasted malcolms power only moments before maybe i couldnt have done it but his intent was so pure so unselfish that it was like the ardeur had learned a new flavor i offered that flavor to them i offered them a choice i gave them cool water and safety she offered terror and punishment she was threat i was promise i won them back with a kiss a touch they poured from the pews and i moved among them damian and nathaniel helped me moving into the crowd touching a kiss here and there there was a gentleness to the ardeur that i had never felt before columbines power died under a wave of kindness a wave of touch and chaste kisses a wave of offering help we will save you we will take away your pain she should have remembered that people have given everything they own everything they are to be taken care of and to have their pain gone its the lure of cults the promise of a good family its what people think love is but love isnt absence of pain its a hand to hold while youre going through it columbine screamed her frustration and she broke the pact she reached out to giovanni i felt her touch him not the hand that she took but her power the power that we had been pushing back suddenly took a leap i felt it like a huge tidal wave rising above us i turned and looked up as if there should be something to see but there was nothing then that nothingness hit it was like standing in the middle of a whirlwind of fire every breath was agony death but you had to breathe power seared down my throat and i fought to scream but there was no air there was nothing but pain a voice came out of that pain and said i will make the pain stop be mine and it will stop i screamed my defiance to that voice in my head but it was the kind of pain that eventually would break you eventually youd simply say yes anything everything just to make it stop vaguely i felt the carpet of the floor underneath me i knew i was writhing on it but the pain ate all other sensations my vision ran in streamers sliding images as if my eyes could not see past the pain hands tried to hold me down but my body wouldnt be still it hurt too much to be still the voice in my head said let go and it will feel so good just let go let go they are strangers to you let me have them anita let them go i didnt even know who them was there was nothing but the pain and some part of me that would not give in it was as if everything underneath my skin had turned to fire and was trying to burn its way out hands held me down and there were enough hands that i had to feel them they were firm and real and it was like an anchor in the pain i could feel the hands feel that they were real which meant light burning light the sun dazzled my eyes and i burned i screamed and something covered my mouth lips a kiss and down that kiss was the sweet musk of leopard my leopard rose to that scent the sun was warm and good not a burning thing i rose with micahs beast two black furred creatures that writhed and danced and rose up and up toward the light the pain fell away as i remembered fur and claw and teeth and meat i wasnt a vampire not really i was nothing that she could make burn her power only worked on the dead i was reminded that i was very much alive i blinked up into micahs face from inches away he was lying on top of me his hands trapping my face between them i couldnt turn my head to see who was leaning weight on my arms and legs but there were a lot of hands i smelled wolf and hyena and human i scented the air before i tried to see who was holding me down micah stared down at me with his leopard eyes anita he said my name like a question im here i whispered micah crawled off of me i could see edward on my right arm now olaf was on my right leg and remus was on my left leg graham was on my left arm i turned back to the men who were still pinning me you can let me up now not yet edward said i realized he was up on all fours putting his full body weight on just the one arm i wondered how hard he had had to work to hold me down you acted as if you were about to shift remus said from where he had my left leg pinned if there is another animal left we cannot let go olaf said the big man almost as big in human form as grahams animal form seemed very serious about holding my leg down i think the strength had impressed even olaf what the hell had i done i wanted to argue but the looks on everyones face said that i had scared them or at least impressed them all impressed in a bad way nothing i could say would make them let up but i so did not want to be spreadeagled on the ground held down sort of helpless in the middle of a fight our servants have fought jeanclaude and mine is still standing but ma petite won columbine she withstood giovannis power all the pain you caused her and she did not let you use her to own the other vampires they are still mine you cannot feed upon their powers as you had planned i could turn my head and see jeanclaude on the stage but columbine was just a voice out of sight i needed to be at his side call it a hunch but bad things were coming you could feel it in the air someone has talked out of turn she said i felt your power columbine felt it forming them into a great fire to feed your power no one had to bear tales for me to understand what you meant to do you can take other vampires and make of their powers one great weapon yes she said but ma petite stopped you from taking these little vampires and forming them into your army your source of power what will you do now that you cannot win power in this way his voice breathed through my head you beside me would be well ma petite i whispered trying let me up boys power breathed through the church it sought to feed your doubts no to feed on them id met vampires who could feed on lust on fear but never one who fed on doubt dear god she fed on it and she could cause it just like the vamps who fed off lust and fear i was suddenly overwhelmed with the certainty that we would lose everyone was going to die and there was nothing i could do about it god remus almost moaned it he had his head in his hands edward and olaf seemed the least affected micah reached out to me i let him draw me into the circle of his arms let myself sink into the strength of him but the doubts didnt go away i was suffocating in my doubts people cried out some begged for it to stop i heard one man say anything anything just stop it stop it there was more than one way to win this fight nathaniel crawled to us he reached out head hanging down i touched his hand and a surge of power knocked back the doubts he raised his face and gave me the full look of those beautiful eyes his face brightened like the sun coming from behind a cloud he said i believe in you i drew him into the circle of micahs body you make me believe in myself as it had earlier nathaniels touch chased back the doubts his unwavering certainty kept us both safe from her even sitting in the room with her her doubts could not get past the certainty that nathaniel gave me damian crawled to us i think partially the doubts assailed him but also he was a vampire the burning illusion of being consumed by the sun had hit him too i could feel his pain and the double pain of the memory of watching his best friend die in the sunlight his tie to me let him be in sunlight and not burn but the terror of the light made him unable to enjoy it sunlight was death period end of story he was remembering watching his friends skin peel away under the heat of a summer day nathaniel grabbed his wrist i took his hand and we pulled him into the circle of our arms the moment we touched him he shuddered but raised a tearstained face her power is terrible you would do anything to make it stop i nodded the crowd was still crying for help for it to stop if theyd set up similar rules to the last challenger jeanclaude had had then it was winning over the crowd that would decide it an actual member of the vampire council had come to town he was the earthmover he could cause earthquakes with his power to save the city and keep the destruction to a minimum jeanclaude had gotten him to agree that they would fight with less destructive powers and one of the tests would be which one could sway the audience at the circus of the damned if victory was in getting this crowd on our side we were about to lose i tried to feel jeanclaude through his own marks but he kept me out i got one hard glimpse of him drowning in doubt but they werent his doubts they were richards poor richard hed come to support jeanclaude but he was so full of selfdoubt that he was hurting him hurting them both jeanclaude shielded so i wouldnt feel it that left him and richard trapped in richards version of hell i got to my feet still holding on to nathaniel and damian micah stood with us but let his hands fall away i told him i love you i love you too now go go to jeanclaude we started hurrying toward the stage jeanclaude needed to touch someone who had no doubts about him or themselves with nathaniels hand in mine i had enough certainty to share chapter fortyfour we hit the stage at a run and i fell into jeanclaudes arms i fell into his arms with nathaniel in my right hand and damian in my left jeanclaude staggered under the combined weight or the momentum asher helped steady him hands on his back to help him stay upright richard was on all fours head down he never looked up as we stumbled into jeanclaudes arms and asher held us all for a moment jeanclaude wrapped his arms around me i felt ashers strength at his back at our backs helping us steadying us i looked up into jeanclaudes face into those midnight blue eyes nathaniel wrapped his arms around jeanclaude me and asher i think asher would have moved back but there was no time damian kept my hand but knelt by richard he touched the fallen mans shoulder nathaniel and i gave jeanclaude certainty a rock to build upon damian shared his coldness with richard his utter control i felt both emotions in a rush of power that danced through my body and into jeanclaudes and ashers behind him richard cried out his head coming up his hand grabbing damians arm like a drowning man taking the last help offered i felt damians coldness rush over richards panic and turn to a wall of ice he gave richard defenses to hide behind he pulled richard to his feet and they stood there hands on each others arms like a version of the guygreeting that friends use sometimes when a handshake wont do but theyre too manly to hug damian kept my hand in his but he and richard were outside the circle of everyone elses arms they were relieved to be outside the circle of the other men richards fear flared he wasnt just afraid of columbine and her servant he was afraid of jeanclaude and me and asher it was one of those tooclose glimpses that we sometimes got into each others minds it was damian who cut off the sensation damian who blocked the fear with his own iron selfcontrol hed had centuries of learning to control fear when he was the plaything of a master vampire who could raise fear in another and feed on it as columbine fed on doubt we must win the crowd mes amis like when the earthmover came to town i asked he nodded arms tightening around me i knew why the hug the earthmover had won only his trying to make me his human servant trying to make me kill jeanclaude for him had given me the chance to kill him instead i pressed my face against the stiffness of jeanclaudes lacy shirt id almost broken him of the oldfashioned lace but tonight hed dressed as i first found him all frothy white lace and black velvet jacket only the leather pants showed he knew what century he was in i pressed my free hand against his side underneath the jacket held the line of his body and was afraid i dont know who the earthmover was nathaniel said but just tell me what to do and ill do it if more of us were submissive things would go so much faster asher said it made me smile though the smile was lost against jeanclaudes shirt you arent one of us richard said and his voice was hostile we must unite richard or we will lose this night jeanclaude said he is not your animal to call or your servant i dont have to play nice with him asher started to move away but nathaniel tightened his arm held him in place dont go let me go boy the wolf is right i am no ones darling his voice held sadness like the taste of rain on your tongue lifetimes of sorrow in that one tone our certainty does not travel outside our triumvirates jeanclaude said even our wolf is drowning how can we save all the others if we cannot even save ourselves his voice was an echo of ashers full of sorrow so that my throat closed with it and i thought id choke on unshed tears fight damn you claudia came up to the edge of the stage tears stained her face her emotions were so raw it looked like physical pain fight for us dont just roll over and give that bitch your throat malcolm came to stand on the other side of richard fight for us jeanclaude fight for us anita he looked directly at richard richard suddenly looked wrong in the leather mask he didnt look cool in the leather outfit he looked like he was doing exactly what he was doing he was hiding the rest of us stood there in plain view only the bad guys and richard were hiding who and what they were from the world malcolm gripped his shoulder fight for us ulfric do not let your fears and doubts destroy us all i thought you of all people would understand why i dont want to be touching them when they raise the only power we have to fight these things i felt what anita and her triumvirate raised earlier it was friendship love as pure as any ive known i begin to believe the ardeur is a jewel with many facets but it needs light to shine ulfric what the hell does that mean richard asked and his voice was angry and frustrated he shoved malcolms hand away and looked at damian youre keeping the worst of it out arent you damian just looked at him to reap the benefits i have to take the bad with the good i cant do it i cant he looked at me im sorry but i cant go where this is heading what do you think were going to do richard i asked what you always do fuck everything it was not sex she offered to my congregation only friendship but it wont stay that way it never does richard said he looked at malcolm and said youre asking me to do something that you would never do yourself malcolm nodded youre righthe nodded againyou are absolutely right i have stood on my moral high ground and been so certain so certain that i was right that jeanclaude was not only wrong but evil i have said such hateful things to anita called her whore and witch i have called all jeanclaudes people that and worse to my congregation but all my righteousness could not protect them richard nodded i know anita saved my mother and brother saved their lives but she did terrible things to get there in time things i still think are immoral wrong and i have to live every day with the knowledge that if i had been there i would have stopped anita from torturing that man i wouldnt have let her dehumanize him or herself i would have stood on my moral high ground and my mother and my brother daniel would both be dead tears shimmered edged by the leather i used to be so sure of so much raina didnt shake my faith she made me more certain only anita only jeanclaude only they have made me doubt everything i drew a little away from jeanclaude still touching because i was afraid to stop touching him if the doubts were this bad touching i couldnt imagine what theyd be like if we werent touching wed just die my cross still works for me richard it still burns with holy light god hasnt forsaken me but he should have richard said he should have dont you see if what i believe is right if what you say you believe is right then your cross should not burn you have broken so many commandments youve murdered tortured fucked but your cross still works i dont understand that youre saying im evil so god should have turned his back on me even with most of his face hidden i saw his face convulse with emotion tears finally falling he nodded yes thats what i mean i just looked at him and knew that it was partly vampire powers messing with his head but that perhaps columbines powers only brought out what was already inside you some part of richard believed what he was saying ma petite no i said no its okay my chest felt like a piece of it had been carved out not bloody and warm but cold and icy as if the piece had been missing a long time but i hadnt wanted to see it feel it know it maybe god isnt the sex police richard sometimes i think christians get all hung up on the sex thing because its easier to worry about sex than to ask yourself am i a good person if as long as you dont have sex with a lot of people youre a good person thats easy its easy to avoid that its easy to think im not fucking anyone so im good it makes it easy to be cruel because as long as youre not fucking around nothing you do can be that bad is that really all you think of god is he just the sex police for you and malcolm or is it that sex is easy to worry about easy to avoid and the whole loveyourneighborasyouloveyourself thing thats hard some days its so hard i feel like trying to take care of everyone in my life will break me apart but i do my best i do my best for everyone in my life every damn day can you say that richard do you do your best for everyone in your life every damn day do you include yourself and jeanclaude on that list he asked his voice so quiet so full of emotion that it was strangely empty do you not include us i asked i could feel the tears pushing in my throat at the back of my eyes like heat i would not cry for him those true brown eyes stared at me i watched the pain in them but finally he said no i dont i nodded a little too fast a little too rapidly i fought to swallow past the tears i thought id choke on them i cleared my throat twice so sharp it hurt i wanted to accuse him say then what were you doing in my bed today why did you sleep with micah nathaniel and me why did you have sex with me today if im not a person in your life theni swallowed the words because they didnt matter hed have had some answer for everything i said or hed have felt bad about it either way i didnt want to hear it or see it i didnt need to hear more explanations from him i didnt need to see him agonize over his moral quandaries anymore i was done im not angry richard i dont hate you im just not going to do this anymore you think im evil you think jeanclaude is evil you think what we do to keep everyone safe is evil fine fine i didnt mean i held up a hand just stop dont the hand on your arm thats keeping the doubts from eating you alive was forged through sex richard that calm was won through centuries of pain and sex and servitude jeanclaude the evil bastard saved damian ransomed him from hell they didnt even like each other but jeanclaude wouldnt leave anyone with her not if he could save him evil bastard anita damian said and his face heldfear something as if he knew what was coming you benefit from our evil richard you count on us being willing to do your dirty work hell im the bolverk for your clan literally i am your evildoer i do what the ulfric will not so fine fine i will be your bolverk but we are not in the lupanar this night we are not lupa and ulfric this night this night is vampire business this night i am jeanclaudes human servant i am nathaniel and damians master that is the power you are hiding behind right this second you think were evil fine i looked at damian i gave him a look to let him know i meant what i was about to say damian let him go you wouldnt richard said you cant have it both ways richard youre right the ardeur will have to rise you dont want to be touching any of us when that happens do you he just looked at me if you mean what you say if you truly believe its wrong evil then let go of damians arm let go and stand on your moral high ground if jeanclaude and i mean nothing to you then stand by yourself richard stand on your own two feet he stared at me as if id said something terrible he stood there clinging to damians arm dont do this not now i think now is perfect richard i think now is great we need to raise the ardeur so let go jeanclaude he said and looked at the vampire it is a strange night my ulfric i should be arguing your case i should fight to keep you with us but i dont seem to want to i like ma petite grow tired of being judged by someone i care for it cuts deeper tonight and i know that is columbine she is laughing at us even now she has stopped attacking the congregation she has put all her power upon us because she found our weakness the weakness that has always been there from the first you mean me richard said i mean our triumvirate it is flawed and i do not know how to fix it i feel what anita has forged with her servants the two of you are more powerful my triumvirate should be the stronger of the two but it is not because of me richard said no because of who we all are mon ami but whatever the cause i grow tired of this fight he leaned back against asher rested his head against the other mans face i have rejected those i do love to save your sensibilities and anitas youre all lovers richard said dont tell me otherwise we will have to raise the ardeur richard jeanclaude said let go of damians hand or you will be dragged into what is about to happen if it is evil and you would escape it let go let go of us richard let go of us all this is vampire trickery malcolm said do not let her force you into something you will regret later it is vampire trickery but as richard said things he truly believed so i think anita and i have come to an understanding we are tired of this ulfric we are tired of you making us the villains if we are the villains then let go if we are not the villains then hold on but either way you know what i must do now if you do not wish to be part of it then you must separate from us let go richard i said he looked at jeanclaude then turned to me is this what you want is it what you want i asked i dont know he said then let me go richard let me go he let go chapter fortyfive richard fell to his knees his head bowed toward the floor his hands rising to his head as if he could shut out the doubt in his own mind alone he could not fight columbines power he was alone but we werent damians hand in mine drew him into the circle of our power he had some of the same issues with the other men that richard had but damian was a more practical creature with him pressed against me so that jeanclaude had to move his arm to let the other vampire in closer i heard or felt damians thoughts it wasnt a fate worse than death no matter what happened with jeanclaude and the rest of the men nothing that we would do with him would be half so awful as what hed endured at her hands the other thought before jeanclaude grabbed the reins of all our minds was that jeanclaude and i were good masters kinder than any hed known we were worth fighting for then jeanclaude settled into the drivers seat of our metaphysical bus and calm we were all suddenly so calm i stood with my back pressed against jeanclaude when hed drawn damian and me in hed turned us like a dance movement smooth and inevitable so that we stood in the circle of his arm jeanclaude held us both my hand had just slid around damians waist and drawn him in against the side of my body as if we fitted together from shoulder to hip his own arm traced my shoulders his hand cupping my arm and again we fitted together in a way i didnt remember jeanclaudes arm was around damians shoulders his other arm encircling nathaniel who was cuddled against his side so that one arm traced the front of my body i wasnt sure where nathaniels other arm was but i knew that asher was still at jeanclaudes back columbine stood just on the other side of the pulpit in her motley clothing all red blue white and black edged with gold her tricorn hat was gold with only a cluster of multicolored balls to echo the colors in her clothes her human servant stood at her back all in black he looked like a shadow beside her brilliance you are very good columbine jeanclaude said i did not even feel you roll our minds your magic is very subtle such a pretty compliment thank you she gave him a low curtsey holding the small halfskirt of her pants outfit to the side as if it were a much longer piece of cloth i should have been nervous at the least but i stood there in the circle of everyones arms and was so relaxed it was a little like you feel when they give you drugs before an operation calm almost a liquid warmth as if you could float away on it part of me thought its what they do to you just before something really painful happens but the thought just drifted away on the warm calm you attacked the audience as a diversion jeanclaude said in that voice that could make your skin shiver but it didnt make me shiver it was as if whatever hed done to us the people he was touching protected us from that voice she laughed but it had none of the touchable quality of jeanclaude and ashers laughs even through the near anesthetic haze that he had created around us the laughter felt flat human even or maybe the reason it sounded flat was the anesthetic haze i couldnt tell whether i was still able to sense a little through what jeanclaude had done or if his power was protecting me from her the laughter died abruptly on that crimson mouth she stared at us with eyes that were gray and as serious as death oh no jeanclaude it wasnt a diversion but i admit that i may have underestimated you and your servant if i could have won the audience from her then i would have had enough power to defeat you easily and now he made it a question with a lilt of his voice i think a more direct assault on you personally is needed if you are too direct then you will simply be executed he said his voice mild my power can be subtle but do not be deceived i too can be direct as direct as the power you hold in your arms with your ravenhaired servant she gestured with one slender hand and the man behind her stepped forward he took off one glove and laid his bare hand in hers you are not the only master whose touch awakens more power in their servant jeanclaude she said i did not think i was he said his voice was as mild as her own but his power was not mild his power riffled through us as if we were cards in his hand what should he play id had jeanclaude drive the metaphysical bus before but id never felt it like this never been so aware of how terribly aware he was of his power of my power of the power we all offered him he was vampire which meant he was a cold power a thing of logic because emotions do not trouble the dead he shifted through our talents like edward would have looked through his gun safe which gun will do the job which will make this shot i had a moment to feel a thrill of fear a thread of real doubt he squashed it shut it tight away from me from us because it wasnt just my mind that had felt it i knew that damian and nathaniel had thought it felt it too he feared that we had no weapon to protect from this we had already nearly been destroyed by her power without her servants touch he shut the doubts away but they were there it wasnt the coldness of vampire i was feeling it was the coldness of necessity doubt was her weapon you do not arm your enemy her power hit us staggered us as if emotion could be a great wind to blow your world apart it was like having your mind and heart ripped open wide so you had to feel know how you truly felt most of us live because we dont shine the light too brightly inside ourselves suddenly jeanclaude damian nathaniel asher and i were at ground zero of the brightest light in the world columbine specialized in doubt and pain but giovanni her man he gave her a wider range loss that choking sense of loss when you think youll die with the person who was buried somehow she knew that we had all suffered losses and she made us suffer them all over again but it wasnt just our personal losses jeanclaude had bound us together so that instead of one loss we got them all i heard julianna scream as the fire consumed her i heard her scream jeanclaudes name as she died asher screamed in the here and now and jeanclaude joined him we stood before a pyre of cold ash and knew that it was all that was left of the woman who had been our heart damian watched his brother burn to death again his screams haunted us damian fell to his knees as if hed been hit we were small again and nicholas was dying the baseball bat made a sickening sound as it hit his head a wet crunching sound he fell on the floor reached out to us blood was everywhere and the man like some dark giant above us nicholas said run natty run nathaniel screamed no in the here and now as a child he had run he raised his face up but he was a child no longer and said i wont run i looked into his eyes those lavender eyes they were real not this memory of pain and death tears stained his face but he whispered i wont run i was eight again and my father was about to say the words that would destroy my life my mother was dead but i hadnt run then nathaniel had run because his older brother told him to run but he wasnt little anymore it had been my father who had collapsed he had wailed her loss not me i did not run i did not run then and i would not run now i found my voice and said we wont run nathaniel shook his head still crying no we wont jeanclaude and asher had slid to the ground with damian crushed under the weight of sorrow no one else was close to us on the stage the guards even richard had fled from us fled from the weight of horror and loss fled so it did not spread to them i guess i couldnt blame richard but i would later i knew i would worse yet later he would blame himself i caught movement in the aisle close to us micah was the closest the only one brave enough or stupid enough to get close to the emotional thermonuclear bomb that had just been set off then i caught movement just behind micah edward was there more surprising was that olaf was beside him nathaniel touched my arm he smiled at me with tears still wet on his face he smiled it made my heart hurt but not in a bad way in that way that sometimes happens when you love someone and you just suddenly look up and realize just how much love love to chase back the pain it washed over my skin like a warm wind love life that spark that makes us get back up it poured down the metaphysical links between nathaniel and me and the other men love love to raise their faces and make them look at us love to help them to their feet love and our hands to steady them to help dry their tears we finally stood perhaps a little shaky around the edges but we all stood and turned to columbine and her giovanni love conquers all is that it she said her voice thick with disdain no not all i said just you i am not conquered not yet the lights seemed to dim as if something breathed in the light ate it twilight filled the church a soft edge of darkness spread out from the harlequin on the stage what is that micah asked he was beside the stage now jeanclaude asher and damian said the mother of all darkness nathaniel and i said marmee noir that which we call the mother of all vampires by any other name would be fucking dangerous chapter fortysix the vampires in the audience made a panicked run for the far doors it was as if even malcolms tame vamps understood what was coming their screams let me know that the doors wouldnt open i guess i shouldnt have been surprised the queen of all darkness was coming to eat us what was holding shut one door to everything she could do micah leapt upon the stage like grace over muscles proving that he didnt have to be in leopard form to be inhumanly graceful he touched my arm and the emotion wed raised to save ourselves leapt to him he was no ones servant no ones master but the love spread to him in a warm rush jeanclaude looked at us with tears still painting faint pinkish streaks on his face you love him even with all the good feelings i frowned at him yes i do jeanclaude shook his head i mean ma petite that your love for himhe waved a hand and let me see inside his head so much quicker because i loved micah jeanclaude could feed off the energy of that love it was as if his powers through belle mortes line had found a new way to think she and her vampires were all about lust love but no one had ever been able to use love like fuel the way the ardeur could use lust it was like an intuitive leap in math or science you start with this bit of reality and suddenly you understand how to make a leap to a larger reality love love was power in more than just a metaphorical way love wont conquer her it was richard from behind us hed come back to the stage i looked at him and wasnt sure i wanted him to touch me in that moment would the love spread to him or would it not had he finally hurt me enough that hed killed my feelings for him if he had then he would be no help here hed hurt me hurt this soft new magic youll need a wolf like last time he said he was right but he held out his hand the dimness breathed around us as if the room had taken a breath he reached for me grabbed my hand his hand was warm in mine it was still richard every gorgeous inch of him but the power did not travel from my skin to his he stood there holding my hand and his touch did not move me id never had him touch me where it didnt move me the other men even damian was like a press of tenderness at my back but richard was cold to my heart anitahe whispered it what could i say you said we were nothing to you you said you didnt want the ardeur this isnt the ardeur he said i nodded yes it is richard you never understood that for me the ardeur wasnt just about sex this is the ardeur i can smell the edge of it its as if love had a scent its the ardeur richard what its become if id stayed by your side youd be spilling love all over me he made it a question i dont know ma petite could we discuss this later we looked at him still handinhand sorry i said richard scented the air and for a moment i thought he really was trying to scent what love smelled like it doesnt smell like her i scented the air too no she smells like jasmine and rain and night theres no scent to this the darkness wasnt growing darker it should have been it was twilight and power breathed through the room but it wasnt quite enough power not for her i turned back to columbine and her servant belle morte said that the harlequin are the servants of the dark mother did she mean that literally all of us bear a piece of the original darkness inside us little girl feel the power of the night given human form and know true terror i shook my head and said to richard its not her he moved up beside me as close as the other men would allow we were getting to be quite a crowd again if i hadnt been in your dream with the real thing this might be scary i nodded but weve felt the real deal and this aint it this isnt the mother asher said hed gotten to his feet scrubbing at tears on his face no its a shadow of her barely that i said nathaniel drew in a large breath i smelled her once in the car she smelled like something cat and jasmine and so many things this has no scent its not real the darkness began to press down like a shadowy hand but it was only a shadow the little vampires huddled and beating at the doors screamed louder it had cleared the pews out so that there was no one but our guards in the aisles the guards and our vampires the dark mother will consume you all unless you lay down your arms and submit to us the shadow of dark tried to crush us damian made a small sound dont be afraid i said its barely a shadow of her power it cant hurt us columbine gestured as if she were crushing something invisible in her hand the shadowy darkness tried to squeeze down around us but i thought love warmth life and the shadows shredded the lights began to grow brighter again requiem spoke from a small distance away this is not the darkness that hunted my master in england this is smoke and mirrors compared to what came for him in the end smoke and mirrors i said softly misdirection like a magicians illusion how do we know youre the real columbine a real harlequin all vampires know the rules the masks anyone could pretend i said you uppity little bitch she said how dare you that would explain them breaking the rules nathaniel said they tried to kill you guys without giving you a black mask first are you truly asking us to prove we are of the harlequin columbine asked yeah i am jeanclaude does she do all your talking for you i am happy to have ma petite do my talking for me which wasnt always true but tonight i was doing okay i wanted to own you not destroy you but if you insist she said a piece of blackness unwound itself from near the ceiling it had to have been there all along but none of us had noticed it it was like some large black snake if snakes were formless and could float oh hell it wasnt a snake but i didnt know what else to call it it was a ribbon of blackness that moved and where it touched the lights the lights went out as if the light was eaten by the coming dark it smells like night air micah said in his growling voice it does nathaniel and richard said at the same time they didnt even look at each other the three wereanimals seemed intent on something i couldnt hear or see or smell then i felt it a cool line of wind and i did smell it night air damp but not rain damp but not rain i drew in a deep breath wheres the jasmine half the lights on one side of the church had been engulfed by the sinuous stream of living darkness the vampires and humans of the congregation had made a huddle of themselves on the other side of the church as far from the dark as the closed doors would allow requiem had pulled his cloak up around his face but he was beside the stage now this is the darkness that killed my master how did it kill him micah asked the darkness covered him hid him from sight he gave a terrible cry and when we could see again he was dead how exactly requiem i asked his throat had been torn out as if by some great beast we had two lights between us and the consuming dark i smell wolf micah said i shook my head the mother of all darkness doesnt do wolf she does cats lots of cats no doggies nathaniel and richard sniffed the air too wolf richard said nathaniel nodded edward called to me can bullets hurt that thing i shook my head let me know when you find something i can shoot we can shoot claudia called the darkness was almost to the stage but it didnt feel like her it didnt feel like marmee noir i closed down the warm fuzzy love flavor of the ardeur and reached out with my own power my necromancy i reached out not toward the coming dark but toward the spot near the ceiling where it originated marmee noir wasnt shy if shed been there shed have let us know so what or who was it who held a piece of the dark inside them i searched the rafters near the high vaulted ceiling i almost heard a voice almost a loud whisper not here not here im not here i actually started to look away then realized what i was doing something was in the corner of the ceiling someone was there the darkness curled along the edge of the stage and began to eat the bright lights that usually spotlit the pulpit columbine laughed a high joyous cruel sound the darkness will eat you all youre not causing the darkness columbine you or giovanni i said we are harlequin she said tell your little friend hanging near the ceiling to show himself or herself her body went very still it was better than any human facial expression there was someone there and she hadnt thought any of us would know great now how did it help us the darkness was almost here a darkness that smelled like damp night and earth and wolf like something acrid on my tongue it wasnt wolf as i knew it but i was out of time to analyze it i yelled edward shoot into that corner there i pointed at the corner where i knew the vampire was hiding edward and olaf drew their guns aimed the darkness swirled toward us toward jeanclaude i drew my gun and moved in front of him remus was beside me youre supposed to have bodyguards remember haven came to my other side in a blur of movement finally something to shoot not yet i said hes not here yet who isnt here remus asked edward and olafs guns fired and darkness swallowed the world black moonless night shit haven breathed they both moved in closer to me i put my free hand on remuss shoulder so id know where he was i moved my leg to brush against havens but his free hand found my back at least we wouldnt shoot each other we stood pressed close in the utter dark guns out but nothing to see how do you shoot if you cant see what youre shooting at edward yelled anita can you hear me weve got blood on the wall but we cant see what we hit i yelled back i hear you were coming he said i dont know what i would have yelled back come dont come because remus said wolf haven said close there was a wet thick sound almost soft like a knife being pulled out of flesh if i hadnt been straining my ears like a son of a bitch i might not have heard but it would have been okay because remus and haven turned like one person and moved me with them almost like you move a partner on the dance floor we fired into that sound that smell of bitter wolf we fired until it hit us back claws haven yelled remus was suddenly standing in front of me enfolding me with his body i felt him jerk hard i yelled haven anita he yelled and he was still on my right i put my gun around remuss body and fired into the body on the other side of remus i fired until my gun clicked empty but haven was there now his gun shooting into what was on the other side of remus remuss body jerked and for a moment i thought haven had shot remus by accident then i heard a sound a ripping meaty wet horrible sound bones cracked and remus screamed liquid ran hot across my skin i screamed claws grabbed at my shirt i drew a knife because it was all i had left a claw cut across my breast i cut the claw back remuss arms had tightened around me pressing me into the claws i couldnt see what was happening and what i was feeling made no sense where the hell was the claw coming from haven wasnt touching me anymore i heard fighting get away anita get away from him haven said get away from who i asked i stabbed the claw that wasnt remus i cut it up but it cut me up too i screamed more in frustration than anything remus whispered im sorry his arms slid away from me and his knees buckled but he didnt fall i grabbed him trying to support him and that was when i realized where the clawed hand was coming from i had to be wrong i screamed remus there was movement sound fighting i heard a sound i didnt recognize grunts of effort what the hell was happening remus suddenly fell forward i tried to catch him but it was too sudden and he outweighed me by a hundred pounds i fell to the ground with him on top of me he wasnt moving the darkness vanished i could see again there was a severed arm sticking out of remuss back i screamed i couldnt help it more guards were there picking him up getting him off me they couldnt roll him onto his back because the arm had pierced his chest the hand looked human now but my chest and remuss said it hadnt been human when it went through his eyes were closed and he was so still terribly still get that thing out of him claudia said fredo was suddenly at her side with a knife the size of a small sword he raised it up and i looked away before he brought it down i saw wicked and truth with bare swords pointed at the throat and chest of a fallen harlequin that i had never seen before he was dressed all in black even his mask he was missing an arm edward and olaf and more of the guards had columbine and giovanni at gunpoint jeanclaude asher requiem and most of our vampires were gathered around them i think with the real master harlequin down theyd been able to take the other two good that something had worked out haven was kneeling between the two groups bleeding but hed live i turned back to remus i wasnt so sure about him they had the arm out now in two pieces but there was a hole in his chest that i could see through like some sort of cartoon cannon shot fuck i said softly his heart claudia looked at me tears drifting silently down her face bastard had silver bracers on his forearms silver fucking razor wire as fucking jewelry this one is healing wicked called how do we stop him from doing that is remusi couldnt say it dead claudia said in a voice that was hard and cold and didnt match the tears yeah i said she just nodded he died saving me i said he died doing his job she said i watched her tears and wondered if he had been more than just a friend to her i hoped not in that moment i hoped not i got to my feet and fell back down richard was beside me holding me youre hurt remus is dead i said and pushed him away anita please i shook my head either help me walk over to wicked and truth or go somewhere else can i at least see how badly youre hurt first no do you want remus to have died for nothing is that what you want micah was on my other side let us see anita then well take you to wicked and truth nathaniel was there too please anita i nodded and let them wipe away some of the blood with a cloth that someone gave them the scratches werent that deep deep enough that if id been a little more human i might have needed stitches and seeing that they were across the mound of one breast i should have been more worried about that whole cosmetic thing but strangely i wasnt take me to them i said richard took one arm and nathaniel the other they lifted me to my feet and helped me walk where i wanted to go micah followed us carrying bandages maybe id even let him use them on me eventually remus was dead and i wanted to know why or maybe how the thing that had come out of the darkness had been a vampire that smelled like a wolf and had claws like a powerful shapeshifter impossible but remus was dead so it had to be possible who are you i asked i am harlequin one of or the i asked my voice sounded strangely distant inside my own head as if the distance was greater than it should have been i am pantalone once pantaleon i was one of the first children of the dark you didnt send us a black mask pantalone but you tried to kill us thats against council law hell thats against the mother of all darknesss law you know nothing of our mother human you are not vampire or succubus you are a necromancer and our laws say you can be killed on sight i smelled jasmine nathaniel said flowers richard said what is that i felt the rain on the edge of a wind that hadnt existed for a million years i tasted jasmine on my tongue sweet and cloying i wasnt afraid this time i welcomed it because i knew i wasnt the one she was pissed at though pissed was too strong for the feeling i got as she breathed closer pissed was too human an emotion and as shed said herself shed lost the knack of being human marmee noir nathaniel answered richard id forgotten hed asked a question anita richard said fight it fight her if you arent going to help me do this then get away from me do what let the mother of all vampires possess you i screamed at him get away from me richard now a cut opened on his arm like a red mouth it wasnt marmee noir id done that a couple of times before under stress i couldnt do it dependably but thats not her thats me help me or get away i fought to keep my voice even because my emotions were dangerous apparently dont let her inside you micah take my arm dont let her do this richard said to him we are still in danger here richard micah said dont you get that we have to finish what we started you mean kill them yes i said yes kill them kill them all another cut opened on richards arm he let me go as if i were something hot that had burned him micah slid furred arms around me he and nathaniel led me forward so i could do what needed to be done no truth what i was going to do not need want i wanted him dead hed killed remus and remus had died because the vampire on the ground had meant to kill me remus had given his life to save mine id pay my debt now tonight in the blood and pain of his killer it sounded like such a good idea the smell of jasmine was everywhere i could taste rain on my tongue the wind was cool and fresh against my face and the wind was coming from me chapter fortyseven take off his mask i said but the voice held an echo of a different voice if you see my face i will be forced to kill you all he said i laughed and the laughter made the wind play around the room patting with cool damp hands at peoples hair their skin you are going to die tonight pantalone your mask can come off now or after your corpse lies stretched at my feet i prefer now but i guess it really doesnt matter the wind eased back i was drowning in the scent of rain and jasmine he struck at me with his own power it was like some spirit wolf a great dark beast that rose from him and came at me huge jaws agape micah and nathaniel pulled me backward but though it looked like a shadow it hit me and pulled us all to the floor people were running from everywhere but marmee was already there the shadow wolf spilled into me she absorbed it like something melting into the snow with the touch of his power came a memory a snowstorm so cold the wind howling so that he thought he heard voices on the wind hed found a cave buried in the snow shelter he thought then hed heard the growl low and too close something else had taken shelter from the storm then a woman had stepped into the light of his fire a woman with a spill of dark hair and eyes that glittered in the firelight he had smelled death on her and tried to fight i felt his body run hot and spill bone and muscle and flesh from human to wolf but a wolf like none that still walked today she had turned into a huge striped cat the color of a lion but striped like a tiger bigger than both shed nearly killed him but when pain and injury had turned him back to human shed fed on him she fed on him for three days until the storm stopped and when the fourth night rose they went out together to hunt i came back to the here and now and found that wicked and truth had pierced his heart and neck with their swords he cursed them and writhed but he wasnt dead i knew i just knew that swords would not kill him he was old blood blood when vampire and shapeshifter could be one back before the blood weakened we could take his head and heart and burn the pieces separately but didnt i want answers yes i did i sat back up with micah and nathaniels help your actions could get the entire harlequin disbanded dont you care kill me if you can but i will not answer questions from you the darkness inside me thought otherwise fredo i called the slender knifewielding man was just beside me can you get enough help and enough knives to pin him to the floor we can pin him but unless were leaning on the knives they wont hold him then pin him with your bodies i dont care how i need to touch him why does it matter tonight yes he said i looked up into his dark eyes i saw pain there i answered that pain the darkness can make him talk and then im going to kill him fredo nodded good plan he went around getting volunteers to hold the vampire down there were a lot of volunteers jeanclaude came to me while they were wrestling him into place i feel her all around you ma petite yeah i said but i wasnt looking at him i was watching them pin the big vampire look at me he touched my chin and turned me so that i would look at him i didnt fight him but i didnt seem to care whether i looked at him or not there is a light in your eyes that i do not know i halfsaw out of the corner of my eye a dark figure form she formed of the dark and she looked vaguely like she had in my dream allblack cloak a small female figure but this was no dream screams again from the vampires the ones with asher standing guard over columbine and giovanni held their ground but no one was happy pantalone himself screamed like a girl it made it harder for the guards to wrestle him into submission oh well the figure spoke and the smell of jasmine and rain was in her voice or on the wind or the wind was her voice i wasnt sure which did you think my laws were superstitions jeanclaude you were supposed to kill her when you knew what she was now it is too late too late for what he said and he wrapped his arm around me drew me in against his body and we both looked up as my nightmare damn near materialized in front of us shes a necromancer jeanclaude she controls the dead all the dead dont you understand yet some of the harlequin think i woke because i want to steal her body ride her as the traveller rides other vampires i had that gift once to travel from body to body but that is not why i woke why did you wake he whispered she attracts the dead jeanclaude all the dead she called me from my sleep her power called to me like the first ray of sunlight after a thousand years of night her warmth and life called to my death even i cannot resist her do you understand now you are so not under my power i said she gave a low dry chuckle legend says that necromancers can control the dead and that is true but what legend does not say is that the dead give necromancers no peace we pester the poor things because they draw us like moths to the flame except with vampires and necromancers it is a question who is flame and who is moth beware jeanclaude that she does not burn you up beware necromancer that the vampires do not put you in your grave your law pantalone yelled your law says she must be put to death the dark figure turned toward the struggling pile of people do not dare speak to me of my laws pantalone i made you i gave you a piece of myself that is what made you one of the harlequin i have been listening to vampires that dwell closer to my physical form you have been assassinating vampires for council members you are neutral you take no sides that is what makes the harlequin her voice rose as she spoke until the wind held not just rain but the promise of storm i will take back what i gave you what you used to make these pale imitations of my columbine and her giovanni these are not my harlequin columbine died i had to make a replacement and you were not here to guide me then the mask should have been retired and the name with it that was my will and our way once she began to walk toward them i could almost see her foot dainty in a slipper edged with white pearls jeanclaude called do not look upon her face for fear of sanity and life do not meet her eyes any of you i am not the traveller to need to steal bodies to walk i did need flesh once but i am the darkness made flesh pantalone i am she who made you made you all killing the necromancer will not put me back to sleep again it is too late for that it was jake who knelt beside me and jeanclaude jake whispered shes using your energy to manifest anita you have to shut her down before shes solid here you do not want her in america in flesh and bone i looked at him and i knew youre one of them jake nodded you saved ma petite when you could have let her die in the bathroom at the circus jeanclaude said the mother was always going to wake again nothing would prevent that some of us believe that anita is our only hope of controlling her prove my master right by shutting down the power youre feeding her i dont know shes feeding on your anger your rage i dont know how to stop that if she feeds on pantalone one of the oldest of us she may have enough power to be permanent flesh the blackcloaked figure was standing at his feet the guards were looking at me i said the only thing i could think of get away from him some of the guards hesitated but most of them glanced toward the dark figure and moved a discreet distance anita jake said help us i turned to jeanclaude and said help me think of something besides my anger the black figure was spreading into what looked like a piece of the night sky like some beautiful and frightening cloak of stars and darkness pantalone shrieked as if whatever he saw in that piece of darkness was something terrible to behold hurry i said jeanclaude raised the ardeur in a breath in the feel of his mouth on mine he raised the ardeur and stripped away my sorrow in a rush of skin and hands i hadnt fed the ardeur in over twelve hours i was suddenly starving marmee noir screamed no her rage cut through me and a sharp pain laced my back i felt blood a second later the ardeur was gone in a rush of fear and pain i turned and jeanclaude caught my face forced my eyes against his velvet jacket she is fading ma petite her voice came in a rush of rain and wind i know who your master is wolf you have betrayed me and i will not forget it when i could no longer smell jasmine or feel rain against my skin like some invisible presence i asked jake how do i keep her from popping in to see me theres a charm for that i gave him a look people used to think she was a demon but whatever they thought she was one human witch made a charm a very long time ago and it works is it a holy symbol i asked he smiled no its magic not faith isnt all magic faith i asked no sometimes its just magic the concept was too hard for me you got one of those charms on you always but ill get one for you we should be safe for the rest of tonight i hope those arent famous last words i said what do we do with them anita truth asked i looked at jake he broke your laws more than mine kill him under your laws we wont argue we suspected one of us was being paid as an assassin but we didnt know who then pantalone volunteered to come check out malcolms church it was just a visit and a report back to the council he usually only takes killing jobs so we were suspicious if columbine had won jeanclaudes lands it would have been pantalone who ruled here we are allowed to leave the service of the mother now because she sleeps once she wakes all that are in her service will be trapped there so you came to spy i said and to help keep you alive thanks for that i glanced back toward remuss body i wish everybody were still alive im sorry about that truly he was a good man i turned back to wicked and truth did you guys wade into the dark and cut off his hand without being able to see anything yes wicked said of course truth said then take his head pantalone with a missing arm stabbed shot moved in a black blur truth was his own dark blur his sword so fast it looked like lightning he took him through the heart again except spitting him this time the way pantalone had spitted remus wickeds blade glittered outward and the head went spinning it wasnt just impressive it was lovely in a macabre sort of way someone put the head in a sack well burn it later separate from the body we should take the heart too olaf said i nodded youre right well do that after we take care of the other two you killed our master columbine said i would ask does that frighten you but i can taste your fear in your words it tastes good im going to ask you some questions if you answer me truthfully then you die quick fairly painless you fuck with me lie to me try not to answer the questions and ill make your death something to write home about ill give you to olaf hes the big guy olaf glanced back at me gun still trained on them do you mean it right this minute yes shes a petite darkhaired woman she even fits your victim profile if she doesnt answer my questions never say i didnt give you a good present no columbine said please you tried to kill me and the people i love your master killed my friend please isnt going to have much effect on me right now not from you please richard said dont do this i shook my head go home richard isnt there any other man in your bed who agrees with me that there are some things you dont do for any reason jeanclaude stood and went to richard he began to try to soothe him it reminded me of when you gamed and you had to send the paladin around the hill so you could loot the dead nathaniel and micah came to my sides you want to get closer to her micah asked i nodded you dont think im a bastard for offering her to olaf theyve nearly killed you three times anita youre my nimirra ill carve out her heart and serve it to you on a platter the threat seemed more real with him in his kittycat form im your submissive i dont argue nathaniel said submissive when it suits you lately he smiled at me i wont carve her up but i might watch olaf do it she almost killed you and jeanclaude and richard i nodded and peter and cisco nathaniel said i nodded and started to turn back to look at remus micah kept me moving forward lets go ask your questions we went to ask my questions olaf was whispering to her as we came up what hed do to her what he wanted to do to her please dont answer the questions vampires die so much slower than humans guess what she answered every question first time out she and nivia had killed the humans and tried to frame the church members it had been to get leverage to try to force malcolm to simply give the church to them then id gone and spoiled it by killing nivia i didnt tell her that i wasnt even certain why nivia had died or what id done to cause it maybe jeanclaude could help me figure it out later columbine was going to be the beard the stalking horse for pantalone once he ruled here even the mother of all darkness couldnt force him to abandon his territory all of them pantalone nivia soledad and giovanni had all taken assassination jobs the only question she hesitated on even for a second was which council members did you work for theyll kill me you dont have to be afraid of them anymore columbine youll protect me in a way you dont have to be afraid of the council killing you later because were going to kill you tonight remember all were negotiating on is whether you die easy or hard your choice she shook her head olaf yes we have to cut her heart out anyway want to do it first he stared at me as if wondering if i was kidding i remembered remuss body in my arms i knew now that id felt his body jerk as pantalone had forced his arm through his chest through his heart dug his way through and killed him i could still hear his last whispered im sorry not help me or god it hurts but im sorry do it i said they held her down and they held giovanni down and olaf ripped her costume open bared her breasts to the room and began very slowly to carve out her heart he didnt get very far before she gave up the names master of beasts and the lover of death olaf didnt stop when she gave up the names hed gone to his happy place it was like trying to argue with an autistic child he just didnt hear us columbine screamed i answered your questions in the name of the dark kill me i told wicked to behead her he did one clean blow that scarred the wood underneath her i could never get a head to come off in one blow olaf looked up as the blood poured out of the neck in a crimson fountain i wasnt finished she gave the information up a while ago i promised her a quick death if she told me what i needed to know he gave me a look that wasnt friendly at all you can still cut out her heart i said its not the same he said and the look on his face was nothing i understood or wanted to understand i started to apologize for not letting him cut out her heart while she was still alive then i caught myself fuck the shock was beginning to leave and i was wondering what the hell id been thinking legally everything we were doing was aokay i had a warrant of execution it covered a multitude of sins he did finish cutting out her heart i had wicked behead giovanni i was really going to see if he and his brother could teach me the beheadingapersonwithoneblow technique i could never manage not even with a sword maybe it was a leverage thing i took giovannis heart myself with one of fredos knives that was better for carving open a persons sternum than anything i had on me i was tired and the shock was wearing off which made me clumsy i was nearly elbow deep inside giovannis chest i just couldnt seem to get the heart out of the ligaments that held the pericardial sac in place id pierced the sac but it was as if id gotten something tangled i was so tired and numb and not numb enough may i help olaf was kneeling beside the body his hands were bloody too but only one of them looked like he was wearing a red glove yeah its tangled i think im just tired he slid his hand inside the hole id made so that his arm slid up alongside mine in the chest cavity it wasnt until his hand cupped mine pressing both our hands into the still warm heart that i looked at him we were both leaning over the body our faces inches apart with our arms up the much longer torso of the male he looked at me over the body our hands around the heart blood everywhere he looked at me as if it were a candlelit dinner and i were wearing nice lingerie i thought very clearly in my head i will not scream i would be calm fuck but i would be besides hed enjoy it if i screamed my voice was only a little strained as i said i think its just past my fingertips can you reach the ligament there he slid his hand over mine farther up the heart he caressed my hand while he reached for the piece of the heart i couldnt reach i started to slide my hand out as i felt him grab the piece of muscle or ligament he laid the other heart on the dead vampires groin and grabbed my arm before i could pull it out of the chest cavity he held my hand inside so wed be touching the heart together if i struggled hed like it i could yell for help but he almost had it loose and it would be over i hesitated he pulled the heart free of whatever had been holding it in place and it spilled into both our hands he kept his free hand on my arm controlling how slow we eased out of the chest cavity he made it last and he stared at my face while we did it i normally dont have much problem fishing around inside dead bodies anymore but the sensation of our hands holding the heart our arms pressed together as we slid out of the thick bloody muscle was too strangely intimate for the last few inches of arm he looked down at the wound and not at my face he watched our arms emerge from the bloody hole just under the sternum he kept his hand on my arm and forced our hands upward so that for a moment we held the heart together and he looked at me over that bleeding muscle i knew i went pale i couldnt help it i knew he would enjoy my fear and i couldnt stop it then he leaned in toward me he leaned in over the bloody heart the body our bloody arms he leaned in for a kiss i whispered dont you dont want me to kiss you he whispered back i dont want you to touch me i said he smiled then perfect he kissed me i had fredos blade going for a different chest when olaf pulled back out of reach he laughed a rich deep laugh a happy sound that didnt match anything we were doing hed left me with the heart in one hand and the knife in the other if my hands hadnt been full i might have gone for my gun surely i could claim temporary insanity he wiped his bloody hands on his clothes not just on his shirt but wiped his bloody hands down his body showing off all that muscled chest stomach and finally groin he massaged his groin with his bloody hands and looked at me while he did it that was it i set the knife and heart on the floor and tried to run for the bathroom and never made it i threw up in front of the door to the recreation hall i threw up until there was nothing left i threw up until my head was pounding and i was spitting up bile micah laid a cool and human hand against my forehead while i was sick nathaniel held my hair back because my hands were still covered in blood olaf left town ive got a new recurring nightmare to add to the list its olaf and me cutting up the body except in the dream its bloodier and giovanni is screaming and i kiss olaf back maybe the temporary insanity was not to shoot him peter didnt take the injection and he didnt catch lycanthropy hes back home recovering humanslow but hes sixteen and in good shape hell heal but hes going to have some seriously macho scars i have no idea what edward told donna im not sure i want to know doc lillian sewed up the marks on my breast she said unless you dont care if it scars i guess i did care i asked her why the breast would scar when the stomach and side healed clean they were more serious wounds what the doc and the other doctors think happened is that the feeding on the swans gave enough energy not only to save everyone but also to heal the injuries completely and even faster than a normal lycanthrope could have done it im not sure what a normal lycanthrope is but lillian has warned me to be more careful you cant find an entire animal group to feed off every night she has a point jeanclaude sent sampson home to cape cod before the fight he didnt want to get his friends son killed sampson left without having sex with me his mothers plans spoiled by the harlequins arrival theres a tiger inside me now thanks to marmee noir and soledad were trying to find some tigers willing to come to st louis though strangely something about what happened seems to have given me more control over the beasts or at least they havent tried to tear me apart recently in fact letting out one beast seems to content the rest no one seems to know why its working this way now im not sure i care why as long as it stays this calm haven stayed in town with his new lions joseph his wife and his brother all vanished most of the pride was offered a chance to join havens new pride some accepted haven and his fellow enforcers seem to be trying to live by my rules ive managed to keep haven out of my bed for now the lioness seems strangely okay with that again part of me wishes i knew why the beasts inside me are suddenly so reasonable but most of me doesnt want to poke at the miracle too much im just glad something is getting easier to deal with instead of harder richard had left the church before i threw up he never saw me have my moment of conscience or panic whatever we arent dating anymore again this one may stick and the thought doesnt upset me which is why it may stick jake left town strangely some people remember he was a harlequin and some dont he and his master are worried that marmee noir will come back and try and use me again he gave me a pendant made of a metal so soft i can bend the edges its carved with symbols i dont know ill have my metaphysical therapist marianne look at it when i see her next weekend jake has made me promise to wear it always after seeing marmee noirs slippers with little pearls so real in the church ill wear the amulet always small price to pay to avoid the marmee darling i found a priest to hear malcolms confession i think it took like three days with food breaks to hear it all but he had been saving up for centuries remus and cisco are still dead nothing changed that i could bring them back as zombies but that wouldnt be bringing them back at all remuss last words keep coming back im sorry sorry about what sorry he thought hed failed to protect me sorry that he was dying sorry in general i was the one who was sorry id gotten him killed peter calls me sometimes and we share our survivors guilt this isnt the first time people died and i lived but its the freshest peter still wants to grow up and be like his soontobe stepdad if ciscos death and almost dying couldnt cure him of wanting to play mercenary then im not going to be able to talk him out of it talking about things im not going to be able to talk people out of i need to try to meet nathaniels needs all his needs i discussed with jeanclaude that byron had offered to teach me how to dominate nathaniel jeanclaude agreed that i needed a teacher if i was serious about topping our pussycat but jeanclaude suggested a different teacher one who was most certainly a top and not a bottom asher would be more than happy to teach me about bdsm if i truly wanted to learn honestly im not sure i do but for nathaniels sake ive got to at least try dont i if i try and cant do it then ive at least tried if i dont try and we break up then its all my fault i dont want to feel like any of my breakups are my fault anymore there had to be a point with richard early on where i didnt compromise maybe if richard had agreed to sleep with me when i first asked there would have been no room for anyone else maybe if i dont want to look back at nathaniel and say maybe or if only ill compromise ill bend though its not one of my best things sometimes it feels like when i bend that ill break will letting asher teach me how to make nathaniel happy break me i hope not
