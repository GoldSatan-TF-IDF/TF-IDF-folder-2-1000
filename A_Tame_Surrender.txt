a tame surrender a story of the chicago strike by captain charles king usa author of the colonels daughter marions faith captain blake a soldiers secret sergeant croesus captain close etc illustrated philadelphia jb lippincott company copyright and by jb lippincott company printed by jb lippincott company philadelphia usa illustrations page in her dainty bathingdress miss allisons wings were discarded frontispiece may i trouble you for those despatches mr elmendorf all that space in there will be needed in five minutes from this time is it potent only at christmas illustration a tame surrender chapter i she had met him the previous summer on the rhine and now if they arent engaged they might as well be said her friends for he is her shadow wherever she goes there was something characteristically inaccurate about that statement for miss allison was rather undersized in one way and oversized in another at least that too is what her friends said she was not more than five feet in height nor less than five feet in breadth measured from tip to tip of her wings as her brother said miss allison had wings not because she was an angel but because it was the fashion wings that sprouted at her fair plump shapely shoulders and billowed out like balloons her brother cary above referred to a sixteenyearold specimen of young american impudence and independence said further of her in the spring of that if floys sleeves were only inflated with gas she could float on air as easily as she did on water and on water miss allison was buoyancy personified on water too and in her dainty bathingdress miss allisons wings were discarded and her true proportions more accurately defined she was anything but slender she was simply deliciously exquisitely rounded now but the question which so disturbed her feminine friends as to call for perennial repetition was what would she be a few years hence this however was a matter that seemed to give the lady in question no uneasiness whatever certainly it resulted in no loss of flesh perhaps it might have been better for her future figure if it had with her perfect health digestion and disposition there was absolutely no way of worrying off a pound or two a week she was the soul of good nature and content she had an indulgent father a luxurious home abundant wealth an unimpeachable complexion character and social position she had a swarm of enviously devoted girl friends on the one hand and selfishly devoted male admirers on the other or on both if she chose she was absolutely without a mean or unkind thought of anybody she was full of every generous impulse she was lazy and energetic by turns had been a romping idler in her earlier schooldays and had been polished off and finished in an expensive eastern establishment without finishing anything herself she had lived an almost unshadowed life had laughed off a dozen lovers when she went abroad in and had then fallen in with her fate across the water there was really no excuse for her falling in love with mr floyd forrest an utter dissimilarity to her other admirers a romantic and somewhat absurd adventure and above all proximity were what did it he must have been over ten years her senior she was barely twenty when they met he was tall slender and strong with deep burning brown eyes and heavy brows and lashes she was short and plump and distractingly fair and fresh and blueeyed big melting blue eyes too they were his lips were wellnigh hidden by a heavy moustache hers were wellnigh faultless in their sweet warm rosy curves faultless as the white even teeth that gleamed in her merry laughter he was reserved and taciturn even gloomy at times facts which through no fault or connivance of hers were presently explained and only served to heighten the interest she had begun to feel in him she was frankness almost loquacity itself a girl who could no more keep a secret than she could harbor a grudge he was studious thoughtful forever reading she loved air sunshine action travel tennis dancing music of the waltz variety and beyond her bible and her baedeker read nothing at all and not too much of them she was with her aunt and some american friends when first she met him it was the morning they hove in sight of england and the steamer was pitching through a head sea her party were wretchedly ill she was aggressively well she had risen early and gone up to the promenade deck in hopes of getting the first glimpse of bishops rock and found the spray dashing high over the bows drenching her accustomed perch on the forward deck and keeping people withindoors it was too early for those who had been her beaux and gallants on the swift spring run a late session in the smokingroom the night before had kept them below only one man was visible at the rail under the bridge the tall dark militarylooking american who seemed to divide his time between reading and tramping on the promenade deck pacing the planks with long swinging stride and never seeming to care for other society than his own thoughts he was on deck and keenly enjoying the strong salt wind and its whistling load of spray and clinging to the stanchions at the saloon door wistfully did miss allison regard him but only as the means to an end she wanted to get there and did not see a way without a helping hand and just here old neptune seemed to tender it a huge foamcrested billow came sweeping straight from the invisible shores of albion burst in magnificent deluge upon the port bow lifted high in air one instant the heaving black mass of the stem then let it down with stomachstirring swish deep into the hollow beyond deep deep into the green mountain that followed careening the laboring steamer far over to starboard and shooting miss allison as plump and pleasing a projectile as was ever catapulted straight from the brassbound doorway across the slippery deck and into the strangers welcoming arms springing suddenly back from under the bridge to avoid the coming torrent mr forrest was spun along the rail until nearly opposite the companionway and just in the nick of time i think id have gone overboard if it hadnt been for you said miss allison all smiles and salt water as she clung to the rail a moment later while mr forrests steamercap bumped off in the collision rode helplessly astern on the crest of the hissing wave but i couldnt swim like your cap do take my tam she cried tearing off her knitted headgear and letting her soft fair curls whip out into so many briny strings ill use this he shouted turning up the capote of his ulster while the cape thrashed furiously in the wind will you pardon my saying you are a trifle venturesome oh i love the ocean and the wind and the sea she cried enthusiastically dont you pity people who are too ill or too lazy to get up and see this and she stretched forward one white dimpled dainty hand over the seething waters dare we get over on the other side you couldnt stand there he said briefly and would be drenched if you could best stay here and stay they did until breakfast by which time she had told him a great deal about herself and learned next to nothing about him remember she said you are to give me your address and im to send you a new steamercap to replace the one i knocked overboard and he merely smiled thanked her said it was entirely unnecessary but did not present the expected card at all perhaps he hadnt any suggested aunt lawrence after they got into sheltered waters off the start point he doesnt look like a society man there are so many of these commercial people travelling now oh he didnt talk at all like a drummer said miss allison in prompt defence of her new protector in fact i dont think he talked at all not if you had first innings flo drawled master cary from the shelter of his steamerrug he aint a drummer but likes not hes been one hes an army officer hubbard said so hubbard was one of the belated admirers whether soldier or not however mr forrest did not prosecute the chance acquaintance he lifted the successor to the shipwrecked cap on passing miss allisons party later in the day but never approached them nearer never seemed to see the invitation in miss allisons shining blue eyes really cary said she as they neared southampton you must go and get his address and the size of the steamercap but cary was the type of the traditional younger brother a spoiled one at that and cary wouldnt it was mr hubbard who went on the mission and came back with the man pray dont think of getting me a cap said mr forrest bowing and smiling rather gravely id much rather you did not indeed it wouldnt find me as i make no stay in england at all i i wish you a very pleasant sojourn he finished somewhat abruptly and with a comprehensive bow to the party backed away but just two months later they ran upon him on the rhine the express steamer had picked them up at bonn and paddled them up the crowded stream to coblentz and there at the dock chatting with two immensely swell prussian officers was mr forrest heres your drummer again flo said cary turning disdainfully from the contemplation of the battlements of ehrenbreitstein just catch on to the cut of those dutch trousers will you indicating by a nod of his sapient head the tightfitting creaseless garments in which were encased the martial lower limbs visible below the long voluminous skirts of their doublebreasted frockcoats flo gazed with frank animation in her eyes but forrest never saw her until after he had waved adieu to his german friends standing in statuesque and superb precision at the salute beyond the foaming wake of the deutscher kaiser i knew wed see you again said miss allison smiling sunshine up into his face and ive brought your cap its in one of those trunks now she concluded indicating the pile of luggage on the deck abaft the wheel hubbard and other admirers who had besieged her on the steamer were no longer in attendance in their stead was a wellgroomed sedate prosperouslooking man referred to as my father when mr forrest was presented a moment later and with him conversing eagerly and fluently in a highpitched querulous voice was a younger man whose english was as pure as his accent was foreign mr elmendorf said miss allison but she did not explain as perhaps she might have done carys tutor forrest bowed civilly to both but looked hard at the latter and miss allison presently went on to explain father joined us nearly a week ago he couldnt come before i wish i could have stayed to see the worlds fair but auntie was so miserable the doctor said she must get away from chicago at once and so we had to come then carys a perfect hoodlum at home one scrape after another as fast as he can get in and father can get him out they sent him with us she continued in the flow of her boundless confidences herr max is a very highly educated young man but i dont think hes doing cary any good that night at mainz there was an episode mr allison senior fatigued had gone to bed as soon as they reached their hotel mrs lawrence auntie that is miss allison and their maid were billeted in very comfortable rooms under herr schnorrs hospitable roof elmendorf stepped in to write letters and cary sneaked out for a smoke it was after ten the shops were closed cigarettes had been strictly forbidden and the boys small stock of contraband had been discovered and seized that morning at bonn herr max wrote currente calamo and as he turned off page after page he lost all thought of his charge among carys treasured possessions was a calibre smith wesson and with this pelletpropeller in his hippocket the boy fancied himself as dangerous as an anarchist twice had it been captured by paterfamilias and twice recovered the last time at cologne carrying concealed weapons was as much against the law in cologne as it is in chicago and much more of an offence but nothing had there occurred to impel him to draw it the boatlanding was not five hundred yards away there under the arching lights of its beautiful bridge sparkling with the reflection of myriad stars silently flowed the rhine and there lay the deutscher kaiser with her wellstocked larder and wineroom thither went the boy in quest of forbidden fruit a waiter to whom he had confided his desire had promised to have the cigarettes on hand and kept his promise for one small package he demanded a fourmark piece a silver coin of about the size and rather more than the value of the american dollar cary responded with what you giving us which the teutonic kellner couldnt understand the boy proffered a mark the german equivalent for the american quarter and sought vainly through the misty memories of his lessons for the german equivalent of size me up for a chump the waiter had friends and fellowconspirators the boy had none and when a grab was made for his portemonnaie he backed against the stone wall and whipped out his pygmy sixshooter miss allison looking out from her casement over the moonlit beauty of the scene before her had recognized her brothers form and later his uplifted voice she knew there was trouble and felt that worse would follow unless prompt measures were taken she was not dressed for promenade being already in peignoir slippers and dishevelled hair but the sudden sound of a shot and a scream banished her scruples she darted into the corridor and on towards the head of the stairs just in time to collide once again with her atlantic protector but was not received with open arms forrest bade her run back to her room while he sped on to the boy german police are slow if sure but the waiters associates were quick enough they had scattered before the police could converge and forrest was first at the scene just as he supposed the boy had peppered himself it was only a fleshwound something to scare and distress and confine young america to his bed for ten days and so to be bragged about prodigiously later on but the injury to german institutions the affront to the majesty of german law was not so slight it took some days of consular and diplomatic correspondence and a week of official espionage to satisfy the local authorities that no deeprooted conspiracy was at the bottom of this discovery of murderous weapons in the hands of the amerikaner in the care of the patient and in all the formalities attendant upon the case mr forrest proved of infinitely more value than the accomplished tutor the former an officer reared with deep regard for established law and order accepted the situation as a fact the laws as incontrovertible and considered himself and friends although involuntarily as the offenders the germanamerican scholar on the contrary spent fruitless hours in striving to argue the officials out of their stand and in preaching a crusade against the laws they were sworn to obey forrest won their regard and elmendorf their distrust if not disgust and from the moment forrest reappeared bearing the limp and lamenting cary in his arms miss allison had chosen to look upon him as in some sense the familys good angel they were much together for a week about young carys bedside and the boy swore that if he had a feller like him for a toot he wouldnt mind trying to obey then when forrest had to go his way she found that she missed him as she never before had missed mortal man it was the first shadow on her life since her mothers death five years before in september most unexpectedly they met him again at geneva cary had been feeding the swans in the blue waters about the little isle of jj rousseau and was figuring how much hed have to pay in costs and fines if he yielded to his consuming desire to drop a donick on the head of one of them that had spit at him when flo suddenly gasped oh theres and stopped short loungers and passersby looked up and shrugged their gallic shoulders and exchanged glances of commiseration at sight of a sixteenyearold boy rushing yelling after a cab but the boy was fleet despite his recent fleshwound and presently reappeared dragging a man by the arm who bared his brown head and bowed low over a frankly extended hand he looked a trifle dusty and travelstained to carys critical eye and the boy meant to comment on the foreign cut of his norfolk jacket and knickerbockers provided a chance were afforded him to enter a remark edgewise but florence with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes was pouring forth a volume of welcome and explanation all in one forrest was on his way to the station en route to montreux oh dont go by rail wait and take the boat with us its so much lovelier over at the quay lay moored the major davel and thither forrest bade the cabman take his luggage it was indeed lovelier the evening voyage up that beautiful alplocked lake and while auntie fatigued with her days shopping and sightseeing snoozed placidly in the salon and cary on honor not to smoke cigarettes again until his next birthday was puffing a swiss pennygrab at the bow mr forrest and this fair joyous girl sat and talked while the sun went down over the jura and turned to purple and gold and crimson the dazzling summits of mont blanc and the faraway peaks up the valley of the rhone elmendorf was enjoying a weeks leave mr allison was sampling the waters at carlsbad and auntie and florence had cary on their hands the boy adored forrest by this time couldnt forrest spend a day or two they would take him to chillon and up to the rochers de naye there was a view worth seeing i can stand on that point up yonder said cary a mile and a quarter high and fire a stone down the chimney of the hotel at territet and they did take him for forrest remained four days mr elmendorf wrote that on the advice of his physician he had asked for a week more to spend in quiet at his home in the shades of his alma mater in a placid old german town stopping at berne a few hours after leaving his friends on lac leman mr forrest found the quaint old capital crowded a congress of socialists had been called and from all over europe the exponents of the order were gathered and almost the first voice to catch his ear as forrest strolled through the throng in the open platz near the station was highpitched querulous and oddly familiar turning sharply the officer came face to face with mr elmendorf still presumably recuperating in the shades of the university at jena and that night mr elmendorf called upon him at his hotel i found myself so much better said he that i decided to push ahead and still availing myself of my leave to stop and see some of these most interesting old helvetic cities my coming here today was fortuitous yet possibly unfortunate mr allison has a deeprooted prejudice against anything of this kind against anything i may say that has a tendency to improve the condition of the laboring man and while i have nothing to shrink from in the matter i prefer not to offend the sensibilities whether right or wrong of my employer and therefore should on his account ask that you make no mention should you write of having seen me here and elmendorf waited a moment i shall not be apt to write said forrest coldly after a pause well in case you you see any of the family again if its all the same to you i shall not volunteer any information mr elmendorf but should i ever be asked the direct question since you have nothing to shrink from in the matter there need be i presume no hesitancy in my saying that i saw you here oh not at all not at all was the answer though in tone by no means cheery or confident and elmendorf departed with the conviction that forrest did not like him which was simply a case of reciprocity there was yet another meeting as unexpected as its predecessors between the allisons and mr forrest and this was of all perhaps the most decisive forrests leave was soon to expire he was returning from vienna to paris and met allison senior at basle the bohemian waters or the rest and regimen or both combined had greatly benefited the merchant his manner was brisk and buoyant his face shone with health and content he was cordiality itself to the man whom he had greeted with but cool civility on the rhine i feel ready for anything said he and am going back at once cary and elmendorf go with me but flo and her aunt want to stay awhile in paris look them up will you if you go there hфtel lafond forrest promised he was going to metz and luxembourg on the way and purposed spending only a few days in the capital he found the ladies packing and almost ready to start once again he crossed the atlantic in miss allisons company and this time though there might have been hubbards and other gallants aboard she had no use for them it was mr forrests figure her eye sought the moment she came on deck forrests arm on which she leaned in the joyous exhilarating tramps on the breezy promenade every woman on board except aunt lawrence believed her engaged to him before they were halfway over and would have sworn to it at sandy hook anything more blissful gladsome confident than her manner at first could hardly be described but when it presently began to give way to something half shy half appealing almost tender when long silences and downdrooping lashes replaced the ceaseless prattle and frankly uplifted eyes then there was little room for doubt in aunt lawrences mind that flo had flung herself away well i wash my hands of it said the pious lady it was fate and her father he deliberately threw them together again after my warning now i suppose hell have to do something for him for if flo loves the man shell marry him if he hasnt a penny beyond his pay which he probably hasnt there ought to be a law against such things but never a confession or confidence did flo have to offer the ladies spent a week in new york before going west mr forrest went on about his business it was when he met them at chicago and calmly escorted them from their stateroom on the limited to their waiting carriage that aunt lawrence felt the time had come for her to speak and speak she did the moment mr forrest had closed the carriage door raised his hat and was left behind has that young man asked you to marry him florence and florence burst into tears from having been a bitter opponent of the possibility mrs lawrence from this moment veered squarely around a month agone she would have resented his daring to speak of such a thing now she raged at his daring not to here they were home again at chicago with all florences friends crowding about and rejoicing in her return and here said aunt lawrence was this extraordinary young man detained on some mysterious duty on the staff of the general commanding working in his office at the pullman building by day and meeting flo at dinners dances theatres and operas by night coming occasionally to the house welcomed by her brother the millionaire with whom the young man often sat now and had long talks about the questions of the hour welcomed shyly but unmistakably by florence adored by cary who took to paying long visits to the lieutenants workshop and meeting those swells his brother officers and looked upon with distrust only by elmendorf and herself never before had the lady fancied the tutor or shown a disposition to listen to his dissertations which were long now she rejoiced his soul by encouraging him it was an easy step to discreet confidences with forrest as the subject mr elmendorf became a seeker for truth other officers whom florence met in society came to the house to call and presently to dine mr elmendorf and his pupil were seldom absent from the table and mr elmendorf made martial acquaintances which as a member of the allison household he was welcome to cultivate one day he came in big with news and that evening after a long conference with elmendorf mrs lawrence decided on another warning talk with her charming niece florence she said finally i am the last woman on earth to pry into any one elses affairs a conviction with regard to herself which is cherished by almost every woman but i have felt it my duty to learn something about mr forrests past life i own i did object to him as a possible suitor but better that than a man insincere in his intentions what would you say were i to tell you what i have heard recently miss allison turned and faced her aunt unflinchingly that he was engaged to miss hosmer now mrs stuyvesant that she broke it off and that he has never cared for any one since i know all about it auntie mainly from his own lips then all ive got to say is you are the most extraordinary persons i ever met both of you illustration illustration chapter ii there are many excellent people in this bright world who like mrs lawrence are prone to assert that all theyve got to say on a given subject is so and so and then to stultify themselves by proceeding to talk a whole torrent mrs lawrence said a great deal in the course of this initial interview and followed it up with a very great deal more she considered mr forrests conduct worse than incomprehensible what business had he to tell a girl his heart was buried in the past and pay her all loverlike attentions in the present he hasnt said miss allison promptly and flatly he has simply been kind and friendly he would have been discourteous unamerican had he done anything less it wasnt he who told her he never had cared or would care for any one after miss hosmer kate lenox told her that and so did other girls here when then did mr forrest inform her of his broken engagement asked aunt lawrence on the steamer coming home said florence he couldnt help himself i met mrs stuyvesant in washington last winter such a lovely woman and some one said she was once engaged to an army officer and it was broken off she found she didnt love him enough to leave her luxurious home to live on the frontier among indians i dont know how her name came up or what prompted me to talk as i did i was saying that i thought her cruel heartless and that she should have considered all that before ever she engaged herself to him and then he simply put up his hand saying do not speak of it miss allison i was the man it fairly took my breath away said florence which her aunt could hardly believe and i didnt know what to say and then he went on quietly to speak of her in the most beautiful way and assured me there were other and graver reasons which led to her decision some of which at least he could not gainsay and mr stuyvesants wealth and social position had very little to do with the fact of her finally marrying him as she did and not until several years after the engagement was broken indeed miss allison waxed tearfully eloquent in defence of mr forrest whom she declared highminded and honorable and manly he wasnt in love with her nor she with him not a bit but she honored him and respected him and liked him better than any man she knew and papa thought him such a superior man and cary was devoted to him and he had been of infinite service to them abroad and was welcome now and should be welcome any time any time to their doors and if aunt lawrence or anybody spoke ill of him to her shed defend him to the bitter end and as for hinting or insinuating that he was trifling with her it was simply outrageous outrageous and if aunt lawrence dared to let him suppose it was his duty to propose to her now shed never forgive her never and so aunt lawrence discovered that her blithe merry joyous niece of the years gone by had developed a fine temper of her own and a capacity for independent thought and action that was simply appalling florence went dancing down into the parlor with flushed cheeks and briny indignant eyes and the mien of an offended fivefoot goddess leaving aunt lawrence to the contemplation of the field of her disastrous defeat and the card of the unworthy object of their discussion illustration mr benton floyd forrest th regiment of infantry usa what on earth brings him here at this time of day quoth she irate and ruffled for a man who is neither lover nor fiancй he assumes the airs and for aught i know the rights of both the girl is as illbalanced as her mother and not all women it must be owned think too well of an only brothers wife the manners of these army men are simply uncouth who ever heard of calls at ten am it was but a few minutes before miss allison returned in fact she did not return to the scene of the late struggle a lovely boudoir overlooking the flashing blue waters of the lake from high over the intervening boulevard miss allison went direct to her own rooms on the opposite side of the broad hallway and not until evening was mrs lawrence favored with explanation why are you not dressed she somewhat caustically inquired as her niece came down arrayed for dinner for answer miss allison contemplated her pretty white arms and took a backward and downward glance at the fall of the trailing skirt of heavy silk then must it be recorded she calmly asked whats the matter with this this said aunt lawrence with marked emphasis may do for home dinners but wont for an operaparty here it is seven you cant change your dress before eight and you simply cant go to the langdons box in that im not going to the langdons box you were and mr forrest was to dine here and take you mr forrest left for the west on sudden orders at noon and came at ten to tell me mrs lawrences hands and eyes went up in mad dismay you dont mean to tell me youve given up going because that mans ordered off child child you are simply bent on ruining yourself socially i dont wonder people say youre daft about him who says im daft about him queried miss allison flushing instantly but looking dangerous well not just that perhaps returned mrs lawrence but thats what they will say now surely mrs langdon could ask somebody in his place who could have escorted you or else i could mrs langdon did invite somebody else two somebody elses in fact as my letter urged her to do fanny tracy was wild to go and captain farwell wild to take her i did a charitable thing in suggesting them then the result of that piece of charity will be that all chicago will say you are so much in love with that man you couldnt go faust when he went away chicago has too many other things to think of and wheres papa said miss allison turning abruptly from her aunt and moving with quick impetuous step towards the heavy portiиre that hung between the parlor and mr allisons library but she stopped short at the threshold for there just within the rich folds of the hanging barrier apparently searching for some particular book among the shelves nearest the parlor and farthest from the library lights and humming musically to himself as he did so was carys tutor i did not know you were here mr elmendorf said miss allison coldly i supposed you were in the study with my brother i was until a moment ago we needed a book and i came down for it mr allisons easychair and readinglamp with the evening papers were all arranged as usual awaiting at the other end of the room the coming of the master of the house it was his custom to read there some hours each evening and the library was the one room in which he reigned supreme his books papers desks and tables were sacred to his use and might not at any time be disturbed by other hands even mrs lawrence who had her own books in her own little snuggery upstairs rarely ventured to touch her brothers library shelves as for florence she never cared to it was well known that mr elmendorf had more than once been sharply rebuked for having helped himself without first seeking the owners permission yet here he was again the odd thing about it was that this end of the library was dark the books on these shelves were huge folios the size of some brobdingnagian atlas any one of which required all mr elmendorfs strength to lift from its place miss allison was not overshrewd she was frankness guilelessness itself she rarely saw through the meanness of man or the duplicity of woman this however was not the first but the second or third time that mr elmendorf had been revealed behind those curtains when she was in conversation in the parlor and it dawned upon her at last that carys tutor was as good a listener as talker and there were times when mr elmendorf was fluency itself he was a shrewd fellow too and he read his sentence in her face miss allison said he quitting his search and stepping boldly forward it would be idle in me to disguise that i have unwittingly heard a portion of the conversation between your aunt and yourself and as your brothers friend and tutor your fathers trusted adviser in many a way both professional and personal indeed if i may say so without offence as one who would gladly be your friend i feel bound to support mrs lawrence in the view she takes of this pardon me unfortunate matter mr elmendorf interrupted miss allison with eyes and cheeks aflame bear with me one moment persisted mr elmendorf with deprecatory gesture i am aware that i have not possessed your friendship in the past indeed i may say i have been conscious of a distinctly hostile influence but my devotion to your father and your brother and the interests of the family and all that may affect its good name make it mandatory upon me to speak i appeal to mrs lawrence to support me in my assertion that i am prompted only by the worthiest motives in thus apparently intrusively officiously if you will claiming your attention mrs lawrence bowed grave assent she had many a time expressed her disapprobation of mr elmendorfs propensity to interfere in domestic matters wherein he had no concern but here was a case where unlookedfor support was accorded her side of an unfinished argument mrs lawrence considered all comment of mr elmendorf on her affairs as utterly unwarrantable but poor flo really laid herself open to criticism it was miss allison who brought matters to a climax i refuse to listen said she with something very like a stamp of her plump little foot mr elmendorf forgets himself entirely when he attempts to to criticise my conduct pardon me miss allison it is not your conduct it is on the contrary mr forrests that i consider deserving criticism more than criticism it is of him not of yourself that i feel it my duty to speak i should be disloyal to my employer to my friends to my own sense of honor and propriety were i to keep silence i know whereof i speak when i say that he is unfit to step within these doors to presume to address you even as an acquaintance and if you will but listen but i wont listen i forbid your ever daring to speak to me in any such way or on any such subject again and so saying miss allison swept angrily from the room elmendorf shrugged his shoulders you see he said in the highpitched querulous tone that so closely resembled a whine you see the hopelessness of arguing with a woman in love i have only succeeded in making another enemy and my position here will become all the more embarrassing in so far as i can uphold you mr elmendorf said mrs lawrence promptly you may count upon me flo is stubborn and hotheaded she looks upon mr forrest as a hero whereas he is really a detriment to her social future i rejoice in his being ordered west and hope the duty will keep him a long time away from chicago ah did he say he was ordered away on any special duty asked mr elmendorf i certainly so understood florence mr elmendorf elevated his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders anew that is very unlike the story that was told me at headquarters said he significantly what was that asked mrs lawrence with prompt and pardonable curiosity that he was ordered away under a cloud in order to put an end to probable scandal gambling asked mrs lawrence whose own firstborn left college prematurely because of fatal propensities in that line well answered elmendorf pursing up his lips i wont say there may not have been something of that kind but the main trouble is more serious i speak from excellent authority in saying that the general gave him just sixteen hours in which to pack and start fixing the noon train today as the limit very probably to prevent his seeing the er woman in the case again illustration illustration chapter iii miss allison declined to come down to dinner that night and mrs lawrence had no power to compel her attendance what she hoped was that when mr allison came in he would send his mandate but mr allison did not come instead there was a messenger from the club mr allison was unexpectedly detained by an important meeting of a board of directors and might not be home until late the butler made the announcement with his usual impassive face and mrs lawrence directed dinner served without further delay when told to summon master cary a servant presently returned with the information that that young gentleman had stepped out slipped out muttered elmendorf between his teeth for no sooner did cary discover that dad was not to be home than he tobogganed down the baluster rail and shot forth into the surrounding darkness and was blocks away among cronies of his own before his absence was discovered my brother is far too lax in his discipline with cary said mrs lawrence in that profound disapprobation which most people have of other peoples methods especially when their own system or lack of it has proved conspicuous failure mr allison said elmendorf diplomatically is somewhat wedded to his theory but that may not stand the test of practice i had flattered myself that the few months of my tuition were beginning to bear good fruit and that cary was steadying so to speak but ever since the boy began to get this west point idea into his head i have found him becoming more and more difficult to guide and control indeed while i do not wish to be considered as complaining i feel bound to say since you have done me the honor to open the subject that the influence of mr forrest upon both your nephew and your brother has been detrimental to my usefulness in this household so much so in fact as to prove at times a serious embarrassment now mrs lawrence had by no means opened the subject as intimated by mr elmendorf but he was adroit in the manipulation of language he noted unerringly the cloud of dissent in her face and knew it would find verbal expression provided opportunity were afforded to head off disclaimer therefore he resorted to the timehonored feminine expedient of talking down the other side and giving it no chance to be heard an easy matter with him for when elmendorf got to talking there was no telling when he would stop or what he might say he was a man who loved talk for talks sake who had an almost maternal fondness for the sound of his own voice and who petted and cajoled and patted and moulded his phrases and sentences as an indulgent mother might humor a child or a schoolgirl dress and adorn a doll before he had been two months an inmate of the household old allison had come to wish he had not begun by prescribing that cary and his tutor should regularly appear at the family table once established there elmendorf speedily became dominant if friends of miss allison dropped in to luncheon and the chat was of social matters or other girls if allison brought home fellowmagnates to take potluck at his hospitable board if mrs lawrence and her especial cronies discoursed on that neverending problem the servants if forrest and his army friends came informally no matter what the subject or who the speakers elmendorf speedily chipped in as cary expressed it and once in could not be driven out his pet theme was the wrongs of the wageworkers his pet theory the doctrine of incessant change his watchword seemed to be whatever is is wrong for against the existing order of things in state society or home he was ever ready to wage determined war armed with propensities such as these a profound conviction of his own sense and sagacity and consummate distrust in those of everybody else it is easy to see that once encouraged to break the ice and join in the current of conversation he could not readily be eliminated a man of good education was elmendorf and during the european trip he had not been so much in the way but once home again more and more as the winter wore on did the head of the household find himself wishing he had never set eyes on the man he heard of him presently as addressing socialistic meetings and appearing prominently at the sessions of the labor unions then in the columns of papers of marked anarchistic tendencies that had been under the ban ever since the riots of long articles began to appear over his initials and both in his speeches and in his contributions elmendorf was emphatic in his condemnation of capital and in his demands that labor should unite unite everywhere and by concerted and persistent effort wring from the congested coffers of capital elmendorf loved alliteration a large share of its hoarded wealth the hands that wrought the fabric said he should share and share alike in every profit the man who riveted the bolt or swung the hammer deserved equal wage with him whose brain evolved the plan or whose fortune built the mammoth plant and purchased the costly machinery what i employed him for said allison was to prepare cary for college and to keep him out of mischief but the boys running wilder than before elmendorfs welcome to his theories but not to the time they take from the education of my son it presently transpired that many an evening when they were supposed to be in the study or at the library or the theatre elmendorf was off at some meeting of the laboring men largely attended by loafers who labored not at all and no one knew just where cary had gone unless he chose to tell elmendorf had long since offended miss allison and her friends by intrusion in their talk he had offended mrs lawrence by comment and criticism on household affairs that were none of his business he had annoyed allison by persistence in taking part in the discussion when his business or professional friends happened in he had time and again thrown down the gauntlet so to speak when forrest or his comrades were present and challenged the army men to debate as to whether there was the faintest excuse for the existence of even so small a force as ours in a land so great and free but forrest coolly even courteously refused to be drawn into controversy and though treating the tutor with scrupulous politeness insisted on holding him at a distance naturally therefore elmendorf hated the lieutenant and all who trained with him none the less did he continue making frequent visits to the officers at headquarters and there the officers who met him on equal footing at mr allisons table could not snub him they grew suspicious of him however especially after reading his speeches etc which as the spring came on grew more and more significant and so they shut up like so many clams on all professional topics whenever elmendorf appeared for it was well known in the great community that the regulars were keeping close watch on the changing phases of what the papers termed the situation twice or thrice before in the history of the city had its mobs overpowered the municipal authority and defied that of the state right or wrong the majority among the prominent citizens believed that in greater force and fury than ever before the turbulent element among the people taking advantage of some convenient strike would break bounds once more and nothing short of disciplined military force would down them the state troops vastly improved by the experiences of the past had won their way to increased confidence and respect but all the same people took comfort in the thought that only an hours railway ride away there was posted a compact little body of regulars and despite the jealousy aroused in the heart of a free people through the existence of a standing army it is marvellous to see how much comfort its proximity brings to lawabiding men now one of elmendorfs theories and one upon which he descanted by the hour was that in the very nature of things it was impossible for people well to do in the world to sympathize with or understand the needs of those who were not so favored divine writ said he was with him just as impossible as for a camel to pass through the needles eye or for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven was it that the wealthy could feel for the poor opulence and indigence were no more sympathetic than oil and vinegar the poor must ever have a champion a savior a mediator or they are ground beneath a relentless heel it was elmendorfs belief that no manufacturer employer landlord capitalist or manager could by any possible chance deal justly with the employed it was a conviction equally profound that manifest destiny had chosen him to be the modern moses who was to lead his millions out of the house of bondage it was astonishing that with purpose so high and aim so lofty he could find time and inclination to meddle with matters so far beneath him but the trouble with elmendorf was that he was a born meddler and no matter what the occasion from a national convention to a servants squabble he was ever eager to serve as adviser or arbitrator it was his proclivities in this line that brought on the first clash with mrs lawrence for in a difference between the lady of the house and the belle of the kitchen which was as usual none of his affair elmendorf took sides with the cook in the light of his conduct on this occasion mrs lawrence declared him a pest and she only recanted when thus unexpectedly he arrayed himself under her own banner against her recreant niece and so this evening they sat alone in the stately diningroom and elmendorf found in mrs lawrence an eager and even sympathetic listener for just so soon as the services of the butler could be dispensed with the tutor opened fire on forrest and his alleged iniquities and from this as entering wedge he found it easy to favor the aunt with his views as to what should be done towards reclaiming the niece so lamentably and notoriously infatuated mrs lawrence winced it is all very well for a woman to say such things herself in the heat of argument and to the object of her wrath but quite another matter to hear them applied by somebody else and that somebody a dependent so to speak in the household mrs lawrence it may be remembered was indignant at forrest first because she thought he meant to offer himself to florence and then because she thought he didnt she did not want florence to marry him but still less did she want that he should not want her that was unbearable she upbraided florence for seeing so much of forrest because it made people think her in love with him and she raged at the people who dared to think as she said they did mrs lawrence therefore may with safety be set down as somewhat inconsistent i do not think my niece is at all infatuated with mr forrest mr elmendorf said she somewhat severely she admires him greatly and there happens to be no one else to occupy her thoughts just now i beg you therefore to dismiss that idea at once and for all time i should be glad to do so mrs lawrence replied the tutor with much gravity and could do so perhaps were it not that you yourself gave me in the conversation i was so unfortunate as accidentally to overhear the confirmation would it not be better now instead of working at crosspurposes in this matter if you were to trust me more fully and enable me to act in harmony with your plans and wishes i shrink from intruding unasked but believe me i too have heard such talk as convinces me that it is high time miss allisons friends took counsel together to protect her good name indignant as most women would be at being reminded of her own responsibility for a false impression mrs lawrence could have found it easy to put an end to the conference then and there but for elmendorfs adroit reference to other talk that piqued her curiosity and held her what talk where she asked i do not like to mention names mrs lawrence my acquaintance among the officials at headquarters has become extensive and much is said in confidence to me that perhaps wouldnt be heard in their chat with others indeed i may say that some among the more thoughtful and broadminded of their number there are a few such have sought my views upon important questions of the day and have favored me with their opinions and do you mean that florence has been discussed there among all those men those officers interrupted mrs lawrence with justifiable wrath elmendorf shrugged his shoulders of course i ought not to betray my hosts or give away their secrets but do you suppose that there any more than among the loungers of the clubs a womans name is never discussed i thought they prided themselves on being gentlemen said mrs lawrence wrathfully and gentlemen would never permit it ah my dear madam theres the trouble a man is not necessarily a gentleman because wealth and social position impel him to membership in one of these forcinghouses of luxurious iniquity we call clubs or because four years in a westpoint monkeyjacket win him a commission as a genteel loafer a womans name is held far less in reverence among them than it is among the humblest of our masses oh yes i anticipate your question said he at this juncture with deprecatory gesture and faint significant smile true i am not personally a member of any of those clubs nor do i wish to be but i know men and mingle with them elsewhere everywhere else in fact the roof of the clubhouse cloaks their misdeeds and worse things are said and done beneath it than outside as for officers the only reason why there is apt to be a stronger percentage of common decency among them is that they are chosen from the masses of the people and sent to the point simply to be moulded not reformed mr forrest is an example of the socalled blueblooded stock his people are swells so to speak people whose heads are held very high and their morals correspondingly low people who think it condescension on their part to notice wageworkers except as menials hence i am in no wise surprised to hear of him as i do even among those who are well of his own cloth surely mr elmendorf the officers who have so often dined here do not entertain ill opinions of mr forrest such men as colonel kenyon captain waring major cranston they have known him long and well and they speak of him to us at least most highly again the significant shrug of elmendorfs shoulders and the sneer in his tone oh certainly said he noblesse oblige or honor among thieves whichever maxim you choose i doubt not that in his younger days each of the eminently respectable trio you mention was no more a model of morality than is mr forrest i have indeed heard as much of captain waring but one has only once to penetrate beyond the veil of that professional reserve which they assume and the details of one anothers lives are not such guarded secrets after all and you really mean that from them among them you have learned these these these particulars of mr forrests sudden orders to leave the city said elmendorf dryly with another shrug from where else even to the name and station of the lady in the case illustration illustration chapter iv not half a mile away from the allisons costly residence was the home of major cranston an officer of some thirty years experience in the cavalry it was an unpretentious oldfashioned frame house that had escaped the deluge of fire that swept the city in and that looked oddly out of place now in the midst of towering apartment blocks or handsome edifices of brick and stone but cranston loved the old place and preferred to keep it intact and as left to him at the death of his father until such time as he should retire from active service then he might see fit to rebuild the property was now of infinitely more value than the house you could move that old barrack out to the suburbs cut down them trees and cut up the place into buildinlots and sell any one of them for enough to build a dozen better houses said a neighbor who had prospered as had the cranstons by holding on to the paternal estate but cranston smilingly said he preferred not to cut up or cut down them trees and he had grown up together they were saplings when he was a boy and had grown to sturdy oakhood when his own youngsters plainsbred little cavaliers used to gather their chicago friends about them under the whispering leaves and thrill their juvenile souls with stirring tales of their doings out in the indian county louis cranston was believed to have participated with his fathers troop in many a pitched battle with the savage foe before his tenth birthday and patchie the younger was known to be so called not because of his mothers having sprung from the distinguished family in which george patchen was a patron saint but because he had been born in the arizona mountains and rocked in a tonto cradle those two boys were now stalwart men cattlegrowers in the far west whose principal interest in chicago was as a market for their branded steers they had their own vines and figtrees their own wives and olivebranches and after the death of the venerable grandparents the homestead on the shores of lake michigan was for some years untenanted but therein were stored the old furniture and the old books and pictures all carefully guarded by one of cranstons veteran sergeants who disabled by wounds and infirmities was glad to accept his commanders offer to give to him and his a home and suitable pension in return for scrupulous care of the old place at long intervals the master had come in on leave and the neighbors always knew when to expect him for the snowshovel or the lawnmower holly wreaths or honeysuckles seemed to pervade the premises and old mcgraths neatest uniform was hung out to sun and air on the back piazza mac was a bibulous veteran at times a circumstance of which placehunters were not slow to take advantage on those rare occasions of the owners homecoming and many a time did the major receive confidential intimation from the sheehans morriseys and meiswinkles in service in the neighborhood that mcgrath was neglectful of his patrons premises and overgiven to the flowing bowl but in mrs mcgraths stanch protectorate as in mcgraths own fidelity cranston had easy confidence twenty years of close communion all over the frontier give fair inkling as to ones characteristics and cranston had known mac and his helpmeet even longer dhrink yer honor faith an i do as regularly as iver i drunk the captains health and prosperity in the ould regiment and id perhaps be doin it too often out of excessive ghratitude but for molly yonder she convinces me wid me own crutch sorr and molly confirmed the statement i let him have no more than is good for him major barrin patricks day and the first of april thats five forks when he always dhrinks as many fingers at a time then hes in arrest till appomattox nine days close and then i let him out for a bit again never fear major im the dishbursin officer of the family an the grocer has his orders mac had his other anniversaries be it understood on all of which occasions he repaired to donnellys shades on a famous thoroughfare two blocks west of the cranstons back gate and entertained all comers with tales of dragoon days that began in the s and spread all over the century shrewd historians of the neighborhood made it a point to look up the dates of brandy station and beverly ford of aldie winchester and waynesboro of yellow tavern and five forks as well as to keep tab on subsequent events of which history makes no mention but which troopers know well for summit springs superstition mountain sunset pass and slim buttes a daring succession of sibilant tonguetacklers were names of indian actions from dakota to the gila the old soldier loved to dwell upon even if donnellys whiskey had not put clogs on his tongue two things was mac always sure of at the shades good listeners and bad liquor but the trooper who has tasted every tipple from pinetop to mescal will forgive the latter if sure of the former donnelly had his ordhers as mrs mac said the sergeant was to be accorded all respect and credit and a hack to fetch him home when his legs got as twisted as his tongue mrs mcgrath would be around within fortyeight hours to audit and pay the accounts donnelly sought to swindle the shrewd old laundress at the start and thereby lost macs valuable custom for six long and anniversaryladen months then he came to terms and didnt try it again for nearly two years which was remarkable in a saloonman this time donnelly was forgiven only upon restitution of the amount involved and the presentation to mrs mcgrath of a very ornate brooch in emeralds and brilliants or something imitative thereof representing the harp of erin from this time on things had gone smoothly a wonderful woman was mrs mac as her husband never failed to admit she had slaved and saved for him in a score of garrisons they had their little hoard carefully invested they hired a young relative and countryman to do the hard work about the premises and they guarded every item of the majors property with a fidelity and care that knew no lapse for mrs mac was never so scrupulous as when her lord was in his cups no said cranston when a neighbor once asked him if he wasnt afraid of serious losses through macs occasional inebriety the more he drinks the stricter her vigilance and shes the smarter of the two but there came a time when the major found it necessary to caution mrs mac and that was when it was brought to his ears that mcgraths nephew the young irish helper above referred to was a frequent attendant at certain turbulent meetings held over on the west side where he had been seen drunk on two occasions its one thing to allow an old soldier like mac his occasional indulgence said cranston he was started that way and he never becomes riotous or ugly but there is no excuse for the boy those meetings alleged to be held in the interests of the workingmen are attended mainly by tramps and loafers fellows who couldnt be hired to do a days honest work and are addressed by professional demagogues who have no end but mischief in view you saw what resulted here when you first came in seven years ago i dont want to hurt macs feelings by saying hes a bad example to his nephew and i dont want to let him know where the boy has been spending his evenings hed break every bone in the youngsters skin if he thought he was consorting with anarchists and rioters and i tell you because you couldnt have heard of it or you yourself would have taken the boy in hand taken him in hand sorr id a broke the snowshovel over the scandalous back av him if id heerd a worrd av it hes aff today sparkin the girls in the block beyant but ill wait for him tonight thank ye sorr for not tellin mac its his own poor sisters boy an like his own that was tuk from us at apache but mac would kill him before hed have him trainin wid them dutchmen and daygoes mrs mcgrath did not share mulvanys views that there are oirish and oirish even phoenix park had failed to shake her view that anarchy and assassination belonged only to foreigners no irishman said she was in the bloody bomb business of and as for dr cronin that was a family matther entirely but if tims been goin to meetin wid the like av them hes been misguided by them as knows betther savin your presence major what would the gentleman be doin wid him that was here last week cranston looked at his housekeeper in surprise the gentleman who came to look over my books mr elmendorf the same sorr he came three times while the major was away and tim was forever sayin what a fine smart man he was for a foreigner and how he was for helpin the poor man cranston gave vent to a long whistle of surprise and sudden enlightenment when was mr elmendorf last there he presently inquired all last week sorr three times at least i let him into the library as usual but he only stayed there awhile he was talkin outside wid tim an hour the major turned away in deep thought only two months before ordered from the far west to take station at the new post near the city he had met elmendorf when dining at the allisons the next morning he found him at headquarters chatting affably with the aidesdecamp and later he encountered him at brentanos just how it came about cranston could not now remember but he had invited elmendorf to step in and look over some old books of his fathers and as the tutor became enthusiastic he was bidden to come again out at the post the major established his modest soldier home much missing the companionship of his devoted wife who was in europe at the time with their only daughter every week perhaps he would run in for half a day to look over his possessions but meantime he had given elmendorf authority to make a complete catalogue of the books as well as to make himself at home in the library a room which mrs mcgrath kept in applepie order but the fame of elmendorf had spread from the city to the garrison and cranston had already begun to wish he had been less impulsive in his invitation when mrs mac told him of the missionary work being done among his retainers by this stranger within his gates the question now was what action could be justifiably taken entering the old dimlylighted study long sacred to his fathers use and now sacred to his memory the major found on every hand evidences that elmendorf had indeed been at work out from their accustomed places on the shelves the books had been dragged and were now stacked up about the room in perplexing disarray some lay open upon the table others on the desk near the north window his fathers favorite seat and here some of the rarest of the collection were now piled ten and fifteen deep on the table in loose sheets were some pencilled memoranda on names authors and dates of publication on the desk were several pads or blocks of the paper much used by writers for the press and face upward among them held by an oldfashioned glass paperweight were a dozen leaves closely pencilled in elmendorfs bold hand cranston raised the weight expecting to find some more memoranda concerning his precious books but was not entirely surprised to read in glaring headlines the wageworkers weapon followed by some vehement lines denunciatory of capital monopoly pampered palates in palatial homes boodleburdened beerbloated legislators etc the sort of alliterative and inflammatory composition which distributed in the columns of the papers of the alarm and arbeiter zeitung stamp was read aloud over the evening pipes and beer to knots of applauding men mostly tramps and idlers in a thousand groggeries throughout the bustling city cranston lifted the file from the desk as though to read beyond the first sheet but on second thought replaced it something about the threatening bayonets of federal hirelings at the foot of the first page promised lively developments farther on and recalled vividly the editorials in similar strain that had been brought to the attention of the officials at headquarters more than one of whom had expressed the belief that they could spot the author on sight cranston turned from it in some disgust and resumed the contemplation of the work already done all he expected all he had stipulated for was a catalogue of the books something he himself had not had time to make and a job which to a man of scholarly tastes and education upon whose hands time was apparently hanging heavily and that equivalent of time money hanging not at all would prove agreeable and acceptable cranstons father loved those books and had grouped them on his shelves according to their subjects history art science the drama the classics standard fiction and modern literature having received each its allotted space and not for a heavy reward would the son have changed them but here already were more than half these prized possessions tumbled promiscuously all over the room and the soldier could have sworn in hearty trooper fashion over the disarray but for the silent presence of his mothers portrait above the mantel facing the fathers desk he had heard only recently of the tutors avowed proclivities for tearing down and stirring up the existing order of things and here was conclusive evidence that the gifted elmendorf proposed the complete rebuilding on his own lines of the fabric that was the revered fathers happiest work even while incidentally devoting some hours each day to stirring up a similar overturning in society that elmendorf was not destitute of practical business views however may be made apparent from the fact that when cranston had intimated a desire to have him name the sum he would consider a fair compensation for the work intending then to add a liberal percentage to the estimate the scholar replied that it would have to depend upon the number of days and hours it took from other avocations and it was now evident that a long engagement was in contemplation closing the door after him and bidding mrs mcgrath allow no one to enter the study until his return unless mr elmendorf should come in major cranston went in search of him it was barely noon up to which hour he was supposed to be closeted with his pupil at the allisons home then after a light luncheon it was his wont to sally forth on a tramp cary starting but rarely returning with him when cranston was at headquarters a fortnight previous the officers were speaking of the almost daily appearance about two oclock of mr elmendorf who was possessed with a desire to get into the generals office and impress that magnate with his views concerning the impending crisis the general however being forearmed was always too busy to accord the interview one experience having proved more than enough everybody was beginning to give elmendorf the cold shoulder there and by this time reasoned cranston he must have had sense enough to discontinue his visits here however he underrated elmendorfs devotion to his principles for such was the tutors conviction of their absolute wisdom and such his sense of duty to humanity that he was ready to encounter any snub rather than be balked in his determination to right the existing wrongs cranston did not want to go to the allisons and ask for elmendorf he had that to say which could not be altogether pleasant and was altogether personal and he had no right to carry possible discord into a fellowcitizens home the lambert library a noble bequest stood within easy range of allisons house and his own a sort of neutral ground and from there did cranston despatch a special messenger with a note will mr elmendorf kindly drop in at the lambert library when he has finished luncheon i have to take the three pm train back to sheridan and desire five minutes conversation relative to affairs at the study as i found them this morning was all the major wrote but it was nearly halfpast one before that boy returned with the answer there was no telephone at the allisons for the millionaire had long since ordered it out finding his home peace broken up by incessant summonses from all manner of people cranston waited impatiently and meant to upbraid the boy it wasnt my fault sir the gentleman was at lunch and wouldnt write until he had finished was the explanation cranston tore open the unexpected reply mr elmendorf deeply regrets that an important engagement in a distant quarter of the city will render it impossible to meet major cranston as proposed if the major will kindly write his suggestions they will receive all consideration and prompt acknowledgment and it had taken elmendorf said cranston wrathfully at least threequarters of an hour to concoct that palpable dodge the railway station was a mile away and he had several matters to attend to it was one of his weaknesses that when he had a thing to say and meant to say it delay was a torment the librarian was a man whom he knew well mr wells ive got to write quite a letter and do it quick said he entering the office can i impose upon your good nature here why certainly major miss wallen will type it for you as fast as you can talk it said the librarian rising and indicating a slender girl who was bending busily over her typewriter oh i didnt mean that the major began and yet i dont know ive sometimes had to dictate reports the only thing is i shouldnt care to hurt a mans feelings by letting him see that somebody else knew of the matter yet ill want to keep a copy for ive got to give him a rasping miss wallen can write a dozen copies at once if you wish said wells and as for hurting anybodys feelings nobody could extract a word from her on the subject then if the young lady will be so kind said cranston bowing courteously i should be most glad to avail myself making no reply the girl deftly fitted the sheets to the roller and waited expectant dont go mr wells i assure you there is no need said cranston as the librarian started to leave the room ive got to its my dinnerhour miss wallen goes at twelve and i after her return if theres anything the office can do for you dont hesitate to ask and with that he was gone miss wallens slim white hands were poised in readiness chicago june began the major there was an instant of swiftclicking keys and a pause for more june repeated cranston yes sir i have that already i didnt suppose it could be done so fast do i give you the address now if you please mr max elmendorf he began shall i spell it for you the swift fingers faltered some strange sudden cloud overshadowed the bright intelligent face the girl turned abruptly away a moment then suddenly arose and hastened to the watercooler under the great window across the room keeping her back resolutely towards the visitor she swallowed half a glass of water then presently resumed her seat excuse me she said i am ready now you found the heat very trying i fear said the major pray do not attempt this if you are tired after your walk it can wait as well as not it is something that doesnt have to be done today she asked looking quickly up certainly not if the sun has been too much for you has it no answer for a moment it isnt the sun finally replied miss wallen but i should rather not take this illustration illustration chapter v that evening as major cranston was getting into uniform again and pondering not a little over the odd behavior of mr wellss stenographer the young lady in question her days library duties at an end was walking thoughtfully homeward she chose a route that carried her close to the dancing waters of the lake it was a longer way but she loved it and the fresh cool wind sweeping inland from the seemingly boundless sheet of blue she was a slender girl rather above the medium height a girl with dark earnest eyes and heavy coils of brown lustrous hair and a grave sweet face whereon already there were traced indelibly lines that told of responsibility and work and care she dressed simply inexpensively yet with a certain style that well became the willowy grace of her figure she moved swiftly but without apparent effort she walked well bore herself well and sped along on her homeward way as though absorbed in her thoughts except when occasionally glancing out over the sparkling expanse to her right other women and nursemaids with romping children dawdled about the sunny footpath along the breakwater miss wallen alone seemed walking with definite purpose nearly opposite the grant memorial the roadway swept close by the path and here it became necessary for her to cross to the western side carriages were rolling almost ceaselessly by and seeing her waiting an opportunity a park policeman signalled to the drivers of those nearest at hand and beckoned to the girl to come on she obeyed somewhat timidly glancing about her one carriage drawn by spirited bays had too much headway and was well upon the crossing before the coachman could help it it brought her almost face to face with the occupants and for an instant hid her from the sight of the friendly policeman when she disappeared her eyes were downcast her features placid even a little pale when an instant later he again caught sight of her miss wallens eyes were flashing and her soft cheeks aflame a man in the carriage sitting opposite two ladies one of middle age and dignified bearing the other young and divinely fair had seemed suddenly to recognize her and whipped off his hat in somewhat careless fashion taking no notice whatever of the salutation beyond coloring vividly miss wallen passed quickly behind the carriage and was speedily over the crossing a friend of yours mr elmendorf asked the elder lady languidly a friend of mr forrests rather was the significant reply and both ladies started the younger turning to see who it could be the elder staring one instant after her then suddenly confronting elmendorf again one swift glance at her niece and mrs lawrence with uplifted eyebrows framed her question with sensitive speechless lips elmendorf nodded sapiently then miss allison turned around whats her name who is she her name is wallen she is employed at the lambert library oh indeed exclaimed miss allison in quick and lively interest ive heard mr forrest speak of her i do wish we could see her again whereupon mrs lawrence and mr elmendorf exchanged glances of commiseration a quarter of a mile farther up the drive mr elmendorf checked the driver if you will excuse me now ladies i have a call to make near here and will leave you should cary return before i do kindly ask him not to go out again until i see him mrs lawrence suggested driving him to his destination but elmendorf declined two minutes more and he had disappeared from their view among the shrubbery and in ten was rapidly walking southward along a busy thoroughfare just as he expected coming up the opposite side of the street moving swiftly and with downcast eyes was miss wallen springily he crossed and the next instant was lifting his hat in more respectful fashion than when in the park half confronting half turning as though to join her barely noticing him at all miss wallen moved determinedly on and elmendorf following placed himself at her side i could not but note your manner to me yesterday in the library miss wallen and indeed on several previous occasions and in spite of it i venture to ask you to listen patiently to me for a moment my object is such as to entitle my words to your respect not resentment it is for your own sake your mothers your name that i brave your indignation again if it is to repeat what you intimated the other day mr elmendorf said the girl in low firm tone i refuse to listen you have no right to speak in such a way i have the right to try and save a poor girl from fatal error i have devoted the best years of my life to the cause of the poor as against the rich the downtrodden against the purseproud i should not have presumed to speak to you on such a subject had i not heard your name lightly slightingly used among these very satraps whom mr forrest hails as companions comrades it is to protect you from the misjudgment the censure of others that i strive to warn you pardon me if i recall to you that it was partially at least on my recommendation that you were given the position at the library and that now my name as your endorser is measurably involved of course if after what i have to say you persist in receiving mr forrests attentions as we will call them you must do so at your own risk mr elmendorf i have told you that there is no truth whatever in these reports i do not say there is it is to warn you of the scandalous outrageous things these people in socalled high society say of people who are in humbler walks of life that i ventured to relate what id heard it is to obviate the possibility of them in future i have told you mr elmendorf that i need no such warning that i will listen to no such affront i refuse to believe that any gentleman of mr forrests set has spoken ill of me i know none of them they know nothing of me knew nothing perhaps until your name became linked with his how said he with significant shrug of his shoulders i know not unless he himself has boyishly boasted of but here miss wallen stopped short and faced him i will hear no more of this either now or hereafter she said with blazing eyes then turned abruptly and entered the hallway of an apartmenthouse close at hand and shut the door in his face it was not her home as elmendorf knew very well but possibly friends lived there who would give her refuge and welcome at all events he had received his congй and there was nothing for it but to go and go he did in high dudgeon not until miss wallen watching from an upper window in the room of a friend and fellowworker had seen him board a car and disappear with it far down the street did she resume her homeward walk and now her eyes were wet with indignant tears that mr elmendorf should have asserted that it was through his influence partially at least miss wallen had received her appointment in the library was characteristic of mr elmendorf coming to the city himself a stranger only the year previous he had spent some hours there each day in reading and writing and study and had early made acquaintance with mr wells the librarian greatly impressing that gentleman at first with the fluency of his chat and the extent of his travel information and culture john allison millionaire and manager was one of the trustees of the lambert bequest and when cary came home from boardingschool in april a premature appearance which the superintendents letter fully explained allison didnt know what to do with him i wish i knew the right sort of tutor to take him in hand said he to wells and elmendorf apparently deep in a volume across the office heard and promptly acted upon the hearing he asked wells for a letter of introduction and recommendation wells having known the applicant less than a fortnight was pleased with him and said what he could allison was impressed by the applicants fluency and apparent frankness and in less than a week the erudite elmendorf found himself in halcyon waters then came the foreign trip another thing to rejoice in but before he sailed elmendorf had had an opportunity of doing good to his kind as he conceived it seeking an inexpensive lodging on his arrival in chicago he had found a neat cheerful home under the roof of an elderly widow a mrs wallen in a little house on the north side she lived alone with her daughter who it presently transpired was her main support there was a son a stalwart fellow too who being only twentyfour and a man of some education and ability should have been the mothers prop and stay in her declining years and so he would have been very possibly but for the fact that he had provided himself with encumbrances of his own in the shape of a wife two children and numerous debts he was provident in no other way martin as the mother fondly said would have made a mark in the world if hed only been started right but as mart started himself he started wrong so long as the father lived both brother and sister had been well educated and gently reared for mr wallen was a man of scholarly tastes but a poor man slaving on a poor mans salary he had little to leave his children beyond his blessing and the care of their aging mother martin was already pledged to a girl schoolmate when the father died and jeannette his sister who seemed to be the only practical member of the household promptly withdrew from school invested her savings in a typewriter spent her days in the care of her mother and the little house two rooms in which were presently advertised as to let furnished went to evening school at a business school practised stenography and typewriting when not doing housework washing dishes or making clothes for her mother and herself and patiently pluckily cheerily looked forward to the time when mart could help mart spent six months hunting for something to suit and found nothing he liked so much as making love to his pretty penniless neighbor the clerkships he was offered didnt pay twenty dollars a week which was the least he thought a man of his ability and education should accept jeannette told him the proper way was to take ten if he could get it and work his way up but mart disapproved of womens interference in his affairs it ended in his finally getting a bottomofthelist berth in the freight dйpфt of a big railway and a wife forthwith jeannette said nothing she had taken marts measure and saw this coming if i do not soon have to take care of marts wife and babies ill be in luck was the thought that possibly occurred to her but she was a silent little body much given to shrewd and commonsense observation of the world in which she lived she was a sunnynatured merryhearted child in the old days and even as she grew older and more burdened with care the little home still echoed to the sound of her blithe song as she flitted from room to room about her work ever brave hopeful uncomplaining if i only had jennys spirits said the widow to her one lodger i might do something too but as she hadnt jennys spirits or disposition by a good deal the bereaved lady thought it unnecessary to try it was jenny who bore the burden of every detail jenny who did their humble marketing jenny who made the hard bargains with landlord and coalmerchant jenny who taught and supervised the one clumsy damsel who was brought in as cook scullion laundress and maidofallwork and jenny who after all did more than she taught it was jenny who cut and fashioned almost every garment worn by either her mother or herself who made and trimmed the modest little hats or bonnets who watched the bargaincounters at the great retail shops and wished that women didnt have to wear gloves and buttoned boots jenny who had to follow up their flitting lodgers young men who folded their tents like the arabs they were and as silently stole away out of the house leaving sometimes a big lodgingbill and little luggage jenny who presently had to nurse marts wife and baby just as she expected for mart lost that job and the house he had rented and the furniture he hadnt paid for and that was seized just when most needed so baby number one first saw the light under the roof that jennys hard work paid for a lodger having opportunely skipped and all the while she managed to keep up her study and practice and to do little odd jobs in copying sitting far into the dawn sometimes with aching arms and wrists and burning eyes and whirling brain there was no yielding to beauty sleep for poor jenny dark circles often settled underneath the brave steadfast eyes and big blinding tears sometimes welled up from unseen depths when no one was near to spy upon her womans weakness and the very people she slaved for were often querulous and complaining and marts wife had about as much helpfulness as a consumptive old cow jenny had to tell mart he must find work and pay their board or some portion of it and mart got another berth at another railway dйpфt and without paying anything whatever for the months he and his had lived under the mothers roof or much for the new furniture moved into another house where the family circle was presently reinforced by the coming of another baby meantime however jennys skill quickness and accuracy had been steadily bringing her work into favor a girl friend and fellowstudent had a good position in a downtown office where lawyers and businessmen brought many a long paper demanding immediate copies and thither jenny moved her typewriter shrewdly calculating that the money she could earn would more than offset the expense of a good servant at home as for carfare she meant to walk she needed exercise as for luncheon shed carry it with her in her little basket the plan worked well there were some days and weeks in which she was given as much as she could possibly finish but there were others alack many others when nothing came there was a winter when she wore old clothes a winter through which other young women in the great hive of a business block were blooming in gowns and garments that were of latest mode and material it was so far as work was concerned either a feast or a famine with her and she longed for just such a position as that held by an older scholar who was stenographer and typewriter on salary in the office of a great law firm and yet was enabled to take frequent transcribing or copying from outside but for a billet of this kind she looked in vain then came another winter how it affected miss wallen can best be told through this simple fact that she was no longer able to ride home even in the dark wet evenings mart had again been turned out of house and home and came with his ailing wife and wailing babies to the doting mothers door and again was jenny burdened with their maintenance mart had struck there had been a scaling down of wages for all hands most of them realizing that these were hard times and that other and better were coming stood by the company mart was a leader at the meetings of the employees and a brilliant orator with all the eloquence of which he was capable he urged his fellows to stand together and strike he was one of a committee of five sent to see the local manager the manager showed the facts and the other men were satisfied that things were about as he showed they had been long in his employ and mart but a short time the manager addressed himself to the old men rather ignoring the new and marts tongue and temper got away with him he said hed strike anyhow and he did he struck his own name off the companys books and so during these dark dreary winter evenings sometimes wet and raw sometimes bitterly cold quitting when she could her desk at five oclock yet often kept pegging away until later miss jeannette wallen walked those crowded blocks below the state street bridge and all the many many squares that interposed between her and her little home as the days began to lengthen and the cold to strengthen she sometimes reached there wellnigh frozen and exhausted to be welcomed and regaled not so much with hot tea and loving words as by wailing infants and complaining women mart being as usual away at some soulstirring meeting where much was said about the wrongs of the workingman but nothing thought of those of the workingwoman and then came an adventure many a time had she been accosted by street prowlers and sometimes followed but her rule had been to make no reply simply to walk straight on and look neither to the right nor to the left one dark evening in early january she had been working late and it was nearly seven as she passed the river a few blocks farther north she overtook a man whose unsteady gait did not prevent his quickening speed and striving in turn to overtake her finding him at her heels and his detaining hand actually on her arm her nerve gave way and she took to flight her pursuer following half a block ahead and around a corner was the apartmenthouse where she had acquaintances and into the hallway jenny bolted hoping to turn and slam the door into the blackguards face but to her horror the heavy portal refused to swing despairingly she touched the electric button then turned pluckily to face her pursuer and warn him off but the fellow was daft with drink and with maudlin exultation he sprang after her and strove to seize her in his arms laughing at her frantic blows then the inner door suddenly opened and tumbled them both into the hall and into the arms of a tall dark heavilymoustached man who looked amazed one second and enlightened the next for he seated the halffainting girl in a chair kicked the intruder into the gutter and then sprang back into the hall in time to catch her as she was almost toppling over on the tiled floor this brought her the second time within the clasp of a muscular arm and then she gasped an inquiry for her friends and he sent the staring hallboy to ask if they were in and stepped into his own room and brought forth a glass of wine which he calmly ordered her to sip and then seeing her heart was fluttering like a terrified birds he spoke gently and soothingly and little by little she had regained some composure when the boy came down from the fourth floor to say the ladies were out then she would have gone and she strove to go but her knees shook and he sent the boy with a message and made her wait seated in the hall chair and came forth again from his room in a fur overcoat and cap and a moment later a cab was at the door she recoiled and said she could go in a car but the cars were two blocks away kindly permit me to see you safely home he said you have had a terrible fright and are in no condition to walk at all events she was in no condition to rebel and was glad to sink back into the cushioned corner of the hansom ill have to trouble you for the street and number said he apologetically as he stepped calmly in beside her oh indeed i mustnt trouble you to come the driver can and then alas she remembered that she had but ten cents about her the driver can perhaps but in this case he wont was the grave halfsmiling answer number what which street if you please helplessly she gave them commandingly he repeated them to cabby peeping down through his pygmy mantrap in the roof and away went the twowheeler her home was but six blocks distant you must let me pay the cabman she faltered not well knowing how she was going to do so i would if it would comfort you said he calmly but hes already engaged to me by the hour for the evening then my share of it at least she persisted that i estimate to be possibly fifteen cents said he as the vehicle drew up at the curb and i think i owe you ten times the amount for the pleasure of kicking such an arrant cur as that specimen has he ever annoyed you before do you know him by sight only said she the color at last reappearing in her face he is often on that street corner below the beaulieu but i do not know his name he will be there less frequently in future and now is there nothing i can do are you sure you have everything you need at home more than i need very much more she could have added to herself thinking of her many unbidden lodgers but you havent given me your name and i owe you so much besides the fifteen cents she was trying to smile now you owe me nothing unless he was turning away but something in her sweet earnest face drew him back unless it be permission to call and ask how you are after all this excitement miss wallens face clouded where could she receive him were not every nook and corner of the house except her own little room given over to the use of occupants in whom this distinguishedlooking gentleman could be expected to feel no interest whatever he saw the hesitation and spoke at once i beg your pardon said he frankly and heartily i had no right whatever to be intrusive goodnight and better luck next time with that he was into the cab and off in a trice two days afterwards miss wallen called at the beaulieu on her way down town clambered to the fourth floor and asked her friends the name of the gentleman who occupied the left front room groundfloor they said he was a mr forrest but hed gone away he was often away from which she decided him to be one of the knights errant of the commercial world but vastly unlike in tone and manner those who usually accosted her two weeks afterwards as she was seated at her desk in the big office building while her friend miss bonner was clicking away at the opposite window the door opened and in came an elderly lawyer for whom she had done many a page of accurate work miss wallen said he can you do some quick copying for a friend of mine let me present lieutenant forrest of the regular army illustration illustration chapter vi that miss wallen was no more surprised than her new customer was apparent at a glance but there was no time wasted in remarks on previous meetings or present weather it seemed that the gentleman in question needed three typewritten copies of a long essay he had written and needed them at once it was now four pm on tuesday he came for the work at five oclock wednesday afternoon and although she had wrought hard and faithfully it lacked completion by just a page it will be ready in ten minutes sir if you can wait said miss wallen rising pray be in no hurry said mr forrest i have nothing to do tonight but read it over he took a vacant chair and produced the evening paper but through its pages he had already glanced while at the club over its pages he was glancing now at the slender fragilelooking girl with those busy flying fingers and the intent gaze in her tired eyes he saw how wan even sallow she looked the lines of care were on her forehead and already settling about the corners of the soft sensitive mouth he did not know that all alone she had returned to the office the previous evening and worked until midnight then hied her homeward fast as cablecar could bear her only with racking nerves and aching limbs to toss through almost sleepless hours until the pallid dawn he did not know that in order that he might have this work on time she had never left the building since eight am that day silently she finished the last page counted and arranged the sheets shaking out the intervening carbons quickly bound each set with heavier cover and then stood before him with her work the pale yellow gleam of the wintry twilight was streaming through the west window the most unbecoming and trying ever girl had to face and she faced it unflinchingly forrest quickly arose i fear this has been heavy work miss wallen he said regretfully you must make allowance for my inexperience i have to leave town tomorrow and needed this before going mr langston an old friend brought me in to you i i hope you will let me pay you all i think it worth i could have got along faster if the manuscript had been a little clearer said the girl smiling slightly some of it was hard to decipher and the technical terms were new to me if you will look it over and let me know how nearly correct it is i will then make out my bill accordingly there wont be any time for that said he and mr langston says you are never inaccurate he tells me furthermore that you brought my scrawl to him three times today for words he himself could hardly make out it is over eighteen thousand words according to my count i know what such work is worth in new york and now he held forth three crisp tendollar bills but this had to be done so rapidly will thirty dollars be anywhere near right he asked miss wallen consulted a memorandum on her desk gravely searched through her portemonnaie found some small coin and a twodollar bill then as gravely took two of the bills and handed him the ten the two and the small change more than sufficient by just twelve dollars and fifteen cents she quietly said provided it be understood that you are to send me a memorandum of any and all errors detected and i shall be here early tomorrow morning and will be glad to rewrite the pages in which they occur but forrest protested i gave twentyfive dollars in new york for work much shorter and done leisurely said he and you have worked long hours i feel under very great obligation you neednt said she i have made more in the last twentyfour hours than in the previous week i was only too glad to get the work down the iron stairs clerks and officeboys were clattering from the crowded pavement a hundred feet below the thunder of hoofs and wheels and thronging traffic rose on the frosty air over the roofs winddriven came the screech of a hundred whistles from foundry factory and mill on the widespreading west side toilworn men by thousands were laying down their tools and turning eagerly wearily homeward the gongs of the cablecars hammered mad alarums and swarms of people squeezed upon the platforms in adjacent office blocks the electric lights were beginning to gleam and the pallid hues of dying day were fading from the wintry sky forrests business was done and he had no excuse to linger she stood there facing him evidently expecting him to go never before in his life had he encountered anything of this description he had read and heard that many a girl delicately reared was now employed as bookkeeper typewriter and stenographer in offices all over the land and here was one plainly even poorly clad yet proud independent selfreliant and in every word and look and act no matter how humble her lot as unmistakably a lady as his own sister he wanted to stay wanted to impress upon her his appreciation of the service she had done him wanted to persuade her to accept what he felt she sorely needed the remaining ten dollars of the sum langston had told him would be about what she would probably charge but after a moments irresolute pause he turned abruptly and went to the door i shall be back in a month with more such work and i shall be fortunate if i can get you to do it for me goodnight miss wallen and thank you goodnight sir and thank you forrest went discontentedly over to the union league he felt somehow that he hadnt treated that girl right one or two men from the fort were there waring of the light battery and little chip sanders of the cavalry these jovial captains hailed him and besought him in cordial soldier fashion to stay and dine especially in view of the long trip ahead of him on the morrow but he begged off he had an evenings work ahead and must get home betimes said he he compromised however on a modest tipple and not caring to fight his way through the crowd in either car or street summoned a cab and was soon comfortably trundling to the north side one block beyond the river under the electric lights he caught sight of a slender girlish form swiftly threading a way along the pavement and recognized at a glance the heroine of the adventure of a fortnight gone the transcriber of those fruitful pages on the seat by his side and the object of his thoughts hold up under those lights yonder he cried to cabby through the trap in the roof and cabby seeing no bar in close proximity marvelled as he obeyed forrest sprang out turned back and in another moment was raising his hat to the girl who glanced up with nervous start and repellent mien that only slowly changed to recognition even then there was womanly reserve and much of it in her manner pardon me miss wallen i never dreamed of such a thing as your walking all the way home and after such a long days work my cab is right here please let me drive you the rest of the way thank you no she answered quietly i always walk after a long days work it is exercise and pleasure both but surely you are very late and forgive my reminding you of your recent unpleasant experience no one else ever chased me she said and i dont think even he would had he not been drinking you seem to have scared him away for not once have i set eyes on him since but you will ride wont you it would be a pleasure some comfort to my conscience if i might send you home after the lot that you have done and the little you would take they had reached the cab now and he stopped invitingly but she never faltered and only turned towards him and slackened her steps sufficiently to repeat her thanks and a courteous refusal upon my word you make me ashamed of my own laziness said forrest i used to be a good tramper on the plains but have been getting out of the way of it at least i may walk a little way with you may i not and this she could not well see how to decline cabby was dismissed with a douceur and forrest hastened after his new acquaintance she carried some bundles in her arms and he offered to take them he had his own however and she declined he shifted his packet of triplicates under the right arm and tendered her with courteous bow the left and she preferred to trudge along without it thank you yet in so pleasant a way he could not find fault he walked all the way to her little home and bade her goodnight with the promise that when he returned in february he would be glad to have another eighteen thousand words transcribed in triplicate for seventeen dollars and odd cents you cant said she with her same quiet smile it will cost eighteen at least your fifteen cents change today was for my share of the cab he was on duty in the judgeadvocates office of the department as has been said and had been ordered off on a courtmartial he was back in two weeks and more work went through that typewriter and then came days which he spent in study at the lambert library and pages of memoranda and notes which he read to her at her office which were faithfully stenographed and promptly accurately typewritten and there were soon some evening walks home several of them and forrest found the way curiously short as compared with the original estimate he was deeply interested in his work at headquarters but the detail was only to last a month or two longer for then the regular incumbent would have returned from the long leave of absence granted him on account of ill health and then forrest himself purposed spending some months abroad all arrangements for his leave having been already consummated one afternoon at the library mr wells came and seated himself by the lieutenants side they had had many a long chat together and were fast friends im out of luck said wells ive seen it coming for months and ought to have been prepared my typewriter has given me warning going to be married i suppose yes and within six weeks shes a girl i simply cant replace why not because in my work only a welleducated and highly intelligent girl will answer i have to dictate sometimes fifty letters a day filled with strange names and technicalities and foreignisms and theres no time to consult dictionaries and the like no leisure half the time to read over the letters submitted for my signature i must trust to my typewriter and girls educated up to that standard come too high for our salary i gradually taught miss stockton what she knows so she was content with sixty dollars a month but i cant get one who can do as well for a hundred which is more by forty than the directors will allow me forrest was silent a moment it is work that demands all a girls time i suppose he ventured yes every bit of it from nine to five and often to six she has her evenings at home however unless some of our library assistants are sick then she would have to help at the shelves if you are in no great hurry will you hold the offer open one week i know a g a lady i should say who is intelligence and accuracy combined and who might take it she has done much work for me and i know her worth would she come for sixty dollars do you suppose i will ask her said forrest guardedly he well knew how glad his hardworking typewriter would be to have so permanent and pleasant a station he more than suspected that many men who came to the busy office in the heart of the city were far from respectful he remembered how his blood boiled one afternoon when he found a bulky fellow his hat on the back of his head his legs outstretched and a vile cigar tiptilted in his mouth sitting leering beside her desk you shouldnt permit it he said to her later ah but i must not quarrel with my bread and butter was her reply half mournful half whimsical not one man in ten thinks of taking off his hat or dropping his cigar when he enters our shop no mr forrest we are wageworkers who cant afford to draw the line at the manners of our customers but are there not some who who become impertinent familiar if not checked at the start he found himself constrained to ask and the flame that shot into her cheeks told him his suspicion was correct not often she answered presently and never more than once we simply try not to notice small impertinences miss bonner and i and generally you know we are together here this was midapril the vacancy was to occur at the end of the month forrest himself brought miss wallen to the library and presented her to mr wells a gentleman was seated in the librarians room at the time an industrious fellow who had recently appeared who spent some hours turning over many books and whom wells described as a most interesting and travelled man a graduate of jena etc but at sight of him miss wallen showed slight though unmistakable signs of embarrassment almost annoyance he pretended to busy himself with his books but was evidently listening to what was going on and miss wallen was decidedly constrained presently he arose and came forward saying with much suavity of manner you must pardon my intrusion i could not but catch something of this conversation and had i known before that mr wells was contemplating a change here i should have eagerly availed myself of the privilege our friendship gives to recommend this young lady of whose character and qualifications we being inmates of the same household i can speak ex cathedra as it were and can hardly speak too highly he went on to say more taking the floor as was his custom to the exclusion of everybody else and mr forrest withdrew to a distant part of the room miss wallen presently bade mr wells goodnight and asked when she might come to see him again and wells looking a trifle vexed asked for her address and said he would write and then mr elmendorf announced that it would give him much pleasure to see miss wallen home and what could she do forrest had said nothing about going further elmendorf had certainly been most flattering in his commendation she had taken a decided dislike to him during the few weeks he had occupied the lodgers room and had avoided him as much as possible but it might well be that he was a man of influence in library matters she had no reason for rebuffing but good reason for showing gratitude forrest gravely bade her goodevening and good luck and miss wallen walked away with her lodger in close attendance all the way home he descanted on his influence with wells and the trustees he was already he said contemplating taking a position in the household of mr allison the millionaire magnate he took it in truth within the week and wrote miss wallen that it had given him much pleasure to urge warmly her claim for the position soon to become vacant he found they had several other applications and some who had strong influence but he would not cease to urge her appointment and keep her wellbeing in mind but meantime one day mr wells gladdened the girls heart by a brief note saying that he had been so favorably impressed with the work she had done for mr forrest that he had determined to tender her the place two days later forrest came to congratulate her and to bid her adieu as he would sail for europe within the week she tried to thank him but could not frame the words she did not lack for language however when her mother read to her that night the charming note she had just received from mr elmendorf felicitating her upon the promotion of her devoted and dutiful daughter and himself upon the fact that this good fortune was probably due to his determined and persistent presentation of her daughters claims before the trustees whom he had frequent opportunity of meeting at mr allisons house doubtless elmendorf considered this presentation equivalent in full for the three weeks arrears of room rent a cheque for which he had said should be forthcoming as soon as mr allison paid in advance his first quarters salary but which never came at all illustration illustration chapter vii when mr forrest returned from europe in the late autumn of he expected to go forthwith to the station of his regiment and devote his energies to those ceaseless engrossing yet somewhat narrowing duties that keep a man of mature years capable of much better things attending rollcalls drilling two sets of fours addressed by courtesy as company grilling on the riflerange and consuming hours of valuable time in work allotted in older services to sergeants calling at the war department on his way he was asked about the autumn manoeuvres and if he had seen any of them he had seen a great deal the interest of friends in both the german and austrian services having enabled him to follow the armies assembled about metz and gьns to excellent advantage returning to his billet after each long day in the saddle he had spent some hours before retiring in recording his impressions and observations the result being several big notebooks crammed with data of deep interest to the professional soldier the adjutantgeneral took forrest in to the secretary of war and there was some significant talk the result of which was the intimation that he should again be assigned to temporary duty at department headquarters in chicago in order to give him opportunity to write out his notes long before this forrests essays on grand tactics and certain papers on military history had won much favor among the studious men in the army and it was with pride and pleasure that he entered on the allotted task he wrote as did zachary taylor a hand that looked much as though a ramrod rather than a pen had been used and naturally his first thought was to find his transcriber of the previous winter there she was at her desk in the library and looking far younger happier and better than when he saw her last and the frank pleasure in her face was good to see as she welcomed him more in manner than in words certainly said miss wallen i shall be glad to give as many evenings to the work as may be necessary i am too busy here by day and so as the autumn wore out and the winter wore on her slender white fingers danced over the keys and page after page in neatly typed duplicates his voluminous notes on the armies of germany and austriahungary were faithfully transcribed home was not so far away now and her brisk walks led her no longer through sections she had learned to dread accustomed for some years to far longer and lonelier tramps in the wintry evenings she thought nothing of tripping to and fro between the lambert and the rather crowded little house in which she dwelt mart and his wife and babies still sojourned there and the babies waxed strong and loud and lusty on aunt jennys bounty never caring whose fingers earned the porridge so long as their share was ample and frequent mart was out of work and correspondingly out of elbows and temper mart had taken to continual meetings and to such drink as he could get treated to or credit for and still the mother condoned the wife complained and jenny carried the family load mart loved to tread the rostrum boards and portray himself as a typical victim of corporation perfidy and capitalistic greed the railway company from which he had seceded refused to take him back and other companies edified by the reports of his speeches in the switch light the danger signal and other publications avowedly devoted to the interest of the downtrodden operatives of the railway and manufacturing companies thought that in a winter when many poor fellows were out of work through no fault of their own beyond having exercised the right of suffrage the wrong way the few vacancies should be given to men more likely to render faithful service marts wife impressed with the idea that she must do something took in sewing and took the sewing to ask jenny to show her how which in nine cases out of ten jenny did practically if the little money thus earned had gone to pay for the babies milk or marts whiskey bills jenny would have been grateful but even these shillings earned with her numbed and weary fingers somehow found their way to marts broad palm and thence to the dramshop though not to that which had claims for goods already delivered and then followed scenes that covered the poor girl with shame and indignation to her office at the library one winter evening when wells was reading the late mail and mr forrest seated at a neighboring desk with a big atlas before him was far away among the glinting pickelhaubes on the banks of the moselle a man came with an account which he wished miss wallen to settle it was martin wallens bar bill for the autumn months at donnellys shades and the girl flushed with mortification this is something with which i have nothing to do said she i would not pay it if i had the money i was told to come to you said the man its your brothers account and he said youd promised him the money time and again if it aint paid well send for the furniture and then he wanted to show it to wells who waved him off in annoyance and then he looked as though he would like to interest the other occupant of the room in the matter but something about that gentlemans face as he arose and came forward proved unsympathetic ill send this bill in again on the st said mr donnelly and if it aint paid then but the tall browneyed brownmoustached man was walking straight at him looking him through and through and there would have been a collision in the office had not donnelly backed promptly out through the doorway this merely transferred the scene of it and involved a third party for there just outside the groundglass partition ostensibly hunting for a book in the revolving case and humming a lively tune was elmendorf recoiling to avoid contact with the advancing forrest the billcollector backed into the listening tutor and bumped him up against a table oh beg pardon said elmendorf as though in no wise aware who his bumper might be and then edged off towards the corridor beyond apparently desirous of escaping further connection with the affair but forrest even in the dim light of the anteroom recognized him at a glance more and more ever since the return from europe had he grown to dislike and distrust the man more than once had he seen an expression on miss wallens face when wells happened to mention elmendorf that gave ground for the belief that she too had no pleasant recollection of her erstwhile lodger but never had she opened her lips upon the subject indeed bright and intelligent as was the girl when she chose to talk both wells and forrest had found that when she preferred to be silent it was useless to question but here skulking in the anteroom where reading was out of the question where however one might easily hear what was going on in the private office here was elmendorf again and though donnellys footfalls were audible to all as he came pounding up the stairway and turned from the corridor into the office rooms not a sound of others had been heard the main stairway that which led to the great readingrooms of the library proper was on the southern front only those having business with the head librarian or the trustees were supposed to come this way forrest often read wrote and studied here because the more valuable atlases and books of reference were near at hand and whenever not writing for wells miss wallen was at work on his notes it flashed upon forrest that the tutor had some object other than bookhunting in that noiseless visit and he called him back would you mind waiting a moment mr elmendorf said he i should like to speak with you after ive said a word to this gentleman then coolly pushing beyond both he closed the corridor door and turned on the electric light mr donnelly said he facing the now nervouslooking irishman you know as well as i that no woman on earth is liable for the liquor bills of any man even a relative what brought you here me legs i spose an me own affairs whats it to you anyhow but donnelly was shifting rather unsteadily on those same legs and twisting his bill in his hands this to begin with said forrest very coolly though his blood was boiling and the impulse to floor the fellow was strong within him an old fellow campaigner of mine sergeant mcgrath has told me but there was no need to go further donnellys tone and manner underwent instant change is this lieutenant forrest it is lieutenant forrest and i have this to say to you here and now you came here to bring shame and distress on an honest girl you an old soldier and an irishman the first soldier and the first irishman i ever knew to be guilty of so low and contemptible a piece of persecution when i write to major cranston of this and when i tell mcgrath dont be hard on me lieutenant i meant no harm to the lady at all sure the bills been unpaid ever since october i tuk it to the house i thought mebbe she could inflooence mart but id never have come here wid it at all sorr but but and his troubled gaze wandered now to where elmendorf stood biting his nails and watching a chance to speak but what donnelly who put you up to such a dirty piece of business permit me nothing dirty was intended for a minute if i may be allowed to speak said elmendorf as he came forward as a friend of all parties concerned for i know mr wallen well and have remarked his bibulous propensities with distress i merely suggested to mr donnelly that perhaps if he could get miss wallens ear he might possibly induce her to exercise a restraining influence upon her brother i thought it best that she should know how and where he was spending so much money in esse as well as money in posse that mr donnelly should have misconstrued my wellmeant words into oh sure ye told me to show this bill when everybody could see it sorr and that would take the starch out av her settle it between you gentlemen said mr forrest turning contemptuously away i have heard more than enough i will see you about this later this evening said elmendorf as the lieutenant disappeared within the sanctum slamming the door after him and vouchsafing no answer that evening wellss letters seemed interminable it was nearly halfpast six when he finished dictating and with aching heart and burning face miss wallen closed her desk and silently went for her cloak and overshoes for over half an hour mr forrest had stood to his guns across the room making much pretence of being busy with the atlas and his notes but time and again his eyes wandered following his thoughts to the other two wells rapidly dictating his stenographer with bowed head determinedly wielding her pencil when wells finally started the lieutenant arose and strolled out with him closing the door behind them i shall see miss wallen home said he in low tone shes had more than enough indignity for one day id do it if you couldnt mr forrest even though theyre waiting for me at home that girls a lady by jupiter youve no idea how shes studied and developed ever since shes been here and its a damned outrage that such fellows should be allowed to annoy her such fellows wont another time said forrest quietly elmendorf was back of this for some reason that i mean to fathom thats all very well as far as the irishmans concerned mr forrest hes had his fill but look out for that other im no judge of character now if he isnt a snake when forrest reentered the room miss wallen had turned out the electric lights over her desk and was standing by the window her face bowed in her thin white hands forrests overcoat and hat always hung in the closet without he had gone with wells closing the door she was as she supposed at last alone and the reaction had come all the weary months of work work work all the patient slaving to provide for the improvident all the brave cheery hopeful uncomplaining days of honest toil and honest effort only to end in such a scene of shame and mortification as this what could mr wells think of his secretary chased to her desk with the liquorbills of her kindred what would not mr forrest think a weaker woman would have found refuge and comfort in a passion of tears but her eyes seemed burning leaning against the open casement she stood there fairly quivering with wrath and the sense of indignity and wrong she too had recognized elmendorfs nasal whine in the anteroom and felt well assured that he was in some way responsible for donnellys action mart had had much to say of late of the foreigners convincing logic and thrillingly eloquent appeals to the workingman there was the man to wring the neck of capital and bring the bloated bondholders to terms said he mart never missed a meeting where elmendorf was to speak and had more than once been brought home fuddled in the cab which conveyed the agitator back to the scene of his labors in the allison homestead the cab was paid for by the union and elmendorf didnt mind having it wait outside while he assisted mart within and stopped to condole with mrs wallen the elder or mrs wallen junior and to inquire significantly if he did not see her where miss wallen was he always supposed the library closed at nine oclock and was not aware he said that anybody except the janitor was permitted to remain there later he knew very well that the librarian was sometimes there until nearly midnight he knew well that it was there and in the evenings mainly that miss wallen worked at the transcript of forrests reports at least as he said to himself and suggested to others that is the ostensible purpose of her frequently prolonged visits he often walked by the lighted windows of the sanctum and occasionally slipped into the dark hallway so the watchman later said the same irrepressible propensity to meddle in the affairs of everybody in the household where he was employed in the councils of the various labor unions in the meetings of political associations in the official duties or offhand chats of the men at military headquarters in the management of the lambert library seemed to follow him in his casual intercourse with this obscure little household one night when towards ten oclock miss wallen came blithely down the corridor stairs she was surprised to find the tutor awaiting her as i know mr forrest to be otherwise engaged tonight miss wallen i have ventured to offer my services as escort said he and though she shrank from and could not bear him there was no reason at that time for denying him but when he presently began talking of forrest in his suggestive insinuating way and excusing his references to the lieutenant on the ground of his extreme regard for her widowed mother her impoverished but amiable relatives and her own refined intellectual and accomplished self she shrank still more and strove to silence him a difficult matter she had however a trait that proved simply exasperating to a man of elmendorfs calibre a faculty of listening in absolute silence where she did not desire to confirm or approve and when he had spent much breath and nearly half an hour in descanting upon his impressions of the demoralizing tendencies of military associations in general and of idle officers in particular it rasped him to find that she did not seem to consider his views worthy the faintest comment nor would she nor did she invite him in when her mother reproved her for this miss wallen smiled and said next time i will and then you might ask him for the three weeks lodging he hasnt paid and mart said she ought to be ashamed of speaking so of a man who had done everything for her shed never have got that library place at all if it hadnt been for elmendorf no matter what her fine friends might have told her oh mart knew all about it neednt try to pull the wool over his eyes another time had elmendorf come and again had he talked more of what he had done for her and the rights it gave him to tender her counsel and this time his references to forrest took a graver form and became offensive it was then indignant she refused to hear more of it and that night elmendorf went away gritting his teeth and now had come this contemptible essay to humiliate her before her employer oh it was cowardly shameful she threw up her arms clinching her little white hands and stamping as slender a foot as ever walked in a machinemade shoe and then ejaculating as women will in moments of supreme exasperation if i were only a man whirled about and beheld one in your present mood said mr forrest quietly i am rather glad you are not especially as what i have to say refers to you rather in your capacity as the clever woman of the family did you ever read an english book of that title and then in the most matteroffact way in the world he proceeded to assist her into the heavy winter cloak he had lifted from its accustomed peg no of course you havent he went on chatting unconcernedly and well knowing she was too overwrought to talk at all a girl who works from morning till late at night has little chance to read anything beyond stenographic notes and hideous hieroglyphics mine for instance now this sensible headgear if you please how can a woman wear a hat in winter yes its on quite straight quite as straight as though you had a glass in front of you now the overshoes no pardon me miss wallen youre not going to put them on yourself sit down if you please or stand if you dont and down he dropped on one knee and in a trice had stowed away the thin worn little boots with their frayed buttonholes within the warm yet clumsy arctics you are sensible to wear such things as these he said the snow is falling heavily and i mean to walk you home tonight now the gloves yes you may have your own way there as i shouldnt know how and so saying he seemed calmly to have taken possession of the hitherto selfwilled and independent young woman who for the first time in her life began to realize how much sweetness there was after all in having some one to do something for one instead of being expected to do everything for every one else she submitted silently to be led forth into the cool fresh evening air and then when he as calmly took her hand and placed it within his arm she made no move to withdraw it neither did she seem to know how by means of it to lean upon his strength passively she let it lie and walking by his side turned her face to the drifting snowflakes and cared not that the night was raw and chill the lake wind blustering for a moment more forrest did not speak he glanced keenly up the dim avenue holding his head very high as was his way and himself very erect already the sting and shame of her recent experience seemed fading in jennys past there was something so new strange sweet in this masterful assumption on his part of all control and command there was something so complete in her faith in him something so like girlish admiration if not heroworship surging up in the throbbing little heart beneath that worn old winter cloak that much of her old bright buoyant merry self came back to her if i cant be a man said she to herself im the next thing to one if there ever was one and then was amazed at her own impulse to peer up into his grave soldierly face and aghast to find herself drawing closer to his side in the suddenness and alarm of this revelation she nearly jumped beyond arms length and he felt constrained to retake her hand and draw it farther through his arm you will find it easier if you will let me bear a little of the weight tonight said he gravely and that is why i have made it my business to intrude upon your time and attention miss wallen will you kindly tell me what claim your brother has upon you he is my brother and out of work she answered simply cant he get work he says he cant what can he do he writes well and he had a clerkship but mart was unsteady and he lost it then he got a place in the freightyards but there was a strike and he went out they wouldnt take him back then because he was so foolish in his talk and they cant take him now for hundreds of better men steadier men old employees have been laid off ever since the worlds fair business has been falling away and you have had not only that house and your mother to care for but an ablebodied brother jenny dropped her head ablebodied brother indeed with wife babies debts duns and all she had borne the weight of the whole establishment upon her fragile shoulders but that wasnt a thing to speak of to him to anybody her silence touched him do you mean that out of your little salary you have paid that houserent and all the expenses and your mothers and his too no answer i wish you would tell me he said in such grave courteous tones that they went to her heart i beg you not to think me intrusive i have never heard of such a case before why miss wallen im appalled when i see how thoughtless i have been you simply cannot afford the time to work for me at the price you fixed it pays better than mending marts clothes etc at home said she whimsically very much better than anything i can get to do up town good heavens cannot your mother mend marts clothes cant he mend them himself my my poor little friend i had no idea matters were as bad as this he had no idea even now how bad matters were nor did she care to edify him why mr forrest said she when i look around me this winter and see all the want and suffering on every side the absolute destitution in places i think my fortune regal i only wish all the girls i know of were half as welltodo forrest drew a long breath well of all the incarnations of pluck and cheerfulness i ever heard of commend me to this thought he they were within two squares of home and at the corner was a large family grocery store she faltered now im very much obliged to you for coming with me so far and i have to stop here but only to make some purchases you are going on to tea and i have something i want to say i may have to wait and you have your engagements nothing in the world but to dine solus at the virginia and my appetites about gone i mean to wait miss wallen miss wallen flushed but made no further remonstrance entering the store she gave her orders some little packages of tea and sugar were speedily ready in the window were some pyramids of florida oranges rich and luscious fruit watching her with uncontrollable interest he saw her eyes glancing towards them saw and knew the question framed by her soft lips saw and realized what was passing as the salesman answered and she shook her head turning to another clerk he pencilled a number on a card he handed him and gave some orders of his own presently she stored her change in the little portemonnaie and picked up her bundles promptly he relieved her of them and again as they came forth he tendered his arm the side street into which they turned was darker than the broad avenue the houses were poor and cheap the gaslamps few and far between silently now they walked rapidly along for he was deep in thought he longed to find some way of opening the subject uppermost in his mind but knew not how at last he spoke miss wallen where and how can i see your brother ive an idea of a place he might fill he is unmarried i presume silence a moment no mart has a wife a wife where is she what does she do she isnt strong and cant do much of anything not even mend his clothes or stop how about children you know the old adage said she with a quiet smile and mart is a poor man and they too are your care you their support and this has been going on since last year oh no mart gets odd jobs now and then the proceeds of which he spends in but i entreat your pardon my my friend this is beyond anything i ever dreamed of and dont come to the library tonight please theres no hurry about those pages tomorrow night will be better they were at the little gateway now and he released her arm overagainst them on the opposite side of the street two men skulking back in the shadows of a dark entranceway edged a little farther forward watched him as he restored the bundles watched him as he took again her hand then lifted his hat and bowed over it as he might have done reverence to a queen watched her as she tripped withindoors and then forrest again as he slowly turned and walked thoughtfully away thats the man then asked in cautious querulous tone the shorter slighter of the two thats him damn him i can feel his kick to this day and it was with him in his room she took refuge you could swear to it course i could on a stack of bibles and this was early in the week of mr elmendorfs conversation with aunt lawrence only fortyeight hours prior to the sudden orders which prevented mr forrests dining at the allisons and escorting miss florence to the opera and which hurried him miles away on a mission whereof only two other men at headquarters knew the purport the general and his chief of staff there was good reason for the aidesdecamp an understrappers as elmendorf referred to them being even more mysterious than usual illustration chapter viii there was a month or more during the late winter in which mr elmendorf coldshouldered out of official society at department headquarters became quite the managing director of the allison mansion john allison with a party of fellowmagnates was on a long tour of inspection over the southernmost of the transcontinental lines and finding home life a trifle uncongenial just now owing to some discussions with aunt lawrence finding too that the wives and daughters of other magnates were to accompany them on the trip sojourning days at a time in many of the charming resorts among the mountains or along the pacific seaboard miss allison eagerly accepted their invitation to be one of the party mrs lawrence was to remain in charge at home and was permitted to send for and receive under her wing her own graceless duckling with the distinct understanding that he was in no wise to be allowed to interfere with carys studies or duties allison had no use as he expressed it for his nephew lawrence he had helped pull the cub through many a scrape but had tired of it and having secured him a place in an eastern office where he had enough to live on and little to do desired to wash his hands of him in future but motherlove watches over even the renegades from the home circle and mrs lawrence persuaded brother john that herberts health was failing and that he sorely needed change and rest and coddling the brother growled out something cynical about chicago as a winter resort but told her to go ahead the party left in early february and about the last thing before going allison had another conference with elmendorf the latter had received warning that unless he gave more time to the instruction of his pupil and less to that of the populace the engagement would terminate elmendorf argued and allison cut him short i have listened to this for over eight months and am further from conviction than ever mr elmendorf said he so waste no more eloquence on me take your choice between serving me on salary or writing screamers and speeches for nothing youve done no great harm outside as yet but there is a growing tendency to disorder that such counsels as yours will only serve to stimulate a blunt man was allison and furnished excellent text for elmendorfs article on the brutality of capital which presently appeared but over a very different nom de plume in the columns of the socialistic press elmendorf agreed that of course as his employer took such extreme views of the case he must perforce acquiesce in the decision he agreed not to appear on the platform or write any more leaders so long as he should remain in john allisons employ and then when allison was well beyond range interpreted the agreement to suit himself as a means of increasing his influence over the mother elmendorf made himself useful and agreeable to young lawrence when he came the lessons went on with fair regularity cary and his tutor occupying their study each day until luncheontime and again occasionally later in the afternoon or evening but while he no longer appeared on the stage or rostrum as one of the leading speakers of the evening the eloquent gentleman was pretty sure to be heard from the body of the house or the midst of the audience at the various meetings held from time to time in what were referred to as the disturbed districts there was a familiar ring about many of the articles that appeared in the papers but they were no longer fulminated over his name or initials for several weeks no more dinnerparties were given at the allisons and few officers called there then the general commanding went off on a tour of inspection taking a brace of aides with him and these were forrests friends and associates and the men who least liked the tutor but while elmendorf had ceased to spend some time each afternoon in the offices adjoining the generals sanctum picking up all stray items of military news and haranguing such men as would listen his was by no means an unfamiliar figure about the great building true to his policy he had made acquaintance among the clerks messengers etc first appearing among them as an associate and friend of their superior officers thereby commanding as it were their respectful attention and then after studying their personal characteristics little by little establishing confidential relations simpleminded straightforward fellows as a rule were these soldier clerks men who lived in a groove and knew little of the wiles of the outer world a few there were of the decayed gentleman stamp and other few of the bibulous through their hands passed much of the correspondence in their keeping were many of the secrets of the official life of the farspreading department and elmendorf saw his opportunity it was no difficult matter to assert in his confidential chats conducted only when and where their superiors could get no wind of them that he had been told by his friend the adjutantgeneral or by captain and aidedecamp soandso all about the matter in question and all he asked was some little item of corroborative detail now there were days as the winter wore away when sundry things had happened within the limits of the generals command which the newsgatherers of the chicago press always sensational were eager to exploit not so much perhaps as they actually occurred but as the management and direction of each paper desired to make it appear they had the reporters sounded many a possible source of information without avail for the chief of staff had cautioned his clerks and subordinates great were his surprise and disgust therefore to find the columns suddenly blossoming out with glowing particulars of matters he had supposed discreetly hidden the reports were by no means truthful they were even more than customarily colored and exaggerated but there was the foundation of fact in more than one next it began to be noted that elmendorf hitherto a contributor only to papers of the socialistic stamp was frequently to be seen hobnobbing with the reporters of the prominent journals now these gentlemen as a rule are shrewd judges of human nature and quick to determine between the gold and the glitter between the actual possessor of important news and the mere pretender but there was another period of a month or six weeks in which elmendorf was sought and followed almost as eagerly as the adjutantgeneral himself never perhaps in his varied life had the graduate of jena rolled in sweeter clover than during the months of the late winter and early spring of an oracle at the table in a luxurious home with no one to dispute his sway and no one actually to disapprove unless it were his much disgusted but helpless pupil with access to public offices and public libraries with occasional touch with officials who might and did dislike but could not actually snub him with occasional driblets of information to supply foundation and a vivid imagination to do the rest he found himself an object of interest to the men of all others whom he most desired to influence the reporters of the daily press elmendorf was never in higher feather he was even able to neglect for a time the clamors of his erstwhile hearers his suffering brethren among the sons of toil and he had been managing matters at home with rare diplomacy too mrs lawrence was mad to find out just exactly what peccadillo had brought about mr floyd forrests sudden relief from duty at chicago and orders to proceed to the frontier but this was a subject on which the tutor was now decidedly coy he had given mrs lawrence to understand that because of some scandal and to prevent further talk the officer had been summarily sent away finding that none of the officers knew what had brought about the order he worked among the clerks who knew nothing at all one of these latter lived not far from the lambert library was a tippler at times and had a grievance forrest had twice come upon him when he was boisterously drunk and recognizing him had given him warning forrest was only a casual at headquarters said the clerk and when a fellow was off duty what he did was none of forrests damned business elmendorf found he didnt know what had brought about forrests relief and so proceeded to ask him if hed ever heard this and that which the man had not but was glad to hear now later elmendorf made him acquainted one cold evening at a comfortable groggery not too far from the allison house with a young fellow who could and did tell how he had followed a girl whom he suspected and saw her go to forrests lodgings that he made no mention of certain concomitant facts such as his being kicked into the gutter by the lieutenant and the girls being a total stranger to that officer at that time was due perhaps to native modesty and possibly to elmendorfs editorial skill what elmendorf wanted to create at headquarters was the belief that it was for some such indiscretion that forrest was exiled well reasoning that then the entire establishment would suddenly bethink itself of all manner of suspicious circumstances that it had thought nothing of before he planned equally well at home miss allison knew only that forrest was ordered away on duty for an indefinite time and speedily went away herself on the jaunt to the pacific mrs lawrence who longed to say something to her niece upon the subject was cautioned by elmendorf to say nothing at all until he could place her in possession of all the facts which he promised shortly to do he felt somehow that if allison ever consulted forrest as to the propriety of further employing him the days of tutorship and ease were ended but forrest was gone with a stab in the back and gone probably not to return allisons stay promised to be prolonged until midapril possibly may miss wallen bending over her task at the lambert library mutely avoided and wells openly scowled at elmendorf whenever he sauntered into the rooms where once he was welcome so again he took an interest in mart and his meanderings mart had steadied a bit had a job over among the lumberyards on the north branch and had been keeping away from the meetings on the west side but it wasnt a fortnight before mart was staying out late at night again and coming home without his wits or wages sunday mornings and denouncing his employers as scoundrels and some new men as scabs the next thing poor jenny knew marts unpaid bills were coming to her again and the brother had lost his situation a third time there was no extra work now to add to her earnings no strong manly courteous thoughtful fellow to help her into her cloak and out of her troubles the days lengthened and so did the faces at home so would the bills have done had she ever yielded to the importunities of her mrsnicklebylike mother or marts weakling of a wife but jenny was spartan in selfdenial what she couldnt pay for on the spot she wouldnt have more and more however she recognized in elmendorf the evil genius of the family and implored mart to have no more to do with him whereat mart laughed wildly just you wait a bit missy he declaimed the day is coming when capitalists and corporations will bow down to him as they have to the goulds and vanderbilts in the past i tell you in less than two months if they dont come to our terms if they refuse to listen to our dictation not one wheel will turn from one end of this country to the other well tie up the business of the whole united states by god thats whatll happen to capital and then what will happen to us mart to you your wife and babies to your mother and to me where will the money come from oh theres money enough more than enough millions more than enough to feed and clothe and keep us all in luxury tied up in the coffers of those bondholders and when the men whose hands have made it get their hands once more on it mart mart your head is crazed with whiskey laughed jenny sadly no wonder capital is being withdrawn from us no wonder the gold is going back to europe people who have it dare not invest in communities where the employees are allowed to talk as they are here if i had a million to invest do you think id venture it where the workmen openly threatened theyd stop every wheel throughout the land you are killing your own prospects mart simply to cripple theirs i dont care what do you know of such things anyhow i dont mean to stand by and see my brothers starving and swindled day by day down there at pullman who have the greater claims mart those whom you call your brothers down there at pullman or your wife and children here at home i feel for those people just as much as you do more probably but your duty lies here oh thats right stand by your swell friends and toss it into my teeth that i and mine are sponging on you for a living and you want your money make a man more desperate than he is by your nagging and faultfinding drive a fellow to striking one minute and then torment him with accusations the next i tell you if it comes to riot and bloodshed here its its just women like you thatll thatll have brought it all about but this was a statement so absurd that jenny turned away in speechless indignation what was the use of logic or argument with one of her brothers mental makeup leaving mart to go on with his harangue and confirm the mother and his wife in their view of her utter lack of appreciation of her brothers noble nature the girl walked wearily away to her desk at the library it was barely eight oclock and her duties began only at nine but she was an early bird this new world little dorrit and loved to be promptly at her work and the janitor and scrubwomen often listened to her cheery song as she plied the duster among the shelves and desks of the sanctum wells perhaps never noticed how much neater everything looked since miss wallen took charge but she was a dainty creature in whose eyes dusty books and littered desks were abominations mrs wells however was not so blind that girls worth two of miss stockton was the ladys verdict and then noting with selfcomforting criticism the inexpensive material of jennys gown the absence of all attempt at ornamentation as well alas as of her predecessors brilliancy of color and clearness of skin she added conclusively and she isnt pretty and these raw blustering days of late winter and early spring or something had left their mark upon poor jennys grave and gentle face the circles seemed purpler and deeper under the soft dark eyes there was even less of color in the pallid skin there was something languid almost droopy in her carriage now she had fought her fight without repining or complaint all the long months through and knew alas that she was only losing ground a year agone she looked forward with joy to this position and now she was loaded with even heavier cares and burdens she had found some outside work but everything she made was rapidly swallowed up by her home cormorants it would be just the same perhaps if i had five hundred dollars a month said jenny she was blue disheartened and discouraged perhaps a little weak as she walked rapidly on she thought a sight of the foamcrested waves might stir her sluggish blood and so sped eastward a block or two and out upon the lake front passing the allison homestead south of the park she saw the family carriage just rolling away not the open barouche that had once so nearly run her down but the heavy closed carriage she knew the coachman and the handsome bays at a glance a few blocks farther south she again turned westward to resume her way to the library and came suddenly upon two men standing in close conversation one was haranguing the other speaking in nasal querulous unmistakable tones and the speakers back was towards her overcome by a sudden sense of repulsion she hesitated stopped and was about to turn back and cross the street when the listening party glanced up saw the girl as she halted and seemed to be watching them and all in an instant turned and sneaked or rather lurched up the street miss wallen knew that gait in an instant there was the ruffian who had chased her and seized her that nevertobeforgotten night and here turning about now and facing her was elmendorf for an instant the tutors aplomb was gone he stammered as he raised his hat and bade her goodmorning i was just giving some advice to a poor devil who accosted me for alms miss wallen he said lamely but i seem to have driven him off my speeches are not universally well received as you probably know but jennie was in no mood for conversation with but scant recognition she pushed rapidly on and elmendorf followed there is a matter i much desire to speak about said he placing himself at her side im aware i have not the good fortune to stand well in miss wallens opinion he added with a halfsneer and a man more vindictive and less devoted to principle would have felt like resenting the the slights you have seen fit to put upon me i shall observe your prohibition with regard to the alleged officer and gentleman of whom i had occasion to speak to you since his superiors have taken that responsibility off my hands by summarily sending him away and as it is not likely that he will ever cross your path in this neighborhood again a matter in which i find sincere cause for rejoicing for of all men i have ever met he seemed to me the least worthy of such confidence as you placed in him is this observing my prohibition mr elmendorf said jenny stopping and facing him oh well possibly not then you will kindly say at once what your business is i have told you i will not listen to anything you say about mr forrest i am detaining you here he said evasively let us walk on no i will not walk on mr elmendorf i have learned to look upon you as anything but a friend to me or mine and i mean to be perfectly frank with you here and now you have slandered my friend you have tricked and misled my brother you have deceived my mother and i know well you have sought to injure me with my employer oh only so far as was justifiable in the protection of my own name as your recommender and endorser for the position you hold i had a right when you showed yourself heedless of my counsel and defiant of my injunctions to say to your immediate superior that he should be cautious about allowing your intimacy with mr forrest to be prosecuted within the shelter of his sanctum and practically under his own nose i thats quite enough mr elmendorf you have added insult to injury once and for all let there be an end of this i decline any and all communication with you from this time on and with cheeks that lacked no color now and eyes all ablaze with wrath miss wallen turned and left him but elmendorf pursued he had one arrow left and meant to send it home at least i may accompany you to the corner only twenty yards away and there as you suggest our paths shall separate you decline to believe my estimate of mr forrest and hold him up as something knightly and chivalric forsooth my deluded friend all the time he was making you the object of those charming little attentions he was pressing his suit under my own eyes at home and in spite of all her father her aunt or her friends could do i regret to say that miss florence allison became so infatuated as to follow that young man to his exile and should he ever return here it will doubtless be as her husband goodmorning miss wallen she had turned from him in renewed anger and disgust as they reached the corner had hastened along with flaming eyes and cheeks and loudly throbbing heart she was furious at him for daring to speak of such things daring to couple forrests name with hers with anybodys she was ready to cry out against the man for such malignity mendacity and then her cooler judgment and common sense began to reassert themselves why shouldnt it be true why shouldnt he seek the hand of one so so lovely and wealthy as miss allison what more natural than that miss allison should learn to love him why shouldnt she she jenny wallen rejoice with her whole heart that her friend and protector could look forward to such happiness he had never been anything but kind thoughtful courteous to her other men had taken advantage of her defenceless post to accost her with low gallantries with bourgeois flattery with ridiculous attempts at flirtation or lovemaking and she had laughed or stormed them off but forrest had shown her from the first the highbred courtesy he would have accorded the proudest lady in the land had never presumed upon a look a word a touch that was not marked by respect and deference he was a gentleman she said any girl might be proud of such a lover and if it was true that he and florence allison were engaged she would congratulate him and her with all her heart and rejoice with them and for them and pray that their lives might be happy happy as her own was desolate and then the day became dark and dull and hopeless despite a brilliant sun for just as the lambert towers loomed in sight the allison carriage came spinning up the avenue a radiant happy lovely face beaming upon her from the window then turning to look up into the dark soldierly features of the man at her side florence allison was home then from her wanderings bringing her beloved with her illustration chapter ix elmendorf was an astonished man he had confidently told mrs lawrence that the objectionable lieutenant had been ordered off under a cloud of official censure and forbidden to return he really believed it it was one of his peculiarities that he invariably attached a sinister explanation to every action of his fellow men and women whose social station at least was superior to his own when other explanation was withheld he had sneeringly told miss wallen that unless the gentleman resigned from the army and returned to be the husband of miss allison he would not return at all he believed this too he was so constituted mentally that he believed forrest guilty of anything that could be alleged against him believed that miss allison was interested in him to a certain extent but would probably lose her interest when once the gallant himself was well out of the way believed that he could even convince her as he had convinced her aunt that forrest was totally unworthy her regard provided forrest himself did not return and lo and behold forrest had returned and returned with miss allison herself brought back on their train in their carriage as he learned from aunt lawrence and apparently more influential with the father and daughter than ever before not until luncheontime that day did he know of this and the news came like a dash of icewater on shivering skin it was plain that mrs lawrence looked to him to defend his statement and name his authorities then and there for miss allison did not come down to luncheon cary was speedily excused and permitted to go about his own affairs and then mrs lawrence whirled upon the tutor with the tidings that not only was mr forrest back but that florence had brought him back that mr allison so far from objecting had approved had invited him to lunch with his fellowmagnates at the club and to dine en famille in the evening as for mr forrest being under the ban of official censure mrs lawrence declared she couldnt understand it in view of the fact that he was with the general and his staff when the party encountered them at wichita and that the general himself had authorized his return to chicago authorized said elmendorf with his ready sneer ordered very probably with the view of having him tried by courtmartial here where the witnesses are ready and mr forrest has had the effrontery to saddle himself on respectable company by way of establishing high connection to start with i have heard of just such expedients before my informants are men who thoroughly know the ins and outs of military affairs in the department and they are not likely to be mistaken all the same the tutor was glad to get away and to go posthaste to the pullman building hoping to catch his one intimate in the clerical force and to dodge the officials with whom he stood in evil odor luck often follows audacity in the elevator he met two officers to whom he had been presented during the earlier days of his tutorship when he was still cordially received these gentlemen had been away on duty in the interim and knowing nothing of his lapse from grace greeted him as pleasantly as ever invited him into the aidedecamps offices and there made him at home in the absence of the usual occupants they knew nothing of forrests movements beyond the fact that he had not been with his regiment at all one of the two was major cranston the other was lieutenantcolonel kenyon of forrests own regiment i suppose you know he left here under very sudden rather summary orders some two months ago suggested elmendorf and it created as you can readily imagine some little comment in society no kenyon hadnt heard and he eyed the speaker sharply from under his bushy overhanging brows cranston however promptly replied that there was nothing in the least remarkable in it officers were frequently hurried off on sudden orders and there was no reason why society should be exercised over it elmendorf promptly disavowed any intention of casting the faintest aspersion on mr forrest whom he at least had found to be certainly quite the equal of his comrades in most things pertaining to the officer and gentleman although there were some things perhaps which to a humble civilian like himself might call for explanation he was merely stating a fact one which he regretted of course as he did all the idle talk that circulated in superficial circles of society he was glad to find officers of such prominence as kenyon and cranston so ready to stand up for forrest as some men he preferred not to mention names had been less outspoken at least in his behalf and then kenyon impatiently arose and went out cranston met a brace of cavalrymen going back to their regiment after a leave and elmendorf drifted away in search of his clerk and found him a glance at the register showed that forrest had already been in to report his arrival had given his old rooms as his present address and verbal instructions of dept comdr as the explanation of his return the adjutantgeneral seated in his own office had seen forrest and had further instructions to communicate evidently for they had been closeted together nearly half an hour but what passed between them the clerk could not say and elmendorf was left to his own vivid imagination forrest certainly had not rejoined his regiment and elmendorf had chosen to think that that was what he was ordered to do when leaving chicago thinking of it so much he had come to believe it a fact but forrest was now back here in chicago as suddenly and mysteriously as he went he was not however back in his old office was not then restored to his functions at headquarters what more was needed therefore to warrant the belief that he was picked up by the general in his wanderings in the indian territory and sent in for trial on charges of disobedience of orders and absence without leave at all events it was a working theory in the absence of any other elmendorf strolled away discontentedly and was presently overhauling books on brentanos counters and there cranston found him and when books were the theme found him more to his liking they walked up to cranstons old home that afternoon together and elmendorf as previously detailed made his first appearance before mrs sergeant mcgrath later he strolled up to the lambert memorial revolving many things in his mind with all the discomfort and uneasiness and foreboding forrests sudden reappearance cost him with all the embarrassment likely to follow one reflection had given him joy there at least within those walls was a proud and wilful girl whose spirit he had longed to tame whose distrust and defiance he had smarted under but who now would have to admit the truth of some of the most salient of his accusations and prophecies with regard to forrest there was still abundant opportunity for him to rejoice in that triumph wells did not like him but what of that wells was probably gone by this time and she would be there all alone bending as usual over her typewriter she couldnt order him out or refuse him admittance since wells had never yet done so she would have to listen and he would go and break to her the news of forrests return of forrests return with florence allison of his luncheon with the magnates at the club today of his coming to dinner informally like one of the family at the allisons tonight it would be comfort to watch her sensitive face thought elmendorf and he meant to make the successive announcements as humorous and lingering as his command of rhetoric would permit his step was light his smile significant his bearing quite debonair as he turned into the private hallway and encountered the janitor at the first turn the janitor was irish misther wells is gone if its him ye want sorr said he with scant civility for the celt had become imbued with distaste for the teuton then ill see his secretary answered elmendorf with his usual shrug and without a stop ye wouldnt bedad if i saw her first said honest maloney as he looked after the agitator maneness goes wid the loikes of him and mischief and trouble wherever he sets his fut springily did elmendorf go up the echoing stairway and then reaching the second floor he saw fit to saunter and that too with noiseless footfall he approached the familiar doorway and the anteroom the scene of his discomfiture when donnelly presented marts liquorbill stood invitingly open but the door to the private office beyond was closed and it was barely five oclock she was there he felt assured of that he could hear the busy clicking of the typewriter she was probably alone too hitherto he had entered unannounced but then the door stood open why should he knock now he would not he decided to enter as hitherto and so quietly turned the knob and pushed but the door resisted evidently it was latched from within twice he made the trial noiselessly as possible and then paused to consider this was something new miss wallen had locked herself in or possibly had locked him out if not at her desk she might easily have seen him sauntering leisurely up the street might have seen him cross and divining that his object was to see her and perhaps renew his offensive talk have taken prompt measures to resist well even if lettered private office on the door it was a public office in point of fact and that public office was not for personal use or benefit he had the authority in one sententious form or other of many an executive from jefferson down so elmendorf rapped and rapped loudly the clicking presently ceased a light footstep was heard then the voice of the official stenographer what is wanted open the door please whom do you wish to see i desire to speak with miss wallen miss wallen declines i have business to transact mr wells is not here and miss wallen is not empowered to act for him you will have to wait and see him tomorrow miss wallen you are barring me out of an office i have a perfect right to enter and that i mean to enter here and now or make formal complaint to the trustees if this door is not opened in twenty seconds i warn you there will be trouble to this remark no answer whatever was vouchsafed miss wallen quietly returned to her typewriter and the only sound from within was the clicking of that ingenious machine elmendorf had sense enough not to shout his news but he had not sense enough to abandon the attempt to tell her there was another way of reaching the sanctum provided he moved with promptness and decision it was through the library itself turning away muttering angrily he returned through the darkening corridor down the stairs and around to the main entrance another moment and he was at the lattice that separated the readingroom from the library proper there beyond were the long aisles and rows of crowded shelves here was the customary throng of patrons returning or taking out books there were the busy attendants bustling to and fro and beyond them and beyond those vaults and dim recesses was the passage leading to the sanctum of the head librarian a young girl standing within the lattice was noting the numbers of some books upon a slip of cardboard and with quick decision elmendorf addressed her pardon me said he i have to go into mr wellss office at once miss wallen has accidentally locked the door and cant open it will you kindly let me through this way the girl hesitated an instant it was against orders but she had often seen the gentleman in the library and in the sanctum itself with the librarian i suppose it will be all right said she doubtfully oh certainly said elmendorf pardon my haste i have left some papers there that i need at once ah thank you and slipping through the wicket he hastened on his way before any one else could interpose and in another moment stood within the sanctum and closed the door behind him nor was he much surprised to find miss wallen no longer at her instrument but leaning wearily against the casement apparently gazing out into the street you see he began with cold sarcastic emphasis the power to lock one door does not make a woman the mistress of an entire situation it would have been better had you accepted what was meant for your good and spared me the necessity of forcing it upon you as it were but i have had my own sisters to protect in the past and knew what was best for you nor am i to be balked in what i consider my duty by the obstinacy of a moonstruck passionblinded girl she had turned her back upon him as he began to speak now she turned and faced him he half expected fierce denunciation but to his surprise her manner was as contemptuously cool as his was sardonically cold you have succeeded in getting in here on the plea of business mr elmendorf but this is insolence it is my business and has ever been and shall ever be to stand between the helplessness of the poor and the oppression of the rich my business is to see that you and yours suffer no wrong at the hands of those who consider such as you their natural prey i see the ghost of a smile flickering about your lips miss wallen and am aware you regard my mission with disfavor but you cannot and shall not treat it with contempt she was smiling poor girl and it was but the ghost of a wintry smile too for even in her exasperation and distress the whimsical humorous side of her nature its helpful sunny side was asserting itself at the moment for the life of her she could not feel the indignation he deserved just then for the contrast between the grandiloquence of his sentiments and the pettiness of that unpaid lodgingbill almost forced her to laugh outright i am here he went on because you would not believe my statements regarding mr forrest because i feel it my duty to open your eyes as to his character and intentions you refused to believe what i said concerning him and you and that only confirms my fears i am powerless to contend against the logic of a womans love but when i spoke of him and her whom i may be pardoned for referring to as your rival i spoke the truth now she was smiling in contemptuous amusement again as though she actually considered it beneath her to answer how amazed would miss allison be at the idea of her being placed on the same plane with a workinggirl her silence and selfcontrol maddened elmendorf have you no reason no sense he demanded i told you this very day that she had gone to follow and bring him back did i not a cool nod of assent i told you he would reappear here if at all only as her husband or possibly her affianced did i not another nod as cool as the first and you turned away in contemptuous unbelief did you not contempt certainly but unbelief not entirely elmendorf was fairly trembling with wrath by this time the idea that this simple unlettered friendless girl of the people should so coolly brave him him on whose words enraptured ears were wont to hang at whose eloquence enthusiastic hundreds burst into applause it stung him to the very marrow of his conceit something must be said or done to bring her to her knees and believing that she loved and dearly loved the man in question he prepared his final coup well it may modify your contempt to know that my words have come true that mr forrest was ordered away in disgrace she calmly asked not so much that as that he has returned brought back as i said by miss allison why but that is no news at all i knew he was coming and i saw them together this morning you saw them and you knew he was coming faltered the tutor you mean to you mean he writes to you that you correspond with him i mean nothing whatsoever beyond what i said mr elmendorf that i knew mr forrest would be here this week that i saw them this morning and as it is his work that lies here unfinished interrupted by this visitation i may now i presume return to my business and you to yours then he has been here too yes and will be again another reason perhaps why you would better not linger i will open the door now since it is to let you out yes and to let him in i suppose and see him behind locked doors as you doubtless have before miss wallen the door is both unlocked and open mr elmendorf said she throwing it wide but now in her turn the girl was quivering with indignation furthermore one touch on this button brings our janitor here mr wells speaks of him as our bouncer and her white hand poised not six inches from the button elmendorf took a long breath you may consider this a moral victory miss wallen said he backing to the portal but you will do well to remember this as i have said before i have a duty to perform that i owe to society to my employers on the one hand to the people on the other rest you well assured that whatever may have been his successes so called in the past there are two schemes of your paragon mr forrest that shall fail even if i have to fight him through the public press in one or other separately he may be too much for my efforts but at one and the same time that accomplished rouй shall never win a wife in that household and a mistress here and immediately thereafter a gentleman coming up the dim corridor without heard a sound that resembled the loud crack of a toy torpedo followed by the reverberant bang of a door and a moment later encountered an oddly familiar figure hurrying out and hanging on to its left jowl as though afflicted with a violent attack of tic douloureux why i believe thats mr elmendorf remarked the newcomer and then was surprised to find the inner door locked to find that he had to knock thrice before it was opened and by that time it seemed quite dark illustration illustration chapter x the dinner at allisons the night of his return from the long journey was not a success it was to be an entirely informal affair no guests present but a high official of the road in which the host was so heavily interested and mr forrest whom miss allison had invited on her own account the brother magnate came and mr forrest did not true his acceptance had been conditioned on his being able to finish certain papers which so he told both florence and her father would be required at the office early the next day mr elmendorf came hurrying in and went up to his room about halfpast six and fifteen minutes later came a messenger with a note which was taken at once to miss allisons room she was dressed for dinner and ready to come down but she took it and read it hurriedly uttered an exclamation of disappointment and sharply closed her door not until mr allison sent for her with the information that dinner was on the table did she appear elmendorf eyed her covertly and aunt lawrence sharply there were unmistakable traces of tears did he say why he couldnt come asked mrs lawrence presently yes no at least he had told me before that he thought it might be impossible answered florence in embarrassment and annoyance her father was laying down the law on interstate commerce to his guest at the moment and it was a subject on which he never tired even while listening intently watching for his chance to chip in as cary said elmendorf caught miss allisons every word what he had not yet been enlightened upon was the explanation of forrests return with the party all he knew was that early on the previous day the general with two of his aides and mr forrest boarded the train in southern kansas allison invited them all into the private car and proposed making them his guests on the homeward run the chief declined for himself and staff saying that they had other matters to detain them but it transpired that mr forrest was to go right on he had his berth engaged in an adjoining sleeper but spent several hours with the railway party and on their arrival in chicago the allisons had insisted on his taking a seat in their carriage allison himself was dropped at his club florence in turn left mr forrest at his lodgings and then was driven home this was actually all elmendorf had been able to learn but here was basis enough for all manner of theory and conjecture none of them to forrests advantage and elmendorf felt that the more he could make of them the better for his own cause and the worse for forrest there had been an intangible something in allisons manner to warn the tutor that just so soon as the guests were out of the way he might look out for squalls allison had greeted him with utter absence of cordiality and elmendorf felt that his employer was even more displeased with him than when he went away under such circumstances a wise man would have avoided saying or doing anything to augment the feeling against him but elmendorf except in his own conceit was far from wise and his propensity for putting his foot in it was phenomenal allison loved his postprandial cigar it agreed with him and so did his guest the ladies withdrew quite early cary slipped away and elmendorf should have slipped after him but here were two great men of the railway world the natural oppressors of the masses the very type of the creatures he delighted in describing upon the platform as bloated bondholders their conversation could hardly fail to be of interest to him and he remained warming up to their work they were discussing the situation at pullman and its probable effect upon the employees of the roads centring in chicago that their views should be radically opposed to those of their absorbed listener was of course to be expected and elmendorf was fidgeting furiously upon his chair every now and then striving to interject a sentence and claim the floor but allison knew his man and knew that once started elmendorf could not well be suppressed every attempt on the part of the tutor to interpose therefore was met by uplifted and warning hand and prompt permit me or permit mr sloan to finish if you please which was galling in the last degree elmendorf had planned to have a conciliatory word or two with miss allison with whom he knew himself to have been in grave disfavor ever since the occasion of his presuming to tender advice and remonstrance on the score of mr forrest but she had escaped to her own room again immediately after quitting the table her manner towards him showed that she had neither forgiven nor forgotten the impertinence and that was additional reason why he should have done nothing more in that household at least to add to the array of his offences but presently the opportunity came and he could not resist the interstate commerce law was again under discussion allison had always fiercely opposed it declaring it to be an utterly unconstitutional and unwarrantable interference with the rights of corporations and individuals mr sloan was rather more conservative he was contending that despite its restrictions upon certain railway companies the appointment of the commission had resulted in much that was beneficial to most parties concerned allison burst forth impetuously why sloan look at the thing it is direct and absolute usurpation on the part of the general government of the functions of the state heres a road running from chicago to cairo for instance its traffic is entirely within the state its offices roadbed and rollingstock everything concerning it in fact within the limits of the state and yet just because it delivers freight and passengers over on the kentucky shore here comes the general government formulating laws for its control which should be the province of the state and of the state only if weve got to be trammelled by legislation let it be at the hands of our own legislators eh what he asked breaking suddenly off to acknowledge the presence of the butler standing solemnly beside him with a card on the salver allison took the card mechanically glanced at the name and even as he was saying oh show him in here send this up to miss florence elmendorf had seized his opportunity and chipped in yes but my dear sir he began in his eager nerveracking whining tone is there not inconsistency here can you deny that when the legislature not only of this but of neighboring states essayed to enact laws on these very subjects your attorneys were promptly on the ground to argue against it and to declare that only congress had the power under the constitution to regulate commerce between the states can you deny that at the meeting of managers and businessmen here one of the most prominent of your number declared that you objected to any and all legislation can you deny that when congress did take the matter up your attorneys were just as promptly in washington proclaiming that any attempt to legislate in your affairs was a violation of the rights of the sovereign states can you deny in fine that when the whole subject was under discussion here a second time one of your most eminent confrиres put himself on record as saying that while he was opposed to any legislation of two evils he preferred to choose the less and if any legislators were to meddle with the affairs of the roads better let it be the state solons who were far more well approachable and ready to listen to let us say reason can you deny that but here elmendorf found himself without listeners the odd point in it all was that very much that he said was true and allison was reddening with wrath and sloan chuckling with suppressed merriment when the entrance of a tall browneyed brownmoustached man in evening dress gave both opportunity to escape the deluge forrest at last exclaimed the host turning and seizing his hand so sorry you were detained lad but sit you down sit you down and let me ring for some dinner for you no had a bite all right take a chair and some wine sloan and i were whacking away at the old bone yes allison and heres a federal officer who wont agree with you for a moment with a dissatisfied shake of his head elmendorf had arisen as though to pull his chair nearer the end of the table and resume his attack but allison had purposely turned his back squarely upon him and was drawing forrest to the very place the tutor had hoped to occupy sloan arose and cordially shook hands with the newcomer who then for the first time apparently caught sight of elmendorf the latter had started as though to come forward but something in forrests eyes restrained him the lieutenant simply bowed and said very coldly goodevening but did not even mention the tutor by name now mr forrest began mr sloan with much heartiness of manner i want you to say to allison here just what you said to me hes a trifle hotheaded tonight he thinks the government has been paternalizing at our expense and that only harm will come from it forrest looked from one to the other a moment a quiet smile upon his lips all the previous afternoon as they trundled along in the cosy private car had these gentlemen been disputing over the same thing and late in the evening as mr sloan and forrest were enjoying a cigar together they too had had a chat upon the subject and sloan had turned and looked upon the officer in some surprise in common with most of his class the man of wealth and worldly wisdom had regarded the genus regular officer as a something impressive possibly on parade useful probably on the frontier but out of place anywhere else that he should have read or studied anything beyond drill and dime novels was not to be expected the magnates had even had their modest game of draw poker at a late hour and laughingly referred some mooted question to forrest as a probable expert and were astonished to hear that he had never played not so much because he disapproved of it as because he had never had time allison had already found out that forrest was a student and a thinker but up to that evening he was the only man of the party who believed that the average officer had any other use for time than to kill it whatever it was that mr forrest might have said to mr sloan it was evident he did not care to repeat it now i would rather not reopen the matter said he possibly i had no right to forecast the action of the government even speculatively in a contingency that may not arise elmendorf planted his chair and lighted a cigarette throwing himself down with an air as much as to say well ive got to be bored and must be resigned to it since they wont listen to a man of intelligence and allison with blacker gloom in his eyes looked squarely at him as he began to speak sloan youre not even sipping your wine forrest you never seem to indulge suppose we three adjourn to my den where the books are right at hand mr elmendorf has his duties and will excuse us if he had struck him the master of the house could not more have stung his employee even forrest who by this time had many reasons of his own for bringing elmendorf to book tingled with something like sympathy at a slight so marked there were so many other and better ways of letting elmendorf know that in the coming conference his presence could be dispensed with that sloan spoke of it the moment they reached the library but allison was imperious and positive you dont begin to know the man said he anything less than unmistakable prohibition he would consider as invitation and hed turn our talk into a lecture on the relations of capital to labor you saw how he got in the instant i stopped a moment sloan faith and i did said sloan laughing and he hit you fellows in the ribs why whered he find it all out im blessed if i know unless it was from the newspaper men they get hold of almost everything wrong side foremost as a rule but they get it now i heard something of your talk last night brooks was speaking of it he looks upon the interstate bill just as i do what do you mean by saying it might prove our salvation he asked abruptly turning to forrest i was simply supposing a case said forrest calmly say that the granger element in one state the populists in another the socialists in a third were to obtain control of the legislature and elect their own governor you say they are utterly antagonistic to the railways that in the event of a general strike mob violence etc they would refuse you help or protection that as common carriers you would be powerless to carry out your contracts and that not only passenger and freight traffic would be blocked but the government mails now prior to february the general government as i understand it had left the management of the railways to the states it had neither formulated laws for their control nor adopted measures for their protection in the great railway riots of when the police and militia were whipped and cowed by the mobs such states as pennsylvania and illinois begged for government aid and got it our troops were called in from the rocky mountains to chicago and from louisiana to pittsburg in the riots at buffalo three years ago new yorks fine national guard and in those at homestead the pennsylvania division were sufficient to put an end to the mischief and neither state had to ask for help but here lies within your limits far greater possibility for riot and bloodshed than can be found elsewhere in the union and suppose that to pander to the masses here as he has done in pardoning the anarchists your governor should deny you protection and permit assault riot and violence whenever you attempted to move engines or trains it is my belief that you can now look where you could not before the passage of that interstate commerce bill in for the protection denied you at home when the congress of the united states enacted that every common carrier should according to their respective powers afford all reasonable proper and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic between their respective lines i am quoting now and for receiving forwarding and delivery of passengers and property to and from their several lines the supreme power of the land asserted its right to assume control over all roads except those doing business exclusively within the limits of some one state and when the general government says to a common carrier that it must do this or must not do that it means that the general government will back it in carrying out its orders and whether it be mails passengers live stock perishable goods time freight or construction trains the railway companies can now look to the united states for protection whether any individual state likes it or not you have abused that law as a menace to your rights as a businessman mr allison you may live to bless it as all that stood between you and anarchy forrest had spoken in a quiet conversational tone noting that allison had closely eyed the heavy folds of the portiиre and once stepping quickly thither had drawn it aside and glanced about him but the tutor had vanished if that was what he was looking for when forrest stopped sloan turned to his friend with a merry twinkle in his eyes hows that for federalist doctrine as opposed to states rights allison i expect to hear you saying almost thou persuadest me to be a federalist before forrest is done with you well i certainly never looked for such an interpretation of the law it has only been a bother a nuisance a senseless trammel upon us thus far interfering with all our business breaking up our longhaul and shorthaul tariffs requiring us to account practically to the government for every penny we charge and almost every one we expend do you mean this is the way the law is looked upon at headquarters he asked glancing keenly at the soldier i have no means of knowing how the general understands it said mr forrest simply the matter may be tested before we think possible i understand that the condition of these poor people at pullman is getting worse every day and that there is widespread sympathy for them among the wageworkers everywhere and i dont wonder at it why theyve only themselves to blame forrest they seem to have done no laying up for a rainy day they had good homes and good wages so long as business boomed and they have spent just as freely as they got the money now theres no business for the company no orders for cars not enough to keep them going no man can expect a company to run its business at a loss and yet these people kick because they cant have the same wages they were getting when work was brisk well now is that strictly so mr allison i have talked with these people i have been told by them quiet conservative wellinformed pullman men that they concede that the wages must come down and that all hands will have to retrench awhile until better times they are willing to do that and stand by their company but on the other hand they think and i think the company owes something to them here are honest capable intelligent fellows who have served the company fifteen and twenty years have reared families within its walls occupied its houses and paid its rents they may not have saved i admit but they have served faithfully and long and well they have never failed in their obligation to the company and prompt payment of wages is not the only duty of a corporation to its people the company is wealthy it is even declaring a dividend none of its salaries have been cut down as a consequence of the business depression it has simply said to its wageworkers you alone are the ones to suffer you and your families and your cares and troubles are nothing to us heres the difference between your last months wages and your last months rent next month therell be no wages to speak of but well expect the rent all the same in my opinion that company is losing the chance of winning the love and gratitude of thousands of men and women whose affection is worth a good deal more than all the money theyll ever save this way it would have been an easy thing to say well bear our share of the burden these are hard times and weve had to cut down your wages until the dawning of a better day well cut the rents down too forrest thats utopia said mr allison i admit it but i know something of these people mr allison the past year perhaps has done more to open my eyes than all those which have preceded i have seen something of the struggles the selfdenial the charity the patience the helpfulness of the working classes i have learned a feeling of respect and sympathy for those who are the workers that is exceeded only by the contempt i feel for the drones and for those whom they hail as their advisers like our for instance said allison uplifting his eyes as though to include the study aloft well i know less of him or his speeches perhaps except by vague report than of others who are prominent they are preaching a doctrine that can only make matters worse for the laborer they counsel strike and forcible riotous resistance to the employment of others it can lead only to tumult to rioting that brings out the criminal and the desperate classes outrage results and the sympathy they might have received goes against them their very worst enemies are these men who are posing as strikeleaders well what do you think of the prospect does it look like an outbreak asked mr sloan to me yes for every day makes the suffering worse at pullman and the company refuses to hear of arbitration from a purely business point of view i cannot deny their right to do so but the very attitude assumed by the corporation makes many of the laborleaders accusations true the company has not contracts enough for new cars to keep all hands employed on full time and full wages perhaps many of its employees are single men comparatively new at the business they can afford to be frankly told to go elsewhere in search of work but to hold everybody while scaling the wages of all hands month after month down down until a family man cannot pay his rent and feed his children then the cord breaks just or unjust the impression prevails among the railway men everywhere i have been that the pullman company has made vast sums that it is about the only company not actually losing money now and that it is protecting itself through a bad year by heavily taxing its people there have been sympathetic strikes before what if one should be ordered now thats the enormity of the whole business broke in mr allison what i wish could be done with our hands would be to have them regularly enlisted for the work so many years unless sooner discharged just like the soldiers by jove then when a man quit work it would be desertion and when he combined with others to strike it would be mutiny ah wed have a railway service in this country then that would beat the world forrest smiled rather too much like a standing army controlled by corporation that would be and a standing army is a luxury the constitution forbids even to sovereign states besides would men enlist in such a service well how do you get them then the lord knows you treat them worse than we do the lord might believe that if he knew nothing but what the papers say answered forrest half laughing but in point of fact we dont begin to work our men as you do and we give them far more for their work another thing our workman knows just what he is going to get from month to month and he signs his contract to accept such bounty pay rations etc as may be provided by law no corporation can scale him down ten twenty thirty or fifty per cent when times are hard it takes the congress of his country to do that and when as once happened congress did adjourn without appropriating a cent for our pay the whole army stood by its obligation because it knew the people would stand by it next term that by the way was the year you railway men had most urgent need of its aid but said forrest suddenly starting to his feet here i have been inflicting a halfhours monologue and i had hoped to see miss allison you have fed allison some truths that will do him good if he can only digest them said mr sloan whimsically and put me up to some things im glad to hear was that what took you off so hurriedly and kept you away so long investigating the feeling of the railway hands all over the west no indeed said forrest promptly it was a very different thing by the way forrest that reminds me said allison with a grin on his face as he touched his bell to summon the butler youve never told us what did take you off and my sister has been consumed with scandal or something about it she began at me this afternoon i told her to apply to you for particulars bang again on the bell also damn that butler hes never around after nine oclock i believe he goes to sleep a quick step through the drawingroom and parlor the folds of the portiиre were drawn aside and elmendorf stood revealed the butler stepped out a moment ago sir i met him at the front can i summon any one else for you allisons face showed added annoyance no unless at least is miss florence in the parlor miss allison some time since sir begged to be excused isnt she well asked allison looking at the tutor in some amaze i cannot say as to that sir miss allison was in conversation with her aunt awhile odd said allison irritably these women are queer excuse me a moment will you and rising he left the room they felt rather than heard that he had gone up to make his own inquiries his voice presently was audible growling in his sisters boudoir elmendorf had disappeared and gone they knew not whither well its time for me to be off said sloan consulting his watch yet i dont want to leave without saying goodnight as for me i have to go said forrest because of an engagement oh you can go any time as you merely dropped in to call on the ladies but i dined here now excuse me mr forrest ive only known you a day or two but youve interested me so to speak you stick to allison and youll be of infinite use to him in case of trouble here he gets off his base sometimes stick to him my lad and your fortunes made ten minutes later when john allison with vexation and trouble on his brow came down to the library his guests were gone a few lines on a card explained each had engagements no wonder said mrs lawrence joining him presently i know what his engagement is and mr forrest seemed to know what was coming impatiently irritably the master of the house turned away i want to hear no more of this of course if its true i shall know how to act ill ill go to the library in the morning early this he did and apparently to some purpose for when he saw mr forrest at the club at noon he turned his back upon him and moved quickly away illustration illustration chapter xi during the week that followed mr elmendorf seemed to tread on air and bask in sunshine and favoring breeze when returning from the trip allison had almost made up his mind to get rid of him now while at the bottom of his heart he felt that he liked and suspected that he trusted him less than ever allison found himself powerless to carry out his intention in the first place cary was certainly behaving better than he had behaved in long months before aunt lawrence vouched for that she deplored only the fact that he seemed unable now to fix his ambition on any other career than the army still even doting and distracted parents have been known to cherish such an ambition long months at a time and to stimulate it by promises of working all possible wires to secure the muchdesired cadetship then if it couldnt be had they were just so much ahead the boy had been weaned from evil habits and associations through his longing to enter the army that he should have been disappointed at the last was through no fault of theirs even though it gave them secret joy they were doubly the gainers had the father stopped to think he would perhaps have seen that carys steadiness and studious ways were all due to this new and consuming desire and to the advice of his friends at headquarters but allison had many cares and worries now and could only thank heaven and perhaps as aunt lawrence suggested elmendorf that such reformation had been achieved in his boy but never until the evening of his return had he seriously faced the problem as to forrest for a soninlaw only once or twice had he vaguely asked himself if there was danger of flos falling in love with him with parental fondness he looked upon it as quite natural that forrest should fall in love with her and with worldly wisdom thought it more than probable that forrest should desire to become possessed of so many charms and concomitant stocks and bonds all that made no serious difference forrest might love and languish all he liked if it was fun for flo it never occurred to him that her fathers daughter could fall in love on her own account with a penniless lieutenant but now he and aunt lawrence had had a sharp talk florence was not to go down said she and it was time her brother knew why the child was infatuated with a man unworthy of her from almost every point of view yet who while paying her loverlike devotions dared to slight her at times for a creature with whom he was maintaining relations that needed to be promptly investigated and put an end to he that man forrest had dared to send a note to florence allison excusing himself from dinner on the plea of urgent work that had to be finished and then was seen in a public place supping with the lowbred person herself yes since allison demanded to know mr elmendorf was her informant but ask anybody at the hotel belmont where the two brazenly appeared together at the very hour forrest was due here it wasnt a block from the library then ask the janitor of the lambert who were there in the private office afterwards and though he is here now see if from here forrest does not go back to her back to that same office where so often they have been closeted before this mrs lawrence had been compelled she said to open florences eyes as to this deceit and duplicity of her lover and naturally she had declined to go downstairs and receive him she did not say however that florence had indignantly refused at first to believe that there was anything wrong had worked herself up into a glorious passion of tears over the matter and was looking like a fright in consequence when full twenty minutes after its arrival mrs lawrence pushed forrests card under the locked door of her nieces room elmendorf had slipped out twice during the evening was in and out like a flitting shadow and on each return had brought mrs lawrence new and more significant tidings florence had bathed her face and done all she could to make herself presentable and was preparing to go down when informed that forrest was gone and later that night mrs lawrence deluged her as she had her brother with the details of forrests scandalous doings wells was out when allison visited the library the following morning but the janitor was on hand to do reverence to the great director and trustee who was in the private office last night maloney said he sternly and distressed to think that anybody could suppose hed allow any one there who had no business maloney promptly answered sure nobody sorr barrin miss wallen and mr forrest he come back twice and took her home misther elmendorf was here sorr but allison did not wait to hear about him seated at her desk when he entered jenny promptly arose in respect to the distinguished arrival but he merely growled an inquiry for mr wells looked her sharply over and banged out again leaving the poor girl with vague sense of new trouble to add to the weight of care she was already bearing as he tramped away down town allison told himself he was not sorry that he had so crushing a piece of circumstantial evidence with which to demolish forrests aspirations yet down in the depths of his heart he knew he was sorry for he had grown to like him well just what course to pursue he had not determined he would see wells see the hotel belmont people see one or two parties referred to by mr elmendorf as highly respectable and responsible who could tell him far more in the same strain then see his brother trustees and dispose of miss wallens case meantime florence was kindly affectionately urged not to see mr forrest in the event of his calling and so elmendorfs schemes were working grandly he could well afford now to let them seethe and bubble he could hold his peace and position at home give renewed attention to those grander projects for the elevation of the downtrodden and the downtreading of the elevated keep out of forrests way and occupy himself in the cultivation of his new acquaintance major cranston in the enjoyment of the privileges accorded him in cranstons library and in the incidental conversion to the true political faith of those dyedinthewool devotees to cranstons service iniquitous feudalistic slavelike service elmendorf deemed it old sergeant mcgrath his better half and the nephew and while he was in the midst of this came other helping hands florence allisons social friends were prompt to hear of her return and of her bringing with her the objectionable aspirant and were equally prompt to call in eager shoals somewhere the impression had got abroad that her army friend had been ordered off under a cloud and though no one at headquarters could explain it many society people could and entirely to their own satisfaction the men who knew forrest liked him but few women seemed to know him at all after standing a social siege of some fortyeight hours even miss allisons nerves gave way and she had to deny herself to callers in the midst of the speculation and sensation ensuing at the moment came the news that once more suddenly and without the faintest explanation mr forrest had left chicago i deeply regret your illness and that i was unable to see you today he wrote from the club to miss allison but i am ordered away on duty that may cover several weeks and have not a moment to spare tell cary for me that i will leave with my landlady the books i promised him i would urge his reading them carefully with my regards to mr allison and mrs lawrence believe me yours faithfully and this was only four days after the luckless dinner florence ministered to the consuming curiosity of her aunt and showed her the letter but the adjutantgeneral at headquarters was less considerate even society reporters could extract from him no hint as to why or where lieutenant forrest had gone but that only served to stimulate conjecture and suggestion and to gossips born a little stimulant goes like the stories it sets afloat long leagues beyond hope of recapture then there were some lonely anxious days for a palefaced slender sadeyed girl who seemed to get no benefit from the bracing breezes and then bursting suddenly from winter to summer as is often the way with our illordered turbulent defiant and generally indescribable climate came the first day of moistureladen heat depressing debilitating a day when the tide of his affairs swept elmendorf from his moorings at cranstons and sent the freeholder thereof in search of a stenographer the day when poor jenny begged to be excused from having even to write that detested name and then speedily came the longthreatened outbreak the demand of the american railway union that the public cease to patronize or the railway companies to run no matter what their contracts the cars of the pullman company weve got em by the throat at last screamed mart wallen at donnellys shades that night this means that the people the people of the whole nation have risen to down that damned old miser and well make a clean sweep of other misers while were about it weve got em foul echoed with drunken hiccoughs the graceless nephew mrs mac and her sobered sergeant were dragging home between them deaf to the eloquence of elmendorf haranguing the crowd in the open square beyond what was he saying stand firm and the blood of the innocent victims of the glorious appeal of seven years ago the martyred lives of the innocent men who died upon the scaffold strangled in their effort to speak for you and your children not only will not have been lost in vain but soon shall be magnificently avenged oh that it had been my lot to lead you here in god be thanked it is my lot to lead you now oh that ye had been here to lead in ye howling lunatic echoed mrs mac shaking her one unoccupied fist at the glorified but luckily distant face of the speaker yer only lot this night would have been in the graveyard for ye never would have lived to lead anything barrin yer own funeral illustration illustration chapter xii then came a few days in which elmendorf was in his glory to be in a position where he could command attention where he could practically compel people of all classes and conditions to be his listeners to hang upon his words and regard him as clothed with power backed by authority this was indeed joy and triumph new to him though still far below the dreams he had dreamed though not even a member of the great railway union not even possessing the confidence of its leaders the fervor of his speeches had won him favor and admitted him to their councils not even tolerated for days at headquarters he suddenly reappeared there with all the assurance of the past and during the first fortyeight hours of the memorable strike no one man in all chicago seemed to carry on his shoulders the weight of information authority and influence of john allisons whilom tutor whose note of dismissal unopened awaited him at the deserted study to the officials of the american railway union he represented himself as deep in the confidence of the officials at military headquarters personally intimate with most of the staff and a man to whose warnings the general himself ever lent attentive ear to the adjutantgeneral and others in authority the chief being still away he declared himself the envoy of the leaders of the strike a man empowered to levy war or compass peace in both assumptions he was impudent yet not without support what he craved was prominence notoriety the fame if not the fact of being an arbiter in the destinies of chicago in this crisis of her history from the pullman to the leland from inner dйpфt to outlying freightyards from meetings to municipal offices he sped never stopping for rest or refreshment irascible officers at springfield receiving despatches signed elmendorf put an h to his name and lopped it off at the neck there were two precincts he left unpenetrated the headquarters of the railway managers and those of the national guard allison had made him known at the one his public utterances and persistent sneers at the militia boys our tin soldier boys at the other his appearance in the armory of any regiment in the city would have been the signal for a demonstration he had no desire to face through the newspaper offices too he flitted shedding oracular statement and prophecy claiming to speak by the card when he had news to tell and preserving mysterious suggestive silence when questioned on matters whereof he knew nothing two days had the strike been in force switchmen yardmen firemen had quit their posts and they or sympathizing gangs of toughs stoned and cursed the men who took their places yardmasters and mastermechanics leaped into the cabs and handled the levers of switchengines whitehanded clerks and electricians swung lanterns and coupled cars conductors turned switchmen superintendents became conductors and managers stepped down to yardmasters and still the mob gaining in numbers and wrath and villany with every hour blackguarded the trainmen blockaded the trains and bombarded with sticks and stones and couplingpins the few shrinking and terrified passengers trains reaching the city were towed in with every pane smashed and their inmates a mass of cuts and bruises trains due in the city and seized by the strikers were sidetracked at desolate prairie stations miles from food and water and helpless pleading women and children were penned up in them and left to hunger and thirst and tremble in vain the railway officials pleaded with the city authorities for protection for passengers and trains we have been watching everywhere weve seen no violence was the answer policemen along the railway lines laughed and looked on while almost within swing of their clubs strikers were kicking a victim to death in vain all appeals to the state this was a popular movement a poor mans protest against the tyranny of a grasping monopolist the people vs pullman let the railways join in and discard his cars and all would be well contracts be damned what cared they for the law of contract when on the eve of revolution and election feigning to believe that the managers were merely pretending that their roads were blocked openly asserting that the managers could run their trains if they really wanted to and slyly intimating that all the destruction thus far effected was at the hands of paid emissaries of the managers themselves officials of a great state and of a great city sworn to preserve peace and good order and enforce the laws dared to look idly on and trust the masses to whom they betrayed the honor of the commonwealth for the vindication of a reelection within three days of the start passenger traffic except on the two or three roads in the hands of the federal courts was practically ended freight traffic paralyzed and the great stockyards were in the hands of a mob of frantically rejoicing men not one wheel shall turn in any yard in all chicago with the morrows sun said elmendorf slyly and jeeringly exultant in the presence and hearing of officers and clerks at the pullman building late that night the managers have played their last card made their last bluff the state and the city virtually tell them that it is their own fight with their own men men whom they have systematically browbeaten bullied swindled and starved until now the worm has turned at last you see the beginning of the end the dawn of the glorious future the rise of labor against capital and your friends the magnates have the option of ruin or surrender i tell you gentlemen three hundred thousand freemen will line those tracks at noon tomorrow and if their but the officers to whom he addressed himself turned impatiently away clerks were passing to and fro along the hall between the office of the adjutantgeneral and their desks some powerful but subdued excitement pervaded the building watchers of the strikers had noted the increasing number of officers in civilian dress long after the usual business hours and elmendorf quick to take the alarm had hastened thither to ferret out the cause vain his effort to communicate with his one victim he was at his desk and a vigilant exsergeantmajor of cavalry scowled at the wouldbe intruder and told him visitors could not enter the clerks rooms vain his effort to extract news along the corridors no man seemed to know why so many of them were there perplexed he rushed back to his associates the strikeleaders are you sure theyre stanch at springfield he asked sure they havent asked for aid from washington the idea was laughed to scorn the governor is with us to the bitter end was the loud boast of prominent sympathizers and until he touches the button no power in or out of illinois can stand between us and victory tomorrow we lock the lines from pittsburg to the pacific exultant he sprang into a cab and drove to the north side it was late at night but he had his latchkey a bath a few hours rest a change of linen and he would issue forth on the morrow refreshed invigorated ready to launch his shallop on this tide in his affairs which taken at full flood must lead to everlasting fame and fortune who would now dare crush him with curt refusal to listen who would poohpooh his prophecies who deny his views who withhold the homage due him now as he strode agitator elevator inspirer anax andrфn king of men the divinely appointed heavenanointed leader of mankind in this sublime movement for liberty and the lord only knew what else it was late and the great house was dark but he let himself in and seeking first the butlers pantry ransacked the larder for refreshment he had eaten and drunk his fill when the electric bell called his eye to the indicator some one at the street door humming softly his blithe tune he shuffled over the tiled pavement and unbolted the inner door a telegraphboy handed him two messages with a receiptbook and pencil john allison was all he said i dont think hes home said elmendorf did you try the club for answer the boy sleepily pointed with grimy finger to the address on the envelope street and number were distinct well just wait youngster and ill see if hes in said elmendorf and trotted swiftly noiselessly upstairs mr allisons room was open the gas burning dimly at the toilettable but no one was there even as he hesitated what to do a door at the east end of the wide corridor quietly opened and a flood of light from miss allisons boudoir shot across the darkness elmendorf heard the soft rustle of silken folds and hastened towards the light florence stood there at the doorway in some rich wrap of a pale delicate shade of pink billows of creamy lace broke away from the shoulders and down along the entire front the short elbowsleeves seemed to burst into creamy foam while a band of sable fur encircled and contrasted with the pure white throat and was caught at the back by a knot of ribbon it was one of her parisian purchases a modern conceit something she never wore except in her own room or aunt lawrences but elmendorf looked upon her with a glow of admiration in his keen eager eyes that even in her hour of anxiety and fatigue she could not fail to notice and resent if you have messages for my father i will take charge of them she simply said er pardon me i was about to offer my services miss allison as these may be immediate if you will tell me where mr allison is to be found i will not trouble you she answered coldly and the plump white hand extended for the messages was the only thing about her that did not seem to turn from him in dislike flushed with the triumph of the two days gone intoxicated possibly by the dreams of his own dawning greatness elmendorf refused to accept rebuff who was she to treat with scorn the man whose merest word now could move a million stalwarts you must pardon me miss allison he answered with emphasis i am not here in the capacity of a menial in the household the events of the past few days have conspired to make me a factor in affairs with power and influence far exceeding that wielded by my late employer furthermore i should see him or rather he should seek to see me within the next few hours unless he has resigned himself to the crash which must involve all he holds priceless in business and may even involve all he holds precious here may i trouble you for those despatches mr elmendorf she asked wearily almost disgustedly elmendorf flushed with wounded vanity the despatches are yours he said bowing with marked reverence but as this may be my last opportunity of speaking to you in some days i have that to say which i urge you for your own sake your brothers sake your fathers sake to hear and heed on many occasions i have conscientiously striven to point out to your honored if somewhat opinionated sire the injustice indeed i may say the brutality of the views he so openly expresses towards the labor class he has not received my advice in the kindly spirit in which it was offered but as possibly you know matters have come to a climax and such is the gravity of the situation that not only is his property in jeopardy but his life nay i know you have not forgiven me for words spoken only through motives of the most loyal and honorable devotion to your best interests i see this bores you but miss allison let me say to you in so many words that if the pq r road persists in its refusal to restore those trainmen who were discharged yesterday for sidetracking a pullman car at grand crossing your fathers life may be the forfeit illustration may i trouble you for those despatches mr elmendorf and yet the strikeleaders declare there is no violence and that the strikers will commit none she said wearily that was the spirit with which they entered upon this controversy but when the managers persisted in hiring men to fill their places and even dared to discharge employees for no worse crime than sympathy with their own brothers even they who have listened to and obeyed me in the past murmur and threaten now it will take my uttermost as it shall be my sweetest effort to stand between you and harm but here the pink corded silk swished disdainfully about its watteau pleat flashed out of sight through the doorday and that portal was slammed in the speakers face the mover of multitudes found himself alone in the darkened hall snubbed and wrathful carys room was just above and the tutor smiled sardonically as peering in there he saw the boy lying half dressed upon his bed covered by a navajo blanket that forrest had given him on his birthday a revolver on the chair a moment later in his own room he found pinned on his toilettable a note addressed in allisons wellknown hand it was a curt dismissal from his service subject to the stipulated one months notice and an intimation that in the interim his services and his presence could both be dispensed with no reason was assigned though the teeming columns of the press contained reason more than enough turned out like a dog he snarled let us see what theyll say in the morning and then he started and listened for down on the floor below light hurried footfalls sped along the corridor it was florence hastening to her fathers room stealthily elmendorf sprang to the landing without leaned over the balustrade and bent his ear he heard the unmistakable rrrring of the telephone bell allisons own room too then he had had to yield one pet prejudice at least as a result of the widespread influence of the strike hell have to yield to more than that said elmendorf give me quick please he heard her call her voice tremulous with excitement that was not allisons office that was not the club nor the managers association where then was he what scheme was afoot hist is that the superintendents office pq r she asked is mr allison there mr john allison no where down at the dйpфt please send for him at once to come to the phone say his daughter has despatches for him of the utmost importance yes ill hold the line silence for a long long minute elmendorf could hear his heart thumping loud what on earth could allison be doing at the dйpфt of the pq r at one in the morning the tracks of the road in a dozen places between the station and the suburbs were piled high with wrecked freightcars at nine oclock the beautiful silver special scheduled to leave each night at eleventhirty had been stalled there since the strike began yet rumor had it that the management meant to launch it southwestward mails express buffet chaircar and sleepers complete if they had to cram its roofs and platforms with deputies armed with winchesters could it be that already wreckingtrains were clearing a passage and that this hated train the reddest rag that could be flaunted in the face of the raging bull of the strike was to burst the blockade and cover the strikers with derision perish all thought of sleep or change of linen that station was a long three miles away but he could get there and to the haunts of the strikers farther beyond but first he must hear the purport of those despatches now her voice again yes what is it oh papa can you hear me distinctly then listen here are two despatches the first from washington wait i must close the door bang and then came only muffled and inarticulate sound down the winding stairs he sped and knelt at allisons door oh wise young daughter not only that but the inner the closet door was shut no time for squeamishness this noiselessly turning the knob he stealthily entered and tiptoed to the closet just in time to catch these words entire system will be tied up trainmen cannot face such assaults did you hear yes they were handed mr elmendorf at the door ten minutes what certainly he came in after midnight yes at least i think he is he went up to his room dont let him get what the contents the despatches certainly not who will come for them why arent you ever coming home oh papa do be careful youve no idea of the wild things that that fellow said what the silver special going out in an hour oh goody but elmendorf did not stop to hear more slinking away he sped down the stairway and in another moment was hastening southward through the starlit summer night illustration illustration chapter xiii down in the southwestward district of the farspreading city a howling mob of halfdrunken men women and streetboys had surged through the freightyards of a great railway company and first looting the contents were now setting fire to the cars here and there along the glistening lines on which ordinarily sped the swift express or suburban trains were toppled now bulky brown boxes with their greasy dripping trucks protruding in air at adjacent streetcorners helmeted policemen idly swinging their clubs behind them looked on and laughed where at sundown the previous day perhaps a thousand angrylooking men and women had hovered menacing above the great crossing of the central and the pq r ten thousand furies now seemed loose the triumphant boast of the strikeleaders that not a wheel should turn on allisons road had been laughed to scorn not only had allison with a force of deputies and loyal trainmen cleared his tracks at midnight and sent the famous silver special full panoplied on its way but the armed deputies that took it to the county line brought in under cover of their winchesters and the darkness of early morning three sidetracked trains from the far west and now indeed was there raging and gnashing of teeth men thus braved and thwarted turned to fiends the sun was not an hour high when the emissaries of the railway union were haranguing the people all along these outlying districts the striking railwaymen themselves were redoubling their pleadings with the men who had stood firm and from pleadings turned to threats by eight oclock the flames were shooting high from scores of cars and under the fierce heat rails were warping and twisting at half a dozen points the city firemen gallant fellows everybodys friends and defenders loyal to their duty had dashed up with their hose only to be furiously assaulted and beaten back and still the police looked on and laughed like a thief in the night screamed elmendorf to his audience of strikers and rioters the pq r has stolen its trains sneaked out its fell purpose in the hours of rest and slumber when honest men brave men worthy men seek their pillows and the sanctity of their homes these despoilers of the poor these tyrants of a confiding people conspiring together and corrupting with infamous gold the brethren who have betrayed us reckless of their pledges false to their promises when were they ever else have succeeded in running two or three trains through the blockade now it remains with you to say how long how great shall be their triumph summon from far and near your manhood and your strength call to action every man with a mans heart and a mans arm see to it that none but stalwarts go on guard tonight or from this time forth and be ready to act when the sun climbs high be ready i say for noon shall bring you tidings to make each heart bound in its seat be ready a million strong if need be to force your ultimatum down these managerial throats mad with excitement and nervous strain seemed elmendorf from point to point his cab was dashing he had slept but such catnaps as he could catch when whirling from one part of the city to another it was he who rushed in to announce to the strikeleaders the astounding fact that despite his efforts the p q r had pushed out the silver special and was chagrined to find they knew all about it it galled him through the night to realize that every time he drove with tidings to anybody else somebody was sure to be previously informed he had left allisons home to hasten to a point three miles distant to rouse the strikers with warnings of the proposed sending out of the train only to find that in that as in everything else he was too late with sympathizing spies and friends in every nook and corner how could it be otherwise yet elmendorf could never divest himself of the idea that without him to warn advise or control chaos would come again the strikers and their sympathetic mob of toughs had become dispersed during the night and could not in time be reassembled in sufficient force to oppose successfully all those armed deputies that was how the road was opened but it was closed now and others despite the injunctions of united states courts and the efforts of the federal officials found it practically useless to attempt to force even the mail trains through the rioting districts such was the peril to life and limb that trained engineers and firemen refused to serve and those who dared were in some cases kicked and beaten into pulp damn the united states courts said the mob injunctions dont go here and so in vastly augmented numbers and in fury that vented itself in wrecking miles and miles of railway property the mob was reopening the day theyll pay for last nights trick said an official of the railway union smilingly announcing another distant road tied up theres a higher power in the land than even the united states courts and tonight theyll come to any terms we dictate and he added significantly terms are already being dictated a messenger entered at the moment mr allison isnt at the office and they dont know where he is he slept awhile and breakfasted at the club but left there half an hour ago this is a matter in which probably i can be of more avail than any one else promptly said the ubiquitous elmendorf my personal acquaintance with the gentleman and his family may and doubtless will enable me to give more weight to your dictum than it might otherwise bear then too i may reasonably hope to influence him to agree to the proposed terms and render further harsh measures unnecessary the leaders eyed one another and hesitated already had they begun to see that elmendorf assumed much more than he carried but no one could gainsay his eagerness and devotion to the cause redeyed sleepless pallid he was yet here eager to devote more hours of effort to the good cause at all events it would get him out of the way for a time and he was becoming too prevalent oh very well if you think you can find him mr elmendorf and obtain his written assurance that no further attempt will be made to run a train on the pq r theres no objection the brotherhood of railway trainmen stands ready and eager to back us and if we call it out the managers are simply crushed and so delighted elmendorf whisked away on this new mission mr allison was not at home such was the answer by telephone in the silvery tones he knew so well then may i ask you to await my coming miss allison said he i am charged with matters of the utmost consequence to him and to his i will be there just as fast as a cab can carry me the reply was not assuring but he went and she waited indeed the girl was waiting anxiously for her fathers return squads of workingmen passing the house had shaken their fists at it and cursed its occupants the morning wind sweeping eastward from the lumberyards along the north branch bore ominous sounds of tumult and uproar even so far from the great railway properties elmendorf bade his cabman wait and rang at the bell the tutor could let himself in with his latchkey the envoy of fivehundred thousand embattled freemen very properly sent his card to the magnates daughter and presently she appeared sleepless nights and sorrowing days had begun to play havoc with that fair complexion and florence allisons feminine friends could not have failed to remark upon it but in the shrouded light of the south parlor these defects were but faintly visible elmendorf was pacing nervously up and down as was his wont when deeply moved and miss allison entered so quietly that he did not hear her and became conscious of her presence on his return trip from the east window only in time to avert collision i beg pardon he stammered i was so deep in thought miss allison permit me and he brought forward a chair thank you no it can hardly take that long as you will he replied with shrugging shoulders yet i protest i deserve less arrogance of manner listen to me he continued coming impetuously towards her whereon she coldly recoiled a pace or two from the heat and fury of the battle i have come here once more to attest my devotion my loyalty to the interests of those under whose roof i have at least found temporary shelter if not a home and friends i come to you clothed with power to speak and to act turning from public duties abandoning against their protest the control of thousands of fellowcreatures who lean on me for guidance in this crisis of their lives on every side this morning i have heard invective execration denunciation threats of the most summary vengeance hurled against your fathers name i tell you not only does he stand in peril of his life but that this household even you you so fair so gentle so delicate may at any moment become the prey of a populace as frenzied as ever dragged to the guillotine the shrieking beauties of the court of france miss allison whatsoever may be the injustice with which your father has treated me it sinks into nothingness in comparison with my sense of the peril that threatens you i am charged with a mission of most sacred character i am the envoy of the masses sent to present their last plea to the man you know where he is my carriage is at the door as you would save him and save yourself i adjure you to accompany me at once and add your prayers to mine to bend his obdurate heart nay florence i implore but miss allison had darted back a fine flush mounting to her forehead at the climax of his impassioned address she had faint appreciation of histrionics mr elmendorf i think youre simply crazy was her eminently practical way of putting an end to the address if you wish to see pa my father youll find him at the managers office at halfpast ten or if you hurry you may catch him at the lambert and then she would have turned but he sprang to her how can you treat me with disdain he said because i have been poor is that reason why i may not one day be rolling in wealth number you among your friends my superior in education in intellect is it in the ranks of these emptyheaded officers or these brainless vapid sons of vice and luxury that make up the men of your social circle you are to be mated i tell you that this movement means revolution that within this very week the longoppressed people shall be paramount and we who reap shall rule i have long seen it coming long foretold and long been ridiculed but now the hour ay the hour and the man have come already i have saved you from the dishonor of alliance with nay you must listen for with infinite disgust upon her face she turned angrily away but as she would not listen he sprang forward and seized her wrists florence he cried i and then her voice reechoed through the hall cary she screamed and far aloft there was a shout of coming and six steps at a bound that exuberant specimen of young america came thundering down the broad spiral of the stairway the portentous butler too hove suddenly in sight elmendorf dropped the subject and her wrist whisked his hat off the hall table and was out of the house and into his cab before the wrathful brother could reach him not until cabby had driven blindly for six blocks did elmendorf poke his cane through the trap and bid him speed for the lambert a carriage stood at the private entrance and the driver said it was mr allisons the anteroom was open the glazed doors to the private office were closed but excited voices arose from within he recognized allisons wellss and that of the chairman of the board of trustees in hot altercation the chairman seemed siding with wells which added to allisons wrath and he wound up with an explosion ive given you more than reason enough she has been shut up here alone with him time and again at night she has been seen going to his rooms long after dark she has been seen walking or driving with him as late as midnight and the very evening he is due at a gentlemans house at dinner he sends urgent business as his plea and is found supping alone with her at the belmont if she stays i resign and i answer thundered wells that that girls as purehearted a woman as ever lived she has been shut up here with me time and again working at my letters until late at night she has been to my rooms a dozen times to leave her finished work on her homeward way she has been seen or could have been seen walking or driving with me late at night for im proud to say ive taken her home instead of letting her go it alone in the rain and as for the belmont its the nearest and neatest restaurant i know of and a dozen times when we had work to be finished in a hurry have i taken her as mr forrest did to have her cup of tea there instead of letting her tramp two miles to get it at home im a married man and he isnt thats the only difference you say if she stays you resign all right mr allison if she goes i go and then upon this stormy scene entered elmendorf the blessed the peacemaker it would be idle to assume ignorance of the subject of this conference he began before any one had sufficiently recovered from surprise to head him off and as it is audible throughout this portion of the building i could not but hear and be attracted by it i am here as ever to take the side of the oppressed and to say that should that young woman be punished thus summarily for her indiscretions i shall consider it my duty to make public certain circumstances in connection with the case notably mr forrests relations with certain families in our midst that may prove unpleasant reading enough of this mr elmendorf began wells angrily this young woman as you term her is not to be summarily punished because she has done nothing to deserve it and despite every sneaking endeavor on your part to cloud her good name and now like the doubledealing cad you are you come here posing as her defender she needs none by god as long as my wife and i are left in the land and i would trust her cause with mr allison himself at any other time than now when he is overstrained and worn out miss wallen is at home he continued addressing himself to the two trustees owing she explains to her mothers severe illness she too is far from well she has been looking badly for weeks i was going up there to see what i could do for her when surprised by this visit mr waldo as president of the board of trustees you may understand that i declare these allegations against miss wallen to be utterly brutally unjust and that i protest against the action proposed by mr allison most unfortunately our talk has been overheard by the man whom of all others i distrust in this connection what business have you here mr elmendorf anyway said allison glowering angrily i have forbidden you my doors yet you follow me my business is with you sir not as a suppliant pleading for mercy as you seem to think but as the representative of a great people demanding immediate answer to their what why you meddling insignificant scowled allison gripping his cane as though eager to use it spare your insults and your cane mr allison our relative positions have been utterly reversed in the last fortyeight hours at this moment there is a clamor for your downfall in the throats of three hundred thousand toilworn honest laboring men between their victim and their vengeance no state no municipal authority will interpose a hand last night false to your promises to the brotherhood of trainmen you sent strong bodies of armed men to terrorize the few strikers gathered in the effort to establish their just claims you broke their blockade ran your trains in and out and indulged in insolent triumph before the people in the morning press at this moment within easy range of your palatial home ten thousand determined men are assembled awaiting the word once launched upon their work not one stone of your railway buildings not a shingle on the roofs of your elevators not one brick in the walls of your homestead will be left to show where once they stood only my appeals only my urgent counsels have thus far restrained them what will be the consequences if you refuse to listen god alone can tell despite my personal wrongs i have come to you as mediator deprecating riots and destruction all the union asks of you all i implore you to do is to sign a written promise that until such time as this unhappy controversy be settled the railway company of which you are the virtual head will make no further attempt to move a single train allisons face was a sight to see purpling with wrath and amaze yet quivering with sense of the wild absurdity of the situation glancing from one to another portly mr waldo stood uneasily by he believed some escaped lunatic had invaded the lambert even wells who had known elmendorf for months seemed unprepared for the sublimity of this flight he turned away towards the window to let them settle it between them at last allison spoke with exaggerated calm and if i refuse this modest request what am i to expect as the consequence the immediate consequence will be the calling out at noon today of the brotherhood of railway trainmen and the brotherhood of locomotive engineers thus tying up every road in the country to be followed tomorrow by similar action on the part of the knights of labor involving every industry in the land and turning millions of idle men loose upon our streets what will stand between you your hoarded wealth and your cherished ones your lives and the wild vengeance of a long oppressed and starving populace i leave you to imagine and you actually expect me to believe this trash expect me to believe that the state of illinois will stand idly by and see the governor of illinois interrupted elmendorf has refused to interfere his heart beats in sympathy with that of his people he knows their wrongs he has dared to say that never by his call shall sabre or bayonet be used to intimidate the workingman in the effort to secure his rights the blood of the martyred men you hanged eight years ago as anarchists cries aloud for vengeance and the day of the people has come at last they govern the governor they are the legislature of illinois and when they rise no power on earth can save you but wells could stand it no longer he was fuming at the great window overlooking the street and now burst impetuously into speech no power on earth you absurd lunatic do you mean that because this state has a crank like you temporarily at the top theres nothing beyond or behind it to save us from pillage and murder and anarchy listen to that you foreignborn fraud and far up the street the morning air was ringing with shouts of acclaim listen to that theres some american music for you you halfwitted stallfed socialist for loud and clear a trumpetcall echoed down the thoroughfare look at that he cried throwing aside the lower shutters look at that you madbrained moonblinded dreamer and there covering the space almost from curb to curb a squadron of regular cavalry came sweeping down the avenue the guidons fluttering over the uniforms of dusty blue the drab campaign hats shading the stern soldierly faces the grim cartridgebelts bulging with copper and lead the ugly little brown barkers of carbines and revolvers peeping from their holsters troop after troop they swung steadily by the guns of a light battery following close at their heels no power on earth persisted the incensed man of books you stuffed owl go back to your mobs and murderers and when youve told them what youve seen keep going until you get back out of this to the country where such as you belong if there is one on earth thatll own you and tell them the united states is a government a nation by the eternal and dont you dare forget it again and stupefied thunderstruck elmendorf turned and fled but this is invasion this is treason he gasped as he bolted madly from the room illustration illustration chapter xiv and these were but the advanced guard of the little army of regulars that welcomed with glad acclaim by every lawabiding orderloving citizen came pouring into chicago all through that day and for some days that followed their very presence bringing assurance of peace and safety to thousands and thousands of anxious householders and confusion and dismay to the leaders of the mob believing as had these latter that despite the vast and valuable federal properties in the heart of the city despite the fact that some of the railways involved were at that very moment under the wing of the federal courts despite the laws of the general government affecting the working and management of every one of over a dozen great trunk lines centring in chicago uncle sam would be ass enough to confide them all to the care of state authorities notoriously dependent upon the masses and that he would not venture to protect his property sustain his courts enforce his laws demand and command respect and subordination or even venture upon his own except at the invitation and permission of a hesitant state government there had been little short of triumph and exultation in the camp of the american railway union until this fatal july morning now their wrath was frantic and elmendorf was madder than ever the general and his staff reappeared in the midst of the concentration their coming was announced after vainly haranguing the stolid officials at headquarters upon the enormity of their conduct in declining to see the fearful blunder made by their president and commanderinchief after attempting to harangue a battalion of dusty infantry in the vague hope that inspired by his eloquence they might do something the enlisted men of the united states never yet have done no matter what the temptation revolt against their government and join the army of the new revolution and being induced to desist only when summarily told to go on out of that or while a bayonet supplied the ellipsis poor elmendorf flew to the station to be the first to meet the general on his return and to open his eyes to a proper conception of law order and soldierly duty even here those minions from headquarters were ahead of him three or four officers were already on the spot awaiting their chief and elmendorf felt convinced that they had come solely to prevent his getting the ear of the commander even as they waited and a curious crowd began to gather numbers of strike sympathizers among them down the broad steps from the street above came the tramp tramp of martial feet and in solid column of fours in full marching order every man a walking arsenal of ball cartridges a battalion of infantry filed sturdily into the grimy trainshed formed line facing the murmuring crowd and then stood there in composed silence at ease then the little knot of staffofficers and newspaper men was presently joined by lieutenantcolonel kenyon commanding the th infantry one battalion of which had just taken position as indicated and to him came others officers of the battalion again did elmendorf raise his voice in appeal for the rights of his fellowmen colonel kenyon he declaimed his shrill tones distinctly audible above the hoarse murmur of voices in the rapidly augmenting throng you have been so considerate as to listen to a humble outsider before this and to express appreciation of some at least of the views i have felt constrained to express you are as i understand the commanding officer of the regiment that has just arrived in this city you are an officer sworn to maintain the constitution of the united states and is not your very presence here you and your men in glaring violation of that constitution here the few officers who had joined their commander all strangers to elmendorf turned upon him in astonishment the newspaper men chuckled and nudged each other companionably some of the staff turned away plainly indicating that they had already had to listen to too much of that sort of thing kenyon looked him curiously over mr elmendorf do you ask that question in your sober senses or only as a jocular reminder those identical words were addressed to me by an irate gentleman in virginia in so far from being irritated old kenyon seemed to find amusement in drawing his interlocutor out ah but my dear sir there the whole state the whole south was in armed rebellion against the federal government here is neither insurrection nor rebellion here honest lawabiding patriotic men as loyal to the union of states as ever you could be are exerting their prerogative as men their rights as citizens to obtain justice for themselves and their brethren at the hands of a defiant and oppressive monopoly they have done no wrong violated no law and yet here you come with bayonets and ball cartridges to intimidate if not to shoot down in cold blood husbands and fathers and peaceable citizens who are only pleading for justice at the hands of their employers some mistake here mr elmendorf your leaders have already declared it a rebellion the husbands and fathers we are here to look after are the amiable parties who stove in our carwindows and soaped our rails and let drive such pygmy projectiles as couplingpins a wild switch engine or two and blazing freightcars at us as we came in awhile ago our people are in no wise connected with that cried elmendorf all this alleged violence is the work of lawless classes whom we cannot control or of the emissaries of the railways themselves it has been grossly and purposely exaggerated oh then all this rioting is done by outsiders not by your friends the strikers who heartily condemn the whole business do they most assuredly we have forbidden violence in any and every form i see and yet the rabble and the railway folks have insisted on it well now how grateful you ought to be to the president for ordering us here to help you suppress them really mr elmendorf i am glad to find we are on the same side of this question after all but here a shout of laughter drowned kenyons words and drove elmendorf frantic you dont understand he almost shrieked it is our people who are intimidated beaten back in the moment of victory and then some of the crowd now thronging the open space in front of the battalion began to cheer a man pushed through handed kenyon a telegram and whispered a few words in his ear kenyon glanced quickly around upon the multitude now surging close about the group and stepped back a few paces to read his despatch elmendorf followed eager to resume his harangue kenyon uplifted his hand pardon me now mr elmendorf i have business to attend to but elmendorf was wild with excitement and wrath he had been laughed at he the mover of millions here were already a thousand fellowcitizens at his back and more coming from the freightyards up and down the tracks from the docks the elevators the neighboring saloons they were swarming to the scene there in double rank stood the four compact little companies of regulars in the businesslike rig of blue and brown resting on their arms chatting in low tones or calmly surveying from under the broad hatbrims the gathering crowd to their right and left up and down the long vista of trainsheds letting themselves down from overarching bridges or pushing boldly past the feeble railway police hundreds of toughlooking citizens were slowly closing in back of the battalion separated from it by only two tracks were long files of passenger and pullman cars behind which and on whose platforms in knots of half a dozen other men were gathering it was the general superintendent of the road who had spoken to kenyon and was now exchanging a few words with the chief quartermaster of the department dozens in the crowd pushed forward instantly newspaper men as a matter of business others from curiosity as kenyon opened his despatch a burly grayhaired major was quickly at his side and a tall young subaltern the adjutant of the regiment one brief glance over the paper and the commander turned to his right clear the station was all he said major cross touched his hat an eager light shooting across his frank soldierly face and strode quickly back to the line a mere gesture brought the four company commanders to him not a dozen words were spoken but in an instant the swords of the officers leaped from their scabbards and then obeying some lowtoned commands the right and left flank companies simply lifting their riflebutts enough to clear the ground changed front to right and left respectively thus bringing them facing the outer ends of the trainsheds about a dozen men led by a sergeant broke suddenly away from the eastward flank of each of the two companies thus moved and without so much as an audible word scattered away to the passengercars covering a hundred yards of their length in a dozen seconds then under the cars dove some of the lot up the steps sprang others and away before them scattered the intruders a long brick wall hemmed the yards in at the eastern side and there dividing into two parties in the same prompt businesslike way the squads drove before them north or south every one of the late lookerson some grinning some scowling and swearing some remonstrating but all going up from the throats of the dense throng in front of the battalion went a chorus of jeers and laughter it is always fun to one part of a street crowd to see some other part of it especially if it occupied a better point of view driven from its enviable ground the moment the space behind their new alignment was thus cleared the flank companies each threw forward another squad of eight which promptly shaking itself out into a long thin rank and fixing bayonet as it went marched straight at the thin crowds which had entered the station along the right of way a solid platoon followed in support and in less time than it takes to tell it the populace was on the move then came the turn of the centre companies and here a very different problem presented itself leading up to the street was one broad stairway in the middle of the great depot building and one somewhat narrower a hundred feet farther north next to the baggagerooms between the tracks and the offices on this floor enclosing a space perhaps a hundred yards in length by ten in breadth was a high iron fence pierced here and there with little turnstile gates now closed and by three or four rolling gates the main or centre one of which stood open this was directly opposite the broad stairway it was this through which the battalion had marched the newspaper men and officials had followed and the crowd had speedily bulged no good would result from shoving back this protruding swarm of curious or combative citizens for the space behind the bars was packed solid the crowd began to grin and exchange jocular remarks it would take a long time to squeeze them back through the stairway and meanwhile they could have lots of fun and elmendorf a chance for a speech so they began to shout for him he was still squeaking and gesticulating about the knot of newspaper men and staffofficers but kenyon climbing on a baggagetruck was calmly looking over the sea of upturned and often leeringly impudent faces beyond the grating then he called major cross to his side and together they looked it over the crowd began to wax facetious they knew the soldiers wouldnt shoot so long as they were not shooting they knew they wouldnt prod with their bayonets men who manifestly couldnt get back they thought they had the regulars in fine where they couldnt do a blessed thing unless the police would come and pull the crowd out from behind and the police were not interfering with the populace just then an american street crowd is gifted with a fine sense of humor and the sight of these two veteran officers perched on a baggagetruck and reconnoitring their ground was full of suggestion dont jump on us major we couldnt stand them feet shouted one jovial tough a speech from oldmanafraidofhisdignity sang out a second the gang guffawed and the officers went on with their conference utterly unmoved deaf apparently to the salutations then kenyon climbed down and said a word to the superintendent who nodded appreciatively the adjutant went one way the regimental quartermaster the other each took half a dozen men from the supporting platoons of the flank companies who had by this time pushed the scattering throng beyond the yard limits and set their guards at the entrances then the grayheaded whitemoustached major whipped out his watch and held up his hand there was a good deal of chaff going on but a halfsilence fell on the throng illustration all that space in there will be needed in five minutes from this time all that space in there will be needed in five minutes from this time he said in a quiet conversational tone the way out is open and you will oblige me very much by quietly withdrawing begin the move back there by the main staircase and up there also if you please so that these gentlemen who are crowded in here can follow you move at once and youll be out in plenty of time not a few on the outskirts did begin subordinately to move away and a dozen or more were already going up the steps when the crowd gave tongue come back there stay where you are weve got as much right here as they have were the cries and then the luckless elmendorf was seized with an inspiration bounding upon a baggagetruck he waved his hat and shouted hear me fellowcitizens you have said right we have indeed more right here than these but here a muscular hand grasped him by the seat of his trousers and elmendorfs speech wound up in a shriek as he was lifted backward off the truck a big irish sergeant glowering at him as he landed him on terra firma i yield to force screamed elmendorf go and tell it and then between a couple of brawny unsympathetic soldiers he was rushed back and in the twinkling of an eye hustled into the smokingcompartment of a vacant pullman and there locked in with a bayonet at the window for a moment the throng howled but there was no forward impulse the motionless line of the two centre companies seemed to have a soothing effect and still the major coolly stood there watch in hand two minutes passed three and not ten men of the crowd had slipped away certain railway men and reporters edged forward away from the crowd certain of the crowd strove to follow but some men in plain clothing whipped open their coats displaying silver stars and warned them back three minutes and a half and still the major stood calmly glancing over the crowd and then at his watch and then the corners of his mouth began to twitch for he had cast one quick glance up and down the line of that iron fence unreeling something behind them as they reappeared the squads that had followed the regimental staff officers quickly trotted into sight again at the upper and lower ends of the pen and the outskirts of the crowd caught on at a glance they were manning the hose already the gleaming nozzles were being screwed on and the humor of the situation became suddenly clouded watch out was the cry from both ends of the dense mass dozens of men at the north end who could readily escape were already in rush for the upper stairway but those at the south were less lucky a dense mass of fellowcitizens was wedged between them and the exits but rapidly the alarm was spreading inward from the flanks four minutes said the major grimly though his lips were twitching like mad then the upturned faces began to blanch the crowd to heave and swell and a backward sway sent a hundred or more surging up the main staircase the next minute panic seemed to seize on all for the jeers gave way to shouts of fright and pain as men were squeezed breathless in the crush and then tumbling over one anothers heels climbing one anothers backs in sheeplike terror they fought for air and escape and the last coattails went streaming up the stairs sharp on time as kenyon said with the bayonets of the left centre company threateningly close in their wake once out in the open street they strove to rally and encourage one another and to shower defiance and stones at their assailants but these latter contented themselves with clearing a space for carriages about the doors and calmly stationing their guards to hold it and when a few moments later the generals special train came steaming in elmendorf raged in vain there was neither orator nor deputation to meet him on behalf of the strikeleaders not until after the chief had driven away in his carriage was the agitator released from the hated confines of the pullman and bidden to go his way fuming with the indignity of his position he left vowing that he would return if there was law in the land backed with warrants for the arrest of kenyon for felonious assault and false imprisonment and kenyon smiled and said the warrant wouldnt surprise him in the least and then followed the stirring scenes of a riot week that showed not only the depth and extent of the insurrectionary spirit among the unlettered masses of the people but also the wisdom of the president in ordering the prompt concentration of regular troops in the heart of the threatened city silently in disciplined order the various detachments had marched to their stations silently in disciplined order puny in points of numbers as compared with the vast mob of their howling antagonists they faced the throng grimly peering from under their slouched hatbrims gripping with their brown sinewy hands the muzzles of the old trusty rifles listening with utter amaze with tingling nerves to the furious yells of down with the government to hell with the united states and wondering how long their fathers would have stood such treason thirty years ago calm grim and silent conscious of their power merciful in their strength superb in their disdain of insult their contempt of danger their indifference to absolute outrage for maddened men showered the ranks with mud and gravel and foulmouthed slatternly women vile unclean harpies of the slums dipped their brooms in the reeking gutters and slashed their filth into the stern soldierly faces for hours for days they coolly held that misguided drinkcrazed demagogueexcited mob at bay reopening railways protecting trains escorting federal officials forcing passage after passage through the turbulent districts until the fury of the populace wore itself out against the rock of their iron discipline and one after another the last of the rioters slunk to their holes unharmed by even one avenging shot fire and flame had wrought their havoc miles of railway lines and cars had been wrecked and ruined but otherwise the madbrained effort had utterly failed of its purpose and for the third time had the regulars stood almost the sole bulwark between the great city and absolute anarchy true the regiments of the national guard were at last ordered into service but not until after the presence of the federal force had given assurance that whether the state officials liked it or not the general government would tolerate such insurrection no longer true the state troops stood ready eager to do their work and some of them at least so capable so drilled and disciplined that left to the orders of their own officers they could and would have suppressed the riots but there was the difference even when called into action the most reliable and experienced of the regimental commanders were practically deprived of their commands their regiments were broken up into pygmy detachments and scattered hither and thither by companies and squads covering sometimes a tract of suburbs fifteen miles long and half as wide while the entire force was placed under the orders of a city official notoriously in sympathy with the initial strike and seeking the suffrages of the very class from which the mobs were drawn the extraordinary spectacle was seen of a veteran colonel with only half a company to guard the headquarters of the regiment in a remote and dangerous spot and absolutely forbidden to summon any of his own regiment to his defence in case of emergency except upon the advice and consent of some official of the city police well was it for chicago and the nation that the president of the united states stood as unmoved by the puerile protests of the demagogue in office as were his loyal soldiery by the fury of insult abuse and violence heaped upon them by that mob of demagoguesupporters by heaven said the editor of a great daily to old kenyon at the close of the week i never dreamed of such superb discipline and under such foul insult i swear i dont see how you fellows could stand it oh said kenyon grimly it wasnt half as hard to bear as what your columns have been saying about us any time these last five years illustration illustration chapter xv when the president of the united states declined to withdraw the regulars from chicago as urged by the governor of illinois mr elmendorf decided that it was because he had not been heard from on the subject and so started for washington this was how it happened that he abandoned his project of leading his friends and fellowcitizens in their determined assault upon the serried ranks of capital backed though they were by the bristling bayonets of a usurper for several days his deluded disciples looked for him in vain the telegraphic despatches of the associated press told briefly of another crank demanding audience at the white house claiming to represent the people of chicago and persisting in his demand until yielding to force he was finally ejected but elmendorf was silent upon this episode when he returned so the story could hardly have referred to him calling at allisons to attend to the longdeferred duty of packing his trunk he was informed by the butler that that labor had been spared him and that he would find all his things at his former lodgingplace mrs wallens going thither to claim them he was met at the threshold by mart whose face was gaunt and white and worn and who no sooner caught sight of the once revered features of the wouldbe labor leader than he fell upon them with his fists and fragmentary malediction mart battered and thumped while elmendorf backed and protested it was a policeman one of that body whom ever since elmendorf had loved to designate as bloodhounds of the rich mans laws who lifted mart off his prostrate victim and mrs mcgrath who partially raised the victim to his feet no sooner however had she recognized him than she loosed her hold flopped him back into the gutter and addressing the policeman bade him fur the love of hivvin set him on again which the policeman declined to do despite mrs mcgraths magnificent and descriptive denunciation addressed to the entire neighborhood in which elmendorfs personal character and professional career came in for glowing and not altogether inaccurate portrayal slowly the dishevelled scholar found his legs mart making one more effort to break away from the grasp of the law and renew the attack before he was led to the stationhouse where however he had not long to languish before a major of cavalry rode up and bailed him out but by that time and without his luggage the victim of his wrath had disappeared theres three weeks board agin it said mrs mcgrath and the ould lady not buried three days and the young lady sick and cryin her purty eyes out and divil a cint or sup in the house for marts wife and babies barrin what me and mac could spare em och thats only wan of fiveandtwinty families that furrin loonattic has ruined at the camp of his squadron major cranston had been informed by his veteran mcgrath of the reappearance of elmendorf and of the arrest of mart for spoiling his beauty mac also told something of the straits to which marts family were reduced mrs mac had known mrs mart in the days when as a blooming schoolgirl the latter used to trip by the cranston homestead and had striven to aid her through the failing fortunes of the months preceding marts last strike it was her voluble account of the state of affairs that prompted this softhearted squadron commander to take mart by the hand and bid him tell his troubles mart broke down hed been a fool and a dupe he knew and realized it but elmendorf had so preached about his higher destiny and the absolute certainty of triumph and victory if they but made one grand concerted effort that he had staked all on the result and lost it he knew it was all up with the strikers when once the general government said stop and so had gone home to be greeted by the tidings that his mother was sick unto death jenny was there calm brave silent full of resource but oh so pale and wan she had employed the best physician to be had but she alone would be nurse she never reproached never chided him for his long absence when most needed then had followed a few days of sorrow and suspense and then the gentle harmless helpless purposeless life fluttered away jenny paid all the bills the doctor the undertaker everything and mart tried vainly to get some work but he was a marked man then the day after jenny had settled up everything and made herself some simple mourning garb she went to resume her duties at the library and came back in a little while white and ill and she had been very ill since out of her head at times he believed said mart and he had gone and got the doctor whom she had employed for her mother a kind fellow who had been unremitting in his attentions and who told him bluntly to shut up when he talked about not knowing where the money was to come from to pay him and said that that little woman was worth ten times her weight in gold which said mart was gods truth as he himself ought to have had sense enough to know before little by little as they walked homeward together cranstons orderly riding with the horses along the street and dozens of people turning curiously to gaze at the cavalry officer and the late striker it began to dawn upon cranston that marts sister who was worth so much more than her weight in gold was the very miss wallen who had been so oddly unwilling to write at his dictation the letter to elmendorf arrived at the house he was sure of it for there with solemn face was mr wells my wife said he is upstairs trying to see what she can do this is martin wallen is it well martin i regret exceedingly to hear you assaulted mr elmendorf today and didnt kill him manifestly mr wells was not a proper person for the position he held being far too impulsive in speech for a bookish man but then wells had been sorely tried he told cranston something of it as they walked away together after loading mart with provisions and fruit at the corner grocery together they stopped to see dr francis and have a brief chat with him about his patient and then cranston mounted and rode thoughtfully back to camp at the lake front captain davies with his troop had just returned from a long days dusty dirty exasperating duty at the stockyards and no sooner had he made his brief report than the major queried do you happen to know whether forrest is back with his regiment he was commanding his company at the yards today sir i heard he returned four days ago hm said the major reflectively i think ill stroll over tonight and find kenyon they were both sons of chicago these two field officers and had always been close friends forrest however was a new yorker many years their junior in the service cranston had liked him well yet now he felt that he should be glad to consult kenyon who had known him still longer for that which he had heard from wells as they walked to the doctors filled him with vague anxiety in common with most society people cranston shared the belief that if not actually engaged to florence allison forrest certainly would be as soon as old allisons objections were removed but in speaking of the probable cause of miss wallens illness wells had used some vehement language plainly the librarian told cranston of the stormy interview between allison and himself in which in presence of mr waldo and that man elmendorf allison had demanded her discharge plainly he told him his own views of miss wallens character and conduct and what his wife thought of her that she was a girl to be honored and admired and respected above her kind but said he mr forrest always treated her as though he thought so too and it may be that she learned to care for him before she had heard about his being a suitor for the hand of miss allison i sent the girl who was temporarily occupying her place back into the library when we had our talk said wells but i reckon she didnt go beyond the passageway and heard pretty much the whole thing allison bellowed like the bull he is and perhaps i did too still it hadnt occurred to me to question her on the subject though i was minded to tell her if she had heard anything she was on no account to repeat it or any part of it but miss wallen came back to her desk sooner than i expected and the moment this young minx hesitatingly told me she had been here and had gone home i suspected something and presently pumped the whole truth out of her the contemptible meanness of some women passes all my descriptive powers there are several girls employed in the library and it seems some of them were jealous of miss wallen or rather of her superior position and one evening that fellow elmendorf got in there and threatened her with exposure or something of the kind and insulted her so that she slapped his face and two of those library girls heard it it happened just before forrest came in and he found her all quivering and unstrung she was to have finished some work for him that evening and he was to have dined at allisons but she was so broken up it was some time before she could go on with it neither could she tell him the cause well it was one of these very girls whom all unthinkingly i had put in her place and what does the little wretch do the morning that jeannette returned but tell her all about allisons row with me and his demand and reasons for her discharge of course she didnt tell of my refusal she says she didnt happen to hear that which is a lie i reckon however thats the big big last pound that broke the heart of that poor hardworking longsuffering girl and sent her home a sick woman francis says shell pull through but what do you suppose will come of it even then wells told him more about poor jenny all the story of her long brave struggle so far as he knew it which was far less than the facts and cranston wished with all his heart that meg his own bonny wife were home to help and counsel all the same he meant to see kenyon and later perhaps forrest but he saw the latter first there was a brilliant gathering at the club that night matters had so quieted down in the disturbed districts that many of the regular officers had been permitted to accept invitations to be present allison had not wished to go but florence begged she was looking absolutely saffron said aunt lawrence and if something wasnt done to break up that childs nervous melancholy she wouldnt be responsible for her that she herself was in the faintest degree responsible for the alleged nervous melancholy aunt lawrence would not have admitted for a moment allison was in evil humor as is many a better man when beginning to realize that he has made an ass of himself wells had been after him with a hot stick on discovering that the only authority for his accusations against miss wallen was that devils tool elmendorf and a creature of his own coaching allison knew moreover that forrest was back commanding a company of his regiment for his own associates were pouring into his ears their praises for forrests nerve and calm courage in facing with only twenty men a furious mob of nearly a thousand and rescuing some socalled scabs from their hands poor fellows who had been pulled from the platforms of the pq r trains hes way down below the stockyards anyhow and wont be there tonight said allison to himself so at ten oclock with florence on his arm he entered the brilliantly lighted parlor it was full of wellgowned women and of men in the appropriate garb of the hour and occasion while not a few of the officers were in uniform the general and some of his staff were almost the first to greet them presently mr sloan joined the party and the first thing he did was to begin telling of forrests prediction as to the attitude of the general government in the event of trouble allison shifted uncomfortably the general and his aides looked politely interested and somebody attempted to make some arch remark for miss allisons ears but she was plainly nervous and ill at ease the chief presently presumed miss florence had heard how admirably forrest had behaved in the rescue of certain railway men from the mob the previous day and florence owned that she had heard nothing at all it was the first intimation she had that forrest was there whereat the three officers looked astonished and embarrassed evidently something was amiss there had perhaps been a quarrel oh said captain morris in prompt explanation forrest was away down in the depths of oklahoma when he heard his regiment was ordered here and he had to wait for telegraphic authority to come on he never even got up into town his company was at grand crossing and he joined it there he hasnt been north of the stockyards since but allison got away as quickly as possible this sort of thing wasnt helping flo to forget and presently flo herself concluded shed rather go home and just at eleven oclock they came forth to their carriage three officers in full uniform were directly in front chatting with two others in rough campaign rig and the taller slenderer of these latter a soldierly browneyed fellow with a heavy moustache and a weekold brown stubble on cheeks and chin stepped quickly forward and whipped off his drab slouch hat for the first time in her life florence allison saw her friend the lieutenant in service dress and knew not what to say all the response to his cordial goodevening miss allison how are you mr allison was the hurried hustling past of the pair the girl with averted head the father reddening and embarrassed florence was bundled quickly into the carriage and then allison turned youll have to excuse my daughter tonight mr forrest she isnt well and er er ill hope to see you tomorrow and lifting his hat he followed florence the door was slammed and away they went leaving forrest gazing after them in no pleasant frame of mind major cranston touched his arm come over to my tent forrest i can explain something of this he said and the next morning after some sleepless hours with permission from colonel kenyon to be absent from camp until noon mr forrest took a cab and drove far up town making only one stop at a florists on the way the allison carriage was coming forth just as he reached the wellknown gates mrs lawrence and florence seated therein did not catch sight of the occupant of the cab until he raised his hat florence gasped grabbed aunt lawrence by the arm called to their coachman and glanced back but no mr forrest had no thought of stopping there at all the cab drove straight on past the allison homestead and something told her whither it was bound illustration chapter xvi mr allison did not meet lieutenant forrest that day as he had hoped to he did not hope to at all he hoped not to for several days and a very uncomfortable man he was forrest however seemed making no effort to find him as the millionaire rather expected him to do forrests duties were somewhat confining and allison even kept away from his pet club awhile dreading to meet with officers who were being entertained there at all hours the lambert was another place that for a while he religiously avoided he was becoming afraid of wells it gave him a queer feeling however when driving home to luncheon one day to see an orderly holding two officers horses opposite the private entrance and cranston and forrest in conversation with mr wells they were absorbed and did not look up but something told allison there was trouble ahead for him even his friend waldo had been embarrassed and constrained in his presence he made up his mind to stop and see wells that very afternoon and did so bursting in in his fine old english manner after fidgeting a few moments until wells had had his stenographer acting withdraw he impetuously began hum haw wells tell me about that girl hows she getting on if by that girl allison you mean miss wallen shes not getting on at all a lady who is robbed of her mother her health her good name and threatened with the loss of her means of livelihood at one fell swoop cannot be expected to get on mr wells i dont like the tone which you assume towards me mr allison i shouldnt like it if you did for one moment allison stared at the librarian and wells glared unflinchingly back the magnate was mad in earnest now by god mr wells youre the only man in this city who dares treat me with disrespect and i wont have it by gad mr allison its because im probably the only one who thoroughly knows you wait till i tell all about your demands regarding miss wallen and youll find others in plenty you cant without looking elsewhere for a position i can for the position is looking for me and the only reason i havent accepted it is that i mean to stay right here until full justice has been done my stenographer full justice sir if that young lady were to place this case in the hands of even a tolerable lawyer yours wouldnt have a leg to stand on you dont mean shes going to law its what my wife says would serve you right and i agree with her just let this community know that solely on the statements of a cur you kicked out of your own employ you had defamed that brave honest girl and thered be a tempest about your head compared to which this riot was a zephyr allisons wrath was cooling now he sank back in a chair and stared gloomily at the librarian where is that gulp elmendorf he finally asked in jail i hope in the gutter the last time i heard of him being pommelled by her brother major cranston and mr forrest are looking for him what do they want asked allison suspiciously several things one is to find out how much he will admit having told you and how much to hold you solely responsible for allison fidgeted for a moment and then turned again upon the librarian you mean to tell me that you think shes entirely good and honest and all that do you no i told you i knew she was well then what does it mean that forrest is trying to hunt up or run down my witnesses it simply means that hes a gentleman who intends to defend the girl whose name you have coupled with his why dont he come to me he hasnt been near my house since he came back said allison in a tone of complaint he hasnt given me a chance to fix things who was fool enough to tell him you principally by your reception of him he knew all about it before he came here to me of course he hasnt been to your house and probably never will go there again i wouldnt in his place allison pondered painfully awhile well i suppose this thing is beginning to get around the neighborhood people are talking about it he queried guardedly beginning was the answer lord no it began the day you shouted the whole business so that everybody in the library could hear of course people are talking but not as loud as you did and you say shes down sick and cant see people of course if ive been made a victim of in this matter by that fellow elmendorf why damn him hes been trying to make up to my own daughter she had to order him out of the house of course i want to straighten things out i withdraw my demand for her discharge under the circumstances and if i might send her a check or something in reason you might if you wanted to see how quick it would come back why hang it wells what should a man do what can a man do sit down and write her that you have made a consummate ass of yourself that might not be a delicate way out of it but it would be telling the truth anyhow youve got to do something and that right soon my wife tells me that her one idea is to get well enough to come over here for one day just to confront her accusers then wherell you be and your invaluable witnesses allison went home and had a conference with his sister which left that lady dissolved in tears it was a brutally hot july afternoon and he ordered the carriage for a drive in the park and bade florence drive with him and obediently she went there wasnt a whiff of breeze off the lake it all came pouring from the hot prairies to the southwest and everybody looked languid and depressed the sun was almost down and the walks and roadways in the park were but sparsely occupied slowly the heavy family carriage rolled along the smooth macadam and drew up with others of its kind near a shaded kiosk where a band was playing presently from under her parasol florence caught sight of a familiar figure leaning against the door of an open livery carriage a tall man in straw hat and white duck suit was chatting with the occupants one a middleaged woman with a gentle motherly face the other a slender girl in deep mourning reclining languidly as though propped on cushions allison anxiously watching his daughter saw the light in her eyes the faint color rising in her cheeks and he too looked then reddened for all that other party seemed to face him at the instant the tall man in duck came promptly around and stood beside them bowing coldly to the father but raising his hat and holding out his hand to florence she took it her eyes not downcast but seeking his i am glad to see you out miss allison he said in frank and cordial tone you were looking far from yourself the night we met in front of the club i hope you are well i am better she answered rather faintly and i had hoped to see you before this that was why i went to the club that night he answered gravely how is cary oh hes just miserable because pa father kept him cooped up and wouldnt let him out to the riots he was simply mad when he heard of your experience with the mob but you are coming to see us she finished looking appealingly at her father yes forrest said allison i wish you would theres a matter i want to talk to you about possibly the same that mr elmendorf is to bring up at department headquarters tomorrow afternoon which i believe you will be invited to hear said forrest calmly then turning once more to florence he held forth his hand i am very glad to meet you again miss allison he said and to find you looking better but now i must return to my friends and bowing again to her but almost ignoring allison he walked away and was soon in earnest talk with the ladies in the open carriage do you know who they are asked florence presently of her father yes one is mrs wells wife of our librarian the other is a miss wallen one of the library employees she has been ill go on parks he said to his coachman and they drove silently home he came and talked with me said florence to her aunt that night he was polite and kind and didnt seem angry didnt say anything but he went he said he must go to his friends to his friends do you understand were no longer no longer of them then she turned and sought her own room and there was an invitation for mr allison a very pressing invitation for an aidedecamp delivered it personally a request that mr allison should be at headquarters the next afternoon at four oclock and allison went he was received by captain morris who expressed the generals regrets at being unable to see him in person and was ushered into a room where were colonel kenyon major cranston and lieutenant forrest still in service dress and two of the senior staffofficers these latter came forward and shook hands with the magnate the others simply bowed see if mr elmendorf is anywhere about said captain morris to a messenger but it was ten minutes before that intellectual party appeared the great strike had collapsed the leaders were under the indictment of the law and this particular agitators occupation like that of hundreds of his hapless dupes was gone nevertheless it pleased him to lurk about the neighborhood until fifteen minutes after the appointed time so that he might be the last to arrive and might thereby keep the socalled upper classes waiting the moment he arrived the chief of staff proceeded to business you set four oclock as the time you would appear to make your charges mr elmendorf and weve been waiting here a quarter of an hour affairs of greater importance sir occupied my time oh yes our janitor tells us that you have been communing with yourself over a glass of beer in the saloon across the way for the last hour gentlemen i received a letter from mr elmendorf yesterday morning which i will read sir having been informed that mr warren starkey a clerk in your employ has been discharged because of his having been accused of revealing to the press certain facts relative to the circumstances under which lieutenant forrest was twice ordered away from chicago this is to inform you that unless mr starkey is immediately reinstated i shall consider it my duty as an accredited correspondent of numerous newspapers of high repute to publish all the facts in the case as well known to me and to demand the dismissal of lieutenant forrest that you may know i speak by the card i purpose calling at your office at four pm tomorrow at which time if you see fit the gentleman and those he may claim as his friends can hear the grounds on which i base my demand let the laws which oppress the poor and friendless now apply to the proud and powerful max elmendorf now mr elmendorf mr starkey has been discharged and has not been reinstated well hear him first and then you very good sir though i seem to be alone in the lions den i shall not flinch from my duty even in the face of all this array that has been carefully selected from among mine enemies they are exactly as indicated by yourself coldly answered the colonel send in starkey and starkey came elmendorfs one weak victim among headquarters force and starkey was in a sorry plight he told his story ruefully i supposed this gentleman was all right i used to see him with the officers he was with them every day or two for hours then he made himself pleasant and sociable and used to get me to lunch or treat to drinks sometimes and seemed to know everything that was going on i didnt know anything whatever about mr forrests affairs except what he told me from time to time and i believed what he told perhaps i did let on i knew more he got me to drinking and god only knows how it all came about that reporter came to me and said that mr elmendorf had told him this and that and captain morris had told him more and then he got things up around the lambert and around forrests lodgings and asked me if twasnt so that forrest had been ordered off on account of things happening there well i suppose perhaps i did say that it was so but i never dreamed that hed make what he did of it and then when the chief clerk caught me drunk and accused me of the whole thing i broke down and owned up to everything and ive been a well ive just been that mans dupe the unhappy exclerk was withdrawn mr elmendorf cleared his throat in readiness to speak forrest with a smouldering fire in his eyes and with compressed lips sat gazing sternly at the extutor the others with faces indicative of various shades of contempt and indifference or indignation not unmingled with the curiosity which one feels in studying some uncommon type of animal or man silently awaited his remarks i will begin by saying that my suspicions in this case were aroused long months ago said elmendorf when the judgeadvocate of the department suavely spoke kindly spare us your suspicions mr elmendorf you promised facts and as time is short owing to your own delay we desire facts alone the facts said elmendorf nettled are that the gentleman in question while posing as a man of honor and a welcome guest in a most estimable family circle has long been secretly laying siege to the affections of a young and comparatively friendless girl with such success that their relations became the talk of the neighborhood i found that she had been seen at his lodgings after dark that they were frequently seen alone together as late as midnight and that they were often alone in the private rooms at the lambert these facts were so well known that when he was suddenly ordered to leave chicago last winter the explanation arrived at by common consent was that the general sent him off to his regiment to avert further scandal and that his second orders were for practically the same reason it is notorious that because of this affair the girl has been threatened with discharge from the position she holds and so i am here to say that since this poor clerk and this poor girl are made the sufferers and the only ones i as the ever ready representative of the people demand the prompt punishment of the real offender whom doubtless his class would shield nothing but my dislike of involving a poor workinggirl in further scandal and trouble has held me silent until now i see said the judgeadvocate reflectively and you have intimated that in order to spare her further publicity you would be willing to abandon your purpose provided provided mr forrest tender his immediate and unconditional resignation from the service and i be furnished written assurance that it will be accepted also admission that my statement as to the cause of his sudden orders to leave chicago was true the scene in the office that sultry afternoon was something to remember long days after cranston couldnt help thinking what a blessing it was that the breeze at last was blowing fresh from the lake and the white caps were bounding beyond the breakwater it was a group worthy of a painters brush elmendorfs sublime confidence in the criminality of his fellowman and the unassailable integrity of his own position kenyons attitude of close and appreciative study of this unique specimen cranstons twitching lips and clinching fists allisons almost apoplectic face at one moment contrasting oddly with the infinite consternation with which he contemplated his own probable connection with the plot the next the speaker was a monument of conceit and cheek might even be a lunatic but what what could be said of himself the chief of staff was fuming forrest was inwardly raging yet by a strong effort maintained as he had agreed utter silence leaving to his friends their own method of conducting the affair one officer alone seemed to be deriving entertainment from the situation the judgeadvocate had never had a professional treat to compare with it before committing ourselves to any promise mr elmendorf said he most blandly you will pardon me if i refer to what seems a trifle weak link in your chain of evidence you say the young lady was in the habit of visiting mr forrests lodgings how often have you seen her there i said she was seen there i did not keep watch on mr forrests lodgings no but how often was she seen there i am not prepared to state once is considered enough i venture to say how often did the witness tell you she was there mr allison asked the judgeadvocate turning to his consternation upon that gentleman allison went crimson in an instant well i paid so little attention it was all so frivolous he stammered yet he was the witness named by mr elmendorf i believe the only one and you had him come to your office and you questioned him there did you not i did yes but the impression passed away almost immediately the man wasnt worthy of confidence when you hear his story you may think otherwise said elmendorf with a contemptuous sneer i have heard said the judgeadvocate but well hear it again send starkeys friend in here he said to the messenger and presently in came a hangdog cornerloafer specimen of the shabbygenteel young man supremely impudent on his native heath but wofully ill at ease now this is your reputable witness mr elmendorf i protest against indignity to my witnesses or browbeating of any kind this is not a court and hes not on oath certainly not hes saved us all the trouble by telling the truth beforehand now you can tell us how you came to chase the young lady into that doorway said the judgeadvocate turning suddenly on the shrinking newcomer well sir id been drinking and i thought she was a girl i knew yes and when you caught her in the vestibule what happened nothin much she fought and the door flew open and here the shifting eyes wandered around until they rested on forrest this gentleman kicked me out i wouldnt a said anything about it only him there found me afterwards and he nodded at elmendorf didnt you declare to me youd seen the lady going in there with him didnt you see them together late at night up near her own home asked elmendorf excitedly well you took me up and showed em to me didnt you tell me you knew she often went to his rooms well you asked me if i hadnt seen her and i said no and then you asked if i didnt think it was moren likely and here starkeys friend faltered that will do said the judgeadvocate you both knew very well then and you know now that it is an apartmenthouse in which several families dwell some of them friends of the young lady in question you can go young man i merely introduced that party as a specimen of the evidence for the prosecution now mr elmendorf let me give you a specimen of the evidence for the defence colonel said he to the chief of staff would you mind saying in the presence of these gentlemen whether the faintest inkling of any such charge as this of mr elmendorfs against mr forrest had ever reached you not a whisper were mr forrests sudden orders in any way the result of any such rumor not in the least he was selected by the general to make certain confidential investigations regarding the encroachments of settlers boomers etc on the oklahoma tract it was necessary that the object should not be heralded beforehand by the press and so we had to keep it quiet there mr elmendorf admitting these as specimen bricks of the probable testimony we decline to reinstate the clerk or to attach the slightest importance to your allegations at the expense of mr forrest and i am constrained to say that your propensity for meddling has got you into a nasty mess so far as headquarters are concerned weve done with you now ill leave you to settle with the friends of the young lady here elmendorf made for the door im not to be assaulted and he began but allison blocked the way you lied to me and mine he cried you declared on your honor that gentlemen high in authority in this office told you the reasons you gave for mr forrests summary orders to quit chicago i demand now to know whether it was not that poor devil whom youve ruined here starkey answer me what good would it do whined elmendorf shrugging his shoulders would not my statement be promptly denied noblesse oblige sir the first business of these knights of the sword is to stand together and woe betide the knave who dare accuse one of them but if youll be guided by my advice mr allison youll look well to your own vine and figtree lest the despoiler but here allison hurled himself upon the fellow and grasped him by the throat you whelp he cried banging the luckless head against the doorpost before any one could interfere in an instant however the officers had seized him shaking the tutor loose madly sped the latter to the elevator but finding starkey and his crestfallen friend awaiting him there he turned and dashed down the stairway his exwitnesses after him for a moment there was silence in the office while allison recovered breath bowing coldly to him colonel kenyon with cranston and forrest turned to leave the room mr forrest said the magnate stepping hastily forward i am more rejoiced at your vindication than i can say of course i see ive been led into doing you an injustice and i hope youll permit me to make amends but forrest declined the outstretched hand and thrust his own within the breast of his uniform you have amends to make elsewhere mr allison he answered with lips that trembled despite his efforts at control and a wrong to right beside which mine is insignificant goodday sir and so they left him illustration illustration chapter xvii the regulars were gradually withdrawn from the garden city as oldtimers loved to call chicago and kenyon with his sturdy battalion was among the first to be restored to his own station the crusty veteran left the home of his boyhood to resume duty at his proper post and left with feelings somewhat mixed we never had more tempertrying work to do said he and there isnt a man in the whole regiment that wouldnt rather stand six months indianfighting than six hours mobbing in chicago its my own old home so ive got a right to speak the truth about it for years its newspapers with one exception have made it a point to sneer at vilify and hold up to public execration the officers of the regular army during the past four or five years the lampooning and lying have been redoubled and it is like heaping coals of fire on their heads that the very regiment they have abused the most was the most conspicuous in chicagos defence we had no picnic but the fifteenth simply had hell and repeat the meanest most trying most perilous duty from first to last those fellows were scattered in little detachments all over cook county and faced fifty times their weight in toughs and carried out their orders and stood all manner of foul abuse and never avenged it when if any one of those young captains or lieutenants commanding detachments had lost his temper and let drive the lightning sleeping in those brown springfields thered a been a cleaning out of the rabble that would have thinned the ranks of one political party in our blessed country at least oh were glad enough to get away and see the change of tone in the chicago press but it wont last and kenyons was by no means an exaggerated statement in the farspreading course of the great strike the regulars came in for many a hard knock from the mob and for not a few from the press at one point experienced railwayhands not mere ruffian rioters wrecked the track at a trestle in front of a coming troop train hurling the engine with its gallant guard of half a dozen artillerymen into the depths below crushing or drowning them like rats at another point when baffled in their efforts to overturn a sleepingcar in front of a patrol engine and dispersed by a dozen wellaimed shots the rioters impanelled their coroners jury and declared the redhanded participants innocent spectators and the officer and his men murderers at a third when a great railway centre was found in the hands of the strikers and the troops were ordered to clear the platform one surly specimen not only refused to budge but lavished on the captain commanding the foulest epithets in a blackguards vocabulary the crowd outnumbered the troops by twenty to one the faintest irresolution or hesitancy would have been fatal one whack with the sword knocked the fight out of the bully and while he was led off to be plastered in hospital the maddened rioters held their indignation meeting and not only they but high officials eager for their votes united in denouncing the officer to the president of the united states declaring the victim a model citizen sober and peaceable and the captain drunk foulmouthed and abusive the press of the neighborhood aided in spreading abroad the utterly false report of the affair with the usual result of the temporary humiliation and distress of the officer and his friends the inevitable official investigation and the prompt verdict the officer deserves commendation not condemnation one paper within five days of its original report announced that it had discovered that it was the civilian who was drunk and who used the foul language attributed to the officer it furthermore said that the officer had done just right but this was the single and phenomenal instance the other papers like elmendorf probably reasoned that if the officer wasnt the blackguard they had striven to make him appear he might as well have been these are specimens of experiences too well known to all concerned may the lord preserve us from any more riot duty said kenyon piously as they steamed away across the illinois prairies but he added ill bet ten dollars to ten cents the politicians will get us into more and worse another year yet even such scenes have their humorous side it was daniel oconnell i believe who defeated the female champion of billingsgate by calmly referring to her as the hypothenuse of a rightangled triangle which was something utterly beyond her powers of repartee it was he at all events who silenced another virago with the cutting response sure every one knows maam yere no better than a parallelogram and you keep a whole parallelopipedon concealed in your closet at home and it was one of the trimmest nattiest most punctilious of our captains who stood in front of the silent ranks listening in apparently absorbed attention to the furious tirade lavished on him by the spokeswoman of the mob a street drab of uncommon stature and powers of expression and command of expletive winding up a threeminute speech with the remark i could pick ye up and ate ye only the taste would turn me stomach you whitelivered bluebellied son of a scut the lady had to pause for breath and the soldier looked up from under his hatbrim and mildly remarked madam youre prejudiced whereat even some of her sympathizers forgot their rancor and roared with laughter and the idolatrous rank of his soldiery doubled up like so many blue pocketrules and the newspaper men chuckled with glee by tacit consent apparently the chicago papers were saying as little as possible against the regulars just then and many a bright fellow who owned that he hadnt known anything about them before except what he had read in his paper in the past found many a friend among them and many a cause for writing of them in a new and different vein cranstons old home was decorated in style the day the cavalry marched away mrs mac had the old guidons and a big flag swung out on the porch mac in his most immaculate uniform standing at the salute many an eye in the long dusty column danced at sight of the honest couple and one young fellow their graceless nephew now a recruit in captain daviess troop braced up in saddle and fixed his eyes fiercely on his fileleader and for fear of the stern avuncular injunction to kape yer eyes to the front there couldnt be induced to peep at aunt mollie as she swung a tattered guidon that had been carried by mac in the ranks of c troop many a year before captain davies himself rode out of column and held forth a cordial hand to the old sergeant as the last troop went clinking by well make a soldier of the boy sergeant as you tried to make of me when i joined said he and if he has half the stuff there was in his uncle itll be no trouble at all and so they went on up the avenue with hats and handkerchiefs waving adieu and cordial voices shouting approving words presently riding at ease now they filed along under the beautiful faзade of the lambert memorial and glancing up cranston saw at the broad bow window the familiar features of mr wells and caught his joyous hurrah by his side smiling and nodding and kerchiefwaving was his buxom helpmeet one arm thrown about a fragile palefaced girl in black off came cranstons broad campaign hat he bent low over the pommel of his saddle ay and looked back again with admiration in his eyes and a fervent thank god upon his lips there were decorations in plenty and enthusiastic demonstrations too from a wide portico crowded with prominent society people as the papers said when a few moments later the column swung by allisons impressive home but here the major merely raised his hat and neither bent nor bowed riot duty over for the time being mr forrest was recalled from the command of his company to a desk at headquarters and bidden to complete the maps and reports of his oklahoma work the maps he went at methodically enough but the report he hesitated over no said wells in response to his call and question miss wallen is not ready to resume work at the lambert and it is my belief she never will be then he looked keenly at the officers face and was gratified to see the deep shade of anxiety and distress with which it was instantly covered shell be well enough it isnt that he continued but the girl is proud and sensitive as any lady has a right to be and she hasnt forgiven allison oh yes he sent her a sort of apology five lines of somebody elses fault and ten pounds of fruit she gave the fruit to marts hopeful family and i think she gave allison the devil i didnt see her letter but the old man dropped in here the other day to ask when shed be back and incidentally remarked that she seemed to be rapidly recovering if fifty pounds of temper to the square inch was any indication how the mischief was i to know said he that hundreds of girls had to work in offices at night had to find their way home late at night and that much of their work was dictated to them during the day and had to be typed before early morning even if he didnt know by gad said wells bringing his fist down with resounding whack on his big desk its time he did know that this country isnt france and that these brave girls who are honorably earning their own bread and often as was the case with her supporting whole families are entitled to the respect yes by gad the reverence of every man with a grain of decency in him this is america by the eternal the one country on the face of the globe where an honest girl may go wheresoever her work may call her amen to that said forrest but do you mean that she will not return here not unless she can be induced to withdraw her resignation she comes to live under our roof tomorrow you know that good fellow cranston has given mart pay work her plan is to join forces with her old friend miss bonner and reopen her typewriter down town and i find she has a will of her own this too was something mr forrest became convinced of even had he not suspected it before though still sorrowing deeply over her mothers death jenny was able to receive some callers by the time the troops were going and very prettily she thanked her friend and customer as she was pleased to call him for the flowers sent so frequently during her illness despite the faint color with which she had welcomed him forrest could not but see how pale and fragile she looked and the slender white hand that he had watched so often flying over the clicking keys seemed very limp and listless now it only passively responded to the warmth of his clasp in fact it hardly could be said to respond at all she was reclining in an easychair a soft breeze playing through the open window rippled the shining little curls about her white temples and forrest drew his chair close to hers it was the first time they had been alone together since the night following his homecoming in the late spring the night of the luckless dinner at allisons the night in which leaving her to work alone at the lambert over his rough notes he had gone as she believed to spend the evening with his fiancйe the night when with almost frenzied fingers she worked to finish every word of his report that he might find it ready on his return and that she might find as she did her way home without him then had come the sudden cloud of her mothers serious illness of marts disappearance the gloom of the strike the crash of the riots the blow of her mothers death a grief the more pathetic because for several years mother and daughter seemed to have reversed their relative positions and the child had become the protector guardian and provider then the brutal wrong of allisons accusation told her with such wellsimulated sympathy and reluctance but with such exquisitely feminine stab in every sentence the collapse the struggle the suffering the halfreluctant convalescence and the sudden sunshine of that afternoon when he turned from the carriage of the girl to whom he was declared engaged let her drive away without another glance and stood there tall and stalwart and manly his soft brown eyes fastened on her face hers jenny wallens a penniless motherless homeless workinggirl mrs wells had hugged herself with delight all the way back and would have said no end of foolish things but for her patients prohibition even the prohibition had not kept her afterwards from telling jenny how forrest had refused his hand to mr allison refused once more to set foot within his doors and what what could that mean but the girl despite her womans heart had a clear brain and cool judgment holding herself in honesty independence and integrity the peer of any man she ever heard of brave proud and selfreliant she had schooled herself to study the difference between his social surroundings and her own wells had spoken of forrests proud and powerful kindred in the east of a mother and sister who held their heads far higher than ever could john allison who forty years before was but a trainboy peddling peanuts for a livelihood even in the wildly improbable event of her soldier knights learning to love her what madness it would be to expect his people to welcome her what madness to think of being his without that welcome even if through love for him they opened their arms to her what would they say to mart and his brood jennys sense of the humorous prevailed over her troubles at this juncture and made her laugh at the contemplation of that mental picture then she bristled again with honest pride mart was her own brother anyway her fathers son he had been a dear boy and she very fond of him in the old days he had married beneath him weakling as he was shed stand by mart and work for his wife and babies they would learn to love aunt jenny and she would forget she ever had cried for the moon or learned to love a soldier she didnt love him she wouldnt but here were boxes of exquisite cut flowers that had been coming in for a fortnight and here was the sender his chair close to hers and he bending still closer then he began to speak and his voice how utterly different it sounded now from that in which she heard him say goodby to florence allison she wasnt strong yet how could she control the throbbing of her heart and then the room seemed to begin a slow solemn waltz even when she closed her eyes and firmly shut her hands for his first words were i have a world of things to say and only this one blessed evening in which to speak i am ordered to my regiment at once coming home later that night mr wells found the partner of his joys and sorrows a tearful lonely wreck on the parlor sofa jenny had disappeared for all explanation mrs wells drew him by the coatsleeve into the room shut the door behind him precipitated herself upon her shoulder and sobbed she she shes refused him well i suppose she thought he belonged to miss allison no no it isnt that at all its pride its obstinacy i dont know what to call it he told her he told me there had never been such a thing as an engagement between miss allison and himself and that there probably never would or could have been i could see he was cut to the heart that he loves our brave jenny deeply truly and there isnt any quixotism about it but she why the girls just marble it was he who called me and stood there with such sadness and reproach in his eyes and told me what hed told her and begged that i should plead with her when he was gone but she only covered her face with the tears trickling down through her fingers and when he had to go she stood up like a little queen and said she thanked him and honored him and even assured him that there was no other man on earth she cared for but no no no was her one answer to his plea that she would be his wife she will not even let him write to her and wells comforted his wife as best he could but there was no comforting himself that was the first of august the hottest dryest ever known along the lake yet the dismal foghorn tooted day after day and night after night when not so much as a single tear could have been wrung from the ambient air it was all on account of the smokeclouds that obscured the sun and shut out the horizon weeks at a time for the whole northwest was one blaze of forest fires and wells grew crabbed and ill tempered at his desk and snapped at his new typewriter until between the smoke and the tears her eyelids smarted he delighted in bullying allison whenever he saw him the magnate had offered miss wallen a permanent position and a good salary in his own office and marvelled at her refusal she still occupied her pretty room at the wellses but solely on her own conditions that she should pay her board she reopened her typewriter in the big business block down town and seemed to gain health color and elasticity in her daily tramps to and fro business seemed to prosper now that the urgent need was over and jenny could have afforded a better gown than that she chose to wear but she didnt know how soon mart might lose his job again and as he never saved for the wife and babies she must needs save for them despite her prohibition two letters came from forrest she read them answered the first gently and with womanly dignity in every line but made no reply to the second frequently on her evening homeward walk she encountered miss allison riding or driving with some of the jeunesse dorйe of society hubbard was immensely attentive again with many prospects said his friends of landing a winner and as for florence it is due to her to say that she hid her woe most womanfully if ever woe existed indeed her lady friends took much comfort in saying that she certainly had lost no flesh over her affaire de coeur in fact quite the contrary and twice did jenny catch sight of elmendorf despite his promptitude in dodging around the corner he had become a fullfledged journalist now writing police reports for a daily and resounding leaders for a semioccasional but like cary his former pupil who was bent still on going to the point he had unlimited faith in the future so too have his fellow strikeleaders and with some show of reason not that their principles have been endorsed but that just as in the active participants in the great riots have been allowed to go practically unpunished the individual citizen who should heave a brick through the window of a crowded car set fire to a sleeper or slug a locomotive engineer at his post of duty would undoubtedly be sent to jail or the lunatic asylum if detected but when he conspires and combines with hundreds of others thereby a thousandfold increasing the danger and damage it becomes a delicate matter for officeholders to handle and so while the leaders are free to roam the land and preach sedition and rebellion the criminal and vagabond classes the ignorant and vicious and the great array of foreignborn foreignbred laborers eagerly await the next opportunity the real sufferers are the nativeborn or naturalized citizens who listening to the false promises of professional agitators have been egged on to riot and outlawry and have lost through them their situations their savings and in some cases even their little homes this and what one of our ablest generals aptly described as the affected sympathy of the men in office high or low for the men in the workshop the more affected the louder brought about and will bring about again these scenes of tumult riot and rage that but for the restraining hand of the regular army would result in anarchy weve had to step in between two fires many a time before said old kenyon and well have to do it many a time again any of you fellows who like that sort of thing may welcome this change of station but i dont and indeed marching orders had come the autumn shaking up was distributing regiments anew and once more kenyons battalions were striding through the chicago streets forrest after sixteen years of subaltern life wearing at last the new shoulderstraps of the captaincy cranston and his squadron still retained within supporting distance of the old homestead eagerly welcomed their comrades of the riot days and no sooner were they fairly settled down in the fine quarters at sheridan than the new captain was out of uniform and into civilian dress and speeding townward to see wells he said forrest lived with cranston a few days while getting his own quarters in readiness and was there to help the major welcome home his wife on her return from europe late in october going to town to see wells seemed to prove a bootless errand for he came back with gloom in his dark brown eyes very pathetic gloom mrs cranston called it and she who had early gone to town to call on mrs wells began going rather more frequently than ever the major had contemplated so interested was she in mrs wellss boarder i want to know her well enough to be able to talk to her she explained to her husband but cranston demurred possibly he knew from old experiences that one way not to influence a girl in favor of a friend was for margaret to set to work to try with the caution born of a quarter of a century of married bliss however he did not remind his better half of previous experiments he meekly suggested that as forrest was likely to remain on duty all winter within besieging distance it might be well to leave him and the lady to work out their own destiny but its so absurd wilbur said margaret he is deeply honestly utterly in love with her and shes worthy of every bit of it if im any judge of a girl and if she isnt careful shell drive him away or anger him with her refusals to hear him why she has refused even to see him mrs wells tells me and its nothing but stubborn pride evidently therefore these two dames had been putting their heads together and were now in the combination to force jenny to surrender yet jenny was right knew she was right and was to be moved neither by forrests pleadings nor by his friends reproaches there had been one long and painful interview between her and her lover soon after his return and then very gently but very firmly she had told him that the matter must end then and there she had asked him one question and only one in the course of that interview and he could not answer her mr forrest what welcome would your mother your sister extend to me a workinggirl forrest said he really hadnt consulted them he was seeking a wife for himself not for the family he said that once they knew her they would honor and love her as she deserved but that wouldnt do miss wallen had seen something of society leaders and had formed her own opinion as to the law of caste she had seen robertsons charming play too and had her own views as to the matrimonial joys in store for its heroine she had asked herself whether she would submit to being either tolerated or patronized by people who had wealth and position to be sure but not one whit more pride or principle nor for that matter refinement than she had down in the bottom of her brave heart was the craving of the woman to be loved for herself to be appreciated for her true worth but she believed that people in high position would not and could not accept one of her antecedents and connections and she would have no concealment whatever knowing me just as i am just as i have been knowing my brother and his people you know well yours could not welcome me and forrest knew even more divining one cause of jeannettes refusal he had told the whole story to his mother in the longest letter he had ever written and sorely he missed his typewriter in doing it and that letter proved a shock the forrests had built upon the story of his engagement to the beauty and heiress miss allison and had long been awaiting his announcement to write the glowing letters of welcome but here was a thunderbolt floyd had fallen in love with a workinggirl a shopgirl a nobody and actually wished his mother and sister to send gushing letters expressive of their approval and assurance of loving welcome it was preposterous they had expected a florence and were told to be content with a jenny it was absurd in floyd to point out that forty years ago miss allisons father was a peanutpeddler and miss wallens a professor forty years in this country made vast changes floyd was simply pelting them with some of his ridiculous theories about the common people their rights and wrongs lincoln not washington was floyds ideal of the good and great and grand type of the american and it had spoiled him all this was what was said to one another in excited household chat what was written was more diplomatic but quite to the purpose they could not endorse his choice and he could not assure his proud independent ladylove that they would he was awfully in love once before for years and got over it said floyds married sister and hell get over this but there were those nearest to captain forrest about that time who arrived at a widely different conclusion jenny wallen might have yielded could she have seen him and listened perhaps that was why she would not it was no longer starkeys friend who waylaid her on her homeward walks in the gloaming it was captain floyd forrest when he could get to town and she took long roundabout ways of reaching home and outmanoeuvred her soldier with her whole heart crying out against her pleading for him and home and love and protection she stilled it like the sturdy little aristocrat she was and would have none of him or his what can one do with a girl like that asked mrs cranston of her grizzled major one bleak november evening on her return from town she has told mrs wells that she is going to leave her roof and live with miss bonner away down on the south side and its all because forrest is received at the wellses and she is determined not to see him the major was hardhearted enough to say he believed that interference even on megs part would only make matters worse but the captain heard of the proposed move and then he placed in mrs wellss hands a brief note he was conquered now rather than see her leave the roof of such devoted friends he pledged himself to vex her no more neither there nor on her homeward way would he seek to speak with her again jenny yielding perhaps as much to the wellses pleading as to this remained what ever could be the outcome was now the question illustration illustration chapter xviii meantime the little blind god was working a combination of his own one stinging wintry evening when the wind was whistling from the northwest and a cold wave of most approved and vicious pattern had swooped down on chicago when the pavements were coated with ice and the populace with extra garments and the visible features of pedestrians were unbecomingly red a tall soldierlylooking man garbed in furs was patrolling an uptown street and keeping anxious watch across the way he had not promised not to look at her at all events and the thought of the fragile form he loved shivering possibly in that bitter blast had lured him from the lambert to within sight of the wellses doorway the yellow green of the wintry west was fading the lamps were flickering in the gale and the electric globes swinging at the corner threw black shifting shadows across the pavement the captain gazed wistfully up at a certain window across the way she was not yet home for all there was darkness then he peered along the sidewalk towards the avenue a social function of some kind was going on and a number of carriages were drawn up at the curb near a great stone house that faced the broader and more fashionable thoroughfare to the east or else were moving slowly up and down their coachmen thrashing vigorously with their arms to restore circulation in their numbed fingers forrest recognized the once familiar brougham of the allisons and conjectured that florence with her now desperately devoted hubbard was among the guests at the eastward end of the street all was light and bustle clattering hoofs and slamming carriagedoors all to the west was gloom and silence yet out of that darkness was he looking for the light the one light that could bring even momentary gladness to his eyes he knew that on certain evenings it was her habit to stop and see how marts little brood was faring and their new home was on a back street not four blocks distant she was later than usual this evening wondering why he tramped westward towards the corner he heard the swift hoofs of horses coming behind him and the smooth roll of carriagewheels he saw sudden commotion and excitement among some children issuing from a bakers shop at the corner and heard their shrill eager voices then the clang of gongs the louder thunder of galloping hoofs and the ponderous bounding bulk of a fireengine as it came tearing down the cross street like a rushing volcano it dashed southward leaving a trail of sparks and smoke and then there was sudden warning cry some of the children unmindful of anything except the engine had sprung upon the crossing to see it go by just as the carriage came spinning out from behind them the coachman shouted hauled at his reins and did his best but the little ones heard only the thunder in front and in an instant though almost sliding on their powerful haunches john allisons beautiful bays dashed through the frightened group yet not before the alert soldier with one spring landed in their midst brushing them aside and then with one shrieking little maid in his arms went down on the icy pavement in the midst of a tangle of lashing hoofs and struggling affrighted horses how he got out he could not say a giant policeman was tugging at his shoulder readyhanded men were at the horses heads and breathless he stood erect conscious of something wrong in one side but mainly anxious about the child she was picked up stunned and senseless and in the white glare of the electric lamp he recognized the features of mart wallens fouryear old kitty a sympathetic crowd had gathered a young man poked a silkhatted head from the carriagewindow and with a face nearly the color of the queen chrysanthemum in the lapel of his coat besought parks to hang on to his horses a surly voice in the crowd said damn your horses and you too if it hadnt been for this gentleman youd have killed a dozen of these kids forrests head was beginning to swim but he took the limp little burden on his left shoulder let me have her he said i know where to take her bring a doctor to mr wellss at once please and as he turned away he caught one glimpse of a fair anxious face peering out across mr hubbards elegantly draped shoulder and found that he could not raise his hand to his fur cap all right miss allison he smiled to her reassuringly drive on and then some one helped him in to wellss parlor and mrs wells came fluttering down all sympathy and welcome her deft womanly hands stripped off the cheap hood and coat of the little sufferer other friendly sympathetic souls came in to help and then feeling oddly faint and queer forrest quietly stole away closing the glazed hall door behind him he paused a moment in the vestibule finding himself face to face with a slender form at sight of which even then his heart gave one great bound instinctively one arm was outstretched in longing in greeting and then at sight of him the form recoiled and cold as the biting wind that swept his cheek he heard the brief sentence you have broken your word bowing his head conscious of rapidly increasing dizziness raging at the thought of breaking down before her yet smarting under the lash of her undeserved rebuke he pushed blindly by and went forth into the night the street was rocking like the steamer of the summer twice gone by as it pitched through the roaring forties he remembered trying to make his way back towards that corner where the horses went down there were friends there and that big policeman hed help the lamppost leaned over and tapped him hard on top of the head he tried to grapple it but the right arm would not answer then his feet shot out from under him on the icy pavement and the curb flew up and struck him a violent blow at the base of the skull ten minutes later as jeannette wallen was rejoicing over the returning consciousness of a sorely bumped but otherwise unharmed little maid and hugging that precious niece to her heart while the doctor administered a soothing draught and mrs wells was pulling off the pygmy shoes and stocking the servant admitted an abashed citizen who faltered at the parlor door and mumbled say doctor that genlmn that saved that little girl must a got badly hurt hes lyin out here down the street senseless that was all jeannette heard who caught little kate was a question the distracted aunt never asked until many a long day after nobody caught her until a dozen doors away under the gaslight in the midst of a little knot of neighbors a battered bleeding head was lifted from a rough coatsleeve and folded in the slender clasping arms of a kneeling girl was pillowed on the pure heart where the baby curls were nestling but a moment before fractured ribs and collarbones yield not unreadily to treatment even fractured skulls have been known to mend and in a week though dazed and bewildered captain forrest was convalescing cranston and other fellows from the fort were in frequent attendance the army surgeon from headquarters had been unflagging and colonel kenyon himself was at the railway station when the limited arrived from new york bringing a muchalarmed mother and sister who relieved if they did not entirely replace certain other nurses at the patients bedside upon their arrival after three days and nights of vigil miss wallen disappeared she betook herself to miss bonners refuge far down town and just what mrs forrest could have heard from the cranstons from her sons commanding officer and from the fluent lips of mrs wells the reader may best conjecture for it is a recorded fact that no sooner was her son out of all danger and well on the road to recovery than two ladies drove to the south side to seek this modest abode of workinggirls and to call in person on jeannette that afternoon came cary allison to visit his old friend the captain day after day had the boy been there to inquire and it was good to see his rejoicing in the mending of the stalwart patient and refreshing to hear his comments on affairs domestic flo and her spoons just made him sick he said and the idea of having a stoughton bottle like that for a brotherinlaw was disgusting why couldnt he have jumped out and lent a helping hand instead of sneaking inside the coach and crying at parks hubbards a muff i tell flo he belongs to the family the squash was named for and i call him squash too and so does pa though hes glad enough to rope him in to buying more stocks i notice it was plain that in carys eyes sister titania had found her bottom and was enamoured of an ass brotherlike he had made her wince many and many a time and now it was forrests turn say cap i do wish youd come around and cheer the governor up a bit hes been warped all out of shape since the strike and seems to feel all broke up over home matters too he wont stay there at all the last thing he did was to drive around to wallens and offer him a firstclass clerkship and now hes rowing with wells because he wont let on whats become of your typewriter his typewriter the girl he loved with all the strength of his being honored and revered and longed to make his wife and the world could speak of her in that loose pragmatical possessive chattellike way his typewriter no more his than any mans who gave her employment no longer his in fact since he was virtually forbidden her presence he who had offered her his hand and name and love was actually of less account in the arrangement of her daily life than any one of the thousands who trod the pavement under her office windows for they could offer work forrest threw himself back upon his pillow buried his face in his arms groaned aloud as the innocent youth went gayly forth into the wintry sunshine and the doctor and the household of anxious women wondered what had happened to set back their impatient patient could it be suggested that social prophet his sister that he was after all really interested in florence allison and chagrined at the news of her engagement now formally announced might it not be after all that as she had originally suggested his apparent infatuation for jeannette wallen was mere sentiment quixotism proximity and that he would speedily recover could they only get him away awhile surely it was worth the trial his mothers health was suffering in the rigors of a chicago winter they had spent three months in st augustine each winter for years past and but for floyd should be there now it was arranged somehow he was passive submissive indifferent he knew nothing of the one wild moment of jennys breakdown he had never been allowed one hint of where his blessed head had been pillowed that bitter november night the girl had pledged her friend to absolute secrecy removed on his convalescence from wellss roof to his mothers rooms at the virginia forrest saw no more of his hostess for several days then with a three months leave on surgeons certificate he was driven under his mothers wing to bid her adieu and that night they were off for florida ill never forgive him as long as i live said mrs wells he never gave me a chance to tell what i cant tell you mrs cranston but you know and those two proud women have just got him between them now and theyll never let him out of their leadingstrings again you dont know him said mrs cranston hell break the strings and be back or he isnt worth another thought of a girl like her but jenny was not so certain never yet had she had opportunity to unsay the cutting words with which she had met him that bitter night time and again in her heart of hearts had she planned how those unsaying words should be said and said just as soon as ever he came but he came rather soon and suddenly they were great christmas farers at wellses with no children of their own the sweet holiday season would have lost its sweetest charm but that jenny was again with them they rigged up a lovely christmastree for marts babies and summoned in sundry little waifs from the neighborhood and had games and romps and laughter and merry voices later in the week there was a dinner at which the cranstons and some fort friends appeared there was a mistletoe bough that night and not a little coquetry and merriment for wells had invited the library girls and numerous young men to be present and the customs of old england were reproduced with characteristic american exaggeration that mistletoe bough remained suspended from its chandelier a reminder of the joys of the old year even after came knocking at the door and in some odd way a little sprig thereof was found one evening to be clinging to the top of a cabinet photograph of mr forrest which stood on the mantel shelf it was a sharp cold january evening and jenny wallens soft cheek was glowing and her eyes sparkling as she tripped lightly up the stone steps let herself into the warm hallway and peered into the parlor no one was there a bright coal fire blazed in the open grate the pretty room looked cosy and inviting the library beyond wellss particular was dark mrs wells said the maid from the head of the kitchen stairs had been home but was gone over to the lambert to meet mr wells so jenny was alone some women lose courage at such times she seemed to gain it drawing off her gloves and throwing aside the heavy cloak she stood there in front of the blaze her eyes fixed upon that unconscious portrait her hands extended over the flames what speaking eyes the girl had what would be the words the soft rosy lips were framing with all her soul she was gazing straight into that unresponsive soldierly handsome face with all her heart she was murmuring some inarticulate appeal lavishing some womanly caresses upon the dumb and senseless picture then the little hands were upraised and the next instant frame and all the shadow was nestled just where the substance had lain clasped in those encircling arms long weeks before a moment or two it was held there the sweet face bending over the soft lips murmuring crooning to it as a mother might to a precious child and then it was raised still more until those lips were pressed upon it long long long and fervently then down went everything with a crash in striving to explain matters and set himself right in the eyes of his ladylove some hours later captain forrest protested that he had had no intention whatever of spying upon much less of startling her they had speedily discovered at st augustine that it was useless trying to bring back this wayward son and brother a man of thirtyfive to live without the heart so unmistakably in the keeping of the girl hed left behind i have written to her all you could ask floyd my son were at last the mothers words go and god bless you and three days later he surprised mrs wells ive just got to go out said she after a while and youve simply got to stay here ill leave directions that im out to everybody and then did that designing matron pick up his furs and deposit them and him in the library youre to stay here mind till i get back but you didnt interposed his hearer reproachfully at this juncture you burst in there like a like a tiger and scared me out of my seven senses that was entirely your fault i was merely trying to escape from the house you see when i left florida you were living as i supposed at miss bonners and as soon as you came in it was my cue to leave in view of the ferocity of your remarks the last time we met here knowing how i must regret that you need not have been so precipitate it was what i think you gentlemen call a standoff said she with a pretty grimace at the slang but do you always take the roundabout way to reach the door miss wallens lips were twitching with suppressed delight and captain forrest was watching them with illsuppressed emotion he rallied promptly however rarely but in this case i flew to pick up the picture you had dropped oh the maid would have done that she was promptly on hand yes too promptly so promptly as to inspire the belief that she suspected something was on foot when you when i by the way what became of that sprig of potatovine or chickweed or something that was on top of the frame mrs wells missed it as soon as she came in it fell into the grate i presume but it wasnt chickweed theres more of it if mrs wells needs it she added nodding to the pendent spray beneath the chandelier it doesnt signify oh i thought it did at least i hoped so mistletoe generally does not when mistaken for potatovine she answered yet her eyes were smiling at him jeannette he said impulsively his deep voice trembling as he stood close before her and strove to seize the little hand that was toying at her white round throat mothers letter must surely be with you by morning it is very hard to keep my faith and plead no more until she has pleaded for me must i wait will miss bonner bring it to you at once i hardly think so then may i not go tonight if need be and get it it was addressed you know to her care yes so i observed jenny then you have it you have read what she says oh my darling then and what imploring love was in those soft brown eyes of his what tenderness and longing and passion in the outstretched arms she looked shyly up at him trembling in spite of herself but not yet yielding you know ive had no time to more than glance at it she said i had hoped to read it this evening but you see visitors came in i must read it all carefully tomorrow ah he said you have me at your mercy you wrung those promises from me and now she backed away from him a bit he looked so fiercely reproachful but he followed she upheld her hands in warning and he strove to seize them but they evaded him you are proud stern unyielding he said at last and turned half helplessly away then caught sight of the feathery spray now almost over her bonny curly head if it were only christmas time again id claim the privilege of the mistletoe the room was very still a moment she stood there with bounding throbbing heart her swimming eyes fixed on his strong soldierly face so powerful in its pleading so helpless through his pledge she saw that he would not break his promise yet that her lightest word her faintest signal would unchain him she saw even in the sterner lines about his forehead something of the look of utter weariness and defeat that hovered there the night they bore the senseless burden within those very doors and in one great wave of tenderness of answering love and joy and longing the woman in her triumphed at last illustration is it potent only at christmas only like a whisper so soft so tremulous was her voice the needed words were spoken is it potent only at christmas but he
