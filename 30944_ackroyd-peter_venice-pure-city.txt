dionisio moretti are taken from antonio quadri il canal grande di venezia i city from the sea origins they voyaged into the remote and secluded waters they came in flatbottomed boats moving over the shallows they were exiles far from their own cities or farms fleeing from the marauding tribes of the north and the east and they had come to this wild place a wide and flat lagoon in which fresh water from the rivers on the mainland and salt water from the adriatic mingled at low tide there were mudflats all around cut through with streams and rivulets and small channels at high tide there were small islands of silt and marshgrass there were shoals covered with reeds and wild grasses rising just a little way above the waters there were patches of land that were generally submerged but at certain low tides rose above the water there were desolate marshes that the water only rarely covered the salt marshes and the shore seemed from a distance to make up the same wide expanse marked with ponds and islets there were swamps here too as dark and uninviting as the waters that the tide did not reach a line of islands made up of sand and river debris helped to protect the lagoon from the sea these were covered with pine woods although the lagoon was not far from the once great centres of roman civilisation it was remote and secluded this was a solitary place its silence broken only by the calls of the seabirds and the crash of the billows of the sea and the sound of the wind soughing in the rushes at night it was the setting of a vast darkness except in those patches where the moon illumined the restless waters yet in the daylight of the exiles approach the silver sea stretched out into a line of mist and the cloudy sky seemed to reflect the silvery motions of the water they were drawn into a womb of light they found an island and a voice like the sound of many waters told them to build a church on the ground they had found this is one of the stories of origin that the venetians told the lagoon itself is an ambiguous area that is neither land nor sea it is approximately thirtyfive miles km in length and seven miles km in width taking a crescent shape along part of the coast of northeastern italy it was created some six thousand years ago emerging from the mud and silt and debris that came down into the adriatic from seven rivers the principal among themthe rivers brenta sile and piavecarried material from the alps and the apennines a city of stone would one day rise on the minute debris of mountains the swamps and marshes and mudflats are protected from the sea by a long and narrow bank of sand divided into islands by several channels the longest of those islands is now known as the lido the channels make openings in the barrier entrances known as porti through which the sea rushes into the lagoon there are now three such porti at the lido at malamocco and at chioggia these tides breathe life into venice it is a continually various and unsettled scene part mud and part sand and part clay it is changed by tides always shifting and unstable there is a current in the adriatic that flows up and down from the mediterranean and each of the porti creates its own distinct basin or force of water that is why the appearance of the lagoon has altered over the centuries there is one theory that as late as the sixth and seventh centuries the lagoon was essentially a marsh covered by water at high tide in the nineteenth century according to john ruskin there were times at low tide when it seemed that venice was marooned on a vast plain of dark green seaweed the whole lagoon in fact would have become dry land five hundred years ago were it not for the intervention of the venetians themselves the lagoon is now simply another part of venice another quarter that happens to be neither land nor sea but it is slowly returning to the sea the waters are growing deeper and more salty it is a precarious place saint christopher carrying the infant christ across the water was once a popular saint of the city there have always been inhabitants of the lagoon the wilderness could after all be fruitful from the earliest times there were small pockets of peoplefishermen and fowlers ready to take advantage of the abundance of wildfowl and marine life as well as the autumnal migration of the fish from the rivers to the sea the marshes are also a natural place for the harvesting of salt salt was a valuable commodity the venetians were always known as a mercantile people but the first stirrings of trade in this area began even before their ancestors had arrived the earliest tribes are lost in the darkness of prehistory but the first recognisable ancestors of the venetians inhabited the region surrounding the lagoon from the eighth century bc these were the people who dwelled in the northeastern part of italy as well as along the coasts of what are now slovenia and croatia they were known as the veneti or the venetkens homer refers to them as the enetoi because there is no v sound in classical greek they were primarily merchants as the venetians would become trading in amber and wax honey and cheese they set up great markets like those which the venetians eventually established they traded with greece just as venice would one day trade with byzantium and the east they specialised in the extraction of salt from coastal areas in a way that anticipates the venetian monopoly of salt production they dressed in black which became the colour characteristically worn by patrician venetian males hercules was the tribal hero of the veneti and became a legendary protector of venice he is the demigod who acquires by labour what others claim by right the veneti traced their descent from antenor who led them from the ruined city of troy they were well known for their skill in seamanship and were essentially a maritime people they submitted in marital and familial matters to the authority of the state these were the people who inhabited cities such as padua and altino aquileia and grado these were the exiles who came for safety to the waters of the lagoon before the time of flight the veneti were thoroughly romanised by the second century ad they had made a pact with the powers of rome in the reign of augustus the area of the lagoon was part of the tenth district of italy and then in the fourth century it became part of the eastern roman empire the byzantine empire the lagoon was already partly settled on one of the islands s francesco del deserto have been found the remains of a roman port with pottery from the first century and wall plaster of the third century the port was no doubt used by those vessels sailing between aquileia and ravenna bearing grain from pannonia as well as goods and supplies from more distant shores amphorae have been discovered here for the carriage of wine and olive oil that had come from the eastern mediterranean the larger ships would dock on the island their goods then transported to smaller ships for the shallows of the lagoon there must have been local pilots therefore to guide the craft through these exiguous waters a walkway dating to the second century ad has been found beneath the nave of the basilica of s maria assunta on the island of torcello roman remains have been found at a great depth on the island of s giorgio maggiore and material from the first and second centuries has been discovered on smaller islands other finds on other islands can be dated from the fourth to the seventh centuries it has been suggested that the outer islands of the lagoon could have been used as a station for the roman fleet it is conceivable to say no more that villas were constructed here yet there was a fundamental change in the nature of the lagoon when the exiles from the mainland began to arrive in larger and larger numbers there was no central exodus but rather successive waves of migration that culminated in the late sixth century the veneti were escaping from invaders in alaric the visigoth descended upon the province of venetia in the words of claudian the historian of rome fame proclaimed the march of the barbarian and filled the land with terror aquileia and verona fell with many of their inhabitants fleeing to the safety of the islands when the threat of alaric had passed some returned home but others stayed making a new life in the lagoon in attila gained roman provinces from the danube to the balkans and then six years later took aquileia altino and padua were also sacked once more the refugees from these disasters fled to the lagoon there was a pattern to their movement the people of altino migrated to torcello and burano for example while those from treviso went to rialto and malamocco the inhabitants of padua sailed to chioggia the citizens of aquileia moved to grado which was itself protected by marshes they came with craftsmen and builders with farmers and labourers with patricians and plebeians they came with the sacred vessels from their churches and even with the stones of their public buildings so that they might build anew but how could they build on such shifting ground how could they build upon mud and water it was possible however for wooden poles of from ten to a dozen feet in length to be sunk into the mud before reaching a layer of harder clay and dense sand that acted as a firm foundation this was the boundary at the bottom of the lagoon so there sprang up small houses known as casoni made from the wood of poles and boards with pitched roofs of wattle and reed new towns such as heraclea and equilio jesolo were founded by the edge of the lagoon on the islands were established village communities with leaders consulting assemblies of the people the veneti may also have set up fortified encampments in the event that the huns or goths decided to move against them but the islanders were fractious and competitive there was no unity in the lagoons so in just twenty years after the appearance of attila a meeting of all the veneti of the lagoon was held at grado it was decided that each island would be represented by a tribune and that the tribunes would then work together for the common good they were after all facing the same dangers and difficultiesnot least from the depredations of the sea this was the first sign of the public and communal spirit that would one day manifest itself so clearly in venice itself the veneti were by the sixth century a defined presence in the region they were paid to ferry people and goods between the ports and harbours of the mainland they transported the soldiers of byzantium from grado to the river brenta they carried officials and merchants to byzantium itself already they were known for their maritime skills their boats travelled up the rivers of northern italy trading salt and fish to the cities and villages en route the first description of these island people comes in a letter sent in to their tribunes by a legate from the ostrogoth kingdom then prevailing in northern italy cassiodorus was asking them to transport wine and oil across the waters to ravenna for you live like seabirds he wrote with your homes dispersed like the cyclades across the surface of the water the solidity of the earth on which they rest is secured only by osier and wattle yet you do not hesitate to oppose so frail a bulwark to the wildness of the sea he was not quite accurate in his description there were already some houses constructed from the stone and brick of the mainland he went on to say that the veneti have one great wealththe fish which suffices for you all among you there is no difference between rich and poor your food is the same your houses are all alike again this was not quite true extant testimonials suggest that even at an early stage in the development of the lagoon there were rich as well as poor families cassiodorus then added that your energies are spent on your salt fields in them indeed lies your prosperity in this at least he was right and he added the significant detail of your boatswhich like horses you keep tied up at the doors of your dwellings by good fortune one of these boats has emerged from the mud of the lagoon part of a rib of oak and a hull of lime have been found on the island of s francesco del deserto the boat itself dates to the fifth century it was lying at a level that in this period would have been submerged except at times of low tide yet venice itself was not yet born it is not shown in a fourthcentury map of the region in which the lagoon is depicted as a sea route without people venetian historians claimed however that the city was established at midday on march by a poor fisherman known as giovanni bono or john the good there are advantages to this theory since the same date has been given to the vernal equinox the annunciation and the supposed date of the foundation of rome the triple coincidence as well as the provident arrival of john the good is too good to be true but it is part of the extraordinary venetian ability to supplant history with myth as the german poet rilke said on a visit to the city in as with mirrors one grasps nothing but is only drawn into the secret of its elusiveness one is filled with images all day long but could not substantiate a single one of them venice is a matter of faith in fact venice emerged over a century later after a series of invasions by the lombards in the late s and early s once more the province of venetia was overcome by alien tribes unlike the huns however they did not wish to plunder and depart they intended to stay and to settle they overran what is now called in their name the region of lombardy their arrival prompted a mass exodus of the veneti the bishop of aquileia moved his see to the edge of the lagoon at grado the bishop of padua removed himself to malamocco and the bishop of oderzo sailed to heraclea these men were secular as well as religious leaders they took citizens as well as congregations ready to create new communities on the water burano and murano were extensively settled as well as smaller islands such as ammiana and constanziaca these last two disappeared beneath the waves in the thirteenth century swallowed up by the main enemy of the island people they have never rested in their battle against the sea venice was born in this flight from the lombards the most recent archaeological investigations have dated the first signs of human habitation to the second half of the sixth century and to the seventh century these remains were situated in the neighbourhood of castello in the east of the city and beneath saint marks square there is evidence too that in these early years work had already begun on raising the surface of the land and reclaiming earth from water the settlers fenced the soil with planks and poles they drained the water they laid down building rubble or sediment or sand from the dunes they erected wooden palisades to resist the sea it is the beginning of the city the exiles had decided to settle on a favoured group of islands midway in the lagoon known collectively as the rivoalto or the high bank this eventually became the rialto the preeminent marketplace and emporium of the city the islands were interspersed with rivulets and watercourses but there was one larger river a tributary of the brenta known as the rivoaltus this became in time the grand canal two more solid hills or islandstheir description depends entirely upon how you judge the nature of the territoryfaced each other along the course of this river this is where venice was created this was land where the exiles could build it was not easy work in there are reports of catastrophic flooding throughout the entire region the force of which was so great that the course of certain rivers was altered the calamity would have changed the hydraulic structure of the lagoon but its effects upon the emerging venice are not known venice did not immediately become the most important city of the lagoon grado was the seat of the patriarch torcello was the great emporium or market of the region the ducal seat as it became known moved from eraclea to malamocco in the period when venice was first being settled there were elaborate building works elsewhere the basilica of s maria assunta was then being built on torcello an inscription on that site is dated and confirms that the church was erected within the context of byzantine ritual and worship the connection with byzantium is important the historiographers of venice insisted that from the beginning the venetians asserted their independence there is a famous legend of their leaders telling a representative from byzantium that god himself has preserved us that we may live in these watery marshes in our huts of wood and wattle for this new venice which we have raised in the lagoons has become a mighty habitation for us they could not be touched by the kings and princes of the world unless they come by sea where lies our strength this is pure mythmaking the venetians were at the beginning a subject people the language of the early venetians had an admixture of greek for example and as late as the last century there were still graecoroman elements in the dialect of the islanders of burano there is some disagreement about the date when the first military commander of the lagoon or dux was appointed by the byzantines it is most likely to have been in the early eighth century the venetians came to believe that he had been chosen by the island people themselves but there is no doubt that this duke or doge reported to the emperor in byzantium the appointment of a military commander did not in itself bring any harmony to the lagoon the early centuries were filled with internecine strife between island and island or family and family there are reports throughout the eighth century of civil war of battles in the forests surrounding the lagoon of doges being blinded or murdered or sent into exile but the political institution survived the early crises a doge reigned in venice for more than a thousand years doges in unbroken succession venice is made up of separate islands that were with effort and labour eventually conjoined there were at first scattered island parishes some of them dominated by monastic foundations and others by small communities such as fishermen or salt producers there would have been islands of boatbuilders too these insular communities were grouped around a church and campanile or bell tower the green or square in front of the church was and is still known as the campo or field in the campo was a well or cistern of fresh water collected from the frequent rain the houses were characteristically of reed and wattle construction although the houses of the more prominent citizens may already have been constructed out of brick and tile some islands were dominated by powerful families exiled from the mainland who kept their retainers around them to cultivate their gardens or vineyards the orio and gradenigo families for example controlled the island of s giovanni di rialto each island had its own patron saint the island parishes were separated from each other by marsh or water but waterways had been established to connect them there was already a pattern of habitation that grew steadily more intensive and determined the drive towards cohesion was advanced by another invader in pepin the son of charlemagne brought his forces to the lagoon in order to claim it for the frankish empire he attempted to storm the ducal seat of malamocco and the doge fled to the islands of the rivoalto for protection it is said that pepin followed in pursuit but that his fleet became enmired in the marshes and receding waters that he despatched rafts made of timber and brushwood but that venetian sailors destroyed them and that an old woman directed them across the treacherous shallows with the old venetian instruction sempre dirittojust go on in the same direction there are unmistakeable intimations here of the army of the pharaoh being overwhelmed by the red sea an analogy upon which future venetian painters would dwell whatever the true circumstances of the defeat pepin was forced to abandon his mission so the place of ducal refuge venice was proved to be the place of safety it was inviolable sheltered among the marshes it was protected by the lidi from the sea and separated from the mainland by water after the invasion of the franks venice became the ducal seat it became the centre of the lagoon it had begun its great career it prospered too from its secluded position in a treaty of it was agreed that venice would remain a province under byzantine rule but that it would also pay an annual tribute to the frankish king whose seat was now in italy this may sound like a double obligation but in fact it freed venice from single domination it now stood between franks and byzantines between west and east between catholic and orthodox its central position allowed venice to steer a somewhat uncertain course sometimes leaning to one side and sometimes to the other it also provoked many disagreements among the ruling families of the lagoon which had different allegiances and loyalties among the parties of the mainland and of the eastern empire nevertheless the position of venice effectively secured its independence one of the clauses of the treaty of allowed venetian merchant ships to sail freely to and from italian ports the venetians in other words were able to trade they could move between east and west venice became predominantly a city of merchants and it grew very rapidly many of the inhabitants of the lagoon soon migrated to the small islands around the rivoalto by the end of the ninth century there were some thirty island parishes and by the close of the millennium there were more than fifty the effects of a fire in when three hundred houses were destroyed is a testimony to the dense population those parishes grouped closest to the rivoalto became connected by bridges or canals the ramparts were erected the marshes drained the dykes constructed the swamps were reclaimed and the ground made fertile some of the major streets surviving still were then first laid out as footpaths stages and landing stairs were built some public and some private dams were created to prevent the silt from the rivers washing into the lagoon a service of ferry boats was instituted venice became an urban mass hot and energetic fixed upon the mud and water it represented a vast human and communal effort urged on by necessity and practicality the goal of common existence was always there there was a desire to make or to reclaim land to conquer the water to unify and to protect the common soil venice in the ninth and tenth centuries was a medieval city where pigs roamed about the streets and where pastures and gardens interrupted the vista of houses and churches there were districts with the epithet in the marsh or in the wilderness or in the seaweed the citizens travelled on horseback along the main street the merceria and tethered their animals to the great elder trees which flourished in what is now the piazza s marco or saint marks square otherwise simply known as the piazza there were flat wooden bridges without steps connecting the islands there were trees along the banks of the canals on the surrounding islands there were meadows where cattle and sheep grazed there were vineyards and orchards there were ponds and small lakes on the central islands which gradually coalesced there were courtyards and narrow alleys that bequeathed to the calli of modern venice their unique circuitry in front of the houses of stone or even of the poorer houses of wood and reeds were short stretches of land these became the fondamenta of the mature city the streets running along the canals by the end of the first quarter of the ninth century the area around what is now saint marks square had been completed there was a ducal palace or castle here together with a large ducal chapel dedicated to the byzantine saint theodore the more important families also built residences here to be close to the centre of power eventually the fields were cleared to make way for a piazza a large pool or fishingpond was filled in thus forming the piazzetta or little piazza in front of the ducal palace this duopoly of sacred and secular authority held its place on the site for more than a thousand years it was not called venezia until the thirteenth century but the region of the lagoon was known as veneto or venetia the latin term for venice was always venetiae thus registering its origin as a federation of islands or cities it has nineteen different appellations ranging from venegia to veniexia thus affirming its multiple identity it might be construed a portmanteau word containing venus and ice venice had no single or distinct origin the cities of the italian mainland had been settled through prehistory their territory defined by their burial grounds and defended by a circumambient wall they had grown in organic fashion from a ritual centre to an expanding periphery the reverence for the city is linked to the reverence for place and reverence for the dead who lie interred there the earliest cities are primeval in origin from the beginning venice had no perimeter it had no outline it coalesced from a hundred different points venice in a literal sense had no roots it had a fluid origin indeed one written in water it is insecurely placed in the world that is why it has always been subject to anxiety as in the present venice in peril campaign venice has therefore sought to define itself it has sought for origins it has felt obliged to uncover some hidden or reveal some absent origin machiavelli wrote that the beginnings of religions and of republics and of kingdoms must possess some goodness by means of which they gain their first reputation and their first growth this was the problem facing the venetians they had in that sense no goodness so they invented stories of origin all of them involving some kind of divine dispensationnot least in the apparently historical fact that the venetians were christian exiles fleeing from pagan invaders on the pavement of s maria della salute in venice is carved the inscription unde origo inde salus or salvation springs from origin thus there grew up certain exquisite and elaborate legends of the beginning they are not to be dismissed legends represent the earliest form of poetry venice is the place of legends particularly of religious legends just as it has always been a city of miracles the people of altino were in doubt where to flee from the pagans until they heard a voice from the heavens declaring go up into the tower and look towards the stars when they climbed the tower the reflections of the stars in the water made a path toward the islands of the lagoon in another version of this story all the birds of the region were seen with their young in their beaks flying towards the islands the voice out of the bright cloud calling the exiles in their boats has been heard at the beginning of this chapter eight of the earliest churches of venice were established by divine decree saint magnus was told in a vision to build a church where he first saw a flock of sheep this was in castello the virgin mary appeared in a bright cloud heralding the rise of s maria formosa a great assembly of birds chose the site of the church of s raphael a red cloud hovered above the site of s salvatore near the rialto bridge there were other more secular legends that the venetians had as their ancestors the romans or even the trojans but they too can be discounted these legends like venice itself have no foundation the city was built upon water by celestial decree it was a miracle in itself to build upon the sea thus it became a city of miracles it was a predestined spot a providential site everywhere in the venetian chronicles there is a great and shining image of the city venice became part of the history of human redemption its divine origin was attested by its perfect constitution enduring for a thousand years and even by its mercantile supremacy in paintings by venetian artists god the father and the holy spirit preside over saint marks square on the rialto bridge are carved the figures of gabriel and the virgin mary at the moment of the annunciation venice was idealised beyond any recalcitrant historical fact or inglorious episode yet the real origins of venice scattered or random as they are vouchsafe a great truth about the city they convey certain characteristics or certain qualities to the nature of life there every organic thing wishes to give form and expression to its own nature and so by obscure presentiment and by the steady aggregate of communal desires venice took shape the statue is latent in the marble the venetians had no arable land of their own so they were obliged to earn their living by trade and industry the city which was half land and half water devised a quintessentially mixed constitution in which the various forces of the state were balanced there was a constant preoccupation among all sections of the community with stability and continuity where are those qualities more necessary than in a place shifting and uncertain a city created by exiles became over the centuries a home for many and various refugees its empire overseas and its incursions into mainland italy were all based upon the necessity for selfpreservation it always perceived itself to be a city under threat venice did not emerge from the union of rural peasantry it was always urban venice was not in its infancy a feudal society by the tenth century it was already known as la civitas rivoalti civitas implying a citizen state the great and enduring fact however was the fight against the sea out of this arose the need for common purpose and community of effort there was no antagonism between the individual and the collective or rather the venetian individual through the centuries subsumed himself or herself within the organism as a whole it is an organism that like the human organism can be seen as a unity it obeys its own laws of growth and change it has an internal dynamism it is more than the sum of its parts each aspect of venetian culture and society reflects the whole from the ninth century three venetian commissioners were appointed to administer and oversee the defence and reclamation of the land an entire bureaucracy eventually emerged to control the depredations of the sea from the beginning venice was a state of intervention the earliest seadefences consisted of wooden stakes interwoven with wickerwork at a later date rivers were diverted and great walls of stone built against the water land could not be reclaimed nor islands joined without the cooperation of neighbour with neighbour and community with community dams could not be built without the unity derived from common interest so from the beginning venetians were possessed by the idea of communal life they created the first communal palace and the first civic square in italy venice was perhaps also the first city in europe to benefit from what has been called cityplanning with the deliberate zoning of industries and activities along the peripheries of the city all this was part of the search for the common good the battle against natural obstacles is the battle for human culture and improvement it requires immense cohesion and a social discipline that is best reinforced by religious observance so emerges the concept of the state as divinely inspired yet we must not discount the character and temperament of these early settlers their work was hard and continual and could not have been carried on successfully without large measures of energy and optimism these are or were the distinctive qualities of the venetian people they are or were proud of their city it was one of the characteristics noted by travellers yet nature sometimes retaliates against those who attempt to curb it certain islands of the lagoon were submerged by the encroaching sea settlements disappeared or were abandoned there was always somewhere in the venetian soul the threat of punishment and disaster water water everywhere venice was until the building of a railway bridge in the middle of the nineteenth century a small island or collection of islands venetians were islanders with all the benefits and burdens that accrue to that especial status to be insular is to be independent but it is also to be alone it secures a measure of safety but it also attracts attention from those on the larger mainland it exemplifies vulnerability even when outward circumstances seem favourable yet as an island city venice survived all the wars and invasions that have beset italy since the eleventh century it successfully defied both pope and emperor french invasion and spanish incursion and the continual forays of the other citystates of italy if it had not been surrounded by water it would have been destroyed many centuries ago but that separation from the mainland from italy and the world has taken its own toll although venice has been part of italy since italy has largely ignored it it is considered as somehow extraneous the italians do not really think of venice at all it belongs to some other realm of fancy or of artifice on the part of the venetians the tradition of liberty and of freedom from the fear of invasion bred a certain insouciance the island guaranteed the citizens their selfsufficiency perhaps but it also encouraged a certain selfenclosed or selfreferential attitude towards the rest of the world it is still easy in venice to grow indifferent to what is happening elsewhere venetians themselves are not particularly concerned with the affairs of what might be called the wider community from the remoteness and isolation can also spring melancholy venice is no longer an island but the island temperament remains and of course the islanders must always look out to sea it is their context it is their horizon where would they be without the sea the city rests on the silt at the bottom of the sea it is as much a part of the sea as the tides and the waves the sea flows between the wooden piles that sustain it the sea flushes beneath it there is something innately unsettling about living in venice there is salt in the air and the atmosphere is rendered hazy by evaporation the haze easily becomes sea mist or sea fog the air seems to melt above the buildings the salt and damp leave silvery traces on the whitened walls as if they were made out of motherofpearl the birds flying above them are the seagulls and there is seaweed floating along the canals beside them so there are images of the sea throughout venice the floor of the basilica of saint mark gently undulates as if the congregation were walking upon waves the area of marble slabs on the floor of the central crossing of that church was known in the sixteenth century as il mare the marble columns of saint marks are veined or striated like the waves in the other churches of the city we might note the popularity of dolphin capitals and the motif of the shell ruskin described the imposing houses along the grand canal as seapalaces in maps of venice particularly those from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the shape of the city is reminiscent of a fish or dolphin the islands and sandridges out of which venice was made seemed to the first settlers like the backs or dorsi of slumbering whales one area of modern venice is still called dorsoduro or hard back on top of one of the two presiding pillars in the piazzetta saint theodore is astride a crocodile there are crabs and dolphins on the capitals of the ducal palace it would not be wonderful to meet a leviathan or what in mobydick herman melville calls strange shapes of the unwarped primal world swimming at times of acqua alta in saint marks square it would not be wonderful to see a great polyp or medusa wallowing in the grand canal it is a sea city the first impression of venice may also be one of the sea goethe saw the sea for the first time in his life when he came to the city in the autumn of he glimpsed the adriatic from the arched window of the campanile in saint marks square ruskin arrived in venice some fiftyfive years later and in his autobiography he writes that the beginning of everything was in seeing the gondolabeak come actually inside the door at the hotel danielis when the tide was up and the water two feet deep at the foot of the stairs to find the waves of the adriatic lapping within the cityto find the sea changing the nature of the stone buildings all around himthat was the great enchantment the moon rules venice it is built on ocean shells and ocean ground it has the aspect of infinity it is the floating world the sea embodies all that is changing and variable and accidental it is the restless and wilful element it emerges in endless variations of colour and surface pattern the paintings of titian and tintoretto have been said to manifest a sea of light in which shape is fluid and ambiguous the venetian school of painting has been characterised as one of flowing colour rather than of form and outline a curvilinear impulse that creates its own weight and volume all is in flux you glimpse the movement of the sea in venetian statuary as well as venetian painting the mosaics of the city favour the depiction of the various biblical legends of the sea thus in the basilica of saint marks can be found the miraculous draught of fishes his walking on the water and the stilling of the tempest there are certain churches that might have risen out of neptunes kingdom the church of the gesuiti or s maria assunta has a baroque interior in which great cascades of grey and green and white marble are supposed to imitate wall hangings but they more closely resemble waves waves flowing and crashing down the sides of the church until arrested in a moment of silence and stillness the floor of green marble might have furnished some cave beneath the ocean as rays of light penetrate the marine gloom of the interior the rhythmic intelligence of the venetians has informed much of the architecture of the city the oncoming sea changes the perception of structure along the venetian canals where the buildings seem more delicate and attenuated the façades of the churches undulate weightless and unstable against the surface of the water like shells at the bottom of a rock pool on the seashore the architecture of venice is horizontal in mass like the sea from a distance across the lagoon the impression of the city is of flatness along the horizon it is perpetually in motion it is baroque and mannerist rather than classical it shimmers as if seen through water it is encrusted with ornament like a coral reef venetian craftsmen were well known for their work in satin where the gleamings and shimmerings of a particular fabric were known as watered silk to work in silk was known in venice as daronda allamuer or to make waves on the sea there is an especial type of venetian risotto more liquid than elsewhere that is known as allonda or with waves a sponge found in the aegean is known as enetikos or the venetian in the last century you could buy in the tourist shops of venice small ornaments made from the pearl shells found in the lido known as fiori di mare or the flowers of the sea they are the only flowers indigenous to venice there are other deep correlations between place and spirit venetian society has been described as fluid and everchanging of venetian politics sir henry wotton the english ambassador to venice in the early seventeenth century said that it fluctuated like the element of which the city was built that is the reason why venetian historiographers were intent upon emphasising the continuity and stability of their society they were always aware of the motion and restlessness of the sea within venetian polity at the heart of la serenissima was a horror of transience like the venetian sailors dread of the sea as the venetian poet of the late sixteenth century veronica franco put it the sea itself yearns towards this city this may be considered a compliment as long as the sea does not come too close it has been said also that the character of the venetian people is like the tide six hours up and six hours down according to the proverb in fact there is a dialect phrase that the venetians use to describe themselvesandara alla deriva to be adrift the mobility and lightness of the venetian temperament are well known the venetians themselves have songs and proverbs about the sea coltivar el mare e lasser star la terracultivate the sea and leave the land to itself there were once many popular songs that opened with the same phrase in mezo al mar in the middle of the sea iswhat not familiar things not beautiful things in the middle of the sea according to the songs are strange presentiments and terrifying apparitions here is a smoking chimney coming out of the waves here is an image of a dead lover there is no celebration of the charm or poignancy of the sea but rather a recital of its perils and its strangeness there are many legends and superstitions of the sea within popular venetian lore it is a shifting city between sea and land and thus it becomes the home for liminal fantasies of death and rebirth according to the english traveller fynes morisson there was a statue of the virgin in venice which was always saluted by passing ships it was surrounded by wax candles burning perpetually in gratitude for her saving lives at sea it is said that the sharp prow of the venetian gondola was a replica of the shining blade of one of the soldier saints saint theodore on the approach of a storm venetian sailors would take up swords and place one against the other in the shape of a cross it was also recommended that the sailor take out a knife with a black handle and cut the air in the face of the coming storm yet the sea is an intimation of impermanence all things come from and dissolve into the water it is enveloping there is no evidence that the venetians ever really loved the sea it was essentially the enemy byron declared that the venetians did not know how to swim and were possessed by the fear of deep or even of shallow water the venetians always prided themselves on having dominion over the sea but that mastery was provisional and fearful there was a constant fear of inundation of course it was the path to wealth but the consequence was that the preponderance of their trade and power was at the mercy of the sea the sea represented evil and chaos it was cruel and it was also divisive the terror of complete submersion could also be seen in part as a nervous apprehension of divine anger that is why there were ceremonies designed to propitiate the god or gods of the water they may have been nominally directed towards the christian god but there was an element of awe and fear within the venetian state that derived from much older creeds the city guarded the water too in the ducal palace the seat of the magistrato alle acque or master of the waters was adorned by an inscription stating that the city of venice benefiting from divine providence was founded in water surrounded by water with water for walls thus whoever might dare in whatever way to bring injury to these waters must be judged enemy of his country it ended with the declaration that this law has been reckoned eternal each spring on ascension day there was a ritual that became known as the marriage to the sea the spouse was the doge of venice taking for his bride the turbulent waters after mass in saint marks the doge and his retinue rowed into the lagoon in the doges own boat the bucintoro followed by the nobles and guilds of the city the doge halted at the part of the lido where the waters of the adriatic and the lagoon meet the patriarch of venice then emptied a large flask of holy water into the mingling currents the waters of the earth and the waters of the spirit became indivisible the bucintoro was described by goethe as a true monstrance which means the receptacle where the holy eucharist may be displayed so it becomes a holy grail tossing upon the waters spreading benediction with a ritual of healing on the prow of the ship the doge took a marriage ring of gold and threw it into the water with the words we espouse thee o sea as a sign of true and perpetual dominion yet what true dominion could there be in such a union one of the attributes of the ring is fertility so the festival can be construed as one of the oldest of all ceremonies it might also have been an act of supplication designed to placate the stormtossed and minatory sea it could also have been a maritime version of casting the runes there is a long tradition of rings thrown into the sea as an act of divination all these meanings converge in this ancient rite of union with the sea performed in spring at that place where the inside and the outside embraced at a later date one of the punishments for heresy was death by drowning when the condemned were rowed out to sea and despatched into the waters these maritime executions might in turn be seen as sacrifices to the seagods at the close of one of these ascension ceremonies in there was a violent earthquake in venice just as the doge and his courtiers returned from their voyage of celebration a slow and regular thunder beneath the earth lasted for several seconds everything trembled but nothing apart from a chimney fell there have been other quakes in the lagoon it is an unstable area in every sense an earthquake is recorded in when the campanile of s angelo was dislodged towards the end of the twelfth century there were simultaneous upheavals in saint marks square and on the island of torcello suggesting that there is a fault lying between them there was a great earthquake on christmas day and then again in when the shock was followed by a great inundation on january another earthquake set all the churchbells of venice pealing at the same time it was followed by another shock on the following day and these quakes were repeated at intervals over an entire fortnight the grand canal was empty but the streets were full of water the weather of venice is seaweather the air is damp and saltladen conducive to fog and mist if the climate is equable that may in part be the position of venice averroes the twelfthcentury philosopher was the first to calculate that venice was at a latitude of fortyfive degrees at the middle point between the equinoctial and the northern pole it is another example of the extraordinary balance of venice between the geographical regions of the earth the climate is mild compared with much of north italy because it is environed by the sea the spring is delicate and fresh the energetic wind blowing from the adriatic the summer can be sultry and oppressive but once the sun has gone down behind the friulian mountains the air is freshened by the breezes from the sea the autumn is the true season for venice it has an autumnal air the air of melancholy and departure the venetian painters carpaccio and bellini bathed their canvases in an effulgent autumnal light there is especially in autumn the possibility of rain a subdued greyness then haunts the air and the sky is the colour of pearl the rain can be persistent and torrential it soaks through the most protective clothing it can be blinding then the rivers may burst their banks and the rising waters around venice turn to a jade green the best description of the venetian rain is found in henry jamess the wings of the dove where he describes a venice of cold lashing rain from a low black sky of wicked wind raging through narrow passes of general arrest and interruption with the people engaged in all the waterlife huddled stranded and wageless the city of water is blockaded by water as if the natural elements were pursuing their vengeance against the most unnatural city the wicked wind may come from several points an east wind blows in from the sea refreshing in the warmer months but crueller in the colder seasons of the year a wind from the northeast the bora brings the colder air from the northern region of the adriatic a humid wind comes from the lagoon known as the salso because of its saltladen content some people say that it smells of the algae and seaweed of the surrounding waters the salt and damp penetrate the houses of venice the paint flakes and patches of plaster fall from the walls the bricks crack and eventually crumble there are gusts of wind that pass very quickly and eddies or squalls of circulating air sir henry wotton wrote of flashing winds all this is of the nature of the sea there is a southwesterly wind too once called garbin it may be of this wind that saint bernardino of siena wrote in he asked a correspondent were you ever at venice sometimes of an evening there comes a little wind which goes over the face of the waves and makes a sound upon them and this is called the voice of the waters but what it signifies is the grace of god and the breath breathed forth by him even the weather of venice was once deemed sacred but the most celebrated wind is the scirocco the warm wind that comes from the southeast and can persist for three or four days there is a scirocco di levante and a scirocco di ponente a hot scirocco and a cool scirocco there is even an elusive wind called the scirocchetto the scirocco itself has been blamed for the venetian tendency towards sensuality and indolence it has been accused of instilling passivity and even effeminacy within the citizens why should people not be moulded as much by climate as by history and tradition the outer weather can make or unmake inner weather yet some weeks of the winter can be harsh a potent reminder of the alps and the northern snows the most frequent weather lament concerned the bitter cold in the winter of those who went fowling in the lagoon were on occasions frozen to death and there were reports of travellers being surrounded and killed by packs of starving wolves at the beginning of the eighteenth century came a famous year of the ice in which provisions were brought to the frozen city by sledge in other winters the lagoon also froze and the venetians could walk over to the mainland in great bonfires were lit on the bacino the basin of water in front of the piazzetta stalls and booths were erected on the ice in the venetian equivalent of a frost fair in great sheets of ice went up and down the grand canal flowing with the tide for a month venice was then truly the frozen world the ice covering the houses and palaces as well as the water the light was blinding venetian houses were not built for the cold the great windows and the stone floors of the larger dwellings made them almost intolerable during the blizzards of winter yet there is still something inexpressibly delightful about venice in the snow the whiteness creating an enchanted kingdom where what is fluid has become crystal the quiet city then becomes wholly silent beneath the panoply of snow but there are winter weeks of not quite snow and not quite rain these may become the weeks or days of fog the iridescent mist or haze is then enveloped by the myriad fogs that creep in from the sea the grey istrian stone becomes an outpost of the fog a sentinel of consolidated fog looming out of the gloom as the esquimaux have many words for ice so the venetians have many names for the fognebbia nebbietta foschia caligo in the midst of the nebbia it is as if heavy rainclouds had come to rest upon the earth and water nothing can be seen or heard the fog sometimes shrouds the city so that the only sounds are those of bells and muffled footsteps if you take the vaporetto or waterbus that goes around the city you disappear within the white curtain about fifty yards about m from the shore all that is visible of venice are the posts carrying lights the city only rises before you when you arrive at the next stage there are portents for flood the air becomes heavy and still the roar of the sea can be heard breaking against the lido the waters in the canals stir uneasily and become more green with the influx of the sea the tide is driven forward by the wind the water rises to the edge of the fondamenta but then more alarmingly it begins to well up beneath the city itself it spouts up through the storm drains and between the paving stones it seeps through the foundations rising higher and higher it washes against the marble steps of the churches the city is at the mercy of waves that seem to be of its own making when the sirens sound venice prepares for another acqua alta this high water flooding the fondamenta and the campi making a lake of saint marks square invading houses and hotels is not unusual in the city one chronicler gave an account of a great flood in although assuredly there were many before that date they may have been so common that they deserved little notice other floods are recorded in and in when water invaded the entire city they have been occurring ever since in the water rose steadily for four hours and in the testimony of a contemporary many were drowned in their houses or died of the cold it was believed that the floods were provoked by demons and bad spirits while the only protection lay in invocations to the saints who guarded venice at a later date there was less recourse to supernatural help in the area of the piazzetta facing the lagoon was raised by one foot m on a calculation that the sea at venice rose three inches mm in every century this was an underestimate the acqua alta is part of a natural cycle occurring when wind and tide and current converge in what is for venice a fatal embrace the bora and the scirocco can both cause surges of storm in the sea there is also the phenomenon of the seiche an oscillation or standing wave in the relatively shallow waters of the adriatic but if venice is sinking it is in some measure due to the removal of water by industry from artesian wells when the water was taken from the silt and the clay the water table was loweredand with it venice the deepening of waterways within the lagoon and the reclamation of marshland have also increased the danger of flooding there are several inundations in every century therefore but in recent years they have been increasing in size and frequency in the s there were in the s there were in november the flood reached a height of six feet four and a half inches m the scirocco blew for two days keeping the murky and polluted water locked within the lagoon at the time some believed that it would mean the death of venice when the rain came it was collected within the stone gutters of the churches and houses it ran through the pipes and then through conduits until it reached the underground cisterns beneath every campo there the water filtered through a body of sand before penetrating the well shaft it was fresh and pure the wells or pozzi were ubiquitous at the middle of the nineteenth century there were still remaining in the city byzantine or gothic in construction an immense well was sunk in the fifteenth century in the middle of saint marks square two great public cisterns were built in the courtyard of the ducal palace from where the watercarriers or bigolanti would carry their precious commodity they were the peasant women of the friuli who wore bright skirts white stockings and hats of straw or felt they wandered barefoot through venice with their copper buckets calling out acquaacqua fresca it was a mournful as well as a melodious cry for a city built upon water water itself was sacred it is what in the gospel of john is called living water the wellheads themselves were highly decorated as a symbol of their significant content they were embellished by fragments of altars pieces of religious statuary and the stones of ancient temples as a token of their spiritual presence there were accounts of miracles being performed by or beside the wells in the plague of a monk was saved from extinction by a cup of water drawn for him by a knight from a local well the knight was later identified as saint sebastian and from that time forward the pozzo became known as saint sebastians well water is holy the byzantine wellheads were sculpted with a range of religious symbols including the cross and the palm tree they were cylinders of marble that might have been glimpsed in any eastern city the gothic wellheads which resembled the capitals of great pillars displayed figures both naturalistic and grotesque yet the wells often ran dry venice on water was often in need of water after storms the wells were marred by salt water it was a general practice for boats to be despatched to the rivers bottenigo and brenta in order to pick up fresh supplies towards the end of the nineteenth century artesian wells were established on the mainland to guarantee a more bounteous flow water was the staple of life and so the wells became central to the social routine of each parish the iron lid that closed the mouth of each well was opened at eight in the morning so there were always knots of people beside it during the day it is the most common view in photographs of old venice the well defined the intimacy and density of the parish water has always been the great unifier and leveller and in many respects venice was considered to be an egalitarian city the well was a symbol of public beneficence a visible token of the wise stewardship of the city but of course water is the life and breath of venices being in quite another sense venice is like a hydropic body filled with water where each part is penetrated by another water is the sole means of public transport it is a miracle of fluid life everything in venice is to be seen in relation to its watery form the water enters the life of the people they are fluid they seem to resist clarity and precision when the more affluent venetians built villas on the mainland they always chose sites as close as possible to the river brenta the venetian painter tintoretto loved to depict flowing and gushing water it expressed something of his own spirit in the work of giorgione and of his venetian school there are constant allusions to fresh and running water to wells and pools and lakes in myth and folklore water has always been associated with eyes and with the healing of eyes is it any wonder then that venice is the most visually seductive of all the cities of the world the endless presence of water also breeds anxiety water is unsettling you must be more alert and watchful in your perambulations everything shifts there is a sense of otherness the often black or viscous dark green water looks cold it cannot be drunk it is shapeless it has depth but no mass as the venetian proverb states water carries no stains this formless water has therefore been used as a metaphor for the human unconscious in his essay the visions of zosimos carl jung relates that the spirit is hidden in water like the fish venice has been depicted as a fish this wondrous water infused with spirit represents the cycle of birth and death but if water is the image of the unconscious life it thereby harbours strange visions and desires the close affiliation of venice and water encourages sexual desire it has been said to loosen the muscles by human imitation of its flow and to enervate the blood yet venice reflects upon its own reflection in the water it has been locked in that deep gaze for many centuries so there has been a continuing association between venice and the mirror it was the first city to manufacture mirrors on a commercial scale and by the seventeenth century was fashioning the largest mirrors in the world the plate glass for mirrors had been created by the end of the fifteenth century two of the greatest of all venetian artists giovanni bellini and titian painted young women in the act of gazing at themselves in a mirror in both of the paintings there is a mirror poised behind the head and one raised towards the face the date of both paintings has been given as only eight years after the government of venice licensed the making of mirrors on the island of murano the artists were publicising venetian commodities or rather they shared the venetian preoccupation with luxury goods yet at the same time they were contemplating in painterly terms the contrast between the true surface and the glassy surface a duality of which they were well aware in the world all around them the young woman might have been venice herself sitting and admiring rather pensively her own reflection the image in the mirror may in some sense be a guarantee of identity and of wholeness the root of narcissism lies in anxiety and the fear of fragmentation which may be assuaged by the sight of the reflection the virgin mary in the book of wisdom is lauded as a spotless mirror of god venice always associated itself with the virgin but of course the image in the mirror is a false self it is hard abstract and elusive it has been said that the venetians are always aware of the image of themselves they were once masters of the display and the masquerade they were always acting one of the favourite pastimes of venetian audiences in the eighteenth century was the use of opera glasses trained upon each other it is a place of doubleness and perhaps therefore of duplicity and double standards travelling on the newly built railway richard wagner was intent upon looking down from the causeway at the image of venice rising reflected from the waters beneath when his companion suddenly lost his hat out of the railway car window when leaning out in delight the reflection is delightful because it seems to be as substantial and as lively as that which is reflected when you look down upon the water venice seems to have no foundations except for reflections only its reflections are visible venice and venices image are inseparable in truth there are two cities which exist only in the act of being seen mirror mirror there is in venice an abiding attachment to the surface it has become commonplace that in the city only the fronts of houses were worth embellishment or decoration most of the gothic façades are simply thatscreens that bear no relation to the organic structure of the buildings themselves it is one of the strangest aspects of a city that in certain respects resembles an ornamental shell the rich plaster and stucco may conceal decaying brickwork and ruskin speculated on the duplicity of saint marks where internal and external ornamentation were quite distinct the city was built in brick but disguised by marble it seemed to matter not at all that behind the sumptuous façades the grand venetian houses were often cold dirty and uncomfortable in similar fashion among the owners of these houses there was an outward show of prodigality combined with avarice and pennypinching at home that was the venetian way it was not at all usual to invite guests for example into the house itself that inward space was confined to relatives and the most intimate friends the english poet thomas gray remarked that in their domestic lives venetians were parsimonious to a degree of nastiness honour was important in venetian society as in others but the mark of honour was what was known as bella figura it might be interpreted as the art of keeping up appearances one of the great engines of venetian life was and is still the fear of criticism everything must be done according to form and for the sake of form that form may hide malfeasance and corruption but it is important that it remains in place it resembles the façade or screen of the venetian house the twin imperatives of show and spectacle design and ostentation move through every level and every aspect of venetian society a sixteenthcentury account of a bankrupt banker of the rialto explained in passing that this market and the city of venice are naturally very inclined to love and trust in appearances the painters of venice lingered over the rich surfaces of the world the architecture of venice had the artifice and outwardness of the theatre venetian music has always been concerned with outward effectiveness rather than internal coherence the literature of venice was oratorical in nature whether in theatre or in popular song no other citystate in italy was so concerned with problems of rhetoric and style venetian ceilings are characteristically false ceilings suspended somewhere beneath the beams in the eighteenth century display and spectacle became a way of masking the decay and failure of public policy it is a constant note one that provides a clear insight into the identity of the city and its people the contemporary restoration of many buildings in venice is a case history of seeming rather than being in their devotion to appearances the restorers have created an unreal city bearing little relation to its past or to its present the architects and designers were concerned to reprise the aesthetic contours of the city but these were imagined rather than real the fruit of wishful thinking and nostalgia what happened in practice is that they remodelled or modified the architectural language of the past to make it fit their own preconceptions of how venice really ought to look fluting and veneer were removed horizontal lines were straightened and strengthened windows were altered to conform to the structure balconies were narrowed for the sake of overall harmony attics were taken out and baroque fixtures replaced by gothic for some reason the stronger shades of red and yellow have spread in a city where they did not exist before the style was known as ripristino it amounted to the creation of fakes it is an example of a general malaise of modern venice first recognised by the german sociologist georg simmel in the early part of the twentieth century he remarked that the city represented the tragedy of a surface that has been left by its foundation that does not render venice superficial quite the contrary the attention to surface without depth provokes a sense of mystery and of unknowability for many centuries venice has been famous for its glassmaking now the preponderant industry on the island of murano what is the attraction of glass for the city of the sea glass is material sea it is sea made solid its translucence captured and held immobile it is as if you could take up handfuls of the sea and turn it into brocade venice is the place for this the first writer on the making of glass in venice georgius agricola wrote in the early sixteenth century that the glass was formed out of fusible stones and solidified juices an apt translation of venices position between water and stone sand becomes crystal it is not venetian sand however it came from syria and then later from fontainebleau in france yet the venetian glassmakers were the most ancient and the most skilled in the world glassmakers had worked in the lagoon from the time of the romans there are finds of glass from the fourth to the seventh centuries and a seventh or eighthcentury furnace in torcello shows evidence of roman manufacturing conditions folk tradition always asserted the continuity of glassmaking on the islands and there may indeed have been some legacy of inherited skills yet much of the expertise derived from byzantine and islamic sources it is another example of the balance venice maintained between two worlds an individual glassmaker a certain domenico is first mentioned in a document of a venetian guild of glassmakers was established in the thirteenth century in that same century for fear of fires the glassmanufacturers were transferred to the island of murano there they flourished but they were in a sense imprisoned by the state they could not move to any other part of italy to reveal any of the secrets of venetian glassmaking was to incur the death penalty any workman who escaped to the mainland was hunted down and where possible forcibly retrieved it is if nothing else a token of the importance of the trade in the venetian economy glassmaking was vital to the citys economic success it would be absurd to suggest that the muranese workmen believed themselves to be oppressed or were forced to labour in any climate of fear but the threat of state punishment is an apt token of the constant presence of the venetian state in all aspects of venetian life it was by no means a free society it was an insular and therefore enclosed society they made goblets and ewers bottles and flasks beads and chalices lamps and windows pitchers and eyeglasses as well as a range of ornamental objects created out of cristallo a malleable form with all the translucence and brilliancy of rock crystal they could render a glass so fine that it was reputed to burst into fragments if it came into contact with poison the workmen of murano created glass that had the colour of milk glass that mimicked the texture of ice glass threaded with copper crystals types of glass resembled marble or metal or porcelain from the fifteenth century forward in fact venetian glass grew ever more elaborate and ornate it became a luxury at a time when venice had become the provider of luxuries of every description objects became ever more useless and ever more expensive in one contemporary noted of the muranese glass industry that there is no kind of precious stone that cannot be imitated by the industry of the glassworkers a sweet contest of man and nature venice had already been involved in that contest sweet or otherwise for many hundreds of years it is another reason for its perfect adaptation to the trade an early seventeenthcentury english traveller james howell marvelled how a furnace fire could convert such a small lump of dark dust and sand into such a precious clear body as crystal but had not venice wrought such a transformation upon itself from the dark dust and sand of its origins out of that dust and sand came a crystal city its churches and bridges and houses billowing out and growing ever more expansive when the travellers came to murano in order to observe all the arts of glassblowing with spatula and pincer they were peering into the nature and growth of the translucent city the lagoon was often described as resembling molten glass and indeed glass became a metaphor for venice itself there was a saying that the first handsome woman that ever was made was made of venetian glass glass is translucent weightless it is not a dense material but is a medium for colour and light glass has no content it is all surface infolded in crests and waves where the inner is also outer venetian painters learned from their fellow citizens who worked at the furnaces they learned how to mingle colour and how to create the impression of flux and molten form they borrowed material in a literal sense they mingled tiny pieces of glass with their pigments to convey the shimmer and transparency they observed all around them it glimmers it is flecked by foam it ripples and undulates it possesses a giant translucent calm it has currents of darker colour it is fluid so the glass is like venice of the sea an early map of venice devised in the late fifteenth

of venice in an object was brought to this place that entirely changed its character and its status it is supposed to have been the body of the great evangelist saint mark himself the essential story remained unchanged through the centuries it concerned some venetian merchantsa class who from the beginning took the lead in all the affairs of the venetian state buono of malamocco and a companion rustico of torcello had gone on a trading mission to the port of alexandria in that alien land they entered into a discussion with the custodians of the church of saint mark who were responsible for protecting the body of the martyred saint lodged in an ancient sarcophagus these priests bitterly resented the persecution of the catholic community by the saracens and expressed the fear that their precious church might be pillaged and damaged the venetians listened with great sympathy and then suggested to the priests that they might like to return with them to venice they might also care to bring the body of saint mark with them that could be considered the price of their journey it was a piece of business despite certain misgivings the custodians agreed the body of saint mark was taken out of the sarcophagus and unwrapped from its silk shroud the relic being substituted by another and less eminent saint it was then placed in a chest and taken on board the venetian ship the merchants first ensuring that the saints remains were covered by a layer of pork and cabbage when the muslim officials asked to inspect the chest they cried out kanzir kanzir oh horror at the sight and smell of the pork the sainted corpse was first concealed in a sail and suspended from the yardarm but when the holy cargo had reached open sea the saints body was placed on the deck surrounded by candles and thuribles thus the evangelist was safely conveyed to venice but not before a number of miracles eased his passage across the mediterranean his arrival could not have been more propitious by mysterious means mark informed his guardians that he wished to be taken to the ducal palace rather than to the cathedral church then rising in olivolo he was lodged in the banqueting hall but a chapel dedicated to his memory was erected in an open area where the basilica of saint marks now stands it was then a grassy field planted with trees as well as a garden and fruit orchard all this was removed and filled so that the chapel of saint mark might rise the devotion to saint mark soon outstripped that to the previous saint theodore and the great basilica was eventually raised in his name the ducal palace needed a shrine to bolster its legitimacy and it could be suggested that the shrine required a palace the covenant between them instantly magnified both the status of the doge and the power of the community if anyone were rash enough to question the account of the divine prize according to a later venetian historian then let him come to venice and see the fair church of monsignor s marco and look in front of this fair church at the mosaics that faithfully tell the whole story this may not be evidence that would stand up in a court of law but it was enough testimony for the pious and the credulous the mosaics were only the most prominent examples of the cult of saint mark on the great arch above the righthand singinggallery of the basilica can be found the scene of the embarkation of marks body there is the ship sailing for venice there is the reception of the body in the city these are mosaics from the end of the twelfth century made luminous by the decorum and formality of the byzantine tradition mosaics are the filigree upon the silver surface of venice from the beginning the cult of saint mark was as much a secular as a sacred affair he became the icon and emblem of venice together with his winged lion but he was always associated with the doge rather than the bishop the open theft of the relic was not an issue there soon grew up a legend that mark had been bishop of aquileia to the north of the lagoon before ever becoming bishop of alexandria and in any case the fact that the transition had been made with the blessing of mark himself proved its benefaction gods will had been done otherwise the theft would not have succeeded it is one of those circular arguments that are very difficult to break in the thirteenth century another layer of the story was added it was claimed that saint mark on one of his missions sought refuge from a storm and providentially took shelter on the island of rialto here in the future venice an angel appeared to him and proclaimed pax tibi marce hic requiescet corpus tuum be at peace mark your body will one day rest here there is of course no historical record of the evangelist ever visiting the lagoon there are in any case many problems with the original account not the least serious being the fanciful chain of events that led to the translatio of mark that there was some kind of theft seems clear that a sacred relic was lodged in venice is also clear it may or may not have been the body of saint mark himself it might have been any ancient body wrapped in pious fraudulence as heavy as any shroud it is likely that the merchants had in fact been sent to alexandria by the doge precisely in order to purchase the relic its removal to venice would heighten the sacred authority of the doge as well as the importance of venice itself venice and mark might rival rome and peter it is interesting that mark had been secretary to peter and that peter had quarrelled with mark for being insubordinate and insufficiently devout these were precisely the charges raised against venice by successive popes from the time of the translatio venice had a most uneasy relation with rome never conceding the primacy of the pontiff in its religious affairs many other consequences flowed from the translatio the presence of the saint was supposed to guarantee venice from assault or blockade and thus lend credence to its claim of invulnerability venice did survive unscathed until the time of napoleon the blessing of the saint would also unify the islands of the lagoon under the leadership of venice a political and social transition that did indeed take place over the course of two or three centuries there were rumours that the head of the evangelist had been left behind at alexandria but the venetian accounts insist upon the wholeness of the body insecurity in the spirit demands completeness elsewhere the wholeness of the relic was also an analogy for the organic interdependence of the islands of the lagoon it is important too that the saint arrived by sea the sea had become venices true element and there was no better way of sanctifying it than by claiming it as the shining path of divine protection the mosaics in the basilica emphasise the image of the ship upon the waves in a later legend a trio of saintsmark george and nicholascommandeer a fishing vessel and quell a storm in the lagoon that has been brewed by demons on his disembarkation mark presents a gold ring to the fisherman who in turn gives it up to the doge power over the sea is transferred from saint to fisherman to leader it is one of the formative myths of venice engaged in its continual fight against the waters there is also the question of free trade upon which venice depended at the time of marks translatio the byzantine emperor had imposed a trade embargo between christians and saracens but in defiance of that prohibition the two merchants had transported their holy cargo from alexandria perhaps clearing the way for other less precious commodities it was a hit against the emperor and a good omen for the merchants if you cannot farm as the venetians used to tell the pope who also complained about their trade with the infidel you must fish and that included fishing for saints it was said that at the time of the opening of the sarcophagus in alexandria a delicious odour as of sweet spices filled the city venetian traders were well known for their bartering of spices the relic also secured the independence of venice the citys previous guardian saint theodore was of wholly byzantine provenance by supplanting theodore with mark venice was asserting control over its own destiny so saint mark became a synonym for venice itself it would seem that half of the venetian males are still christened marco the red flag of mark became the venetian standard the winged lion is everywhere the essential and eventual autonomy of venice was assured by the remarkable if not miraculous events of there was a great fire in venice in in the course of a rebellion against the reigning doge in that conflagration the church of saint mark was utterly destroyed it would have been supposed then that the combustible relic would itself have been consumed in the flames in fact it was to all appearances lost until when by curious chance a piece of column fell away revealing the last remains of the evangelist it was certainly a miracle that he had withstood the great fire and against all the odds he is still with us until recent years it was reported that his body lay beneath the high altar of saint mark in the summer of pope paul vi handed certain relics of the evangelist to a delegation of coptic churchleaders but confirmed that the rest of the body was still in venice the thumb of saint mark as well as the famous gold ring given to the fisherman are still preserved in the treasury of the basilica the old bones still live in the imagination of the people there is a further reminder of the saint throughout the city the lion of saint mark is the emblem of venice it can be found in stone and in bronze carved in relief or in the round the lions are to be found on the ducal palace and the doges chapel they stand in front of the shipyards of venice they guard various grand houses and communal spaces every public building in venice once bore an image of the beast the winged lion stands on a pillar at the harbour the lion was a symbol of both religious and political intent the leonine symbol is one of authority and of paternalism it is also a token of justice all of these associations come together in the ubiquity of the lion on venetian stones and walls as a companion of the evangelist the spiritual connotation of the lion was clear but the lion could also be ferocious it could be aggressive it was a way of symbolising the might of venice if it were ever roused an inscription of the midfifteenth century reads behold the winged lion i pluck down earth sea and stars the lion of saint mark was often depicted with its hind legs in water and its front legs upon the land an apt indication of venices pretensions to lordship both of the sea and of the mainland refuge venice has been construed as a great ship upon the sea sometimes among the restless motion of the waters there is a sensation that the ground of venice is also in motion like the deck of a ship ralph waldo emerson wrote in his journal of his stay in venice that it is as if you were always at sea the image of the ship of state is a familiar one but it has a particular pertinence in the case of a city that seems almost to float when a doge of the early fifteenth century francesco foscari spoke of guiding the republic he reverted instinctively to the language of the sea he discoursed upon sails and upon cordage upon the wind and current with all the experience of a practised sailor it was a language that the venetians intimately understood the analogy was made for example between the building of the city and the building of a ship when a ship was constructed with keel and ribs of wood it was not easy to say when the form first emerged in similar manner it was not easy to specify the origins of venice the tip of the dogana or custom house sitting on the edge of land that leads to the grand canal has often been compared to the prow of a ship on the church of s maria salute immediately behind the dogana a statue of the virgin has been clothed in the uniform of a capitano da mar or admiral of the venetian fleet venetian buildings have often been compared with ships with their cylindrical forms and rectangles ships turned into stone and permanently moored the wooden roofs of some venetian churches have been erected in forma di galea or as a ship bottom roof the circular apertures everywhere in venice are like portholes yet the most important allusion can be saved to the last the ship was once for the early settlers a place of refuge the ship of venice was from the beginning a haven for exiles and wanderers it was an open city readily assimilating all those who came within its borders one fifteenthcentury traveller noted of venice that most of the people are foreigners and in the following century a venetian recorded that apart from the patricians and the citizens all the rest are foreigners and very few are venetians he was referring principally to the shopkeepers and artisans in an english diplomat sir dudley carleton described venice as a microcosmos rather than city it was created in the fashion of orbis rather than of urbis and so it has remained for the rest of its history there were french and slav greek and fleming jew and german oriental and spaniard as well as assorted citizens from the mainland of italy certain streets were named after them all the countries of europe and of the levant were represented it was something that all travellers noted as if quite suddenly they had come upon the tower of babel in saint marks square no other port in the world held so many strange peoples in many nineteenthcentury paintings the gabardine of the jewish merchants the scarlet caps of the greeks and the turbans and robes of the turks are seen jostling among the more severe costumes and tophats of the venetian gentlemen it might be said that the venetians fashioned their own identity in perpetual contrast to those whom they protected the germans were granted their own miniature germany in a complex known as the fondaco dei tedeschi at rialto which contained two halls for dining and eighty separate rooms the merchants were supervised and monitored by the government but it was said that they love the city of venice more than their native land in the sixteenth century the flemish settled in large numbers the greeks had their own quarter with their own church dedicated to the orthodox faith after the fall of constantinople in and the abandonment of that city to the turks in there was a further flow of byzantine greeksamong them soldiers mariners artists and intellectuals looking for patrons the armenians and the albanians had their own districts eventually an armenian monastery was established on the island of s lazzaro where byron travelled to learn the armenian language as a way of exercising his mind among the more sensual pleasures of venice there was a colony of turkish merchants established as the fondaco dei turchi where a school for the teaching of arabic was maintained so venice was the setting for a thriving cosmopolitan life it was not altruism or generosity that occasioned this inviting embrace venice could not have survived without its immigrants some of them were raised to the rank of citizens some of them intermarried with the indigenous people they were not all of course well protected many thousands of poor immigrants were cramped into cheap housing sharing the corners of rooms with others of the same race or nationality many of them came as refugees from balkan wars or from impossible poverty some of them were escaping from plague they congregated in the poorer parishes and by the sixteenth century as a result of the influx venice had become the most densely populated city in italy the immigrants also provided cheap labour for the city and were even employed in the galleys of the venetian warships they did the work that the venetians themselves preferred to avoid in the fourteenth century the italian poet petrarch celebrated venice as the sole shelter in our days of liberty justice and peace the sole refuge of the good as a port the city attracted such epithets as shelter and refuge they were natural images pietro aretino himself an exile from rome who had found safe haven in venice put it another way in an address to the doge in he declared that venice embraces those whom all others shun she raises those whom others lower she affords a welcome to those who are persecuted elsewhere there were after all refugees who travelled to venice for reasons other than commercial there was a toleration in this open city that was unknown in other regions that is why it became from the eighteenth century forward a resting place for what henry james called the deposed the defeated the disenchanted the wounded or even only the bored the deposed were a particular speciality of venice many of the dethroned princes of europe made their way here at one time in there were five dispossessed monarchs living in the city one of them being the young charles edward stuart it was also a haven for those of broken spirit for wanderers and for exiles venice became the home of the dispossessed and the deracinated its watery and melancholy nature suited those who were acquainted with sorrow it became a haven for those who were uncertain of their origin or of their true identity and for those perhaps who might have wished to escape from them it was like a mother endlessly accessible and accommodating it was a womb of safety the people were known for their placability and civility venice was a city of transit where you might easily be lost among the press a city on the frontier between different worlds where those who did not fit in to their native habitat were graciously accepted in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries for example it became attractive to male homosexuals who were lured by the opportunities for boys and gondoliers there came here too swindlers and fraudsters of every description there were failed financiers and statesmen shamed women and soldiers of fortune alchemists and quacks the rootless were attracted to the city without roots venice was also a frontier between different faiths catholic and orthodox islam and christianity so it attracted religious reformers of every description a secret synod of anabaptists was established here in the middle of the sixteenth century and the german community harboured many lutherans among its number venice always kept its distance from rome and protected the independence of its church from the depredations of the pope so it became in theory an arena for religious renovation there was even a time when the english government believed the republic to be ready to join forces with the reformation in that of course it proved to be wholly mistaken if you had failed then venice was a good place to forget your failure here you were in a literal sense insulated from the outer world so that its scorn or simple inattention could no longer wound you venice represented an escape from modernity in all of its forms and like any port it offered anonymity if you were an exile in venice you could lose your identity or rather you could acquire another identity entirely in relation to the floating city you too could become fluid and elusive tell me who i am but not who i was that still holds true for a place that afforded refuge for the foreign or the dispossessed it is perhaps ironic that venice gave the world the name of the ghetto a ghetto a small and insular community seems naturally to arise from venetian circumstance indeed the venetian ghetto became a venice in miniature and will thus help us to understand the nature of the city itself there had been jews in the city from the twelfth century at the very latest and in a population of thirteen hundred is recorded they were not permitted to live in venice itself but were settled upon the adjacent island of spinalunga its name was changed later to giudecca two centuries later they were given permission to reside in the city a burial ground was prepared for them in the sand of the lido with a palisade to protect the jewish dead from the enormities of the venetians but the jews were always subject to the prejudice and hysteria of the larger population prompted by superstition or greed to strip them of their wealth they were forbidden all professions except that of medicine and were denied all trades except that of moneylending then they were reviled for the very business they were obliged to take up by the early sixteenth century their dwellings were scattered over the city a series of military defeats in the same period in battles with some of the italian cities of the mainland were believed to spring in part from the venetian tolerance of the christkillers in their midst gods wrath was directed against his chosen city exacerbating the anxiety that the venetians always seemed to feel so on march the jews were enclosed in the first ghetto it was located on the edge of the northern district known as cannaregio some distance from the sacred places of the city it seems to have taken its name from the previous use of this remote enclave as a foundry for cannon the word for the casting of metal was gettare the noun for the cast is getto two other adjacent neighbourhoods were eventually added to its domain it was a complex of ghettoes it was not an altogether novel development the german merchants had already been consigned to their own quarters where they could be supervised and taxed without difficulty the turks would soon follow the policy of separation and enclosure had in addition previously been tested in the venetian colonies of the mediterranean the administration of venice was a pragmatic business but of course that pragmatism under other skies and in other cultures could become brutal and murderous the venetians had always been preoccupied by the definition and creation of space what could be more natural therefore than their invention of the ghetto it was not however the most benign concept the sacred state had in certain respects become a rationalised state the combination elsewhere might prove fatal but the venetian ghetto had certain special and defining features it was or it became poor and overcrowded it was surrounded by a wall a small island with one bridge connecting it to the rest of venice the inhabitants of the ghetto were allowed to leave when the marangona bell in the campanile of saint marks rang at daybreak but they were obliged to return by sunset at that time the drawbridge was raised the jews were locked in for the night space was so limited and the influx of residents so large that buildings grew higher and higher to eight or nine storeys the buildings were divided into a number of apartments with four or five families residing in each of them it is reported that some people had to sleep at separate times of the day or night since there was too little floor space rilke recites a story of one block in the ghetto that rose and rose ever higher until its inhabitants could finally glimpse the sea that is a significant venetian fable yet in truth all the windows looked inwards to the central campo or courtyard there was to be no visual contact between jews and christians it was deemed inadvisable for example that the jews should be allowed to see the sacrament as it was paraded through the adjacent christian streets such was the measure of the latent venetian anxiety so from the outside the unusually tall edifices were bare cliffs of stone guards were posted at the gates of the bridge by night and by day the adjacent quays were walled in two boats were employed to patrol the immediate area the ghetto resembled a fortress or a prison the city itself had become a kind of prison for some of its inhabitants the jews were obliged to wear a sign of their race it was at first a circle of yellow cloth the size of a fourpenny loaf stitched onto the breast of an outer garment then it became a yellow hat then a red one sexual congress between the two communities was forbidden any jewish male discovered in flagrante with a christian female was punished with the removal of his testicles by the end of the sixteenth century there were complaints that the ghetto had become by day and night a den of thieves and harlots troubled by rows clashes of weapons and threats but in the sixteenth century this might have been the definition of any city three hundred years later the french writer théophile gautier condemned it as a fetid and purulent district but this was a period when much of venice might have answered to that description the ghetto reflected the nature of the larger city but in this microcosm within a microcosm it did so in an intense and garish way there were gambling dens in the ghetto as there were in the larger city where large sums were won or lost the ghetto harboured a community of as many tongues and accentsspanish portuguese greek italian german levantineas the city itself the ghetto was closely organised and controlled by the jewish leaders imitating the example of the venetian patricians on the feast of purim the jews put on masks and disguises in true venetian fashion it became known as the jewish carnival the inhabitants of the ghetto excelled in music and in singing as did the venetians themselves by the early seventeenth century there was even a musical academy within the walls the jews put on elaborate theatrical performances many jewish women dressed themselves in the latest fashion with velvet and plush velveteen and lace they had been thoroughly venetianised in other words to the extent that the stricter rabbis would condemn their general dissipation and sensuality the ghetto had become another venice this was one of the secrets of the city it reproduced itself effortlessly in all of its various districts and institutions its nature and its structure were endlessly imitated in a perhaps unwitting act of homage every community within venice whether a trade guild or a manufactory became a miniature republic the image of the city was so powerful that it became a paradigm drawing everything towards itself a thousand cities of venice comprised the city just as a thousand flames may make up one fire the ghetto was not despised by the jews themselves it became a home a haven just as venice itself had once been to the first settlers it became a resting place the jews of spain and portugal for example were happy to find refuge there it became a centre of hebrew studies and the principal site of hebrew publishing in europe it was a fixed point of rabbinic culture despite its somewhat noisome reputation it remained for some jews a central place of prayer and spirituality reflecting the sacred destiny of venice itself it also offered a welcome defence on a practical level against outbreaks of antisemitism among the populace jews and christians would mingle in the ghetto during the day and in fact the ghetto exercised a peculiar fascination for some members of venetian society the government of venice tried to prevent its citizens from attending the purim plays for example but in the face of mounting protest gave up the attempt there was simply too much enthusiasm certain venetians would also regularly attend the synagogues when a renowned or gifted speaker was about to deliver the sermon in turn rabbis would listen to the sermons in venetian churches there may in fact have existed an affinity deeper than either the jews or venetians would care to confess there were many similarities both people were intent upon custom and ceremony the venetian patricians were often described as grave and dignified in a fashion similar to jewish elders and the mercantile venetians like the jews were subject to vulgar prejudice other countries accused them of insatiable cupidity and of conspiring the ruin of everyone the rest of the world believed that venice was extraordinarily wealthy even though it took great pains to conceal its wealth similar charges had been levelled at the jews in all ages there was a fellow feeling they were both hated so in venice the jews were tolerated in a manner not evident in other european cities there is no example of popular execration or maltreatment although it was reported that venetian drunks or venetian children would sometimes dance in the jewish graveyard on the lido the jews were tolerated perhaps because they were profitable you can never ignore the principle of commercial calculation running through all of venices affairs jews were allowed to open business premises only on the payment of large fees the trade that jewish merchants and shopkeepers brought to venice was of immense service to the venetians themselves the relatives of the venetian jews often sent their capital to the city at times of crisis not infrequent heavy taxes were levied against the ghetto in the first decades of the seventeenth century it has been estimated that the net revenue received from the ghetto was approximately ducats the sum was much higher than any collected from venices overseas or mainland colonies yet a more exalted association can be placed beside this talk of taxes and ducats it is significant for example that both venetians and jews had a solemn sense of law and a sacred belief in nationhood they both shared a preoccupation with their native territory as a common heritage they both believed that their constitution was in essence a covenant between deity and people they both reverenced their forefathers and had an inordinate respect for custom and tradition the jews knew themselves to be mutually interdependent part of a communal life rendered ever more sacred by a common purpose and the necessity of selfpreservation does this not remind us of the venetian state the two cultures were images one of another the battle of lepanto painted by paolo veronese in this work was completed just a few months after a famous victory of the venetian forces among others over the turks two hundred and thirty turkish vessels were sunk or captured with only thirteen losses for the europeans lepanto was the last battle in which the use of the oar held

fourteenth and fifteenth centuries surviving even into the sixteenth century and giving an unmistakeable aspect to the city that still survives most of the wellknown palaces or great houses are created in the gothic mode photo credit i against nature there were once many gardens in venice in the sixteenth century there were five hundred of them nestling within the city spreading their own refreshing and aromatic life yet by the eighteenth century casanova remarked that a garden is a rarity in venice in the middle of the twentieth century it was estimated that there were sixty remaining that number may have since been revised yet there are still gardens secluded and still protected by walls and gates creating little pockets of green in the stony life of the city in previous centuries the smaller gardens might have shrubberies of larch or cypress or laurel the larger gardens were planted with flowerbeds and avenues of fruittrees complete with cages of singing birds to maintain the illusion of nature there were also in the largest of them temples and fountains as well as elaborate loggias the fugitive scent of fruit and jasmine and banksia roses trailed through the calli and the campi the venetians evinced a great love for flowers matched only by their love of buildings there were itinerant sellers of gladiolas and tuberoses and other blossoms harvested from the mainland on describing these merchants in sir henry wotton coined the english word florist it entered the vocabulary effortlessly on saint marks day it was the custom for each young venetian man to offer a rosebud to his sweetheart in painted representations of venice in the fifteenth century there are innumerable pots of carnations cluttering the windowsills but tastes change in the early decades of the twentieth century the aspidistra became the flower of venice there was however one native flower it was the flower of the lagoon fiore di barena clothing the level marshes with a purple robe it is a token of that time when venice itself was merely a heap of wild and uncultivated nature on the lagoon itself there were garden islands in the fifteenth century there were vineyards and monastery gardens the island of giudecca was until recent years a paradise of gardens the island of torcello was the home of the vine and the pomegranate the oleander and the acacia the fig and the elder tree it also provided the rich soil for maize and artichoke once there were olive trees all over venice the island of castello where the cathedral of the city stands was once known as olivolo olive oil was a profitable commodity yet in the city itself there is no sense of regeneration or rebirth that accompanies the presence of flora and foliage it has been said that the venetians prefer marble to vegetation in venice architecture must take the place of nature it must allude to nature in a pious and consolatory manner it is one of the secrets of venetian building the stone of the buildings is sculpted with leaf and branch the hundred columns of saint marks comprise a solemn forest the wood becomes stone the stone becomes wood the great houses have also been compared to coral reefs it needed art to recreate nature there was a fashion among venetian painters of the early sixteenth century for pastoral scenes but the natural world is pictured without life it is not worked or populated there are sheep there are picturesque rustic buildings there are groves and springs there are nymphs and shepherds in the foreground the inner reality of rural life is not understood the grass is depicted as if it were velvet for example just as in venetian manufactories velvet was created to resemble grass the natural life of the city must be imagined rather than seen it must be intuited beneath the layers of stone byron called venice the greenest isle of my imagination a paradox only he could sustain george aschenbach the protagonist of thomas manns death in venice sees in vision a landscape a tropical marshland a kind of primaeval wildernessworld of islands morasses and alluvial channels it is a vision of venice itself in its original state but it is a city that no one else will ever see and what kind of animals prowl in this city of stone there were once sheep and oxen there were foxes and even wolves there were horses and mules in the streets of venice in a mule carried pope alexander iii through the streets of venice and in the doge and eleven patricians entered the city on horseback the veneti of early time had been known for their skill on horseback and the latterday venetians continued their practice eighty horsemen were deployed in saint marks square in to maintain public discipline after the discovery of a conspiracy against the state there were tournaments in the square and at one such display in petrarch was moved to remark that the venetians demonstrated horsemanship and weaponhandling enough to equal the fiercest fighters on earth there were horseraces across the rialto bridge until they were banned by edict in it was a city where one of the principal sounds was that of the clangour and neighing of horses this did not endure however in the english traveller thomas coryat reported seeing only one horse in the entire city horses were eventually barred from the streets there was simply not enough room and the spread of stepped stone bridges was a further impediment such was their rarity that in mrs thrale noticed a line of venetians queuing to marvel at a stuffed horse indeed by the eighteenth century the patricians of venice were ridiculed for their inability to ride on anything except gondolas it shows that a native skill may disappear from sheer lack of practice the only horses now to be seen in the city are those with the rigid composure of metal the four bronze chargers panting on the façade of saint marks the spoils of war looted from constantinople are a token of a city where natural life is coming to an end cats and dogs were and are popular in venice once the city was filled with watchdogs and hunting dogs for deployment in the lagoon but over the centuries they have become more discreet they are relatively small and domestic they consort well with the spaces of the city the dogs in particular enjoy the savour of old stone they have a distinct sense of territory as venetians also do the venetian painters loved dogs carpaccio enjoyed their company on canvas in one of his most famous paintings now to be found in s giorgio degli schiavoni a small terrier looks up expectantly at saint jerome or perhaps saint augustine lost in divine rapture nature looks on bemused at the supernatural but he also paints dogs on guard dogs asleep dogs on verandas and dogs on gondolas they were not reserved for patricians almost all of the numbers of the local newspaper in the eighteenth century the gazzetta veneta contain advertisements for lost dogs the venetians embraced them because they were one of the tokens of the larger natural world that they had forfeited in their struggle for survival in the modern vaporetti the dogs are all safely muzzled the cats were celebrated as the little lions of venetian life they are part of the territory they are naturally lazy they are naturally observant and can spend much of their day simply looking on yet cats unlike most breeds of dogs do not like water they can still be found in feral groups scattered across the city they haunt the fishmarket they can be seen on ledges on steps under bridges and in the squares the square of s lorenzo is particularly graced by cats they are useful of course in catching the rats rats are one of the curses of venice but one surprisingly little mentioned in the literature of the place there is a saying in venice that every house has a rat by which is meant that every family has a renegade member but it can also be taken literally the efficacy of cats against the pests may have prompted the venetian superstition that he who kills a cat will die within a year and that he who hurts a cat will suffer an accident this did not deter the more serious cathaters there were once mysterious outbreaks of catpoisoning in the republic and a curious ritual in which a cat tethered with a board was killed by systematic headbutting from the venetian crowd yet there has always been a general celebration of animal life in the republic late medieval and early renaissance painting is filled with animal studies carpaccio and crevelli tintoretto and veronese and bellini depict cats and dogs and falcons and deer and pheasants titian painted white rabbits in every case there was a desire to embrace a natural world which was in truth out of reach all the more fervently loved for being elusive there were aviaries and cages of singing birds all over venice another reminder of a natural life elsewhere brightly coloured birdsfinches canaries and parrotswere the favourites all these birds had of course to be imported in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the apothecaries of the principal shopping street the merceria kept cages of nightingales to advertise their trade john evelyn reported that shutting your eyes you would imagine your selfe in the country when indeede you are in the middle of the sea the pursuit of nature was for the venetians a way of forgetting the unnatural and precarious position in which they lived browning loved the seagulls of venice although they are seldom mentioned in the annals of the city yet the seagulls should be named with the cranes and the wild ducks as the native birds of the lagoon they are also part of the myth of the city like the flight of birds that led the earliest settlers to the islands of the lagoon there is a legend that the pigeons of saint marks square are a direct descendant of those flocks that followed the exiles from the town of oderzo in their flight from the barbarians the swallows provide another blessing they come in summer and swoop down upon the mosquitoes that are the plague of the shallow waters no one can visit venice however without being aware of the pigeons those in saint marks square are the most pampered and preserved birds in the world to the extent that they have acquired an absolute immunity from the passing human population in times of frost or heavy rain they will literally form a pile one upon the other creating and maintaining warmth in their huddled masses they know that they are not at risk from predators and that they will not be disturbed so they have developed a unique form of animal behaviour like some remote island species on a distant sea they are protected by ancient custom and custom in venice is sacrosanct it is said that on one palm sunday they were released from the basilica of saint mark with small weights tied to their legs hampered in this manner they became easy prey for the dinnertables of the venetians but some of the birds still somehow managed to escape and found refuge on the various ledges and alcoves of saint marks itself so they were preserved by the intervention of the saint after that they became a cult bird so the story goes it is certainly true that a daily supply of grain was provided to them from the public granaries as was the custom in persia and in southern russia and that it became an offence to injure or molest them in any way there are now forty thousand doves of saint mark in the city the vendors of corn in the square maintain nineteen venetian families the birds themselves do seem to enjoy some divine dispensation and elizabeth barrett browning referred to them as the holy pigeons there have over the years been several attempts to curb their numbers on the grounds that they constitute a menace to public health and that their excrement corrodes the precious stone of the city there have been attempts at poisoning at trapping and even at contraception all have failed they have been flying and fluttering in saint marks square ever since it was fashioned why should they depart now and if they were to be removed would the square itself be any nobler or safer the case is arguable trafalgar square now that its own pigeons have been eliminated looks like a denuded and almost empty space the birds are part of the spirit of place they are the grey stone come alive and rendered soft to the touch there were many ways in which venice fought against nature its whole soul and being were devoted to the battle against the sea and that rivalry by a process of transference affected other areas of venetian life it is remarkable for example how expert the venetians became at forcing flowers they were adept at making roses and gilliflowers blow unseasonably they had sweetscented roses in january it was also common in the first part of the twentieth century for venetians to dye their flowers orange and blue roses were displayed for sale as well as pink or purple daisies but these are no doubt examples of a very old practice the venetian love of colour is well enough known why should it not spread from the canvas to the more transient world the venetians were entranced by artificial gardens the more complex the better in their villas on the mainland by the brenta the gardens were formed in symmetrical shapes with every variety of water sculpture in grottoes and caves the greenhouses were filled with rare plants and with foreign flora and the hedges were fashioned into the shapes of boats or animals the marble statues of nymphs and goddesses were the natural or unnatural extension of the pastoral landscapes that were fashionable in the early sixteenth century in this same period too there was a general and genuine interest in the practice of horticulture in the constant striving to control and to improve the natural world everything was of a piece the venetian patricians revelled in their triumph over natureor rather their native skill in manipulating it for their own purposes it was after all the principal lesson of the republics history the city represents in the most delicate and disquieting way the ambiguous domain between the natural and the artificial suggesting that there may be some third entity stones of venice if it is a city of stone rather than earth or leaf for example does that make it an unreal city oswald spengler believed that the development of civilisation could be marked by the transition from plant to stone and in that sense venice might be considered the most civilised of cities from the beginning of the fifteenth century when the wooden city was slowly dismantled it became a little kingdom of stone it has all the appearance of solidness and stability all the stronger because of its constant companionship with water there is no natural stone in venice so it had to be bought or stolen it is the old story of the floating city there was a time after the capture of constantinople when every boat sailing to venice from that city was obliged to carry a consignment of stone it was used as ballast yet much had to be purchased the marble of venice came from carrara and from the island of paros trachite stone from the euganean hills was used for paving the calli and the campi dark or red stone was imported from verona it was mottled with chips or pebbles of harder stone that resembled islands surrounded by channels the lighter stone of verona pink and grey changes tone according to the seasons and to the light it is perfectly suited to the city pink granite and porphyry came from egypt and there was abandoned and disused stone stone from the old churches and houses of the lagoon islands stone was so precious that it was used and used again the spoils of ruins laid the foundation for new buildings in a continual process of regeneration and reinvention the gravestones of the roman dead became parts of christian churches an altar to the sun god taken from aquileia was reemployed in the baptistery of saint marks it can truly be said that venice was built upon antiquity it harbours past ages there are also more exotic stones the venetians loved the coloristic effect of agate and malachite amethyst and cornelian the ultramarine used on the façade of the great house on the grand canal known as the ca doro was made of powdered lapis lazuli from badakhshan the venetians loved coloured and richly veined stonegreen porphyry and black granite stone with red stripes on a white ground stone with white stripes on an orange ground in the church of saint mark there are more than fifty different types of stone but the principal stone of venice was quarried in istria istrian stone endures heat and cold it is easily worked and most importantly it resembles its sister stone marble once it has been smoothed and polished it can scarcely be distinguished from that material it is an example of venetian show it was used as foundation for the great houses and churches it was used for sculpture for framing doors and windows for columns and for keystones for quays and coats of arms there is one important fact about the stone it is a limestone it comes from the action of the sea made up by the unimaginable compound of billions of marine creatures it represents the compacted time of the sea it is the essence of sea when auden imagined a limestone landscape he could hear the murmur of underground streams it is indissolubly connected with the life and history of water marble itself is also limestone hardened and changed so that it is more resistant to the sea air that is why it was often used upon the façades of the churches and greater houses so the sea has become by metamorphosis the stone of venice the stone glows with the inner translucence of the ocean it glistens it gleams it shimmers it has been described as a forest of marble springing upward from the petrified trees within its foundations ruskin devotes many paragraphs in the aptly entitled stones of venice to the designs of foliage and flowers sculpted in stone the ornamentation is so careful that the stone leaves of a vine are every one varied in position there are branches and twisting tendrils drifting leaves and bunches of grapes every rib and vein of the foliage may be copied exactly it is a way of commemorating nature but it is also a way of mocking it the visitors come to venice precisely because of its stone for the traveller it is a city of buildings rather than of people stones are the life of the city there is a tradition of sacred stones stones in the form of byzantine crosses were set into the front of palaces arrangements of oval stones and stone crosses are found on many churches and houses above the gothic doorways are generally to be found tympana of stone carved with angels or with saints stone was a way of giving form to spirit there are stones of faith and there are stones of scripture with passages from the bible inscribed upon lintels and gateways there are stones of the law on which legal precepts and decrees were carved there are stones of punishment the sites of public justice and of execution there are stones of infamy to mark places of treachery and disgrace the words on one stone column declaring that it was erected in view of the public to be a terror to others and a warning for ever to all these tokens go very far back to the primitive belief in stone as the image of god found in cultures as diverse as those of india and celtic europe melanesia and the americas it happens that these beliefs were perpetuated by the very special circumstances of the floating city precious stones were also magical stones rilke once described venice as a stone fairy tale the venetian painters lavished their wealth of colour and of invention upon stone in carpaccio and veronese in bellini and tintoretto there are vistas upon vistas of stone it is the landscape of their imagination the public buildings of venice elicited from them a profound veneration and respect the staircases and columns the hallways and turrets are their real subject their sensibility lies behind canalettos later meticulous rendering of the citys architecture canalettos painting the stonemakers yard is a meditation upon the power and potential of stone his canvases were generally prepared with a brickred ground but venice has a secret it is also accurate and appropriate to describe it as a city of masonry it is in large part built with brick artfully faced with marble or with stucco in the most profound sense it is deceptive the great palaces are constructed out of brick the churches and the dwellings are of brick it is in truth a city of baked clay taken from the earth of the mainland yet it is clothed with marble and limestone in homage to the sea rather than to the earth the brick and stone of venetian buildings have on occasions been compared to the flesh and bone of the human body the glow of limestone has been likened to the glow of flesh so the stones may live and move the stones of venice seem light the buildings are aerated ready to rise from their moorings and soar into the empyrean when the narrator of prousts time regained stumbles in the entrance of the hôtel des guermantes in paris he is thrown back in time to the moment when he stood upon two uneven paving stones in the baptistery of saint marks the moment of vision afforded him overwhelming happiness obliterating time and space in a euphony of sensation between past and present the stones of venice brought him joy and indifference to death many legends and superstitions surround the stone of venice in some veined marbles strange shapes appear on a wall of saint marks for example two slabs of marble were sawn apart they revealed the image of a bearded hermit with his hands folded in prayer there is scarcely a stone in that edifice that has not been sanctified by legend or report here is to be found the rock from which moses drew water here are stones upon which christ walked or upon which his blood was spilled on the wall facing the piazzetta beside the basilica are two groups of porphyry images it is believed that they are four saracens who were turned to stone in the act of robbing the basilica of its sacred treasures in another part of venice by the salizzada del pignater there is lodged above an arch a heart made of brick if two lovers touch it their passion will last for ever statues suddenly move or vanish on the night of good friday the statue of judas in the madonna dellorto was said to rise in flight for jerusalem he was accompanied by the stone images of justice and of faith on the roof of the same church the statue of a merchant still to be seen in front of one venetian house was supposed to cry in february when the air was colder than any stone the good and the innocent if they placed their hands upon the breast of the merchant would hear his heart beating many of the legends of the city are preoccupied with one central fearthat the stone will come alive there are stories of stone lions bounding into life of wizards that could turn stone into flesh of a column by saint marks that on foggy nights secreted blood if venice has turned the natural world into stone its secret longing might be to reverse the miracle and once more to become fresh and yielding stone represents the longing to die a tendency and a yearning to be found in every city god created the natural world as the venetians were taught but humankind made the city after his murder of abel cain became the founder of cities cities represent the primal curse and the abandonment of natural ties venice is their avatar giovanni bellinis portrait of the earlysixteenthcentury doge leonardo loredan note the sumptuousness of the dress and the strict serenity and reticence of his gaze this severity was part of the official imagery of the venetian state photo credit i a seventeenthcentury painting attributed to joseph heintz depicting an audience with the doge in one of the chambers of the ducal palace the government of venice had perfected the art of selfpresentation every political act had its own ceremonial all the actions and decisions of the state were hallowed by tradition and sanctioned by divine authority photo credit i three eighteenthcentury venetian lawyers depicted by pietro uberti they were dressed for the part and indeed every venetian was clothed according to rank and status the lawyers had an especial place in venetian life where it was believed that the people were more fond of talking than of doing there was a saying to the effect that a venetian law only lasted for seven days before being forgotten photo credit i an earlyfifteenthcentury tempera by jacobello del fiore depicting justice and the archangels the justice of venice became one of the myths of venice it was deemed to be ancient it was deemed to be divinely inspired it was related in ultimate form to the judicial salvation of humankind photo credit i a photograph of the lions mouth in the ducal palace where evidence of scandal or wrongdoing was posted it was one of the many mouths that became a postbox for accusations against any venetian the lions mouth was of course a venetian invention it was the mouth of the city a capacious orifice of whispers and rumours it meant that there was a general atmosphere of surveillance even in the most private quarters of the city photo credit i an eighteenthcentury engraving of pozzi prison of venice the pozzi were the wells of venice and this underground dungeon close to the waters was named after them it had a reputation for noisomeness with the suggestion that it were better to be entombed alive than to be lowered into the hole photo credit i dream of saint ursula painted by vittore carpaccio in the sacred interior is directly modelled upon venetian interiors here are two doublearched windows and two white greek vases with a plant in each the lower walls are covered with green cloth there is a readingtable covered by a red cloth and a very small threelegged stool covered with crimson cloth on the table are a book and an hourglass photo credit i the tailor by pietro longhi this eighteenthcentury painting portrays one of the most important figures in venetian patrician society the venetians had a keen eye for fashion and for striking colour they manifested an almost childlike delight in dressing up the patrician women of venice like the lady in the painting in particular loved sumptuous attire photo credit i the geography lesson by pietro longhi the venetians were expert and famous cartographers they were looking for fixity and certainty in their watery world they were guided by the twin imperatives of trade and of travel both of them embodied in the figure of marco polo in this painting a fashionable patrician lady consults a globe with a pair of compasses in her right hand an open atlas lies at her feet photo credit i the perfume seller by pietro longhi perfume was one of the many luxuries in which venice traded it might be expected in a most unnatural city that everything was scentedhats shirts socks handkerchiefs even the money was scented note the ladies in carnival costume a mantle of silk or velvet that covered the head and shoulders known as the bauta photo credit i a wooden image of the madonna of mercy carved and painted in the sixteenth century images of the virgin were displayed everywhere in venice hers was a popular devotion there were many shrines on the corners of the calli with a votive lamp burning before the virgin there was not a venetian home however humble without its picture of the virgin photo credit i madonna and child enthroned with two devout people painted in the fourteenth century by paolo veneziano this painting has the form and quality of an icon and indeed images of the madonna were venerated in venice as the workers of miracles the virgin was also the archetypal mother in whose capacious embrace the sons and daughters of venice could rest photo credit i the coronation of the virgin by giovanni battista the cult of mary penetrated every aspect of venetian society there were more than three hundred altars in the fifteenth century devoted to the worship of the virgin venice was the virgin too because she had never been assaulted she was inviolate and immaculate protected by the waves of the sea like a precious girdle mary is peace peace is stability photo credit i the tempest painted by giorgio da castelfranco otherwise known as giorgione in the early fifteenth century in his study of this quintessentially venetian artist the english critic walter pater declared that all art constantly aspires towards the condition of music in venice oil paint can be liquid music photo credit i young woman at her toilet by giovanni bellini this painting of is evidence that the venetians believed colour or colorito to be the mother of painting they enjoyed the bliss of its warm and capacious embrace colour was soft and intimate and harmonious that is why venetian painting has often been associated with the depiction of the female nude the naked woman can be said to be the invention of the venetian artists of the sixteenth century photo credit i venus of urbino by titian detail the sensuousness and voluptuousness of venetian art are most clearly seen in the female nudes of titian planes and lines are supplanted by curves his art is alive it captures the movement and the appearance of life it captures the effect of the transient moment it is ardent it has no sense of calculation or theory photo credit i iii ship of state let it be everlasting the cry in saint marks square was always that of marco marco invoking the saint of the city on his deathbed the greatest theologian of venice paolo sarpi breathed the words esto perpetualet venice last for ever yet by the time he murmured this blessing in the city had become a state in more than name it had become one by deed and example the abstract concept of the state did not emerge until the first half of the sixteenth century but the idea of the common good was of course very much older the common good had created venice in the first place the first mention of the commune venetiarum can be traced to the beginning of the twelfth century when civic dignitaries wished to supplant the power of doge and people from this time forward we can chart the growth of a bureaucratic state with its administrators and its diplomats its governors and its laws the local ties of parishes and the wards known as contrade were weakened with a decline in the number of religious ceremonies designed to celebrate them instead there emerged the notion of a unified and united city expressed in numerous public works and relayed by public decrees a new form of urban life was being created at once more efficient and impersonal public order was confirmed and controlled by public means the people had once created the city the city now created the people or more exactly the people of venice now identified themselves in terms of the city the private had become public the city had become a totality certain criminal acts for example were described as being contrary to the public will thus conflating the people with the city by the fifteenth century at the latest we may speak of the formation of the venetian state it was known as the signoria roughly meaning sovereignty or lordship so how did this city become a state and indeed a forerunner of the modern state it is a perplexing question related to complex rituals of selfawareness and communal selfrespect it emerged together with a wellsupervised system of public finance sustained by such mechanisms as credit and bills of exchange some of the first banks in the world were located in venice the first public loans were issued in that city in the banco del giro was established in a state cannot survive without internal stability governed by law the venetians were always proud of the nature of their justice however flawed its administration might become yet the law behind all laws was in the words of one english ambassador at the beginning of the seventeenth century reason of state the state was eternal the state was the source of all morality it had an almost byzantine rigour and prestige but there are more practical matters to consider a state needs a broadly defined elite that will exercise power in the apparent interest of all by the end of the thirteenth century the governance of venice was vested in the hands of a patriciate that was legally defined and of course the security of the constitution was intrinsically important to the security of trade power and commerce were inseparable such a general administration needs a bureaucracy to supervise such matters as public health and public order the bureaucracy of venice was one of the wonders of the western world everything was committed to writing as the overflowing archives of modern venice will testify at a time when other cities or other nations had only the most rudimentary internal organisation venice was already a model of administrative expertise the census of population was carried on more frequently and with more efficiency in venice than in any other city it was said by jacob burckhardt in the civilisation of the renaissance that venice can fairly make good its claim to be the birthplace of statistical science every aspect of social and cultural life was closely ordered even the sale of fruits in saint marks square and of flowers on the steps of the basilica was monitored and controlled the rise of bureaucracy helped to foster accounts and treatises on the arts of government texts that played a large part in the formation of what has become known as civic humanism of course in the actual practice of government and statecraft there were always large doses of opportunism and corruption of relativism and pragmatism but they flourished all the more for being easily concealed behind the imposing order of the public administration a state needs a measure of conformity among its inhabitants the city can survive with rowdy or antagonistic citizensin some ways it thrives upon thembut the early venetian state needed a measure of internal control no city had more success in ordering its people than venice the doge and the various councils exercised in a literal sense the art of power any words of offence or what we might now call speech crimes were prosecuted for being contra honorem huius civitatisagainst the honour of this stateand rewarded with a period of imprisonment foreigners who spoke disparagingly of la serenissima were banished in the secret correspondence of a venetian diplomat published by alfred de musset was found the entry to pay to signor a the sum of fifty scudi for having killed the signor s who spake ill of the republic of venice it was the state that the venetians were meant to serve it was continually asserted that it had been bequeathed to them by their diligent forefathers and that they should deem it more precious than their own lives they were in honour bound to preserve it the key to venice was exactly therepreservation the city itself was from the beginning a miracle of preservation and it felt the need to invoke that miracle again and again in its threatened and embattled position as the public edicts suggested it needed a coherent and obedient body of citizens to sustain it this is the reason for the relative tranquillity of venice over the centuries it springs from its origin power sprang from the place itself in the constant awareness of collective survival but the state emerges from an awareness and a celebration of power venice became strong because its immediate neighbours were weak there was no city to challenge its authority over the adjacent mainland yet eventually it became a citystate depending on its command over other cities it was never a question of a natural territory outlined by rivers and mountains but a confederation of separate urban entities it created an empire of cities in northern italy now won now lost now exchanged so we are presented with an image of a highly authoritarian very well organised and exceptionally efficient enterprise this may not consort well with the modern picture of a beautiful and serene if on occasions drowsy city but it is the necessary precondition of its contemporary form venice is now and for ever will be because of what once it was the signoria thereby became the object of a secular religion honoured and commemorated in literally hundreds of communal rituals spread through the year a large bureaucracy was created precisely to organise and to administer these festivals even at the time of the siege of venice surrounded by austrian troops in scarcely a month or even a week passed without the celebration of a fête or pageant it was in the blood the venetian people were temperamentally inclined to spectacle and display the city itself was designed for elaborate ceremony and in saint marks square the theatre of operations gifts were presented and greetings were exchanged it is a measure of the order of the state that strict custom and formality guaranteed the order of the rituals various groups carried variously coloured candles the banners flown had their own code white when venice was at peace green when a period of truce had intervened and red when open warfare had been declared the ducal processions in particular were viewed as the venetian constitution in motion they were the living embodiment of sacred and secular governance in other cities and in other states according to a milanese observer in the moment the prince has passed all go pellmell and without any order but in venice everyone goes in the best order imaginable there were engravings and paintings of the entire sequence with each participants role clearly defined by attitude or by costume in the sixteenth century matteo pagan executed a remarkable series of eight woodcuts detailing every participant in the procession there were the eight standard bearers followed by certain judicial officials there were the six musicians sounding silver trumpets there were the squires of the foreign ambassadors followed by the ducal squires there were more musicians followed by minor officials such as the clerks and the notaries and so it goes on the procession itself fashioned into three large groupings in which religious authority and state power were weighed and balanced it was not a procession of persons but a procession of officeholders in the middle walked the doge the centre was the heart of power radiating out from that centre rippling through the procession were the classes and hierarchies in due order the citizens walked before him in ascending levels of rank the nobles walked after him in descending levels of rank it was observed by some that the patricians were notably benevolent they smiled a great deal there was a general atmosphere of calm and serenity on certain occasions in venetian history that was the greatest act of all the celebrations were not necessarily of an uplifting nature at the festival of the epifania on january certain rowing men were dressed as old women wearing carrots strapped to their noses and trailing old stockings they raced to the rialto bridge at the feast of giovedí grasso in february a bull and several pigs as well were ceremonially slaughtered by the guild of locksmiths in saint marks square in a later part of the ceremony the doge and certain senators attacked with staves and then knocked down some lightly built wooden castles the ceremony was in effect the reproduction of a venetian victory over the parent city of aquileia is politics transformed into game or is the game a form of politics there were other festivities when the doge visited various quarters of the city when he entered the parish of s maria formosa for example he was given a hat of gilded straw a bottle of wine and several loaves of bread at the close of the proceedings twelve wooden statues of women were taken in procession to the church whereupon they were pelted with turnips the ritual was said to derive from an occasion when twelve venetian maidens were carried off by pirates before being rescued by the young men of the parish it is all most improbable it is more likely to represent a primitive phase of venetian experience when the young women of wealthy families were all married on the same day as part of a fertility ritual but thus do folklore and festivity take on strange shapes it was the custom in the city to call a frigid or disdainful woman a wooden mary the word marionette may spring from the same source there were so many venetian festivals that in the end one day was chosen to commemorate several different celebrations it had become in essence a ritual city that is why certain pathways were chosen churches were sited at focal points where theatre and piety converged public spaces became ceremonial axes part of the vast geometry of the sacred city it was a society of the spectacle land and water were conjoined in a variety of festivals visually and emotionally the various districts or sestieri were also woven together in acts of homage and of celebration the processions represented the collective hope of the city just as they memorialised the collective experience of the city ritual promised continuity and harmony ritual also assisted in the shaping of time within the city it was seen to obey ceremonial law rather than the diurnal round of minutes and of hours ritual also helped to codify and identify the past there were perhaps less elevated aspects of the show the pageantry impressed foreigners and ambassadors with the solidarity and wealth of the venetian people these festivals like those of modern venice also helped to lure tourists to the always alluring marketplaces of the city the venetians never lost a chance for making money the same practicality lay behind the institution of the carnival and of course all the art and film biennales of more recent years the festivals therefore brought much of the city into play the paintings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries show all the windows and balconies of the houses draped in ornate carpets there were many elaborate floats and wheeled chariots displaying the cardinal virtues or the saints of the city there were large displays of decorative architecture there was music and singing there were paintings and sculptures and recitations there were stages or scaffolds for theatrical performances in which the political events of the day were reinterpreted in the form of allegory at the festival of the sempiterni in a painted globe of the universe was floated upon gondolas along the grand canal within the globe a masked ball was conducted the pageant was a method of reinventing life as a form of art it represented the very highest form of popular consciousness which is why all classes of venetian society participated in it so the population of venice walked in measure along the sacred routes with each person knowing his or her own place in the general enterprise it was hoped too that the common people the popolani would in the general mood of rejoicing forget that the liberties they once enjoyed had been lost irrecoverably spectacle was of course another way of procuring social order the same milanese observer of mentioned that one single person appeared to me to direct everything and he was obeyed by everyone without protest only the great hierophantic societies such as those of egypt or of ancient mexico have achieved such order it is one of the singular facts about venice that its religion should have such an atavistic hold upon its people the reason for it may lie in the peculiar merging of place with piety the earth of venice was sacred miraculously saved from the waters of the world the people of venice were part of that earth the government of venice thereby perfected the art of selfpresentation it became an exercise in style it evolved into a unique form of rhetoric by which all the actions and decisions of the state were hallowed by tradition and sanctioned by divine authority the especial providence of venice was invoked together with the concepts of glory and resolution and independence the immortality of venice was also assured it could most kindly be described as a means of emphasising idealities but it could also be criticised as a wilful disregard of realities it might also be seen as a fog of fine sentiment no less dense than the fog coming in from the sea veiling the greed and ruthlessness of la serenissima in most of her dealings with the outer world no other people placed so much reliance upon the devices of rhetoric it was a city of performance poetry was understood and considered as a form of oratory in an essentially pragmatic culture such as that of venice the whole art of literary education was to inculcate the techniques of rhetoric the artistic life of the city in music and in painting was attuned to expressive performance it emphasised that which was shown rather than that which is meditated or intuited whether we are listening to the music of vivaldi or gazing at the canvases of tintoretto we are engaged with an art of effect of dazzling virtuoso performance of bravura exercise the facility of tintoretto and the fluency of vivaldi may also be understood in terms of the rhetorical concept of copia or plenty the textbooks of venetian rhetoric demonstrate a native form of eloquence depending upon moderation and propriety in the manner of the state itself variazione or variety must be used to temper extremes and avert the dominance of any one style it was part of venetian reserve and discretion in an eighteenthcentury treatise an account of the manners and customs of italy variously attributed to giuseppe baretti and samuel sharp it is remarked that the venetians value themselves much on their forcible eloquence and think that their advocates are the only legitimate offspring of the ancient roman orators an earlier legal advocate leonardo giustiniani declared in a letter of that there is no kind of case no type no topic finally no precept of the entire art of rhetoric in which i must not be proficient from the earliest times the administration of venice was steeped in rhetoric that is the reason why of all the venetian arts of government the most finely tuned was that of diplomacy the ambassadors of venice were unrivalled in the arts of graceful selfpresentation with the attendant emphasis upon appearance and demeanour these were the elements of sprezzatura which can be defined as the ability to create an effect while concealing the art or skill involved in so doing concealment and double nature came instinctively to the representatives of venice it was the first city to maintain a continuous diplomatic presence outside the confines of italy it had established an embassy to the court of france in the principle and stated aim of la serenissima was to maintain peace with all parties only in those circumstances could trade truly flourish war may have been good for the armament trade but not for the convoys of spices and other goods that were carried across sea and land when in edward iii of england desired that venice should pledge not to lend assistance to his enemies the doge replied it is not the custom of the venetians to interfere between disputants or belligerents except for the sake and purpose of making peace the venetians were expert at the polite rebuff from the sixteenth century their policy was one of strict neutrality a noncommittal approach to all who wished to involve venice in the affairs of other states or cities the venetian system of government was established upon a coherent pattern of equivalence and balance it seems likely that they applied the same notion to foreign affairs in the days of political decline however this apparent neutrality was condemned as the cover of timidity and irresolution venices diplomacy was described as occhiuta or manyeyedprudent discreet circumlocutory conciliatory and practical it was cloaked by dolce maniera a term for mildness or sweetness derived from music but behind that mask the venetian ambassadors probed for weakness and prejudice they were not averse to bribery and other forms of corruption and they watched everything looking for grievances they might exploit they were masters of intrigue they played state against state not scrupling to incite one city against another if it suited their purpose they were dishonourable in their pursuit of venetian honour the most famous diplomatic innovation of the venetians was in fact the report that all ambassadors were obliged to present to the senate after their tour of duty was complete these were called relazioni utterly unlike any other ambassadorial documents in which the diplomat was obliged to report if he has learned anything of the country from which he comes worthy of being heard and pondered by prudent senators for the benefit of the fatherland his survey would include such matters as military preparedness economic conditions the health and character of the sovereign no detail was considered too trivial to be overlooked on the principle that knowledge is power venice was a city of foreign ambassadors too who came to the city seeking for information they were greeted with elaborate ceremony and all the panoply of state but this was the rhetoric rather than the substance of their welcome when sir henry wotton the english ambassador of the early seventeenth century made a proposal for submission to the doge he received the most nebulous possible response the doge was forbidden by law to make any specific reply and in the words of wotton could only float in generalities so the ambassadors needed all the guile and patience they could muster wotton also noticed that the doge and his advisers favoured delay and stealth in matters of state ambivalence and ambiguity were the ground of their considerations this may have been beneficial in times of peace but in times of danger it was a positive disadvantage it is perhaps instructive that it was wotton who offered the famous opinion that an ambassador is a man of virtue sent to lie abroad for his country only the atmosphere of venice could have prompted such a conclusion the chosen people venice has always been a city of myth the collective need of the people for reassurance and identity has the consequence of creating a fantasy city based upon idealised selfrepresentation by the thirteenth century it had created a closed political order that allowed it to claim unity and inviolability by the fourteenth century the venetians had assumed the mantle of the chosen people by the early fifteenth century venice had fashioned itself as the new rome with its own mainland empire but the real myth of venice arose in the early sixteenth century in the years immediately following the citys struggles against an alliance of its enemies known as the league of cambrai when the european powers were ranged against it the defeat of venice followed later by the restoration of most of its territories had a double consequence it was felt that the city was vulnerable but that it was also invincible from this potent mixture of anxiety and reassurance there emerged a doctrine that expressed the permanence and harmony of la serenissima the idea of an aggressive and victorious republic was replaced by the myth of an illustrious city of peace it was in this period that the architecture of the city took its classical shape the plan of the city became a metaphor for order and grandeur the city became known primarily for its art and for its music ruskin believed that the myth of a nation or tribe is formulated at the time of its utmost power but that is not necessarily the case the myth of venice was prompted by observable weakness that had somehow to be concealed from the outside world even after it had effectively forfeited its authority it still displayed itself as a proud and powerful city the ingredients of this myth can be distinguished in a close reading the venetian state was founded by miracle and governed by providence it was immune from external invasion it was immutable it had survived for a thousand years according to a chronicle without ever changing every other city in the world had lost its liberties frequently or infrequently but venice had never once been oppressed in james howell wrote in a survey of the signorie of venice were it within the reach of humane brain to prescribe rules for fixing a society and succession of people under the same species of government as long as the world lasts the republic of venice were the fittest pattern on earth both for direction and imitation venice represented an idea that was itself eternal it was supposed to embody a harmonious mingling of all forms of government it was at once democratic with its great council aristocratic with its senate and monarchical with its doge the idea of balance and of stability is of course paramount for a city resting upon the sea thus james howell could write that venice is as dextrous in ruling men as in rowing of a gallie or gondola it aspired to be a veritable commonwealth of liberty it was free from civil unrest and internecine warfare its political debates were conducted in an air of refinement and sagacity it was a city therefore devoted to the common good there was no room for individual ambition or private greed the princes of other lands were ruled by the passion for selfaggrandisement and by the imperatives of temporary necessity but as pope alexander vi told the venetian ambassador in rome in you are immortal insomuch as your signoria government never dies it was compared with the phoenix the bird that regularly renews itself so the city was selfconscious and confident enough to turn itself into one continual allegory the rulers of venice were acclaimed as epitomes of wisdom and fraternity in the ceiling panels of the ducal palace they are shown at the feet of the saviour or in the light of the holy spirit it was related that there was no discord between them all united in the cause of the republic they were devoted and impartial in their dealings never allowing private interests to affect their judgement there was no room for corruption or individual ambition effectively they were anonymous servants of the divine order of the state that is why they conventionally dressed in black and in public were urged to preserve a decorous and dignified appearance the doge was invariably of great age confirming the notions of wisdom and experience it was a great play but it served its purpose particularly in fooling foreigners and what of the citizens philippe de commynes an ambassador from fifteenthcentury flanders was astonished to see the venetians lining up to pay their taxes at such a rate that the tax collectors could not keep pace with them the motive here may have been fear rather than devotion yet this much is true the city did indeed have the capacity to instil fervour in the hearts of its inhabitants as early as the thirteenth century a paduan chronicler exclaimed oh happy commune of venice that happy city where the citizens in their every manifestation have the common interest so much at heart that the name of venice is held as divine it was the seat of wisdom the ducal palace was considered to be another palace of solomon it was the home of justice the sculptured image of venice was based upon the figure of justice with the sword in one hand and the scales in her other it was the seat of learning it was the seat of liberty it had never been the subject of any other power or empire it had ceded no authority to west or east its inhabitants were bound together in a mutual covenant in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that liberty took a different form in the carnivalesque society of art and theatre and sex that became notorious throughout europe but the later liberty was based upon the perhaps more virtuous original the city quickly acquired olympian characteristics the great staircase in the ducal palace known as the scala dei giganti was surmounted by the images of mars and neptune venus was always part of the myth of venice the images of jupiter and minerva mercury and apollo are still to be seen in saint marks square the great paintings depicting the figures of classical mythology were created in venice rather than in their more natural home of rome mount olympus was to be found in the heart of the city by the midseventeenth century the myth of venice had become in england a paragon of harmony and continuity all the more alluring in a country that had witnessed civil war and regicide it was seen as a model of republican virtue in which patrician and citizen for which the english read lords and gentlemen shared authority it also became a model for the intellectuals of the enlightenment who saw in its proceedings a genuine compact between rulers and ruled it became an inspiration to the makers of the american constitution it is the nature of humankind to idealise to indulge in excessive praise as well as unjust condemnation the daily texture of life in venice was neither harmonious nor free the government was often corrupt and ineffectual there were many who disparaged the city all the more fiercely because of its pretensions to grandeur in the seventeenth century it was depicted as the home of assassins and sodomites far from being free it was an oligarchy it was a tyranny its symbol was the torture chamber of the council of ten its true emblem was the dungeon in the late twentieth century too some revisionist historians emphasised the greed and oppression endemic in a ruling class based solely upon birth a parade of triumphalism provokes hate and resentment there were many scholars who considered venices version of its history mere trumpery it was a fake the venetians holding themselves aloof from the rest of italy were derided as misers and fishermen they were as treacherous and unpredictable as the water on which they lived the city of merchants was denounced for its insatiable cupidity cosimo de medici described them as unblushing liars indeed their rulers and ambassadors were known throughout europe for their doubledealing they had so great a reverence for the state that they would stoop to the lowest practices in order to maintain it there is some truth in all of these allegations at a later date dh lawrence described it as an abhorrent green slippery city many visitors have been unmoved by its charms professing to find it superficial tacky and unhealthy it is hard to know whether the people themselves or the rulers of venice were ever gullible enough fully to subscribe to the myth of venice but that myth has never wholly died in the early seventeenth century giovanni priuli apostrophised venice as a terrestrial paradise two hundred and fifty years later john ruskin one of the many englishmen who have been entranced by venice described it as the paradise of cities he was speaking in a time when venice had lost its authority its trade and its independence so the myth goes on venice still remains the exemplary city it is unique there is no doubt about that that is what led to its success the location of the city is obviously singular and from this everything else in its history sprang you may see in the seed the whole created being the union of water and earth allowed it to neglect or to transcend the ordinary practices of european states it had to invent a new way of life venice belonged to no particular element just as it belonged to no other authority goethe decided that the peculiar circumstances of the city in the lagoon required that the venetian is bound to develop into a new kind of being the venetian political system of incredible complexity and subtlety designed to balance and harmonise the various councils and jurisdictions was like no other on earth in the endless letters of travellers the predominant note is one of wonder at its difference thus lady mary wortley montagu wrote in the middle of the eighteenth century that it was a great town very different from any other you ever saw and a manner of living that will be quite new to you in the american author james fenimore cooper observed that he was in the centre of a civilisation entirely novel the abiding charm of venice lies in the fact that it is always new and always surprising it is somehow always renewed by the enthusiasm and wonder of its visitors so it is that the italian writer of the early twentieth century gabriele dannunzio asked if you know of any other place in the world like venice in its ability of stimulating at certain moments all the powers of human life and of exciting every desire to the point of fever the venetians were well aware of their uniqueness too they had a lively conviction of their own difference they believed that their city was born as a place of refuge from the barbarians no less than from the sea and enjoyed the especial status it conferred upon them they trusted in their especial and superior destiny if this resulted in a certain arrogance towards other italian citystates then so be it it might also lead to complacency of course which had less certain consequences so for others it enjoyed a visionary quality it was the city of earthly beauty it seemed so fragile and yet it was in reality very strong it floated upon the water like an optical illusion petrarch described it as representing another world by which he might have meant a double image of this world this was the effect it had upon rilke upon wagner and upon proust in invisible cities italo calvino describes a visionary city with the steps of marble palaces descending into the water of bridges and canals without end of balconies platforms domes campaniles island gardens glowing green in the lagoons greyness kublai khan asks the narrator marco polo whether he has ever seen a city such as this the venetian replies that i should never have imagined that a city such as this could exist in this context calvino himself said of invisible cities that every time i describe a city i am saying something about venice venice is in that sense the purest city of all it is invariably associated with dream henry james described his sojourn in venice as a beautiful dream venice he wrote is quite the venice of ones dreams but it remains strangely the venice of dreams more than of any appreciable reality to those visiting the city for the first time it seems strangely familiar in this it resembles the landscape of dreaming so for proust the city was one that i felt i had often dreamed before the calli are so labyrinthine that the passersby seem suddenly to disappear it is a common experience for visitors after a perplexing walk to find themselves back at the place from which they started but this may be a dream of oppression a dream of being beguiled into a maze this induces fear as well as amazement charles dickens in pictures from italy invoked his whole journey through the city as an oneiric adventurei passed into my boat again and went on in my dreambut it is one that has the qualities of nightmare with intimations of horror and of darkness beneath the surface of the fantasy or vision lie dismal awful horrible stone cells it is an unreal city because it seems to have no foundations like the landscape of a dream never did a city seem so dreamlike and unreal william dean howells her aspect is like a dream byron dreamlike hugo von hofmannsthal this dreamlike town rainer maria rilke the life of a venetian is like a dream disraeli when you are at venice it is like being in a dream john addington symonds dreamlike and dim but glorious john ruskin the city of my dreams george sand that waking dream of beauty frances trollope we have been in a sort of halfwaking dream all the time mark twain it is perhaps significant that these testimonies all date from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries they are part of a culture in which the interior life first came to prominence as an object of study once more the city infinitely malleable and fluid satisfied the cultural expectations of a new period it breathed the spirit of the age sigmund freud visited venice on several occasions he mentions the city in the interpretation of dreams as the site of one of his own most disturbing dreams it was of a warship passing over the lagoon it can hardly be doubted then that venice still exerts some strange power over the human imagination to walk around the city is to enter a kind of reverie water instils memories of the past made all the more real by the survival of the ancient brick and stone the presence of water may also induce the emergence of unconscious desires and fantasies the uterine embrace of the womb has already been mentioned it has always been a city of luxuries and luxuries are dreamedof things the most important venetian text of the early modern period is entitled hypnerotomachia poliphili or the strife of love of poliphilus as veiled in a dream it is a recondite and anonymous work the meaning of which remains unclear but it is concerned in large part with the transition between illusion and reality there are dreams and dreams within dreams revealed in a series of architectural conceits in this respect it is wholly venetian in spirit the

women were locked up at home as if in prison dickens dreams of dungeons when he floats along the canals of venice and meditates upon scenes of dreadful night when the monk came at midnight to confess the political offender the bench where he was strangled the deadly little vault in which they tied him in a sack in the nineteenth century venice became a true image of horror the most famous adventure of the citys favourite son giacomo casanova concerns his escape from the venetian prison to which he had been consigned with its slops thrown into the canal and the scent of bilge water the city sometimes had the smell of the prisonhouse some of the most famous prisons in the world are to be found in venice the bridge of sighs itself named after the laments of those about to be gaoled is the most picturesque of all penitential emblems it was not in fact given that name until the nineteenth century largely by the happy inspiration of byron yet it serves the purpose and the image of venice very well when william beckford rode in his gondola beneath the bridge he invoked the memory of piranesi the artist born in the republic of venice whose enduring fame lies in his shadowy and vertiginous drawings of imaginary prisons despite his great success and renown in rome piranesi liked to sign himself as architetto veneziano from his gondola beckford looked up at the highest part of the prison and snatching his pencil i drew chasms and subterraneous hollows the domain of fear and torture with chains rocks wheels and dreadful engines these are some of the images summoned up by la serenissima the most feared and hated institution of the city was a judicial committee known as the council of ten it was created in as a direct result of a political conspiracy by a group of patricians and it soon became an indispensable part of the machinery of state by the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries it had acquired a power equivalent to that of the senate itself it concerned itself with the threat of lawlessness and unrest within the confines of the republic and thus its remit stretched very far it was an internal police force small and flexible enough it met in secret every day of the week its members wore black mantles and became known as the black inquisitors it employed secret agents in every part of the city and relied also upon a network of anonymous informants it never allowed the evidence to be given to the accused and its witnesses could not be crossquestioned the examinations of the accused were generally conducted in darkness and from the room of the three leaders of the council was a staircase leading directly to the dungeons and the chambers of torture its verdicts did not permit any appeal banishment or death by strangulation or by drowning followed very quickly it was according to rousseau a tribunal of blood equally horrible to the patricians and the people there is no doubt an element of exaggeration in rousseaus account and in those of others who liked to foster the myth of venice as a dark and vicious place but there can be no doubt that the reputation of the small council was the single most important element in the understanding of the venetian polity it symbolised the secret life of the city prisons were in a real sense part of the literal and metaphorical world of the venetians a fourteenthcentury notebook kept by a merchant contains a list of all the gaols of the city the most notorious prisons in venice were in fact part of the palace of the doge it was ordained that the doge himself should hold the keys with the unspoken suggestion that prisons supported the legitimacy and authority of the state there were prisons on both sides of the rio della paglia that flowed past the palace those on the ground floor were known as the wells for the reason that water often collected in them while those on the upper storey were called the leads after the slabs of lead that covered the roof just above them some of the individual dungeons had names such as the lion and the volcano the wells in particular had a reputation for noisomeness with the suggestion that it were better to be entombed alive than to be lowered into these holes but as with most aspects of venetian life there is more than an element of fantasy and mythmaking in these accounts the supposed horrors of the venetian gaols may be related to their proximity to water but they can be construed as part of the shadow world behind the ritual and masquerade that touched every aspect of venetian life what depths of torture and depravity might somewhere lie concealed in this fair city what is being masked the answer may benothing at all when the french forces invaded and overwhelmed venice in only one prisoner was found in the wells he had been imprisoned for sixteen years and on reentering saint marks square in broad sunlight he was struck blind and died shortly thereafter casanova was imprisoned in the leads and from the grating of his cell he saw rats of a fearful size wandering unconcernedly in the garret when he asked his gaoler about the scoundrels imprisoned with him he was told that on the contrary they were respectable people who for reasons known only to the authorities have to be sequestered from society it emphasised to him the horrible despotism to which he too had become a subject yet he escaped he fashioned an iron bar into a spike and cut his way out onto the rooftop his narrative of imprisonment and flight is a central story of venice itself it is generally believed that casanova died in bohemia on june but there is an unofficial story that he secretly returned to venice after the french revolution and lived there in anonymity it is also said that he practised certain necromantic rites that guaranteed him immortality some argue that he still lives in his uncorrupted body others believe that he is reborn in every venetian infant he really does represent therefore the genius loci he never really escaped after all the image of the prison has often been used to conjure up the mood and setting of the city like the jews in its ghetto its citizens are in a sense incarcerated surrounded by water as if they were confined in alcatraz no citizen was allowed to leave venice without official permission that is why there is relatively little crime in the city in a place where everyone is watching everybody else there is nowhere to hide the route to the mainland can easily be sealed off the venetian people were in addition heavily policed by the fourteenth century there was one policeman for every two hundred and fifty citizens with the laws enforced by the council of ten and the signori di notte or lords of the night there were also the chiefs of the wards and a secret force known as the sbirri it was reported that the sbirri dealt with offenders by throwing their cloaks over them and then having muffled them led them directly to the prison the elements of silence and concealment consort well with the popular image of the city they are of a piece with coercive legislation and constant observation there is or was very little privacy in venice the people are packed closely together the small communities of every parish were woven flesh to flesh the private space is small indeed just as private interests were subordinated to public needs and the individual subsumed within the larger community so privacy itself was considered to be of little importance all this may induce acute feelings of claustrophobia the people cannot escape one another let alone the clusters of islands on which they are immured secrets the shade of the prison house may also induce secrecy if privacy is a luxury then the keeping of secrets may become ever more urgent or obsessive the city of masks must in any case also be the city of secrets the venetians despite their apparent sociability are notoriously reticent they do not invite casual visitors into their homes in the portraits of venetians there is a general air of inscrutability they are painted for their office rather than for their person and their actual temperament or personality is not to be divulged they are impenetrable it was said of one doge that one never knows whether he loves or hates anything one public lecturer from another part of italy found it impossible to engage his audience of young venetian nobles in any form of political discussion when i ask them he wrote what people think say and expect about this or that movement in italy they all answer with one voice that they know nothing about the matter was this silence the result of fear or of distrust in a city where you could be banished on the evidence of suspicion alone who would willingly open their mouths after napoleon had conquered venice in he instigated a survey of the newly captured people he asked in particular what were venetian prejudices and opinions the native writers of the survey could not enlighten him since they said such questions admitted no answer no other city had so effectively silenced its inhabitants there were times in fact when indiscretion exacted a high price when two glassblowers escaped to foreign capitals with the secrets of their trade in the senate decreed that they should be assassinated by means of poison it was observed that on the rialto the bankers and merchants customarily spoke in hushed voices the government of the city was conducted in secrecy we might almost describe it as an oriental secrecy with secret meetings secret payments secret audiences secret decisions and secret deaths when new nobles were introduced to the business of government their oath of allegiance included the promise of faith and silence it is highly characteristic of venice one of the allegorical paintings in the doges palace is that of taciturnity there is a strange figure of stone on the edifice of saint marks it is of an old man leaning on crutches who has a finger to his lips it was said that venice was a secret oligarchy it not only kept its secrets but the nature of its own identity was also a secret the oath for the council of ten was jura perjura secretum prodere noliswear foreswear and reveal not the secret there are pages in the annals of government where the words non scribatur let it not be written are to be found other chronicles of venice were burned the archives of the government were secret the doge himself could not consult them unless he were accompanied by an official the keeper of the archives was a man who could neither read nor write in an eighteenthcentury text the chinese spy it is stated that silence is the emblem of this government everything is secret and cloaked in mystery political doings are covered by a thick veil of darkness in venice those who talk are buried alive in a tomb covered with lead thus it was said by a seventeenthcentury historian that the venetians are apt to be jealous of all ambassadors and to interpret all their actions as mysteries tending to conspiracy they discussed every word and action from whence they make great conjectures and draw mighty consequences of state no venetian official could speak to a foreign diplomat on pain of death or life imprisonment the boxes at the opera had little withdrawing rooms diplomats felt obliged to visit one of the several opera houses if only to discover secrets which would otherwise be hidden from them paradoxically the mute stealth of these proceedings encouraged suspicion and conspiracy venice was known as the city of conspiracies there was a violent altercation at a meeting of the senate in which the council of ten deemed to be so shameful that it was never to be mentioned oaths of secrecy were demanded from the members of that body many proposals and discussions put before the senate were also considered under strict vows of silence some dignitaries were imprisoned or sent into exile so that they could not speak out secrecy was for the public good when the senate deliberated for a month over the imprisonment of a venetian admiral for incompetence or malfeasance not one word reached the admiral himself until the moment he was seized and bound his friends who had argued passionately in his defence had not warned him when rumours of a great military defeat began to filter through venice in the early part of the sixteenth century the council of ten refused to discuss the issue and imprisoned anyone suspected of a loose tongue and there was at the end of the eighteenth century the case of the venetian secret it was a secret that sir joshua reynolds for example pursued to his death it concerned the warm texture of venetian painting how did the artists fabricate that golden and glowing tone reynolds even scraped down one of titians canvases in search of the secret one woman ann provis declared that she possessed it she said that it was contained in a copy of a lost text concerning the method and practice of the great venetian painters miss provis promised to reveal it but only in exchange for ready cash of course it was a confidence trick james gillray caricatured the whole affair in a print entitled titianus redivivus or the sevenwisemen consulting the new venetian oracle so venice was well known as a city of secrecy of mystery and of silence henry james described it as a place of endless strange secrets and in the portrait of a lady partly set in venice there is the almost unbearable tension of what has been left unsaid such an atmosphere perfectly suits the venetian genius for intrigue casanova said of his venetian contemporaries that their most prominent characteristic is to make a mystery of nothing in the past the venetians made a mystery of government or a mystery of love now they were happy to create mystery for the sake of mystery the gondolas were designed for secrecy with little cabins draped by blinds or by black cloth a venetian writer giovanni maria memmo wrote in that the houses of venice should have some secret doors where one can enter and exit without being seen by anyone venice is still in part a secret city it is a secret city of the living unseen by the many thousands of tourists who take up the public spaces that is why good restaurants are hard to find the venetians reserve them for themselves there are still streets that seem in retreat silent and secluded the watery element deepens that sense of seclusion and secrecy the canals render the streets remote and unfamiliar but secrecy is also the companion of anxiety and of shame those who preserve secrets may wish to conceal their real nature secrecy leads to dissimulation and playacting it was said that venetians never discussed their true motives in the affairs of the world yet secrecy is also an aspect of power that which is spoken can be denied or repudiated it can be tested and contradicted that which is unspoken remains most powerful the secret city takes the shape of a labyrinth it is a maze that can elicit anxiety and even fear from the unwary traveller it lends an element of intrigue to the simplest journey it is a city of deadends and of circuitous alleys there are twisting calli and hidden turnings there are low archways and blank courtyards where the silence is suspended like a mist there are narrow courts that terminate in water the natives do not lose their way but the traveller always gets lost it is impossible not to get lost but then suddenly as if by some miracle of revelation you find that for which you have been searchinga small church a house a restaurant will suddenly present itself to you the city gives you a present but then it is unlikely that you will ever find that place again kafka would have understood venice the concept of the maze or labyrinth is an ancient one it is a component of earth magic that according to some authorities is designed to baffle evil spirits the chinese believed that demons could only ever travel in straight lines it has also been said that the dead were deposited at the centre of the mazes that is why they retain their power over the human imagination the labyrinth of classical myth is that place where the young and the innocent may be trapped and killed but the true secret of the venetian maze is that you can never observe or understand it in its totality you have to be within its borders to realise its power you cannot see it properly from the outside you have to be closed within its alleyways and canals to recognise its identity the scheme of house numbers is difficult to understand in each sestiere they begin at number one and then snake through every street until they finish they reach into their thousands without the benefit of any reference to street or square the names affixed to the streets seem in any case to be different to the names printed in the maps of the city in fact the reality of venice bears no relation to any of the published guides and maps the shortest distance between two points is never a straight line so the network of venice induces mystery it can arouse infantile feelings of play and game wonder and terror it is easy to believe that you are being followed your footsteps echo down the stone labyrinth the sudden vista of an alley or a courtyard takes you by surprise you may glimpse a shadow or a silhouette or see someone standing in a doorway walking in venice often seems as unreal as a dream or rather the reality is of a different order there are times when the life of the past seems very closealmost as if it might be around the next corner the closeness of the past is embodied in the closeness of the walls and ways all around you here you can sense the organic growth of the city stone by stone you can sense the historical process of the city unfolding before you there is a phrase in ts eliots gerontion to the effect that history has many cunning passageways these are the passages of venice news travelled fast through the echoing calli venice was at the centre of news from east to west and from west to east in the early modern era it was the primary conduit of news in the world the correspondence of merchants from the thirteenth century was a significant source of information he who heard the news firstof an important transaction or the scarcity of a certain commoditywould profit most speed was of the essence the roads must be in good repair if possible and the ships swift venice was one of the first cities to organise a postal system the compagnia dei corrieri in the fourteenth century nevertheless it took four days for the mail to travel from nuremberg to venice it was the news and speculations that generated half the business of the rialto in fact venice would not have been the centre of commerce if it had not been the centre of news it came from all sidesfrom couriers on horseback from the reports of diplomats and from the letters of administrators information descended in torrents upon the marketplace once the news was known it was discussed there was an inn the golden ship where venetians would meet to recount their intelligences one with another thither also came merchants that were strangers some of the earliest coffee houses were established in venice for the particular reason of conveying information the human city could itself be described as a medium for the reception and exploitation of information venice the preeminent city was also surely preeminent here so the venetians ran after the latest news and the latest sensation yesterdays news was of no account the entries in the diaries of marino sanudo in the early sixteenth century were often prefaced with the phrase that news came that the venetians listened with elevated ears for the latest word or information there were reports known as notizie or avvisi read aloud to the populace who paid a small coin known as a gazzetta for the chance of hearing the latest rumours it is perhaps not surprising that this appetite for news was considered by some to be a contagion or a distemper sir henry wotton described news as the very disease of this city yet some news was more important than most in a letter of march wotton wrote from venice to his employer robert cecil of the strangest piece of news whereof here all corners are full it was the news of the new universe penetrated by galileo one resident of venice has been celebrated if that is the right word as the first of all journalists pietro aretino came to venice in in exile from the papal court at rome and for the next twentynine years threw himself into the public discourse of the city he wrote comic plays pornographic dialogues and religious works but he also thrived in the world of the weekly newspapers then circulating through venice an early biographer described him as the first great adventurer of the press he thrived upon the art of public selfimaging and described the affairs of the day in the language of the street he wrote pasquinades or flysheets that were distributed everywhere in the city and he refurbished the form of the giudizio or almanac local and immediate news was now the staple of the public prints he wrote on demand aretino turned news into a commodity in the style of any merchant of venice his writing smells of the turbulent city he thrived in the city and repaid the compliment by extravagantly praising his hosts in plays and letters so he was tolerated in truth he could have existed nowhere else it is not perhaps surprising that the first newspaper in the world the gazzetta emerged in venice at the beginning of the seventeenth century at various times in the following century one of the first modern journalists gasparo gozzi published losservatore veneto and la gazzetta veneta the latter established in was published twice a week its editor received news and subscriptions at four bureaux in the city there were news items advertisements conversations overheard in saint marks square menus questions and pleas by lonely hearts all venetian life is there from the story of the drunken porter who fell to his death from an open window to a list of the rates on the exchange it was one of a number of newssheets and newspapers and newsletters many of them simply publicised private scandals and quarrels they indulged in rumour and innuendo they reprinted personal letters and created a climate of acute social embarrassment for certain prominent venetians concerned about their good name or buona fama they were of a piece with the topical satires that were circulated through the streets the token of a city that was obsessed with its own communal life yet there is one thing missing the political debate of the city goes unnoticed and unremarked the government of venice was masked nevertheless venice was filled with rumour and intrigue there were spies everywhere the courtesans were spies the gondoliers were spies the state inquisitors had spies the council of ten had spies there were spies for the trade guilds who informed on any craftsmen or workers infringing the rules of business there were political spies employed to denounce any corruption in the processes of election or of government the spies spied on other spies and were in turn followed and watched there was heavy surveillance at the docks the point of entry for people as well as goods the abiding rule for foreigners and other interested parties was to stay silent as long as you did not talk you remained at liberty there is the story of vivaldi walking in saint marks square with a violinist from dresden johann pisendel he suddenly broke off the conversation and asked his friend to go home with him at once behind closed doors vivaldi then told pisendel that he had been observed by four officials vivaldi told his friend to remain within the house until he had discovered what offence if any pisendel had committed against the majesty of venice it turned out to be a case of mistaken identity but the fear had been there the mere experience of being observed had induced it one of the secretaries to the council of ten was an expert in the breaking of codes and secret ciphers every foreign embassy or foreign household in the city had one or more resident spies the foundations for foreign merchants like the fondaco dei tedeschi for the merchants of germany were packed to bursting with spies the venetian weighers and brokers on those premises were known to work for the government in a semiofficial capacity one great lady of venice elisabetta zeno held a salon for certain important senators behind a screen were hidden two clerks who for her later benefit noted down everything that was said when the venetians became informed of the conspiracy they suspended the senators from any public office elisabetta zeno herself was exiled for life to capodistria every venetian on foreign soil was expected to take on the role of spy as part of his or her civic duty the prelates of venice when in rome were expected to spy upon secret papal enclaves the venetian merchants who travelled to other lands or other cities were especially useful it is apposite too that in a mercantile state the language of merchants was used as a code the turks for example might be described as drugs and the artillery as mirrors in a fictionalised commodity market spying was a venetian employment and pastime people were always and still are watching other people in the city the state of the houses was such that surveillance could take place through cracks in the walls or floors the houses of the powerful were not exempt three youths were found to have broken through a section of the senate ceiling so that they could listen to an address by an ambassador recently returned from the ottoman court there were examples of professional and amateur informants throughout the city there was incentive too the accusers were rewarded if their information proved to be correct and their names kept secret in the honoured venetian fashion the venetians invented this particular form of harassment known as denuncia or denontia segreta it is still true that venetians if they find it necessary will inform on one another in a small place humiliation is the greatest punishment of all it was sometimes only necessary for the government to name and shame a culprit for the necessary sentence to have been executed of course the administration of the city thrived on the undermining of personal loyalties it was a measure of the success of the state that its people should conform to the greater good indeed the habit of denunciation might be seen as a thwarted or twisted expression of civic pride and civic belonging it is embodied in the bocca di leone the lions mouth to be found in various parts of the city the mouth generally carved on a grotesque and offensive head was a postbox for accusations against any venetian the accuser was obliged to sign the paper and include the signatures of two witnesses to his or her good name but the information could include anything from financial extravagance to licentiousness anonymous accusations were meant to be burned but in fact could be entertained if they involved matters concerning the security of the state this lions mouth was of course another venetian invention it was the mouth of the city a capacious orifice of whispers and rumours it meant that there was a general atmosphere of surveillance even in the most private quarters of the city there were even specific mouths designed to implicate those who cheated on their taxes or who adulterated oil a wife could inform upon a husband a son upon a father the practice was continued in venetian dominions in some venetian country houses on the mainland there was a bocca delle denoncie segrete where informants could accuse individuals working on the estate gossip and scandal were thereby the fuel of venice it was a network of small neighbourhoods each one resembled any country village in itself but packed together on an island the atmosphere of rumour became ever more intense all venice will know became a commonplace sentiment casanova complained that he was the talk of the city rumour spread very rapidly so that the street urchins knew the name of the next doge before it had been officially announced there was a general awareness of murmuring in the city the sisterinlaw of one of byrons venetian amoratas according to the poet told the affair to half venice and the servants to the other half rumour had a thousand tongues and as one venetian patrician put it everyone says what he pleases dreaming up something at night and spreading it in the morning rumour was the excrement of venice if you spread it thickly enough anything might grow wd howells in his venetian life commented that you must figure the meanness of a chimney corner gossip added to the bitter shrewdness and witty penetration of a gifted roué and you have some idea of venetian scandal the venetian gossips knew every trifle the talk was sometimes known as ciaccole or chitchat and the word itself expresses the littleness of the discourse the victims of course were excessively humiliated many of the popular songs of venice were concerned with the harm wreaked by mischievous gossip and by perjured tongues some victims were inclined to call upon divine protection a picture of a swooning madonna was to be donated by one venetian if his wife gave birth in time to avoid malicious gossip when a secretary of state in venice pietro antonio gratarol believed that he was being ridiculed in a play by carlo gozzi and had tried unsuccessfully to have it banned or censored he fled to padua without the permission of the venetian authorities and was eventually condemned to death in his absence but the ultimate penalty did not balance the fear of rumour and mockery he could not bear the malicious gossip nevertheless gossip was accepted as evidence in the courtroom it had a privileged status and was generally considered to be the prerogative of women and of servants but fruitvendors streetsellers and gondoliers were also called to give witness to what they had seen or heard there were murmurs about this or that the witnesses testified that the whole courtyard was there or that if one person says it everyone says it the most intimate secrets of a marriage were known to the community which was generally not averse to taking sides in any marital dispute it was quite common too for neighbours in such circumstances to enter the house or crowd the doorway the venetian idea of the common good was here lent a visible identity the comedies of goldoni are a perfect image of this unusual social life people come and go from one house to another doors and windows are perpetually open taverns and shops are close by so the conversation can be continued from living room to inn without any disturbance the campo or campiello is one large domestic space it is a curious fact that in venice public matters were held in inviolable secrecy while private affairs became public knowledge almost at once gossip may then have been a form of compensation neighbours and domestics would come into court in order to testify on oath they considered their evidence to be public knowledge so the people watched one another morning and night they studied one another it helped that they already knew each other by sight at the opera the opera glasses were characteristically trained upon the audience rather than the performance from a certain perspective however the members of the audience were the performance the venetians are still marked by their propensity for gossip strangers in a familiar setting are noted and if necessary reported to the police the telephone lines are always busy chronicles venice was the most conservative of societies it revered tradition it reverenced authority the city was always searching for an historical origin so it worshipped origins it venerated the past the respect for custom permeated every level and every aspect of venetian culture custom represented the inherited will and instinct of the people custom was the embodiment of the community there was a formulaic phrase used in public pronouncements to the effect that new legislation was simply following the most ancient customs of the city it was a form of reassurance custom was also considered to transcend positive or systematic law experience was always more important in venice than theory there would never be a revolution in the city the social life of the people was dominated by customs to disregard costume in matters such as churchgoing or hospitality was to invite criticism of all the things the venetians most dreaded the worst was public obloquy that is why they were often so lavish in public acts of generosity but frugal to the point of miserliness at home the artists of venice used a common and narrow range of iconography the architecture of the city is of course known for its traditionalism the form of the houses large and small remained unaltered for many centuries there was no change in structure or decoration if they fell down they were rebuilt on the same spot with the same principles and even with the same materials the remains of the previous building were used in the construction of the new one the foundations could always be reemployed petrified wood did not decay or burn in building instructions there is a consistent themerebuild this room according to its original dimensions do not let this wall be any higher than its predecessor reconstruct this house where it was previously perhaps it was the fear of fluidity of mobilitythe fear of waterthat instigated this stasis casanova said that the patricians of venice trembled at the mere idea of novelty power is itself a conservative force a venetian historian from the early seventeenth century paolo paruta noted that states are preserved by continuing the same traditions with which they were founded change encourages corruption even in the sphere of mercantile activity where the city was most expert there was a pronounced aversion to change it is often said that the venetians invented the art of doubleentry bookkeeping in fact the technique was invented in genoa the genoese minted the first gold coins drew up the first insurance contracts and made the first marine charts venice characteristically lagged fifty or more years behind it borrowed from others it did not create ab novo it feared and distrusted innovation only the forceful intervention of napoleon brought an end to a system that had endured for five hundred years without noticeable change it was until the sole example of a medieval citystate it was after all an island the venetians were obsessed with their history they produced the largest body of chronicles in the italian world extant from the fourteenth century are more than a thousand such texts the diaries of marino sanudo detailing the most inconsequential or tedious events of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries filled fiftyeight volumes in folio it is reported that at the age of eight he was making an inventory of the pictures in the ducal palace he like the other chroniclers was fascinated by the life of his cityits laws ceremonies trades customs treaties were considered to be of fundamental importance and interest it was a parochial vision perhaps but an understandable one the spirit of place spoke through him he could only truly be himself by acting as a medium for venice after the chronicles came the histories by the middle of the fifteenth century there were volumes with titles such as de origine et gestis venetorum the origin was just as important as the deeds the origin explained the deeds in andrea navagero was appointed to be the first official historian of venice a post in which he was expected to celebrate the constancy and invincible virtue of the city this was precisely the moment when the myth of venice was being formulated the concept of a state historiographer is itself an interesting one suggesting that the task cannot be left to free enquiry as with official biographers the art lies in concealment as much as revelation unfortunately navagero did not entirely succeed in his purpose and in his will he ordered that his notes and papers be burned he had perhaps revealed too much there then followed a succession of state historians who like the narrative painters of the sixteenth century united minute detail with a general celebration of venices sacred history they were always reshaping the myth to accommodate present circumstances they were descriptive and prescriptive with the sure belief that they were offering a practical guide of governance to those who came after them everything was to be explained and understood in terms of the historical ideal the historiographers were convinced that to chart the history would also be to reveal its manifest destiny tradition is the key in a city constantly nervous of its own survival in the sea duration itself was considered to be worthy of honour if it has endured it must be laudable the reverence for custom and tradition was not necessarily benign the political and economic decline of the city was not wholly of its own making but the inherent conservatism and traditionalism of the authorities impaired the possibilities of improvement and renewal the patricians reassured by their own claims to superiority often made signally disastrous decisions their exploitation and sack of constantinople in the company of allies led directly to the turkish conquest of the city on may venetian industry was injured by the restrictive practices imposed by the government as joseph addison put it the venetians were tenacious of old laws and customs to their great prejudice whereas a trading nation must be still for new changes and expedients as different junctures and emergencies arise they wished to guarantee for example their reputation for manufacturing luxuries so they emphasised quality at the expense of cost and quantity in an enlarging world economy this was a mistake there was a deep reluctance among the rulers of venice to confront a world of change that is why the arsenal the shipbuilding enterprise that had for a long period been the home of technological efficiency had become by the seventeenth century hopelessly out of date there was no renewal and no true renovation it may be that venice distrusted itself too much to be capable of change and made a strength instead out of sheer survival that is still its most enduring attraction so the city took on various historical guises to suit the imperatives of the period it reinvented itself as roman in the second quarter of the sixteenth century buildings were raised in the roman manner of public architecture these were heralded by the triumphal gateway to the arsenal itself it was the first exercise in venetian monumentality in the s shields and helmets of stone were attached to the basreliefs of the ducal palace in the face of threats from two empires of the hapsburg charles v and of suleiman the magnificent venice laid claim to the inheritance of the greatest of them all rome was the context for her particular historical mission even the constitution was said to be derived from roman originals the patrician families of the city began to find roman ancestors through whom they could plausibly hope to inherit ancient virtus the cornaro family traced their clan to the cornelii and the barbaro to ahenobarbus the dark gown of the governing class was known as a toga as if the senators of venice would be as much at home in the forum as in saint marks square the historians of the city identified their founding fathers with the refugees from troy who were supposed to have established rome itself it was all a great charade but there comes a time when a nation or nationstate will embrace the most absurd or extravagant claims in order to bolster its sense of identity so by the sixteenth century the venetians were calling themselves the new romans there was in any case a fascination for antiquity there were antiquities begged or borrowed or stolen everywhere in venice classical sculptures and trophies were set up in public places there were many famous antiquarians there were also notorious forgers who could knock up a piece of roman statuary or a classical bronze without any difficulty in a similar spirit the governors of venice would sometimes proclaim that a certain activitylet us say educationhad been preserved from the foundation of the city this was normally quite untrue but the fraudulence betrayed the reverence for antiquity in itself the venetians were primarily interested in the material remnants of the ancient cultures of greece and of rome they were not interested in their intellectual prowess greek for the venetians was the language of business rather than the language of plato latin was a necessary lingua franca not an agent of revelation in burckhardts the civilisation of the renaissance in italy there is a long section on the revival of antiquity as an agent of moral and spiritual awareness venice is not mentioned in this context burckhardt simply praises it as the home of a flourishing publishing trade and the centre of affectation and bombast in funerary inscriptions the venetians were understandably proud of their history i observe lady blessington wrote in the s that the venetian cicerone guide and gondoliers often refer to the past prosperity of venice and always in a tone that shows a knowledge of its history and a pride of its ancient splendour not to be expected from persons of that class it was and is a city based upon memory it is a city of nostalgia it lives by remembering and representing its past in the same way visitors are invited to admire buildings and scenes that are so familiar that it is as if they somehow remember them it is wholly to be expected therefore that the venetian archives are the second largest in the world only the archives of the vatican are more extensive yet none are more rich or more detailed than the venetian papers some date from the ninth century everything was written down in the hope that older decisions and provisions might still be useful it is the measure of the efficiency of a state that it preserves its official documentation in that sense venice was very efficient the archivio di stato just one of the many official archives contain km one hundred miles of files and documents when the german historian leopold von ranke first came upon them in the s he was like cortez on a peak in darien staring at an ocean from his encounter with the papers sprang the first exercise in what was known as scientific history they are still an infinite resource for contemporary historians and sociologists who find there stories and dramas of venetian life in more profusion than in the scenes of the commedia dellarte iv republic of commerce the merchants of venice the genius of the venetian state lay in commerce and in industry trade was in its blood the city was sustained by what has been described as the first capitalist economy but the phrase needs refining it represented the first great triumph of mercantilist capitalism in europe the commercial paradigm for seventeenthcentury amsterdam and for eighteenthcentury london in this marketplace everyone came to buy or to sell the artist and the priest as well as the merchant sought for profit the system of trade defined the social and cultural systems of the city it subsumed them fashion and innovation became the key concepts rational calculation and the abstract relations of credit and exchange fashioned a wholly new kind of societya society of commodities and a society of consumers it has been said that the modern economic spirit sprang from the experience of the city paris only took on an urban form for example when mercatores or merchants settled beside the existing schools and monasteries all the actions of venice in war and in peace were determined by the interests of commerce it conquered only for profit not for glory and calculated with cold eye the financial gain to be acquired from the pious aspirations of the crusades or the brutal sack of constantinople its diplomatic treaties are wrapped in the language of recompense and reparation in a private document of the fifteenth century known as the morosini codex there is a formulaic sentence for disastermany people died and much merchandise was ruined the essence of trade lies in further and further expansion but venice itself could not grow so it exploited territories overseas from mainland italy to the island of cyprus at the height of its power it was the third largest state in europe it was also the richest that is why commercial selfinterest became a foundation of national ideology the earliest example is that of salt the dwellers of the lagoon long before the immigrants from the veneto ever arrived had traded in that substance the lagoon was a perfect place for salt pans with the brine of the lowlying sea all around but the venetians pursued that business with a vengeance they decided to create a monopoly in the supply of salt to the mainland by force and by conquest venice appropriated the other centres of salt production in the territories closest to it then it applied itself to the salt producers of the entire adriatic compelling or bribing them to close their manufactories if any salt was produced in overseas territories as it was in the venetian colony of cyprus it was taken to venice and stored in great warehouses from where it was despatched to consumers at monopoly prices effectively the city put down any hint of competition this was the venetian way of doing business in similar fashion it exploited the appetite for spices that reemerged in the twelfth century when the mediterranean became once more open to traffic within a short time it dominated the trade in the sixteenth century for example it imported almost six hundred tons of pepper annually from alexandria it even had its own pepper officers the greatest source of profit lay in trade over long distances the more the possible risk the more the possible benefit it has been calculated that in the early fifteenth century there were some vessels within the citys mercantile marine the ships of the venetians left in convoys each year there were seven trading expeditions sailing for different destinations one fleet travelled to the crimea for example and another to cyprus and egypt venice itself owned the galleys and rented them out to the highest bidders it is a perfect example of the citys commercial instinct the freight and the dates of travel were arranged well in advance merchants at home would then invest in the journey of the travelling merchant in return for a large proportion of any subsequent profit there was much profit to be obtained on the return of these argosies the quays of venice were piled high with carpets and silks and perfumes sacks of cloves and bags of cinnamon argosy is indeed the most appropriate word it derives from the port of ragusa dubrovnik in what is now croatia a venetian colony in the sixteenth century in the fourteenth century wax and pepper sandalwood and ginger were despatched to europe by venetian merchants from the indies and syria timor and malabar the east did not know the market prices of the west nor did the west know the prices of the east but the venetian merchant understood and calculated both metals and manufactures were despatched to the east while cotton and spices travelled in the opposite direction the venetians exploited opportunities that other cities and other states did not see or to which they were indifferent venice is the fulcrum between what we call the medieval and the early modern ages some of the earliest banks in the world were established in venice there are private banks mentioned in official records from in the thirteenth century too venice created the first publicly funded national debt known as the monte the monte meant literally a pile of coins until the fourteenth century moneylenders were free to practise in the city although they were forbidden in most other cities in the twelfth century charging large interest was said to be an old venetian custom the counters for the moneychangers covered in cloth or carpet were set up at the base of the campanile in saint marks square truly the venetians made a religion out of money on the bills of exchange was often inserted the phrase and may christ watch over you there was a public bank in the city by years before the foundation of the bank of england venice became the largest bullion market in the world the merchant of venice was the master of venice the founders of venice were merchants or rather they were forced to trade in order to survive the doges themselves engaged in trade so there is the curious anomaly that the earliest nobility of the city were wholly involved with commerce there was no hierarchy of birth dependent upon a feudal system of honour but a social framework entirely fashioned out of commercial speculation as an english ambassador wrote in omnes vias pecuniae norunt they know all the paths of money fortunes were not made out of landed property but out of skill in business this accounts in part for the evident sense of equality that the venetians experienced one with another in the realm of king money all subjects are intrinsically equal money knows no duty or honour yet in practice it was government of the rich by the rich and for the rich there was no merchants guild in venice for the simple reason that the city itself was one grand guild it was a government of merchants much of its commerce was in fact controlled by a relatively small number of families who had always been in business they were characterised by their acumen as a family unit so that for example the dandolos were known to be audacious and the giustinianis were benevolent the domestic partnership whereby brothers or fathers and sons traded together was known as fraterna its account books could pass through many generations like a piece of family furniture household accounts were not separated from business accounts they amounted to the same thing the senate was essentially a board of directors with the doge as the chief executive officer the government of the city was practical and efficient it was moderate in its spending and vigilant over its auditing of costs the resources of the city were managed with extreme caution the venetians for example had great skill in the drawingup of contracts which became almost an art form there was not the expense of a standing army soldiers were purchased when necessary the council of ten were charged with the administration of the mint the bankers kept their coins in the offices of the state treasury the government could only safeguard trade by maintaining liberty and security liberty in the removal of restrictions and security in the domination of the sea the originality of venetian governance lay in its unique ability to fuse politics and economics into a new form of power it can be called state capitalism or communal capitalism or corporate government the point is that it worked in administrative terms it was the equivalent of the philosophers stone the venetian merchants could also take comfort from isaiahs disquisition on tyre that it was the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord the image of the merchant is central to any understanding of venice it was even said that all venetians were merchants why should that be so the merchant is in part a speculator ready to take acceptable risks for the sake of future profit he rises to a challenge but will decline a mere escapade he is ambitious for supremacy and competitive if not coercive towards his rivals but he is also thrifty and cautious if these are paradoxical qualities they are part of the paradox of venice the love of commerce and the desire for gain are essential to its nature there were many venetian proverbs on the subject of moneymoney is our second blood money makes money and lice make lice a man without money is a corpse that walks merchants calculate they are economical with their time as well as with their words within them are wells of secrecy and duplicity they have little use for culture unless that is a profit can be made out of it they are interested in peace but they are in essence dispassionate observers of the affairs of the world an opportunity after all can arise out of any situation war itself can be a source of immense profits if it is handled in the correct manner new markets can be opened and new resources exploited but the venetian merchants were more interested in the short rather than the long term they shifted with the evershifting scene that is why they were described as foxes in a world of lions there is another venetian proverb with truth and lies you sell the merchandise from the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries venice became the city of luxury goods luxury may be defined as a form of erotic display a deep response to the refinements of sensation it suggests delicacy and rarefied pleasure one need hardly add that it encourages further and further consumption we need many things as the staples of life but we desire even more desire lies in the open mouth of the consumer venice has always been known as a sensual city whether in the ubiquity of its courtesans or in the lush canvases of its painters both artist and prostitute reflect the underlying reality of the city in which colourful display and material value are sacrosanct the popular festivities of venice might also be considered to be an expression of luxury venice possessed no natural resources and so it relied upon manufacture the only way of maintaining its supremacy was in the creation of more various and more rarefied items luxury was prodigality whether in spices or perfumes or dyestuffs or ornaments of gold and rock crystal venice traded in them all it made the glass and the silk and the soap it manufactured the marzipan as well as the wax venice was a centre of silk manufacture while the neighbouring island of burano was the home of lacemaking and murano of mirrors and glass the manufactories of venice created the first glass window pane which was undoubtedly a luxury on its arrival in it became the first western city to market coffee the fork was also a venetian invention one of the panoply of luxuries that emerged upon the dining table venetian households in general were known for their ornamentation and luxurious furnishing the whole city was a hive ever active relying to a large extent upon rapid and small transactions you may see the merchants in the paintings many of them young and eager surrounded by pens and papers and balances each one is in a little world of striving and risk lorenzo lotto finished portrait of a young man with account book by the early s from various signs and tokens it is clear that the young man after an unhappy romance is seeking for consolation in the perusal of household accounts he turns the pages of a doubleentry register never have the blessings of business been more poignantly stated but we can move closer to the merchant we can glimpse more of his life a manuscript notebook of the early fourteenth century known as the zibaldone da canal has survived it was compiled by a merchant of unknown name and is filled with arithmetical and geometrical notations together with what the merchant calls many beautiful and subtle calculations there are medical remedies of an eminently practical nature together with the most egregious superstitions he notes that cheese becomes lighter as it dries out so that it must be weighed carefully at the end of a voyage he estimates the profit to be earned from gold smuggled into tunis he calculates the length of voyages he recommends that a traveller on first boarding his ship should invoke saints oriele and tobias he remarks also that there is a time to threaten and not to fear the heart of the merchant is thereby laid bare in venice according to one senator everything is up for sale he was referring in particular to political office when the state itself became the object of commercial speculation but he was entirely correct in a wider sense venice became the market of the world indeed it seems one visitor wrote in as if the whole world flocks there and that human beings have concentrated all their force for trading this notion of force the energy and power released by commerce is the perfect word for the tempest of venetian business to venice came the wines of crete and the cinnamon of the indies the carpets of alexandria and the caviar of caffa the sugar of cyprus and the dates of palestine cloves and nutmegs arrived from the moluccas by way of alexandria the camphor of borneo was brought to the lagoon together with the pearls and sapphires of ceylon the shawls of kashmir lay beside the musk of tibet while the ivory of zanzibar was unloaded with the rich cloths of bengal the venetian ambassadors signed commercial treaties with the soldan of egypt and the khan of tartary the sultan of aleppo and the count of biblos the sons of nobles became apprentices at sea marco polo was a merchant fernand braudel in le temps du monde characterises venice in as the centre of the world economy in it was described by lewes lewkenor as a common and general market to the whole world in coryats crudities saint marks square itself is called the marketplace of the world the city dominated the adriatic and insisted that all of its trade passed through its own ports venice fought off all other claimants it was the quintessential merchant city the ultimate bazaar the early trade fairs of europe were conducted in venice perhaps from the examples of egypt and syria the annual fair of the sensa with its origins in the twelfth century was devoted to luxury goods there were no less than twentyfour shops for example reserved for the goldsmiths and the silversmiths it took place in saint marks square lasted for fifteen days and welcomed some hundred thousand visitors there were glassblowers and painters and armourers in fact craftsmen of every kind trade then became a carnival and an entertainment it became the object of festive ritual just as the harvest rites of the countryside had a spiritual as well as a secular importance yet there is a sentence from voltaire that underlines the economic significance of this trade in luxuriesle superflu chose très nécessaire luxury was necessary because it stimulated trade the possession of luxuries for example was a vital element in the attainment of status it has been argued that the growth of luxury is largely responsible for the rise of modern capitalism in which case venice was a pioneer capitalist in more than one sense in its exploitation of raw materials in its obsession with profit in its rational organisation of trade and manufacture and in the size of its operations across the known world it was the very model of capitalistic enterprise these urban merchants and shopkeepers learned how to diversify to create new occupations and products to seek for simplicity in all forms of exchange luxury is the stepmother of fashion there were sudden crazes in the city and the great chronicler of venice pompeo molmenti noted that no nation ever showed itself so insatiable in the matter of fashions in his treatise of commerce john wheeler remarked that all the world choppeth and changeth runneth raveth after marts markets and merchandising so that all thinges come into commerce this was the situation of venice so here we may see the beginnings of what has become known as consumer demand the consumer emerges in venice fashion was the goddess of this turning world vivaldi was disparaged as yesterdays composer according to an eighteenthcentury observer for fashion is everything in venice where his works have been heard for too long and where last years music makes no money at a later date margaret oliphant the scottish novelist described it as the sensationloving city the ladies of venice always wore the latest style and in the street of merchants known as the merceria there was a doll dressed in the latest parisian mode the shop itself became known as the doll of france fashions created luxuries luxuries encouraged trade trade prompted industry venice was built from gold it was the golden city the desire to grow rich led to an obsession with gold it was both a solace and a treasure it was an investment and a defence it was glorious it was pleasing to the eye the venetian protagonist of ben jonsons volpone rises with appropriate words upon his lips good morning to the day and next my gold in the mint of venice there once stood a statue of apollo holding gold ingots petrarch in an encomium upon venice enumerated all the wild and distant places to which its merchants travelled behold he wrote what men will do for the thirst of gold one early fifteenthcentury doge spoke of venice as holding the signoria delloro or lordship of gold venice was golden in the manner of jerusalem or of the celestial city gold was one of the principal glories of venetian painting the artists worked with gold thread and gold dust and flakes of gold the virgin in bellinis frari triptych is enthroned beneath a gold mosaic she is suffused by a golden light that seems to contain the sweet breath of eternity this is the light that can be experienced in venice itself the same painter in his agony in the garden bathed christs back with powdered gold in his resurrection at the scuola di s rocco tintoretto has gilded the branches of the fig tree so that the light of the miracle may be seen to touch and transfigure the natural world gold believed to be engendered by the sun in the bowels of the earth is a sacred commodity the most celebrated casa or house in venice is surely the ca doro its façade constructed between and was so embossed and gilded that it became a glittering wall of light there were sheets of gold leaf fixed upon its surface it was matched in the city only by the golden coffer of the fondaco dei tedeschi and the golden basilica of saint marks in the basilica itself is displayed the pala doro the gilded altar screen encrusted with precious jewels the fame of venetian goldsmiths was such that their work became known as opus veneticum gold was used in the decoration of venetian glass and was of course part of the texture of the cloth of gold worn by the doge when dressed in gold the doge became an emblem of the city and a token of its wealth the precious material represented dignity and moral power even the performers in venetian operas were dressed in gold there is the less lovely topic of land to which the venetians applied a form of agricultural capitalism in the fifteenth century venice acquired much territory on the mainland a century later the landscape had been transformed the patricians had in part eschewed maritime trade and concentrated instead upon their investments on terra firma the labourers in the fields worked under the eyes of supervisors the barns and the winepresses were organised for the maximum efficiency land was reclaimed systems of irrigation were introduced the venetians applied the techniques used for the creation of the city itself it marked the end of feudalism and the new exploiters of the land eventually became known as the capitalisti at the same time the appetite for bucolic poetry and the affection for pastoral landscapes became more pronounced culture followed economics in the seventeenth century as trade became ever more difficult and uncertain in a world of change the patricians of venice saw land itself as the major source of income rice and maize were exported mulberry trees were cultivated by the eighteenth century agriculture had become the single most profitable enterprise in venice there were those at the time who lamented this flight from mercantile trade to farming it was wrong to abandon the sea the mirror of venice in order to harvest the land or so it seemed but the venetians had always sought profit rather than honour by exploiting the terra firma they remained true to their first principle yet of course there were consequences the partial withdrawal of venice from the international world of trade inevitably led to a decline in influence and in status the venetians became more provincial the principal market of the city however remained that of the rialto it was the power station of venice it was the seed the origin it resembled the city of london the centre of londons energy but on a more local and much more intense scale here the first settlers were supposed to have come ashore and by the strange alchemy of the city here the first negotiators or merchants began their trade commerce seems to have sprung up fully armed from the ground itself it enters the public records of the city at the end of the eleventh century when the patrician families of gradenigo and orio gave up their properties in the neighbourhood of the rialto for use as a public market the area had been a commercial centre for some time primarily used by butchers and the gift to the venetian commune was a recognition of that fact in the twelfth century the private houses in the neighbourhood were converted into shops and warehouses it became truly a bazaar such was the importance of its commerce that in the council of ten decreed it to be a sacrario or sacred precinct on ash wednesday and good friday there were ducal processions to the two principal churches of the rialto trade could have no finer commendation it had been enshrined the rialto grew and grew outlying streets were cleared and widened the canals were improved and docks constructed in the s the rialto nuovo was erected to the west of the original market and thirty years later the campo di rialto was enlarged there was a general desire to bring harmony and even dignity to this commercial scene a great map of the world was placed on the wall of its principal colonnade there was a prison and a pillar for public proclamations there were warehouses too and government offices for the administration of trade the patricians met and mingled within a loggia or opensided gallery at the base of the rialto bridge when much of the neighbourhood was destroyed by fire in it was rebuilt on the same pattern with the streets or blocks running parallel to each other the essential conservatism of the venetians required that they should preserve the old forms the passageways of the rialto like a souk out of the east had become the natural expression of trade the main street was lined with shops selling luxury goods but there were areas for banking and for shipping insurance there were separate markets for diverse commodities and specialist stalls such as those for leather goods the more expensive the items the closer they were to the heart of the rialto this central spot was marked by the little church of s giacomo di rialto taverns and brothels were on the periphery where they were joined by ragsellers and dealers in secondhand goods it was an island of moneymaking from the highest to the lowest it was a little venice within the larger venice a vivid instance of the commercial life there was already a wooden bridge linking both sides of the grand canal in the vicinity it was rebuilt on two separate occasions but it could hold out no longer against the tide of improvement the first stone of the existing bridge was laid in and the work was completed within three years two rows of shops and stalls lined its span of eightynine feet m but the higher significance of commerce was not neglected on its side were sculpted the figures of the archangel gabriel and the virgin mary hail money full of grace the citys topography therefore was defined by its centres of trade the larger campi became openair markets the merceria the route linking saint marks square and the rialto was lined with shops of every kind it was according to john evelyn one of the most delicious streetes in the world there were also pedlars and streetsellers hucksters and itinerant craftsmen sales and auctions were held in the streets beneath porticoes or in the shade of the churches shops themselves became places of assembly it was a great carnival of commerce there were traders of every description there were no less than forty trading guilds ranging from apothecaries to weavers from victuallers to barber surgeons there were also hundreds of different occupations without a guild from wetnurses to porters and latrinecleaners it has been surmised that virtually the whole population of venice worked it was a desperate obligation for those below the level of the patrician the existing street names of the city bear witness to the forgotten world of work and tradea street of the sheetmetal workers a street of soapmakers a street of wax factories a street of dyers the street of the goldsmiths became at the end of the nineteenth century the street of the greengrocers the tailors and the jewellers worked together in the same quarter jacopo bellini the progenitor of the great bellini family executed many drawings and studies of the itinerant labour of his city he knew that these tradesmen and hucksters were the essence of venice itself a large proportion of venetians worked in the textile industry there were the lacemakers their eyesight ruined by their labour children from the age of five were enrolled in the trade the exquisite refinement of the art prized by the rich matrons of europe can be measured in human suffering other workers turned raw english wool into finished articles the looms of the city produced damask and cloth of gold there were weavers of tapestry and spinners of cotton of course women and children were part of this enormous trade the workshop knows no gender despite the severe restrictions placed upon the movement and freedom of patrician women the females of the lower orders were treated as fuel for the fire of the venetian economy women were employed as printers and sailmakers ironmongers and chimneysweeps there were also female hawkers gaetano zompino published cries of venice in which he listed sixty different varieties of hawker similar books were written in london and paris but in venice the endless sound of human voices would have a distinct and different quality there was no other background noise apart from the hurrying feet of the passersby and the calls of the gondoliers the cries of the wooddealer and the chairmender and the man with the performing monkey would have echoed through the streets of stone joyful and mournful intense and intimate tomatoes a little sour perfect for the salad women you must make water with lemons the pears that wet the beard in this climate everything could be raised or lowered to the status of a commodity as venice grew richer the churches became ever more ornate as ornamented and encrusted as the jewel boxes of the great venetian ladies it was reported that at the time of the creation of venice the almighty had been promised a hundred temples of gold and marble the reverence for show and splendour began early that is why venice was the showcase of the world information became a commodity as venice became the centre for the trade in printed books knowledge could indeed be packaged like a consignment of pepper albrecht dürer a resident of venice for a time executed a sketch in which books are being produced en masse as if they were loaves of bread as a result there were more literate people in venice than in any other part of italy incipient capitalism had its uses it is appropriate that the manufacture of spectacles for the purpose of reading was begun in venice there was a thriving trade in human flesh by the twelfth century the slave trade in venice far surpassed that of other cities and other countries the venetians were incorrigible slave traders and the markets of the rialto and s giorgio were centres of slavery they were eager for this particular source of income since the profit on each item was said to be per cent they sold russians and even greek christians to the saracens men and women and children were bought or captured in the region of the black seaarmenians and georgians among thembefore being despatched to venice where they were in turn sold on to egypt and morocco and crete and cyprus they sold boys and young women as concubines one doge pietro mocenigo had in his seventies two young turkish men in his entourage many of them were consigned to venetian households no patrician family was complete without a retinue of three or four slaves even venetian artisans owned slaves and used them in their shops or workshops venetian convents possessed slaves for domestic service the galleys were stocked with slaves but the city always needed a fresh supply servile status was not inheritable many slaves were freed in the wills of their masters or mistresses marco polo manumitted one of his slaves peter the tartar before his own death in in there were three thousand slaves in the capital the black gondoliers in carpaccios paintings of venice are all slaves the solemn benefits of the church could also be bought and sold with the purchase of altars and windows and commemorative masses in a stall was set up in saint marks square for the sale of indulgences from time spent in purgatory relics could be purchased the seamless robe of the saviour was valued at ducats the island of crete was slightly cheaper it was sold to venice for a thousand silver marks music and art sculpture and opera were all appraised by the criteria of profit and loss the point was put plainly enough by the quintessentially venetian artist of the eighteenth century giambattista tiepolo who suggested that painters should please noble rich people and not other people who cannot buy paintings of great value yet this could be construed as a moral as well as an economic imperative artists might in the process of appealing to the wealthy be directed towards the sublime heroic towards perfection in venice there was every reason to believe that the possession of money was compatible with the pursuit of glory it might even be argued that the renaissance itself springing from the social and cultural life of the italian cities was the first movement towards the commodification of the western world it was composed in part of art objects that could be ordered and purchased that could be transferred from place to place that were not unique to one city or one society in venice we can witness the rise of cultural materialism which in turn created the first cosmopolitan culture music was part of the market too in which vivaldi and galuppi drove hard bargains opera was notably successful in venice because from the beginning it was highly profitable speculators even made money from the leasing of boxes it is hard to name one activity in the city that was not commercial in origin or in nature the painters of venice in their portraits and in their more expansive urban scenes provided an inventory of costly material goods the sitter is seen with his or her possessions and the city is decked in ornate splendour bellinis paintings depict the fine porcelain and the sumptuous carpets currently available in venetian shops these canvases were in turn placed within gilded and elaborate frames it is not accidental that venetian houses were known for their plenitude of pictures everything promised richness artists came to the lagoon in order to learn the techniques of powdered gold used in painting and in manuscript illumination in venice they would also find the finest pigments brought from the east venetian painters too were well known for their skill in depicting the texture and appearance of the velvets and satins that were sold in the city itself in a portrait of one doge bellini clothes him with the costly damask that had only recently been imported from the levant the sign of art as a commodity is the surface in many cases the surface is without content or more precisely the nature of the subject is subordinated to the imperatives of surface decoration or ostentatious costliness it is one of the attributes of capitalist enterprise that an object is no longer significant for its essence but for its exchange value here we may see one of the abiding characteristics of venetian painting the notion of art as trade is of intrinsic importance to the cultural history of venice most works were commissioned directly from the patron or patrons and so the artists responded directly to what we might call consumer demand there was an association in the fifteenth century between artistic theory and trading practice there were manuals instructing the merchant on the right shades of dyes and spices couched in precisely the terms that the artist would understand in the activities of trade and art objects become separated from the world they are more intensely seen and judged the consumer too judges by the senses there was also a connection between mercantile calculation and pictorial geometry piero della francesca after all wrote a treatise on the abacus as well as one entitled on perspective in painting when a venetian merchant calculated the volume and appearance of his goods he was engaged in the same process as the venetian artist sebastiano serlio and andreas vesalius both lived in venice or in the veneto in the s one wrote a treatise on human architecture and the other completed a treatise on the human body the finely shaded illustrations in both books bear a striking resemblance a steady supply of paintings was despatched along the trade routes of the city on both sides of the adriatic in a literal sense art followed commerce the establishment of trade between venice and the netherlands for example heralded the profitable interchange between two schools of painting when venice and germany joined in commerce they also joined in art the good citizens of augsburg and salzburg had many paintings of the venetian school the collectors of venice possessed many works from german and netherlandish painters there was also a market for utility art with panel paintings used as devotional props and easel paintings as interior decoration the material rather than aesthetic quality of the work was the important consideration by the sixteenth century there were already dealers operating in venice mediating between artist and client or between seller and purchaser the contracts drawn up between consumer and supplier often specified the amount of gold or expensive pigment to be employed in any one painting they ordained the nature as well as the dimensions of the work they included a deadline for completion as well as penalty clauses for late delivery some contracts even included a clause in which the artist agreed to surpass the work of another named artist tintoretto from a family of dyers had all the skills of the merchant he habitually undercut the prices of his rivals thus assuring a steady supply of commissions he worked quickly as well as cheaply the letters of titian are filled with money matters with haggling and demanding and complaining canaletto two centuries later was a master of the export trade tiepolo concentrated upon the production of historical and allegorical painting on the very good grounds that only they provided him with a reasonable profit margin there was a passion for collecting in venice anything from roman coins to freaks of nature could be taken up and placed in cabinets or cupboards so the city could become a market in another sense private collecting was a venetian phenomenon of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it created new forms of demand and new methods of accumulation it made the act of possession intrinsically worthwhile the consumer could pose as the connoisseur the sybarite could become a humanist saint he was called a virtuoso the first known collections were venetian dating from the fourteenth century but the obsession with studioli or curiosity shops just grew and grew the collection of the venetian patrician andrea vendramin included sculptures and medals urns and gems lamps and shells plants and manuscripts costumes and mummified animals the whole world could be purchased and displayed another venetian patrician federigo contarini aspired to possess a specimen of every thing or being ever created in this of course he could not be assured of success during the course of the seventeenth century possession became more specific and specialised there was a market for antiquities and a market for landscape paintings there was a market in natural marvels such as the manyheaded hydra valued at six thousand ducats and a market in ancient musical instruments coins and medals were also popular the collection of apostolo zeno for example contained medals we must never forget however the commercial instinct of the venetians zenos medals were a financial investment as well as a scholarly marvel a collection could also be a portfolio that is perhaps why it was an enduring as well as a widespread passion in the city the last great venetian collector conte vittorio cini died in niccolò serpetros marketplace of natural marvels was published in venice in with the entirely appropriate notion of placing the curiosities of nature in an imaginary piazza not unlike saint marks square here amid the porticos and shops and stalls the wonders of the world could be purchased the market is the metaphor and the reality everything is on display the display rather than any intrinsic worth is the point serpetros imagined world was recreated in the late eighteenth century when a great wooden oval was constructed in saint marks square entirely for the display of goods the venetians were celebrated for their skill at windowdressing and created the first glass shopfronts in the world so their markets were great exhibitions from the fairs of the twelfth century onwards the goods of the city were paraded at a later date works of art were put up for sale in the square classical and contemporary works hanging side by side in the open air it is entirely appropriate that the venice biennalesof art of film and of architectureare still flourishing at the beginning of the twentyfirst century they are continuing a great tradition of showmanship the first factories of capitalism were the silk manufactories of venice ships were turned out from the shipbuilding yards of the arsenal fully rigged and fitted in the same fashion as the automobiles of a later date glassmaking and mirrormaking were fullblown industrial enterprises in which the division of labour was matched by the economies of scale these were family trades too with the son taking over from the father the authorities of the city also invented the concept of zoning whereby industries were despatched to separate locations it would be possible to construct a map of venice in which every trade and industry is given a separate territory clothstretchers to the west and tinsmiths to the northeast the area of dorsoduro was taken up by fishermen and silkworkers while that of castello was inhabited by sailors and by shipbuilders this rationalisation of urban space continued well into the nineteenth century when it was decreed that the lido should be devoted to recreation and become a seaside resort the industrial power of venice preeminent in the sixteenth century is attested by the fact that its technical innovations soon reached other parts of europe the manufacture of gold cloth in france was introduced by the weavers of the city luxury soapmaking came out of venice the type fonts of the venetian presses were copied in other cities venetian workers revolutionised the production of fine woollen cloth the city became the unlikely setting for technological change and innovation for more than a century it was the first industrial city in italy and indeed the centre of european industry at the peak of its development in the third quarter of the sixteenth century its population reached in the end that industry declined the nature of any decline in the human world is interesting as a spectacle it is arresting as a lesson it is invaluable a nation in decline is always more intriguing than a nation at the summit of its power sorrow and humility are always more attractive than triumph but was this the case with venice there seems to have been very little sorrow and no humility at all the reasons for the industrial decline of the city are many and various they may be said to be part of changes in the human world as a whole the discovery of new trade routes and the emerging supremacy of amsterdam and london in the late seventeenth century have been cited as explanations the merchants of england holland and france were able to undercut the prices of venetian suppliers the venetian government refused to compromise on the quality of its luxury goods its competitors had no such scruples the cloths and metals of the north were cheaper it was in essence the global transition from the mediterranean to the north atlantic the compass of the world had changed that is why in the seventeenth century the wool market the staple of venetian trade was perilously close to collapse the venetians too were temperamentally averse to innovation as we have already noticed the patricians and merchants were traditionalists the habits of control and regulation born from the earliest communal fight of venice to survive could not be changed in a generation other economies were more open and more flexible by the beginning of the eighteenth century therefore venetian industry had been curtailed yet it cannot be said that the standards of living among the various sections of the venetian populace were notably affected certainly it would be wrong to talk in anthropomorphic terms of weakness or decay perhaps after all talk of decline is unwarranted there may simply be transition venice merely changed its nature to deal with changing circumstances and attained commercial success in a different guise it is still a rich and richly endowed city it is the home of biennales and of tourists it has in effect marketed and sold its ultimate commodityitself its history and memory have been transformed into luxury goods for the delectation of travellers and visitors it traded in goods and in people now finally it trades upon itself the endless drama venice might be described as a series of boxlike stages opening out one into another it is the merest cliché that it resembles a vast stage set against which the citizens engaged in carnival and parade the paintings of carpaccio and of longhi the drawings of jacopo bellini depict it as a form of sacred theatre in the work of these venetian artists the city is a tableau vivant suffused with what wd howells in venetian life described as the pleasant improbability of the theatre the citizens are displayed in groups with actions and attitudes taken from the stage or from the pageant it has always been a place of artifice where even the natural has a sprinkling of stage dust it glitters the houses and churches have the air of stage properties sited for the convenience of the eye the arches and the stairs are mere effects the palace of the doge and the basilica of saint mark take their place before the proscenium of saint marks square the pageant masters made full use of the square for floats and parades mummeries and processions on great state occasions the theatrical possibilities of the city were exploited to the full the square was also the stage on which acrobats and magicians performed puppet theatres were especially popular in a city that was itself often described as a puppet show venice welcomed actors dressed in motley there were even stages on the water during the pageants and festivities stages were erected on the grand canal for the performance of serenatas there were ornamental barges too for singers and musicians the water was a perfect auditorium as well as a stage the façades of the venetian churches were often eminently theatrical with fantastic ornaments of stone loaded upon them the curved mouldings vie with the contorted columns volutes and pinnacles capitals and cornices are piled high in weddingcake fashion the church of s moise built by alessandro tremignon in is a riot of whimsical excess the more famous salute invites awe rather than admiration the religious services of venice were theatrical in conception and execution with music more suitable for an opera than for a sacred occasion the congregation was an audience chattering and gossiping through the proceedings and the ritual was a performance the recesses of the churches create an authentic air of mystery the confused light and darkness the brilliance of marble and precious stone the air steeped in the perfume of incense are all what ruskin termed the stage properties of superstition in venice they are to be found in the basilica of saint mark for example which ruskin considered to be of a theatrical nature unexampled in any other european church yet the theatricality of venice was sometimes a cause of complaint among venetians themselves when at the end of the sixteenth century new pillars were added to the square one senator federigo contarini compared them to theatre props in the twentyfirst century the newly rebuilt theatre la fenice has been criticised by some venetians as a contrived pastiche of the previous building destroyed by fire theatricality is everywhere the convents of venice became a form of theatre with the nuns sitting behind gratings watching the rest of venice cavort before them masked balls with the characters of pierrot and harlequin were performed for their delectation the private trials of venice were conceived in theatrical terms during one hearing of the inquisition the walls of the chamber were draped in black the curtains were suddenly thrown back to reveal a strangled corpse the deliberations of the council of ten depended upon surprise and suddenness the head of the police in the late eighteenth century missier grando always dressed in black the various receptions and meetings conducted within the ducal palace were occasions of intense theatricality at an ambassadors reception the doge sat wrapped in a golden cloak with the various councillors ranged about him upon the death of a doge a great procession circled saint marks square each member carrying a large candle or torch in front of the basilica the coffin was raised and lowered nine times while the bells of the city tolled on good friday torches were lit beside the houses and palaces that lined the canals so that all the waterways of venice were illuminated by fiery reflections the power of visual spectacle was more important to venice than to any other european city there was a long history in venice of collaboration between art and theatre jacopo bellini was a pageant master and stage designer as well as an artist at the time there would have been no need to distinguish his different roles he was simply festaiuolo or organiser of festive play the art of veronese and of tintoretto is in part the art of staging theirs was an intensely theatrical vision the work of veronese was known as maestoso teatro or majestic theatre he in turn has been associated with the great architects of venice sansovino and palladio who share with the artist a sense of space and structure when sansovino redesigned the piazzetta in the sixteenth century he intuitively defined it as a stage set with a onepoint perspective from the bacino the basin of water before it the buildings on both sides diminish towards the vanishing point of the ornate clock tower from the other direction looking from the piazzetta towards the bacino the two great pillars frame the watery landscape here some of the great set scenes of venetian life were conducted this was the site for example of the public executions the rituals of venice were surrounded by stage fire tintoretto acquired the habit of placing small figurines of wax or clay in illuminated boxes this was the brilliantly lit arena of his imagination prior to his work on canvas but the light is that of the stage spotlight tintoretto and veronese also designed and sketched costumes for the stage they needed to look no further than their canvases for inspiration tiepolo too revealed an interest in decorative costume he also favoured exaggerated theatrical gesture and facial expression the characters depicted in his paintings are often grouped together in the fashion of a dramatic chorus they are earnest purposeful and emotional they have the bearing of actors figures of commedia dellarte under the impress of strong feeling this can only happen in a culture where no distinction is made between nature and art between what is real and what is artificial or rather the distinction does not matter the importance of anything lies in the gaiety and brilliance of its surface expression and activity are of more consequence than essence or being that is perhaps an inevitable consequence of urban life where everyone must signal his or her role but it also seems peculiarly appropriate to venice wagner an adept at scenic mysteries recognised the truth of the city at once he remarked that everything strikes one as a marvellous piece of stagescenery and that this unreality created a peculiar gaiety that could not help but affect any visitor the chief charm he added consists in its all remaining as detached from me as if i were in the actual theatre detachment is the key it is actually the reverse of what coleridge once called the willing suspension of disbelief we know that it is a real city with real people but we will proceed as if it were unreal it was often noticed that the people of venice were themselves detached from the world beyond their city the government of venice by the eighteenth century was considered too remote from the ordinary dealings of the world to be of any consequence it was you might say trapped in its theatre as the power of venice declined in absolute terms in that century its capacity for life and display was never more exalted the glorious past and the uncertain future were obscured by carnival and festival this was not an isolated phase in the citys history during the austrian siege of venice in the early nineteenth century when suffering and hardship and famine became the lot of all citizens the people crowded on balconies and rooftops to watch the bombardment the summits of the campanili and the towers of the churches were filled with venetians bearing spyglasses and telescopes so that they might more clearly see the destruction being inflicted upon their own city in foreign productions as for example in the theatres of london venice was often viewed as a stage set the christmas pantomime at drury lane in included a diorama entitled venice and its adjacent islands when byrons plays marino faliero and the two foscari were produced the stage sets were considered to be the most considerable element of the entertainment when charles kean played shylock in the merchant of venice in the sets were praised for their realism but what reality were they reflecting other than the theatrical image already in the public mind this is the context for edward lears disappointment with the buildings of venice from which he derived not one whit more of pleasure from seeing them there than in any of the many theatre scenes dioramas panoramas and all other ramas whatever he knew them all already there is no scene in venice that has not already been painted there is no church or house or canal that has not become the subject of an artists brush or pencil even the fruit in the market looks as if it has been stolen from a stilllife everything has been seen before the traveller seems to be walking through oils and watercolours wandering across paper and canvas it is no accident that venice has also become a traditional setting for twentiethcentury and twentyfirstcentury fiction or film it is the natural home for the sensational and the melodramatic narratives of intrigue and mystery are commonly set in the calli and campi of the city and venice is the obvious setting for an international film festival venice is not so much a city as the representation of a city so what were the venetians themselves but actors characters against a celebrated backdrop henry james in the aspern papers described them as members of an endless dramatic troupe there is the gondolier and the lawyer in their characteristic costumes there is the housewife and the beggar all of these people live in public they delight in selfexpression they share the same language of gesture and attitude they talk continually they describe and imitate one another they watch one another against the background of little shops and houses they live in an intense and circumscribed space it is another example of the venetian life of the surface where the primacy lies with what is seen hence in the last century of the republic the sublime importance of the mask or bauta the transcripts of trials now held in the abundant archives of venice demonstrate the extent to which instinctive and unforced drama entered social and domestic life the demeanour as well as the evidence of the witnesses was recorded one bookkeeper was described as wiping his face with his handkerchief and twisting himself about under the strain of testimony there were dramatic phrases in the courts i never wanted him i said yes with my voice but not with my heart i do not even talk with her or her friends because they are not meat for my teeth it is reported that the actors who performed in the various campi were employed to coach witnesses in the arts of speech and gesture it is always possible to see urban life as a form of theatre when wordsworth described london in the prelude he reached for theatrical metaphors he wrote of shifting pantomimic scenes and dramas of living men london was for a him a great stage but venice possessed these qualities in excelsis the masquerades of the carnival were participating in one giant dramatic performance of which the city was the centre the spectators become part of the play and the crowd swirls in and around this living theatre the memoirs of that quintessential venetian giacomo casanova demonstrate the facility with which life in the city can be turned into selfconscious and selfserving drama the individual venetian without mask or cloak can become a lithe performer goethe noticed a man by a quayside telling stories in venetian dialect to a small group of bystanders there was nothing obtrusive or ridiculous about his manner he wrote which was even rather sober at the same time both the variety and precision of his gestures showed art and intelligence venetians delighted in costume they sometimes seemed to be dressed up as actors playing in a particularly sophisticated city comedy and in a volume of illustrations was published with the title outfits of venetian men and women they had a keen eye for fashion and for striking colour they manifested an almost childlike delight in dressingup the patrician women of venice in particular loved sumptuous attire indeed they seem to have been almost obliged to do so by the state for one feast in honour of the french ambassadors in the senate ordered all female guests to arrive in bright clothing and to wear as many jewels as possible the appearance of wealth and luxury was all that mattered evelyn described the garb of venetian women as very odd as seeming allwayes in masquerade fynes morisson gave a more graphic description noting that they shew their naked necks and breasts and likewise their dugges bound up and swelling with linen their hats boasted many accessories including butterflies and flowers and stuffed birds but this was the venetian talent for outward show it seems from certain allusions that it was not customary to change undergarments very frequently they were scrupulous in one respect however they wore veils white for the young and black for the middleaged or the old but the venetian women were most notorious and conspicuous for their shoes or zoccoli these were effectively stilts as much as eighteen inches mm in height upon which they were balanced by attendants they looked like giants in a pantomime venetian women were said to be half of flesh and half of wood the preposterous footwear has been explained by the muddiness of the streets or by the venetian male restriction on female roaming it also allowed the presence of gaudy or decorative trains it is more likely however to have been a fashion that got out of control it might be mentioned in passing that venetian women had the general practice of dyeing their hair yellow one of the ingredients in the process was human urine but the quest for la bella figura ran among both genders and among all classes the women of the poorer sort wore simple gowns and shawls but they had a liking for small rings of chain which they wore around their wrists and necks the fishermen wore large brown hooded cloaks complete with scarlet lining the gondoliers wore white shoes and red sashes female servants wore frocks of dark brown or peacock blue the beggars were selfconsciously picturesque and would often wear a cloak in imitation of the richer citizens the working men dressed in blue tunics with wide sleeves narrowed at the wrists and the trousers that were first worn in venice became known as venetians or pantaloons the favourite colour of the people was azure blue translated as turchino and known to cassiodorus in the sixth century as the venetian colour it was possible from the dress of each venetian to know his exact position in the political hierarchy the patricians obeyed strict rules in all matters of dress only the doge was permitted to wear gold he also had the widest sleeves since the width of the sleeve was a mark of status the venetian patricians wore sober black gowns as an image of their presence as perpetual guardians of the state they were the priests of the polity those of higher rank dressed in scarlet or violet or purple the members of the senate for example wore purple but these too are grave and official colours over their gowns they wore hooded cloaks they also wore black caps or bereti since the priests the more important citizens the doctors and the lawyers of venice also wore black it is not difficult to see a city dressed in mourning many of the women poor and patrician also wore black it was essentially a uniform or in other words a costume with which to express uniformity the long robe also impeded quick movement so that the walk of the patrician was generally slow and deliberate in thomas coryat the english traveller recorded how they give a low congie to each other by very civil and courteous gestures as by bending of their bodies and clapping their right hand upon their breasts so black was the colour of gravity black was the colour of anonymity black also held elements of intimidation it represented death and justice the predilection for black lasted a thousand years its endurance a measure of the intense conservatism in all matters of venetian social custom indeed the taste has lingered it is not wonderful to see in the streets of twentyfirstcentury venice young men wearing large black capes there is still something odd something theatrical about the dress of contemporary venetians there was one group of venetians who showed off tremendously the young patricians of the renaissance city belonged to one of the numerous city clubs or calza guilds from the triumphanti to the valorosi the immortali to the principali the hose or calza on the right leg was sewn with gold and silver and besparkled with pearls and jewels it was drawn over tightly fitting breeches and reached the hip it was set off by a doublet of velvet worn over a flowing shirt of silk their long golden hair was as often as not dyed and then there was the perfume it might be expected in a most unnatural city that everything was scentedhats shirts socks handkerchiefs even the money was scented the calza guilds were best known for their presentation of theatrical performances for fêtes or wedding celebrations at which the young men and young women known as compagne excelled we wore the stocking of the club one of them giacomo contarini wrote to his brother in january as well as mantles of alexandrian velvet brocaded with silver doublets of crimson velvet with open sleeves zones of the same colour and squirrel fur linings on our heads caps alla sforzesca sforzesca can be interpreted as in the style of francesco sforza a celebrated condottiero or leader of mercenaries before his success it had been the fashion in venice to wear hats à la carmagnola after the name of a renowned general it is an indication of the venetian love of the trivial and the triumphant all expressed in the most theatrical possible manner the venetian patrician at his noblest had a long aquiline nose and high cheekbones he was the statesman as ascetic his skin was the palest white but a singular change can be dated precisely to in that year venetian men began to cut their hair short and to wear beards before that time they had worn their hair long and beards were only allowed as a sign of mourning once one or two tentatively made the change all the others duly followed there were other and more general changes by the late sixteenth century for example costumes became looser and fuller where once they had been stylised and closefitting the reasons are obscure buried somewhere in the human appetite for novelty and transformation it is no part of our purpose to write a history of fashion it is important only to recognise that for venetian men and women clothing was essentially dramatic costume in the eighteenth century criers walked through the streets of venice calling out the casts and performance times of the latest plays venetians were known throughout europe for their love of theatre it was a passion that touched all classes from the gondolier to the patrician and is nowhere more evident than in the extraordinary success of commedia dellarte this form of improvised comedy first emerged in the veneto of the sixteenth century although its ancient origins whether in classical drama or festive ritual seem undeniable one of its principal figures was pantaleone or pantalone a venetian name attached to the recognisably venetian figure of a sprightly if sometimes foolish old merchant venice was effectively ruled by old men he was dressed in a red costume and black cape with red turkish slippers as token of the fact that he traded with the east thus the sixth age of man according to jaques in as you like it is represented by the lean and slipperd pantaloon he always spoke in venetian dialect it has been surmised that his name comes from a corruption of pianta leone to plant the lion in reference to the lion of saint mark on the flag of venetian merchants his besetting vice is that of avarice the avarice of the wealthy man who fears to lose what he has rather than that of the poor man who wishes for more he is fearful a pacifist who nonetheless wishes to conquer the world by trade jealous of everything a fanatical patriot desperate wooer and miser highprincipled but subtle so fearful of being gulled that he runs headlong into situations that will guarantee his gulling he represents venices uneasy conscience from pantaloon too springs the name of pantomime we have venice to thank for a still popular english art the characters of the commedia were indeed pantomimic figures with arlecchino in his chequerboard costume and doctor graziano in his black robe the female parts were played by young men they wore masks and spoke in venetian dialect mixed with greek and slavonic words arlecchino spoke in the dialect of bergamo the town in lombardy from which many of the porters and labourers of venice came the actors were shown the scenario of the play but as soon as they stepped onto the temporary stage they invented the dialogue with a wit and vitality that were wholly native they were often obscene and always playful they engaged in fevered and acrobatic dances to the accompaniment of the lute and guitar the performers of the commedia were not averse to mocking contemporaries and contemporary types the audiences for these comedies could recognise themselves they screamed with laughter and applauded and cheered whenever a familiar allusion was made there were courtesans among the characters of the commedia and many courtesans among the audiences the themes of these improvised playsunhappy children miserly fathers disloyal servantswere the stuff of venetian social life it was a curious mixture of magniloquence and parody loud lamentation and broad farce these were plays about playacting it can be called the comedy of mercantile capitalism similar in spirit to the city comedies of early seventeenthcentury london comedy thus became the mirror of the world and then of course it spilled over into the perception of real people and real events some of the cases conducted before the courts of venice have the ingredients of a farcical sketch a french diplomat of the early seventeenth century mocked the grave venetian statesmen of the period as these pantaloons so there may have perhaps been something risible about the spectacle of these solemn figures all secretly pursuing profit for themselves the venetian people were themselves often derided as pantaloni byron noticed too the naivete and pantaloon humour of the venetians there is still a phrase in venice paga pantalon pantalon pays meaning the state or the taxpayer pays casanova records how he donned the costume of pierrot assuming the gait of a booby in the masquerades of the carnival you had to maintain the character of the person whose costume you had donned the early visitors to the carnival noted that the local citizens liked to dress up as the natives of other countries a venetian could become an actor without a moments hesitation it has sometimes been suggested that out of the songs and scenes of the commedia emerged the opera itself it is perhaps not surprising then that venice became the first centre of opera in europe the opera and the commedia embody the spirit and attitudes of the people they come out of the same circumstances and fulfil the same desires both arts spring from the spectacle inherent in the religious and civic rituals of the people the popularity of opera in venice is of course well documented never has an art so suited the temperament of the people the first public opera house in the world was created in venice in the patrician tron family opened one within the premises of its grand house and began to charge entrance fees for all who flocked there a second opera house opened two years later and within fifty years there were seven of them for librettists and composers there was now a flourishing trade the post of the impresario was born dancers and singers were hired under contract the structure of the opera itself became standardised with each of the principal singers awarded five arias and it was manufactured as quickly and as proficiently as a glass vase on murano or a ship in the arsenal between and separate operas were produced and staged opera flourished in venice because in many respects it was an urban art it was an art of contrast and heterogeneity in a city filled with contrasts between rich and poor squalor and splendour it was an art of the scenic and spectacular in a city filled with the energetic display of festival and carnival opera is concerned with external life life on display with the great general drama of the human spirit taken up in music and in song opera has to do with energy and splendour with ritual and melodrama it was thoroughly venetian it also sustained the myth of venice there were operas in which venice was hailed as a new troy or a new rome there were operas that dramatised the origins of venice among the exiles many of the stage sets were of venice itself the audiences clapped and whistled and yelled the gondoliers obtained free entrance they applauded by stamping their feet and uttering loud cries of bravo once they had heard a favourite aria they would stamp their feet so loudly that the singer would be obliged to return to the stage with a reprise after the aria was over flowers would rain down from the boxes together with scraps of paper on which laudatory poems had been written there were even occasions when doves with bells around their necks were released within the opera house one traveller noted the reaction of a venetian patrician in his box ah cara mi butto mi butto oh my darling ill jump ill jump venetian stagecraft was renowned throughout europe for its subtlety and elaboration john evelyn noted with approval a variety of scenes painted and contrived with no less art of perspective and machines for flying in the aire and other wonderful notions taken together it is one of the most magnificent and expensive diversions the wit of man can invent this fascination with the marvels of stagecraft was of a piece with the venetian predilection for fairytale plots and oriental settings there were shipwrecks and seamonsters firebreathing dragons emerging from the depths and classical deities gently lowered from the sky the cloud machines of venice were especially praised it was art as play burckhardt in the civilisation of the renaissance in italy quotes one venetian to the effect that the fame of the scenic arrangements apparati brought spectators from far and near but he went on to note that the skill and effectiveness of these engines of display were used only for comedies and other cheerful entertainments scenic display had helped to kill tragedy there never has been room for tragedy in venice the first european theatre specifically built for the production of plays was erected in venice in by the end of the seventeenth century there were eighteen public theatres a large number catering for a population that was never more than in the same period london possessed only six and paris only ten theatres in the sixteenth century according to the italian composer girolamo parabosco the citizens would climb walls break open doors or swim the canals to force their way into the place where some famous comedian was acting the members of the audience were as much part of the play as the players they gossiped and laughed and even gambled through the course of the drama people moved from box to box in search of conversation and entertainment the noise of their chatter was compared to that of a bush filled with birds the lighting was always dim and the boxes were almost wholly dark the desks of the musicians were illuminated by candles of spanish wax and the stage was lighted by lamps fed with olive oil the spectators in the boxes spat upon the spectators in the pit this was a custom endured with good spirit those in the pit were allowed to wear hats those in the boxes were not given that privilege the gondoliers the favourite sons of venice entered free of charge as in the opera houses they in turn set up claques for particular actors or particular playwrights they were often bribed to clap or to jeer on cue others merely waited at the back with lanterns for their masters between the acts vendors would pass among the people selling oranges and biscuits aniseed water and chestnuts coffee and ices the curtain would rise upon a classical temple a forest or a royal palace there would be processions and parades banquets and battles but there was one favourite subject it was the city itself the whole audience cheered any and every allusion to venice and they were delighted by amorous or mercenary dramas set in the streets and houses of the city it was an intensely local drama the spectators loved in particular the more reassuring emotions of family life if a character or scene violated the decorum of real life the audience would object in the most strenuous manner goethe witnessed a production which was stopped by the spectators when a young man was supposed to kill his wife with a sword the actor then stepped forward apologised and confirmed that the scene would after all end happily were they not after all part of one big if not entirely happy family this is nowhere more evident than in the work of the most famous of all venetian playwrights carlo goldoni his was the comedy of venetian social life he held a mirror up to venetian nature it was so congenial to him that in one year he completed sixteen threeact comedies in the course of his theatrical career from to he wrote plays like his compatriots tintoretto and titian and vivaldi he worked at high speed he was filled with verve and energy in the language of business he managed a quick turnover he began by writing formulaic dramas established upon the pattern of the commedia and then by happy instinct migrated to the mild comedy of venetian life he captivated his public with portraits of gondoliers and of servants of shopkeepers and housewives everything was staged on an intimate scale with that compactness and neatness intrinsic to the venetian character the typical setting is the campiello or little square the background is of familiar shops and houses he reproduced the language and the manners of the people with the utmost fidelity the larger world is of no consequence to his characters in one of his comedies a londoner talks of the canals of his city with the suggestion that goldoni believed london to resemble venice his characters do not concern themselves either with the politics of their city that was a task left to others they comprise a small group of people who steer their way through quarrels misunderstandings and awkward domestic moments households and families become unstable for a moment then they steady themselves and sail on the first stage directions of the fan one of his most famous comedies reveal a wholly venetian scene evarist and the baron sit towards the front at a little table drinking coffee limonato serves them crispino is cobbling in his booth near to him coronato sitting beside his door writing in a notebook the boots cleans the restaurant windows geltrude and candida on the terrace knitting to the right tognino is sweeping the square nina is spinning before her house door beside her stands moracchio holding two hunting dogs by a cord every now and again timoteo puts his head out of the pharmacy in the background susanna sewing before her shop it is a perfect miniature goldoni was true to the spirit of the people too in his ability to see the absurd aspect of serious things there was much mockery and some impertinence but no malice in his humour there is no violence upon his stage goldoni carefully refrained from the frank obscenity of the earlier commedia his characters idle and gossip they are lively and witty they talk about the latest play and the most recent scandal they are very interested in money but they are generally amiable and convivial all of these qualities may be said to be characteristic of the venetian temperament in the first half of the eighteenth century there is no inwardness there are no meditations or monologues we may call goldonis drama superficial therefore but it is not meant to be anything else it is a drama of surfaces the venetians on the stage are not properly individualised they think and act like a community they are not known for their eccentricities they express no great passions everyone is affected by the same sentiments and has much the same identity that is why goldonis comedies are couched in the genial poetry of domesticity they do not record the exploits and sensibilities of outstanding individuals or aberrant types all is light and graceful goldoni celebrated the inherent dignity of ordinary human nature and what then were the characteristics of the venetians themselves they were universally reported to be cheerful with an innate gaiety and spontaneity of address henry james believed that they have at once the good fortune to be conscious of few wants and thus allowed their lives to be measured by sunshine and leisure and conversation they had a freedom of manner although it is something of a paradox that they were governed by one of the most severe systems of government in europe there may be some connection between public discipline and private liberty george sand described them as a gay unthinking people so witty and so full of song they were also described as frivolous mercurial and naive that may be the darker aspect of gaiety they were considered by other italian citystates as inept and unreliable they were deemed to be fickle and unjust they had a propensity to forget even the most recent and the most grave misfortunes it may be the forgetfulness of excessive vivacity the naivety however may have been characteristic of the people rather than of the patricians by the government they were treated almost as children hence their trust of the state and the climate of submissiveness in which they seemed to flourish addison believed that the senate of venice encouraged sports and factions among the common people in order to preserve the safety of the republic they were then ambiguous they were difficult to read ambiguity reflecting the ambiguous status of a city on the water may be the key in the eighteenth century a nun could also be a prostitute a gondolier might be a very wealthy man a richly clad patrician might have no money albrecht dürer reported that among them were the most faithless lying thievish rascals such as i could scarcely believed could exist on earth and yet if one did not know them one would think that they were the nicest men on earth it could be argued that this is true of humankind in general under whatever sky but in a city of masks and secrets this ambiguity becomes manifold and pervasive it becomes more intense it is certainly the source of the charge of duplicity that was always being levelled against them they possessed a talent for dissimulation in their dealings with other states and indeed with each other in the business of law and government they disguised their greed with the semblance of honesty and piety they hid their guile under the mask of polity it became their nature in the phrase of one english observer to sew a piece of fox tayle to the skinne of smarks lyon there were many stories of their duplicity when the king of hungary came to venice in the fifteenth century he begged the body of saint paul the hermit from the canons of the church of s zulian they did not wish to offend the sovereign and so they gave him the body of one of the grimani family the hungarians then worshipped this worthless body as a holy relic the city of masks was adept at the art of concealment that is why the venetians were always polite evincing what was known as their characteristic dolce maniera they were celebrated for their good manners they were formal and reserved in their public demeanour perhaps recalling the venetian proverb that he who loves foreigners loves the wind there was a certain courtliness from which the venetian patrician could keep his distance the memoirs and records suggest that they were courteous and composed even in their private dealings they loved form and surface above everything in company venetians were observed to be stiff relying entirely upon propriety and correctness of behaviour unlike other italians for example they were not known for extravagance of gesture or language there were certain significant catchphrases adoped in the official texts of the city councillors were called prudentes et cauti prudent and cautious an officer of state was sapiens et circumspectus vir wise and circumspect they were pious for example but they were not zealots savonarola would not have been welcomed in venice their humour however was unambiguously coarse there is a venetian saying to the effect that if you want to laugh talk about shit the statue of one famous and overproductive author niccolò tommaseo is known as el cacalibri or bookshitter the vulgarity as in england has much to do with a culture of practicality and common sense there was for example a certain harsh realism in their statecraft in this romantic city there were few romantics the humour is often at the expense of hypocrisy and pretence it was often dark and on occasions bitter or savage the venetians were great deflaters of the pompous or the preening this may have been the instinctive reaction of a population inured to the hypocrisies or pious pretences of public life it was a way of striking back of showing that they were not really fooled wheels within wheels in venice was described as the summary of the universe because all that the world contained could be found somewhere within it if the world were a ring then venice was its jewel it is in some respects the model city the ultimate city defying nature and the natural world it is the most urban of cities occupying a realm of meaning very different from those communities rooted on earth and soil as such it offers lessons to other cities lewis mumford in the city in history notes that if the civic virtues of venice had been understood and imitated later cities would have been better planned the system of transport for example with the fast grand canal cutting across the slowermoving smaller canals was a model of its kind the waters of the lagoon have also ensured that the city remained of a manageable size it did not sprawl and its only suburbs were the other islands that had an intrinsic life of their own it has also become a paradigm of european culture one may claim plausibly that the first industrial revolution occurred in venice rather than in england with the management of shipbuilding glassmaking and mirrormaking it was the first centre of commodity capitalism the focal point of a vast urban network that spread across europe and the near east it was a city dependent upon and also sustaining other cities it represented a new form of civilisation that had moved from agrarian to mercantile life it has always been an emblematic place in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries for example it was interpreted as the ultimate cityperverse unnatural reducing its population to servile status in our own century it may also be classified as the first postmodern city the city as game in that sense venice may be the harbinger of a common human destiny its polity itself became a model for others hobbes wrote his leviathan after an extended residence in venice that book has in turn been seen as an apologia for the burgeoning market economy the political reformers of the puritan commonwealth in the seventeenth century looked towards venice as a viable model of a modern republic so did the founding fathers of the united states the administration of the state was paradigmatic in another sense it became the model for all other forms of rule and order in the city the election procedures of the guilds were established upon the elaborate rules for the election of a doge the meeting halls of the fraternities were based upon the halls of the ducal palace and were similarly decorated with historical and mythical painting the diamond lozenges on the façade of the ducal palace are locked into a mesh venetian madrigals of the sixteenth century are known for their complex of overlapping voices each singer distinctly heard in a dense and undulating body of sound the topography of the city itselfwith its small bridges canals and narrow callireflects the intricacy and interlinked dependency of republican institutions the multiplication of magistracies and agencies in the supervision of venice was often described as labyrinthine as the streets and alleys themselves the members of the various committees were replaced every six months or every twelve months giving a shifting pattern to the polity much like that of the movement of the sea did the territory determine the polity or did the polity form the territory it is an unanswerable question so deeply implicated in the origins of human behaviour that it must for ever remain unresolved so what was the secret of this polity that crept into every feature of venetian social life dudley carleton the english ambassador in venice in the early seventeenth century had an analogy with one of the commodities the city traded the republic is a clock going with many wheels and making small motions sometimes out of order but soon mended and all without change or variety these wheels and wheels within wheels were the various organs of the state the earliest guardians of venice from the first settlement of the lagoon were the tribunes of the various islands they were elected annually yet this loose structure proved unworkable and in the first doge was elected paoluccio anafesto was chosen and acclaimed by all the people in a general assembly on the island of heraclea it was believed that the spirit of republican rome had been reborn yet as in rome the power of certain leading families was used to destroy any incipient democratic spirit only the rich and powerful merited the awards of office in the tenth and eleventh centuries there were many feuds between the aristocratic families doges were assassinated or expelled from office in the middle of the twelfth century a group of officials was formed to help and advise the doge it was known as the commune although it had none of the revolutionary implications of the later use of that word it was not enough at the end of the twelfth century a council of the aristocratic families was formally instituted to check the activities of the doge it was they who now elected the leader and the doge was merely presented to the people for their approval he came upon the balcony to the words this is your doge if so it please you at a later time even this acknowledgement of the power of the people was removed there were further restrictions placed upon the nature of government in a law was passed that allowed access to the great council only to those patrician gentlemen whose fathers or paternal grandfathers had already sat in the body it was to be an exclusive club and venice became an hereditary aristocracy by the nomenclature of the commune had been dropped and the state was for ever after known as dominio o signoria signifying power or lordship so by the beginning of the fifteenth century the essential structure of venetian government was shaped and determined there were some constitutional changes in the sixteenth century but the principles remained the same until the end of the republic in it was as if eighteenthcentury england were still governed by the polity of richard ii and henry iv this structure had evolved over many centuries and like the mammalian life of australia it was a unique phenomenon born out of relative isolation it was made up of a series of councils and official bodies each of which participated in some kind of mystical unity like the threefold divinity of the trinity at the base of a complex and striated pyramid was the general assembly which met only to ratify essential legislation above them lay the great council which in theory elected the various magistracies the members of the lesser councils and the doge himself the councils included the forty a specialised body of patricians and the ducal councillors the members of these councils comprised the senate at the top of the pile stood the doge it would tax the reader too far to elaborate further upon the wearisome and complex organisation of the various councils and assemblies and magistracies it was scarcely understood by the venetians themselves but an insight can be gained into the labyrinthine venetian mind by describing the process by which a doge was elected on the morning of the election the youngest member of the signoria one branch of the administration fell on his knees to pray in the basilica then he went out into saint marks square and stopped the first boy whom he met this child then became the ballotino who drew the nomination slips from the urn in the ducal palace in the first ballot the great council chose thirty of its members in a second vote nine were chosen out of this original thirty in turn the nine chose forty each of whom had to receive seven nominations a new ballot would then reduce this forty to twelve who voted for twenty who voted for nine who voted for fortyfive who voted for eleven these eleven then voted for fortyone the final fortyone voters would then elect the doge no more cumbersome and intricate procedure could have been devised its only purpose was to eliminate individual chicanery and special interests but it suggests an almost obsessive preoccupation with communal solidarity the cohesiveness was maintained by a myriad of overlapping powers and offices this fostered a sense of equilibrium so important in the floating city and of adaptability it also afforded a measure of judicial oversight it was government by debate and by committee what it lacked in novelty and excitement it made up for in prudence and continuity it was patient and it was thorough that was why it endured the rapid turnover of magistracies most of them lasting for only six months meant that the patricians were trained very quickly in various fields of administration there was inevitably inefficiency and confusion together with a bewildering number of bureaucratic procedures but they were considered to be a price worth paying for good order the secret of success perhaps lay in the curious fact that no one could really know where true power resided there was no single authority venice was in name a republic but in practice it is best described as a plutocracy only one hundred familes were allowed to participate in the government the citizens and the popolani or lower class were excluded the polity also had all the features of a gerontocracy patricians under the age of forty were excluded from the senate in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the average age of a doge on the day of his election was seventytwo the doges were always older than the popes the only other office in italy where the leader was elected for life this might be an advertisement for the healthy air of the republic but it is also a reflection of the emphasis that the venetians placed on tradition and experience the road to leadership being a long one required patience and obedience the length of service to the republic fostered conformity and compromise it was also a precautionary measure no doge would rule for a very long time or acquire too much power the military commanders and the principal members of the government were old domenico contarini for example was seventyfive when he was elected general of the venetian forces in he was not exceptional a government of young menwe may take as an example the medieval english monarchycreates a culture of impassioned fervour of sudden violence and intense rivalry none of these occurred in venice there were rivalries of course in the last decades of the sixteenth century there were tensions between the representatives of the old families dating from the first years of the republic and of the new families who had arrived at a somewhat later date the new families were opposed to the encroaching power of the council of ten and wished to refurbish the trade of venice by finding new markets there was in fact a gradual change of emphasis in the administration of the city but it was a slow and cumulative process there was no descent into party or faction everyone depended on everyone else to maintain the smooth working of the governmental machine no individual ambition or familial rivalry was allowed to undermine the safety of the state corruption was general and widespread every office marino sanudo wrote in october is filled for money it was common for rivals vying for a particular post to come into the great council carrying bags of gold loans were offered to individual electors there was an old venetian saying that to give a favour is to receive a favour there were over eight hundred offices to be filled in the city and a major preoccupation of the patrician class lay in lobbying for position this was especially true of the poorer members of the governing class known as the svizzeri after the swiss mercenaries who had no other source of income or status legislation was continually passed against electoral corruption and the intricate procedures for the choice of even the most minor official were designed to circumvent the more obvious forms of bribery but the elaborate precautions are themselves significant they suggest a deep awareness of the possibility of corruption a city that is deeply corrupted will go to extraordinary lengths to seem incorruptible the word for plot and chicanery imbroglio derives from the very topography of venice the brolo or broglio was the garden laid out before the ducal palace here the patricians would walk and plot their latest moves it was the place for lobbying and for intrigue where a smile or the tug of a sleeve was the only necessary sign the doge therefore was the most senior member of the government in the earliest times he wore a biretta or bonnet like the ancient kings of phrygia he was dressed in a mantle of silk fringed with gold and secured by golden buttons his shoes and stockings were red he was elected for life but he was surrounded by restrictions and regulations there would be no caesar in venice the doge could not open his own mail he could not receive foreign visitors in private he could not discuss matters of policy without consulting his councillors he could not leave the city without permission he could not even travel in the city without gaining approval he could not buy expensive jewellery or own property outside venetian territory he could not display the ducal arms beyond the confines of the ducal palace he was never to be called my lord but only messer doge or sir lord no one was to kneel before him or to kiss his hand it was said that he was essentially a tavern sign swinging in the wind the more true power he forfeited the more he was loaded with pomp and ceremony yet he possessed power of a kind he was after all the figurehead of the state sir henry wotton declared that like the sun he doth effect all his purposes in radio obliquo not by direct authority he presided over all the elective councils including those of the senate the great council and the council of ten he was the general supervisor of all the organs of government he had to preside twice a week at public audiences and his ceremonial duties were onerous he was the symbolic representative of the venetian state in a literal sense he embodied the health of the nation his dress and demeanour were scrutinised for any change of emphasis when during a debate on the conduct of a difficult war the doge left his seat in order to urinate his action caused a sensation but part of his power lay elsewhere he knew all the secrets of the city on his death the same formulaic words were pronounced with much displeasure we have heard of the death of the most serene prince a man of such goodness and piety however we shall make another the signet ring was removed from his finger and broken in half the dead doges family had to leave the palace within three days and their furniture was removed three inquisitors were appointed to scrutinise all the actions of the doge and if necessary to punish his heirs for any fraudulence or wrongdoing only in that way could the state resist the rise of powerful families the doge was the patrician among the patricians the social strucure of venice was in essence very simple the patricians comprised per cent of the population the citizens represented a further per cent the rest approximately nine tenths of the population were simply the people or popolani each group had its own functions and its own privileges it was a highly structured and deeply hierarchical societya society of legally defined estates and ordersmade up of a number of interlocking networks and affinities bound together for the greater glory of god and the city yet how was it possible that per cent could effectively master and control per cent of the population they bribed them they deceived them they created internal rivalries they consoled them for their lack of power by weaving myths of origin and identity it is the story of human history itself we may begin with the largest number of the venetians the popolani were made up of tradesmen artisans and labourers and the poor they formed a social rather than an economic category so there were differences in wealth between the popolo grande the richer landowners and merchants and the shopkeepers or artisans of the popolo minuto there were so many local variations in fact that we cannot entertain a description of the people in any political sense there was no feeling of solidarity as the spanish ambassador put it in the popolani is made up of so many elements that i do not think it can ever start a riot even though it is large enough to occupy and fill the whole of venice the people were generally believed to be loyal and tractable with an affection for their native city that far outweighed any tendency to protest or rebel there were other good reasons for the maintenance of social order and stability among the people there was always enough cheap food except on unusual occasions of emergency and famine and through the centuries the wages of the workers maintained a relatively high level there was none of the endemic distress for example that characterised the lower class of paris or london it would have been impossible to write les misérables in venice the people could be fierce however but only with one another the poorer people the fishermen and the gondoliers and the servants and the labourers formed two great factions across the city known as the castellani also named the arsenalotti and the nicolotti it was an ancient division born from the enmity between the federated townships of the veneto jesolo and heraclea from which the venetian settlers first came well into the twentieth century the nicolotti wore a black cap and a black sash around the waist while the castellani wore red the nicolotti also had their own version of political power since from the fourteenth century they had acquired the custom of electing their own leader known as the gastaldo grande who was solemnly taken in procession to greet the doge in the ducal palace the arsenalotti had their own privileges the workers of the arsenal were deputed to stand guard when the general council was in session and they acted as a bodyguard for the doge by these means the popolani were drawn into the life of the state so the venetian people were not accustomed to and indeed had a hatred for political sedition their territories were clearly divided with the castellani to the east and the nicolotti to the west centred around the parishes of s pietro di castello and s nicolò dei mendicoli the boundaries were a clear indication of the fact that in the earliest days the city itself was a collection of independent communities one church straddled the common frontier s trovaso but the castellani entered by the south door and the nicolotti by the west door there were often street fights between the two factions tolerated by the government on the assumption of divide and rule by fighting among themselves they minimised the chances of general urban riot against the authorities in a series of battles in over forty combatants were killed but in succeeding years these encounters were gradually turned into staged games and contests such as the regattas in true venetian fashion aggression was softened into ritual the popolani had no political power but they enjoyed a different version of hierarchy and degree in the membership of guilds or confraternities all of the ordinary occupations of trading life had their representative organisation there were over a hundred of them registered in the thirteenth century and they offered exclusive rights for dyers and coopers masons and carpenters ropemakers and fruiterers there were guilds of hempspinners and fustianweavers two hundred altogether throughout the city maintaining an intricate occupational web that kept every worker in his or her place so it was a covert way of maintaining control of the working population like other medieval guilds throughout europe they were exclusive and hierarchical they moved against strangers or foreigners working in the city they laid down standards of good practice and punished those who ignored them they had their own officers and their own courts they organised the markets and perhaps most importantly they provided financial support for any member who was out of work for reasons of accident and illness no male venetian could practise his craft without joining the appropriate guild no man could join his guild without first swearing an oath of allegiance to the city but of course no member of the guild had any status in the political life of the republic it is pertinent and significant that none of the most important professions such as lawyers and merchants had or needed to have guilds in order to protect their interests the state performed that role for them the guilds maintained the rights of the workers but they were also insistent upon the duties involved they had for example to furnish conscripts for service in the galleys through the agency of the guilds too the state could enforce discipline within the various trades the guilds were also brought into the devotional life of the state by becoming involved in specific religious rituals and processions they adopted certain saints as their patrons or patronesses before whose shrines they would light candles on days of festival by these means the morality of state power was enshrined in popular consciousness so were the independence and the status of the workers as maintained by the guilds part of some grand illusion it all depends on the observer the trades of the popolani were in a literal sense one of the pillars of venetian life the two pillars of the piazzetta holding up saint marks lion and saint theodore had on their granite bases carved images of the workers of the citythe winesellers the cattledealers the smiths the fishermen the basketmakers the butchers the fruiterers all had their place these images have now been effaced by time and weather like their counterparts on the venetian streets they have disappeared the craftsmen of venice have now become so many tourist shows when the trades marched in procession to greet a new doge they arranged themselves in predetermined order the glassblowers led the way followed in turn by the smiths the furriers the weavers the tailors the woolcarders and others in the rearguard came the fishmongers the barbers the goldsmiths the combmakers and the lanternmakers each trade had its own liveries its own symbols and its own band of musicians it has been estimated that in the late sixteenth century the unskilled labourers and artisans of the city below the level of guild membership comprised some ten thousand men and women if the members of their immediate families are taken into account they comprised a quarter of the entire population they were essentially the proletariat feeding venices mercantile capitalism the class above the popolani was known as the cittadini it was a distinction afforded by birth and by residence and by the duty of paying certain taxes it was not an economic group in any meaningful sense of the word an aspirant had to prove that both his grandfather and his father had been born in venice and that the family had for three generations been untainted by any form of manual labour at a later date it was sufficient for a man to have lived in the city for fifteen years and to have paid all the requisite taxes once this was determined the citizen was free to enter the ranks of the bureaucracy for example that lay behind the venetian state machine the cittadini were in large part the civil servants of the city with all the virtues and vices of that group but they provided the continuity and efficiency necessary for the business of government little or nothing is known of them as individuals throughout the history of venice they were the anonymous and uncelebrated servants of the state they dressed like and copied the solemn manners of the patricians at the top of this unified society stood the patricians themselves the exclusive class or caste that governed the republic throughout its history never have so few ruled so peacefully over so many they have already been described with their black gowns and stately manner in previous pages of this book in the extant portraits they resemble one another in gesture and expressionor perhaps in the lack of those elements since they are depicted as possessing no interior life to speak of they are inscrutable it was said of one doge that no one knew whether he loved or hated anything yet their gravity and selfcontrol afforded a sense of continuity and firmness in a floating world in a world of shifting appearances they were changeless there were poor as well as rich nobles but the largest number of patricians always wished to retain the exclusivity of their rank in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries the great council was closed to all those outside the charmed circle it was a form of government by virtue of inheritance a list of the chosen families was then inscribed in a register that became known as the golden book there were twentyfour of them recorded in who had been part of venetian life from at least the seventh century they included the bragadin the polani the querini and the zorzi by the seventeenth century there were approximately families or clans coming together in various informal associations of interest this multiplicity of factions ensured the stability of the state since no one family or interest could achieve supremacy yet they were so relatively few in number that they knew each other very well they knew the virtues and the weaknesses of all those aspiring to high office the last surviving relics of the patrician class are still standing they are the great houses of venice until the sixteenth century even the grandest houses of the patricians were simply known as dwellings casa or ca after that date they were often given the more distinguished appellation of palazzo some of them indeed were palaces of noble rooms and rich furniture i never saw palaces william hazlitt wrote in anywhere but at venice their façades can be seen beside both banks of the grand canal while others are lost in the tapestry of alleys and smaller canals that comprise the rest of the city in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries these mansions had a utilitarian function they were trading post as well as domicile they represented the collective identity of the family they represented the honour of the succeeding male generations there were rules encouraging the members of the same family to retain possession of the house a fixed point in a floating world some of the houses looked away from the water and were assembled around an inner courtyard the ground floor or central portego was used as a storeroom and as business quarters opening onto the canals for the easy traffic in goods there was a waterentrance and a landentrance on the upper floors were the living quarters the central hall on the first floor the sala opened onto suites of rooms on either side there were also a myriad of small rooms for the various members of the extended family as well as private staircases in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the hall was made grander its furnishings more ornate and its interior decoration more sumptuous this was the period when the patricians were moving from involvement in merchandise to investment in estates on the mainland it was in fact only in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries when venice deemed itself to be the new imperial city that the great houses with grand incrusted façades were built for display the mouldings and capitals and filigree were part of a public attempt to emphasise the grandeur of the city many were decorated with frescoes devised by artists such as titian and giorgione others like the ca doro were encrusted with precious metals venice looked like a city of marble and gold it should be recalled that these were palaces rather than castles unlike the houses of the nobility in the rest of italy they were not fortified or defended in any way there was no need v empire of trade the lion city as venice grew richer it became more powerful a city needs a ruling authority and the acquisition of authority invites arrogance and belligerence it encourages the will for further power venice surrounded by the sea could not grow out of its own frontier but it could be enlarged and enriched by its extension in other lands and in other cities it could become an empire in earliest times la serenissima the city of the virgin had been given a masculine identity by its citizens it was the lion city the very conditions of its existence made warfare an inevitable part of its history there was warfare against the natural world and then warfare against its competitors it was obliged to fight for its survival venice had archers and oarsmen and maritime warriors sea powers are natural competitors while land powers may agree to the division of land into frontiers the ocean has no frontier wherever there is sea there are hostile ships throughout its long history venice could never rest the drawing books of jacopo bellini composed in the midfifteenth century contain many studies of cavaliers and crossbowmen preparing themselves for combat half of bellinis lifetime was spent in the battles of venice against other powers this nation of sailors petrarch wrote was so skilful in the handling of horses and weapons so spirited and so hardy that it surpassed all other warlike nations whether by sea or by land so it can indeed be construed as a masculine city the history of venice was conceived and composed as the history of patriarchal families the government of venice was patriarchal in all of its elements the society of venice was considered to be patrilinear in nature the image of the city was wholly dependent upon the exercise of paternal authority the patrician youth were trained to use the bow and to command galleys at sea they were educated in all the knightly virtues in a period when the chivalric code of warfare was honoured throughout europe the first jousts in saint marks square are recorded as early as from that time forward they were staged at regular intervals in bellinis drawing books chivalric opponents dash upon each other in spectacular tournaments on these occasions the city was given up to the celebration of militarism and the military virtues it provided the theatre of war painters were employed to embellish shields and armour as well as icons and portraits artists among them bellini himself were used to design fortifications and draw military maps in the sacred paintings of venice the saints are often seen wielding swords saint george one of the patrons of the city was the archetypal military saint this is very different from the picture of venetians as quickwitted traders or as earnest statesmen but knightly valour was once an aspect of their culture how else could the venetians have created an empire so they knew how to use force when it was required they were quick to strike when the opportunity presented itself one conquest led to another conquest in fact one conquest demanded another conquest in a state that never felt itself secure the condition of the world was always perilous unsuccessful generals and admirals were imprisoned exiled or killed when they employed the newly invented cannon against a recalcitrant italian town an old chronicle reported that one would think that god were thundering one cannon was named the venetian woman who casts down every wall and spike the first colonies of venice were in the lagoon itself originally the smaller islands had selfruling or selfsustaining communities once each island had its monastery and its church but soon enough they all became part of venice itself the leaders of the city might then take comfort from the opening words of the ninetyseventh psalm the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad thereof the multitude of islands were swallowed up by the great city growing in their midst or their communities simply withered away torcello seven miles km to the north of the most serene city was once a thriving place before the city of venice ever rose from the waters it was a great civic centre for the exiles from venetia they had first come in the middle of the fifth century a cathedral of byzantine form was raised here in the seventh century it was built as a refuge and a strength by exiles fleeing from the mainland the windows of the church have shutters of stone wealthy monasteries were founded on its fertile soil in the tenth century it was described by the emperor constantine vii porphyrogenitus as magnum emporium torcellanorum yet the success of venice led ineluctably to the decay of torcello there was no room for two thriving centres of trade in the lagoon there are some however who say that it was poisoned by the malarial waters of the lagoon the sea was silted up and the island was surrounded by stagnant ponds there may be truth to this but the visitation of disease added only the final blow to a long process of disintegration ineluctably torcello sank in the significance of the world in the nineteenth century a nobleman of spurious or dubious origin was dubbed as a count of torcello now the once thriving island supports a handful of people all around are wastes of mudfilled creeks and rivulets and what ruskin described as salt morass the brick campanile and the mosaics within the cathedral itself are the only remnants of its faded splendour the civic square is covered by wild grass yet the silence of this island interrupted sometimes by the soughing of the wind through the reeds or the rustle of rippling waters is a vivid token of the primeval lagoon to which the first veneti came another symbol can be found here of the venetian world there is a restaurant on the island frequented by the tourists who journey to torcello as an outdoor museum it is really no more than that and might it then somehow anticipate the fate of venice itself on the majority of the islands could once be found a tall campanile and brickbuilt church there was a small piazza with the image of the lion on wall or pillar there were little clusters of whitewashed houses their gardens protected from the depredations of the salt wind by neat red fences then they were touched by decay more insidious than the wind the island of ammiana once boasted eight churches then it was depopulated and turned into a salt farm and where did the inhabitants go they migrated to venice all of these dead towns and cities and settlements could once have been proposed as alternatives to venice they might have flourished and grown strong as venice did if we were to follow the precepts of italo calvinos invisible cities we might create the possible cities of the lagoon the distinct customs and dialects of each island might then have created several different cities resembling and yet not resembling venice itself but then this would be a fantasy other islands once under venetian control have disappeared the island of constanziaca was engulfed by the waters it had once contained monasteries and churches it became so woeful however that it was turned into a burial site where the bones of the dead were left to bleach in the sun then with all its churches and bones it simply subsided into the sea no one knows its precise position other islands suffered a similar fate among them terra dei mani and terra dei soleri five little islands encircling murano have been washed away by tides and currents there is seaweed now where once tall cypresses grew some islands were overcome by earthquakes or tidal waves others were claimed by a slow and general desuetude they could not compete against the most serene city the venetian authorities turned some of these once flourishing islands into prisons or hospitals it was one way of pushing the undesirable elements of the population to the margins it was also an exercise in total power the island of s servolo was turned into a lunatic hospital for men while the island of s clemente was a mental asylum for venetian women sacca sessola was a place of exile for those suffering from consumption while the isola della grazia held those who burned with fever on the island of poveglia were laid out huts for the lepers banished from the city all these islands were known to the venetians as isole del dolore or the islands of sorrow the island of s biagio now called giudecca was once a green haven of orchards and gardens here were a convent a home for penitent prostitutes and a pilgrims hostel but the secular world of venice intervened it became essentially a suburb of the city other islands were used as agricultural factories for the markets of the rialto in the second half of the fifteenth century the island now known as the lido became an extension of venices port it became part of the economic zone that now encircled and sustained the city the beginning of the venetian empire beyond the lagoon can be found in the ninth century venice was not as yet a leading seapower that position was reserved for the spanish and for the north africans but it needed to control its immediate environment it had to find and maintain a reliable food supply for an increasing population it needed to secure access to water and to agricultural land it needed to control the lifelines of its trade so venice turned to the mainland the people of the sea were obliged to conquer terra firma towards the close of the ninth century venice sacked the rival cities on the italian coast and took control of the mouths of the adige and po rivers the rivers gave them access to the markets of northern italy within a short time the bargemen of the city were offering their wares in pavia the capital of lombardy the merchants of venice were prominent too in the markets of verona and cremona in the tenth century venetian markets and warehouses were built on the banks of the rivers sile and piave the venetians occupied a castle beside the livenza river so that their goods could reach the german traders coming down into italy by the venetian traders had a colony in limoges and by the next century they had diffused themselves into marseilles and toulouse the corngrowing areas of treviso and bassano were acquired in this period too the venetians began the slow process of purchasing mainland property and territory some of the great families of venice like the badoer and tiepolo acquired land around treviso the larger monasteries purchased estates along the coastal plain this gradual enlargement of venetian property continued for seven centuries the key issue as always was that of commerce and in particular of the supply of grain once the trade with northern italy and much of europe was considered secure the governors of venice turned their attention towards the sea the merchants already effectively controlled the trade in eastern goods but the success of that trade demanded that the routes to the east should be strengthened and defended the sea was to be made safe for the mass transport of goods the principal cities of istria immediately across the sea from venice submitted the northern part of the adriatic became known as the gulf of venice then the venetian navy worked downwards by the end of the tenth century it effectively controlled the middle adriatic and set about the conquest of dalmatia now part of modern croatia the islands and cities of the region surrendered to the superior force and numbers of the venetians some cities more alarmed by the depredations of the pirates who found safe haven in the small islands and inlets along the dalmatian coast invited the doge and his troops to enter their gates other cities were tormented by the demands of the petty despots characteristically living in fortress outposts and preferred the more benign sovereignty of venice other places were simply happy to enter stable trading relations with the great seacity all of them were treated as allies rather than as subjects of venice yet in truth the empire was being born the pirates were defeated the marauding slavs were pushed back from the coast in the doge added the honorific of dux of dalmatia to his title the seaway was open for increased traffic with egypt and more particularly with byzantium venice had already become that ancient citys single most important trading partner sending slaves and timber in exchange for wine oil and wheat in greek and arab envoys travelled from the east to pay respect to the new doge and a year later a treaty confirmed that venice had been granted most favoured status by the byzantine emperor it confirmed what was already known venice had become the dominant trader of europe its commercial supremacy sustained by a vigorous and expanding navy in return venice offered its ships as transport for byzantine soldiers crossing the adriatic the city was also for all practical purposes inviolable at the time of the magyar invasions of lombardy at the end of the ninth century a stone wall was built to defend the islands of the rialto a great chain was placed across the water to prevent enemy ships from entering the grand canal but the precautions were unnecessary the magyars could not reach the seagirt city they were beaten off in the shallow waters of the lagoon where their ships foundered and sank the great wall itself was demolished in the fourteenth century it was not required by the eleventh century therefore venice had become an autonomous and influential state in the latter part of that century it fought with the troops of byzantium against the norman invaders of sicily the reason for the norman adventure as well as all the other policies and actions of venice in this period was very simple no other state or city could be allowed to block the mouth of the adriatic thus imprisoning venice within its own waters this was the great fear and the abiding preoccupation it has become customary to describe the eleventh century as the period in which latin christendom emerged triumphant this is nowhere more powerfully evinced than in the history of the crusades they have been construed as a direct attack upon the muslim world or as a form of spiritual imperialism but the participation of venice in the first crusade had no such motives the venetians were waging economic warfare by other means they were not concerned with the cross or with the sword but with the purse the point was that rival trading cities genoa and pisa in particular were already taking part venice could not permit its competitors to gain an advantage in the lucrative markets of syria and egypt to have a permanent presence in antioch or in jerusalem would be a source of innumerable commercial benefits so in the summer of a fleet of two hundred venetian ships arrived at joppa jaffa the venetian commanders agreed to help the crusaders on condition that the merchants of their city were given the rights of free trade in all dominions recovered from the saracens the terms of this practical bargain were accepted the venetians were then despatched to besiege the town of caifa haifa and having achieved the surrender of that place they returned to the lagoon before the end of the year they were not content however with this single and relatively simple victory they wished to acquire more profit from their participation in the holy cause they established trading stations within the syrian ports and began a lucrative business in transporting pilgrims to the newly captured jerusalem on their way to joppa too they had engaged in a peculiarly venetian piece of business the fleet had cast anchor at the ancient lycian town of myra bari in search of the bones of saint nicholas who had been bishop of that place the saint is now better known as the progenitor of santa claus but in the eleventh century he was revered as the patron saint of sailors the venetians naturally enough wanted him it is alleged that they arrived in the town and put to the torture four christians the keepers of the shrine they learned nothing of any consequence from these unholy proceedings however and made do with the theft of the bones of saint theodore theodore had been the patron saint of venice before the arrival of mark he was a good secondbest yet before their departure according to the venetian chronicles of andrea morosini a wonderful fragrance issued from a recess beneath an altar in the church itself the scent was that of saint nicholas so he was removed too and brought back in triumph to venice where his bones were lodged in the monastery of saint nicholas on the lido that is the story at least in fact the remains of saint nicholas if such they are have remained in bari to this day whether the tale reveals more of venetian mendacity or of venetian greed is an open question the crusading venture had been a success for venice and in the venetian fleet once more sailed under the flag of the cross it may be noted that the governors of the city were particularly interested in the seaports of the mediterranean and that venetian merchants were established in acre jerusalem and elsewhere yet the attentions of the doge and senate were not confined to the principalities and powers of the middle east they thought it prudent to maintain and consolidate their presence on the mainland they took ferrara and fano under their control and moved against padua in the process they reasserted their rights over the principal rivers of the territory on the other side of the adriatic they struggled with the hungarians over the coastal regions of dalmatia they now had many enemies the cities of the mainland were jealous of venetian wealth and fearful of venetian power the norman kingdom of sicily had long regarded venice as a foe the german empire of hohenstaufen still laid claim to northern italy there emerged one other formidable enemy in the new emperor of constantinople decreed that the trading privileges of venice were at an end he ordered all venetian residents within the boundary of his empire to remove themselves and their business he also proposed a treaty with the king of hungary thereby recognising hungarian claims to the venetian settlements in dalmatia the reaction of venice was slow but assured the venetian fleet raided and sacked a number of byzantine territories rhodes chios samos lesbos and modon were some of the objects of their vengeance they had set out to prove that they were now the single most important sea power in an area previously deemed to be the preserve of constantinople the emperor signed a new trade agreement with venice in the venetian empire could justify its existence with the claim that trade and not conquest was its purpose it naturalised its subjects with a spirit of enlightened commercialism the motive was one of constructive selfaggrandisement there was no true cult of empire as there was in nineteenthcentury london or in thirdcentury rome there was no interest in massiveness or monumentality for their own sake the only concession to the appetite for glory lay in the construction of gateways at key points in the citythe torre dellorologio the porta della carta and the arco foscari among them the gateway to the arsenal is in every guide to the city these were the venetian equivalent of the triumphal arch all the more striking in a city without a defensive wall yet the venetians who lived and traded in constantinople and in the other markets of the kingdom became increasingly unpopular they were judged to be arrogant and greedy away from venice the venetians became insecure and fractious they attacked their genoese and pisan rivals in trade and refused to obey byzantine edicts they even stole the relics of saints from the churches of constantinople they were generally considered by their hosts to be vulgar mere merchants looking for bargains in turn the venetians despised the greeks as effete and indolent then in on the command of the emperor all the venetians in constantinople and elsewhere were arrested and imprisoned a venetian fleet despatched to threaten the lands of the emperor was reduced to impotence by the onset of plague the commander of the unsuccessful expedition on his return to venice was assassinated in the streets it was the condign justice meted out to all perceived failures the byzantine emperor then sent a message to the doge in which he asserted that the venetian nation had acted with great foolishness he noted that they were once vagabonds sunk in the utmost poverty who had somehow claimed the right to imperial ambitions but their abject failure and insolence had rendered them a laughing stock the leaders of venice reacted cautiously they formed alliances with some of the emperors enemies and began an insidious campaign against byzantine territories there were secret talks and clandestine meetings an accord was eventually reached and in twelve years after their arrest the venetian merchants were finally permitted to leave the prisons a formal peace treaty between venice and byzantium was signed it had represented a great crisis and a vivid token of the real enmity between constantinople and venice one city was dying and the other was impatiently waiting to emerge supreme over the next few years there were pacts and agreements and messages of mutual confidence between the two cities but in truth there could be no end to the struggle other than a fatal one the new eminence of venice was exemplified by one of those scenes of living theatre at which venice excelled the characters in this lavish spectacle were the leaders of latin christendom one was the emperor of germany frederick barbarossa and the other was pope alexander iii barbarossa laid claim to the lombard states and in particular to milan pope alexander strenuously resisted the claim and allied himself with the italian cities the emperor was excommunicated nevertheless barbarossa spurned by the church had success with the sword the lombard cities were taken milan fell and was largely destroyed yet the dominion of germany over this part of italy was constantly being threatened by internal rebellion and by the open hostility of other italian cities that looked to the pope for leadership the weariness of continual warfare and the inevitable cycle of victories and defeats eventually disheartened both sides the pope and the emperor contemplated the principles of an agreement but where should they meet formally to ratify their pact venice had largely kept itself aloof from the hostilities on the very good ground that it is better to remain neutral in any battle between such powerful enemies venice did not in any case concern itself with the affairs of italy if its own interests were not directly touched so the most serene city became the most appropriate setting for the reconciliation of barbarossa and alexander on march the pontiff landed at the lido and was received at the monastery of saint nicholas he was no doubt shown the socalled relics of the saint himself on the following day he sailed into venice where he was received by the doge there were now long and difficult negotiations over the terms of the peace with the emissaries of both sides raising objections and proposing alterations yet the pact was finally sealed on july the emperor was welcomed to the monastery of saint nicholas on the following day he sailed to venice where alexander awaited him the pope sat in state upon the papal throne which had been placed before the central gates of the basilica he was surrounded by his cardinals like some crowd scene from the sacred plays of the period the emperor disembarking from the glittering barge of the doge walked in stately procession towards the pontiff before him walked the doge himself saint marks square was filled with spectators eager to see the play unfold when the emperor reached the papal throne he took off his scarlet cloak and bowing to the ground kissed the feet of the pope alexander now weeping raised up the emperor and gave him the kiss of peace the audience now began to sing the te deum and all the bells of the city rang out it had been a great performance this dramatic scene was also used by venice as an advertisement for the citys strength and sense of justice it was the seat of a general reconciliation the city was the place of impartial judgement and of equity because it was subject to god alone it played no part in the power politics of popes or emperors except to heal the wounds caused by them that at least was the message of the venetian chroniclers in reporting these events from the summer of for that moment when the bells pealed venice was the centre of the world there were more immediate benefits also the emperor granted trade privileges to venice throughout his empire and the pope gave venice ecclesiastical dominion over dalmatia the spectacle itself might have acted as an overture for the grander opera that was about to be performed in the years that followed venice entered another and greater phase of its imperial power it conquered and stripped constantinople a new scenario began with another holy war the pope had declared a fourth crusade against the infidels and in the early months of the french princes who had taken the cross came to venice to plead for the ships that would transport them to the holy land they were received in great state by the doge and were asked to plead their case before the people of venice in the basilica so after mass had been heard one of their number stepped forward and declared that no nation is so powerful on the seas as you after that piece of flattery he implored the aid of the venetian people the princes then knelt down and wept immediately there were cries all around the basilica we grant it we grant it it was a fine piece of stage management in the best traditions of the city the doge enrico dandolo was already old and nearly blind he was elected at the age of eightyfour but he was one of those venetian patriarchs whose tenacity and singleness of purpose were the visible proof of the citys own ruthlessness it was said that he had nourished a grievance against constantinople ever since the mass imprisonment of according to one byzantine greek chronicler he boasted that so long as he failed to take revenge on them for what they had done to his people he was living under sentence of death it was even reported in later chronicles that he had been blinded by the byzantines themselves when he had once travelled to the city as an ambassador this is the stuff of legend only the carpenters of the arsenal were set to work engaged to build and equip enough ships to carry horsemen and soldiers in return venice demanded silver marks the efficiency of the shipbuilding yards was by now well known throughout europe and all of the ships were delivered on time but there was one problem the crusaders had been unable to find the money to pay for them so a new arrangement was concluded the venetians would waive full payment on condition that the crusaders would assist them in subduing the rebellious city of zara on the dalmatian coast it was a diversion from the holy land but the leaders of the forces of the cross considered it to be a necessary one three hundred ships left the lagoon in october to the chant of the veni creator and sailed down the adriatic zara after a siege of five days surrendered christian had turned against christian rather than the common enemy of the saracen the pope incensed by this unwelcome development excommunicated the forces of the expedition it is not reported that the venetians in particular were in any way cowed or humbled by the papal wrath once the venetians were fully in possession of the town they were surprised by the arrival of an unexpected guest the son of the deposed emperor of constantinople alexius angelus came to dandolo in search of justice he wished the crusaders to overthrow the usurper on the throne of the empire and reinstall his father for his part he pledged to finance and otherwise assist the armies in their high purpose it was an offer that could not be refused it has often been surmised that dandolo had held this aim in mind throughout all the preparations for the crusade and that he had already determined that constantinople rather than syria was to be the destination of the venetian fleet there can be no doubt that dandolo saw a great opportunity for advancement and enrichment in this war at the expense of constantinople but there are elements of adventitious chance in all the affairs of men dandolo could not have known that the french crusaders would be unable to honour their obligation although it is likely that he knew in advance of the arrival of alexius in zara the venetians were always adept at taking advantage of chance and circumstance yet in another perspective the great events of the world seem on close scrutiny to be made up of a thousand singular elements and accidents and coincidences in the midst of this swirling world it would be hard to detect a pattern so we may say that it just happened as a consequence of these events the power of byzantium was extinguished its city and empire weakened beyond repair the venetian fleet in aid of alexius moved against the city on june it sailed beside the walls a french attack by land seemed to have failed and so under the command of dandolo the venetians tied their galleys together to form a united front from the decks and turrets of the vessels military engines discharged their fire into the city constantinople was in flames dandolo himself stood at the prow of the first ship that struck land he was dressed in full armour and the standard of saint mark flew at his side at his urging the venetian soldiers leapt from their vessels and scaled the ladders swung against the walls there was some combat but the forces of the byzantines were overwhelmed by this swift attack from the sea the banner of the republic was fixed on the rampart the city was taken the deposed emperor on whose behalf alexius had pleaded was rescued from his dungeon and placed upon the throne alexius himself was crowned in the basilica of saint sophia and took his place as coruler of the empire yet the fatal decline of constantinople was about to resume its inevitable course alexius had promised the crusaders more than he could achieve he lacked finance and more importantly he had forfeited his authority among his countrymen by relying upon the forces of the crusaders to obtain the imperial crown the citizens of constantinople instigated by fear and rumour rebelled against the new emperor alexius was cut down his father abandoned to his grief the venetians and their allies now had to extinguish this rebellion and bring the city under their rule they had not come so far to be simply asked to leave so once more in march they laid siege to the city on the eve of the assault dandolo declared to his men that they must be valiant and with the help of jesus christ milord saint mark and the prowess of your bodies you shall be tomorrow in possession of the city and you shall all be rich once their victory was assured the christian armies inflamed by greed and anger began a general sack of the city constantinople was pillaged and burned the wealthiest city of the world filled with art and sculpture was laid bare its citizens were slaughtered the frenzy of bloodlust such that it seemed that the gates of hell had been opened the palaces and houses of the city were ransacked the churches were despoiled the statues were melted down and the pictures ripped apart the tombs were opened and the sacred vessels removed it is reported that a prostitute was enthroned in the chair of the patriarch in the basilica of saint sophia from where she hurled insults at jesus christ and she sang bawdy songs and danced immodestly in the holy place one chronicler claimed that the rapine exceeded any other since the creation of the world and the venetians were the principal agents of this despoliation much of the plunder found its way to venice the four great horses that surmount the basilica of saint marks are part of the fruit of that brutal victory there were other spoils the crusaders claimed the dominions of constantinople and carved up its empire among the victors venice negotiated its portion with its customary merchant zeal and was rewarded the fourth part and the half of the roman empire that is it commanded threeeighths of the old empire it already claimed dalmatia and croatia and now it took possession of the aegean coasts and islands as well as parts of the mediterranean it controlled crete and corfu as well as the islands of modon and coron it took the western part of greece and the islands of the ionian sea it demanded the coast of thrace as well as the ports on the hellespont it seized negroponte in the aegean while the other crusaders were unsure of their geography the leaders of venice knew exactly what they wanted many of the islands were then granted to various patrician families of venice who held them as fiefdoms of the republic there was now also a large venetian colony within constantinople itself which acquired a large measure of independence from the home city there were even reports that the capital of the new empire was about to remove from venice to constantinople but these were discounted yet one central fact was clear the markets of the east were beckoning all thought of the war against the infidel was forgotten and indeed the crusaders never did reach the holy land it was the last of the crusades the strategy of venice was that of a sea power intent upon strengthening its command of the sea that is why the first great conquests were in the levant or eastern mediterranean where venice might pose as the begetter of an apostolic empire of the east as a fitting successor to the christian empire established in the east by justinian and constantine it is a typical example of venetian rhetoric masking policy to the victors the spoils so the imperium of venice was largely confined to the islands and to the coastal regions the venetians wanted no part of the inland empire of byzantium whether in asia or in europe the city could never have become another rome instead it settled for secure trading routes across the seas with a series of ports under venetian control linking the market of the lagoon to the markets of the levant these were not so much colonies as trading posts stretching from venice to the black sea the nature of venetian dominion was now clear for all to observe the power of constantinople was effectively gone for ever the consequences of the venetian adventure however were by no means beneficent that which is born in fire may die in fire a weakened constantinople became the prey of the turks the newly established latin empire endured for only sixty years the colonial possessions of venice also left it exposed to attack in a long sequence of wars that tested its strength for the next seventy years the serene city would be engaged in almost constant warfare with its rebellious subjects and with its rivals with the saracens and with the pirates of the mediterranean cities in collision there was one other significant competitor with which venice had to deal genoa was known to the world as la superba genoa the proud petrarch had described venice and genoa as the two torches of italy but fire can drive out fire both cities were known throughout europe for their rapacity and acquisitiveness the genoese were more individualistic and inventive the venetians were more communal and conservative the genoese had a history of internecine warfare and rebellion the venetians were quiescent could they ever have lived at peace with one another for many centuries the merchants of genoa competed with those of venice in the eastern markets but the success of the venetians materially hindered the commerce of the rival city it had been decreed after the fall of constantinople that the genoese were to be excluded from trade throughout the empire but the genoese fought back they too were a seafaring people who had built up a great fleet that could challenge venice on the seas of the known world there were open clashes between the rival cities on the coasts of crete and in corfu where the native inhabitants welcomed the arrival of the genoese a truce was agreed in but this was merely a prelude to further and more fatal struggles the tension between the two cities remained constant throughout the century with skirmishing and assaults in all the markets where they competed in after some particularly bloody fighting in syria the venetians expelled the genoese merchants from their quarter in acre there was then for the venetians an unfortunate and unexpected development in the greeks under the leadership of michael palaeologus regained control of constantinople the venetian fleet was at sea and the city was relatively unprotected under these auspicious circumstances the emperors forces mounted a rapid attack on the latin contingent and gained the defensive walls three weeks later michael walked in glory to the basilica of saint sophia he owed much of his success however to the genoese who had supplied him with fifty ships in return for their support they wished for unrestricted trade access in the markets of the city they wanted revenge upon the venetians for their forced departure from acre when the venetians returned they could do nothing except rescue their compatriots whose shops and dwellings had been destroyed by fire the genoese were not faithful allies their merchants were according to report arrogant and avaricious their fleet proved unequal to a naval challenge from venice more importantly their representatives in constantinople were accused of mounting a conspiracy against paleologus himself ever ready to supplant a rival venetian envoys were sent in secret to the court of the emperor a new trade pact was concluded the genoese were to be expelled from the empire whereas venice would be granted free privileges in addition the venetians were allowed to retain the former byzantine possessions of crete of negroponte of modon and coron these were sufficiently generous terms and the emperor now understood that venice itself was the greater power the venetians were becoming accustomed to empire at the beginning of the fourteenth century the doge pietro gradenigo made a speech to the great council of patricians in which he declared that it is the duty of every good prince and of every worthy citizen to enlarge the state to increase the republic and to seek its welfare by every means in his power it was the responsibility of the state too to seize every favourable opportunity for aggrandisement gradenigo had the mainland of italy particularly in mind where now the venetians were actively promoting a policy of aggressive warfare they had once sought neutrality in the battles between pope and holy roman emperor over the cities of italy they had once wanted simply to preserve their trade routes but now the experience of imperial expansion had hardened their sinews they had become more belligerent the mainland of italy was in any case changing its nature the principal cities no longer saw themselves as vassals of superior powers such as the papacy but as sovereign regions or citystates there were some eighty of them throughout the land of italy some were under the control of individual families such as the este of ferrara and others were in theory republican communities yet the central point was their independence independent cities want power and territory they compete with each other for trade and influence they even fight each other in venice fought on the mainland in order to maintain its commercial rights within ferrara and gain control over the po it allied itself with florence and bologna in order to fight back the expansive policies of verona and in the process captured much mainland territory it fought against padua and by its victory gained the provinces of treviso and bassano as well as the city of padua itself it won verona and vicenza the italian cities that came under venetian domination were not subjugated venetian civil and military commanders were dispatched to the cities but municipal government continued in the familiar fashion the venetian ruling class had a genius for administration and government its power was neither too lax nor too onerous there are some indications of an imperial style but in the colonies overseas the rulers were blended within the native landscape there was no ruling ideology of conquest there was no attempt to impose new standards of value or new principles of belief they came not as conquerors or as missionaries but essentially as traders their true belief was in the efficacy of commerce they were a very practical people they were unpopular enough but they were resented rather than hated it would be wrong to assume however that there was no internal discontent the immediate fact of conquest was for the conquered hard to bear the example of crete is representative the lands of the local byzantine magnates were expropriated and given to venetians there were neither finances nor resources to maintain a standing army on the island so a number of venetian patricians were sent out as colonisers who retained their lands as fiefdoms on condition that they defended them these venetians tended to inhabit the towns and cities of the island they were accustomed to cities cities were their natural habitat in due course a predominantly agricultural economy was in part turned towards urban trade trade directed almost exclusively to the mothercity and of course the venetian authorities imposed heavy taxation upon every transaction they encouraged trade for the purpose of exploiting it yet merchants began to flourish on the island there was also a growing market for the wares of cretan iconpainters it has been estimated that per cent of the iconpainters throughout the venetian empire originally came from the island the venetian strategy was to remodel the governance of the island on the example of venice herself crete was divided into sestieri there was a duca in the principal role modelled on the doge the major decisions of security and trade however were still the prerogative of the venetian senate there were more visible changes the principal square of candia the capital of crete was renamed piazza s marco it became the meeting place and market of the island with its own basilica and ducal palace it was remodelled and restored to lend dignity and seriousness to the new administration it became the stage for festivals and public celebrations a processional way was constructed between the entrance gate of the port and the basilica venice was recreating its theatre of trade and of politics in a new environment the byzantine palaces and monuments were reused their symbolic meaning subtly altered to reflect venetian hegemony some of them were given new venetian façades venice saw itself as the natural heir to byzantium there was no sudden disruption but instead an orderly transition the religious traditions and the public ceremonies of the old empire were appropriated and adapted as always venice lived by assimilation the example of crete is again instructive the ecclesiastical rites of the latin church in ceremonies and processions were moulded with the rites of the greek church the venetians adopted the cult of the local saint of the island titus so there were no religious wars the venetians were not like the spanish there were endless reconciliations and compromises simply in order to maintain the momentum of what was essentially a vast trading regime cretans married venetians venetian merchants migrated to crete cretan scholars and painters migrated to venice a new culture emerged of the west and of the east after the fall of byzantium crete became the centre of hellenism in the west there were naturally enough influences of opposite tendency there are still venetian dialect words embedded in modern greek among them the words for steel armada velvet the acacia tree and the wedding ring indeed there was a revival of greek letters under venetian rule it was venice rather than byzantium that preserved native greek culture in the early modern period its poetry was composed by men whose political racial spiritual and cultural allegiances were to venice there were revolts and rebellions as a result of local grievances and factions but the island remained in venetian hands for more than four centuries it can be concluded therefore that the venetians were effectively the first modern colonial power yet in a world dominated by war and empire there could be no end to rivalry and struggle in the letters and chronicles of the late fourteenth century the optimism of the venetians is in some part replaced by intimations of gloom and melancholy the world seems more uncertain and the role of providence illdefined the loss of confidence is accompanied by the search for greater security in the world the acquisition of empire then brought its own burdens in the native inhabitants of candia rebelled against their venetian overseers several venetian patricians also joined in the revolt the insurrection was put down its leaders executed but it had been a troubling moment for venice petrarch was in the city when the victorious force returned to the lagoon we augured good news he wrote for the masts were garlanded with flowers and on the deck were lads crowned with green wreaths and waving flags over their heads relief as well as triumph was the emotion of the day a high mass was celebrated in the basilica and a great festival was organised in the square itself petrarch was present on this occasion too and remarked upon the magnificence of the ceremonies as the empire of venice became more assured so the taste for spectacle and ceremonial grew more intense genoa was not quelled by its expulsion from constantinople its traders were dominant in the black sea it held the preeminent position in syria and palestine there was never any chance of an enduring peace in a venetian admiral surprised a fleet of fourteen genoese vessels at the port of negroponte and captured ten of them the other four were allowed to flee simply because the venetians were too occupied in plundering the cargo of the others the venetians and their greek allies then confronted the genoese fleet in the bosphorus but the battle proved inconclusive in the venetians defeated the genoese off sardinia but a second genoese fleet began a journey of destruction through the adriatic and the aegean a year later a venetian fleet was sabotaged and sunk by the genoese in the port of modon the venetian commanders and their men were taken into custody it was a signal victory for the genoese but even in defeat the venetians proved to be expert negotiators a truce was agreed by means of which each side promised not to attack the other the subsequent peace was not for venice a peace at all it was obliged to cede dalmatia to the king of hungary because of that sovereigns superior force of arms it was impelled to withdraw its merchants from famagusta in cyprus when the genoese took over that town the venetian fleet kept the adriatic as its territory but it was engaged in constant confrontation with the genoese in the black sea when venice seized the vital island of tenedos controlling access to that sea the genoese once again declared war the fourth genoese war was to prove the most terrible and the most fatal of all the hostilities began in when a venetian admiral vettor pisani sailed west and won a great victory over the genoese in genoas own waters but there were complications closer to home the king of hungary invited the genoese to use the dalmatian coast opposite venice as their centre of operations it was an opportunity not to be missed pisani was obliged to return to the adriatic in order to protect venetian convoys in a gulf that the venetians had always claimed as their own his base was at pola in istria and at the turn of the year the vessels of the fleet were being fitted up and cleaned for future hostilities but a battle was forced upon them before they could muster all of their ships the venetians first had the advantage when the genoese admiral was killed but a reserve force of genoese ships came forward unexpectedly and overwhelmed the venetians hundreds were killed or captured with their fleet effectively out of action it was the moment that the venetians most feared their enemies closed in upon them from every side the king of hungary closed the routes of the northern adriatic the lord of padua blocked the western trade routes on the mainland the fleets of the genoese were protected and were being augmented all the time they were even able to enter the lagoon and burn towns along the lido this had never before happened in the history of the serene republic when the paduans and genoese joined forces and took the extensive port of chioggia to the south of venice the armed circle around the city was complete the venetians were now effectively under siege they might even be invaded business on the rialto came to a halt the salaries of public officials were suspended the poor were told by the doge that they would find food in the homes of the rich when threatened the venetians came together as a coherent body the venetians proposed negotiations but the genoese replied that they would not talk to their enemies until the horses of saint marks had been bridled by this time the bronze horses taken from the spoliation of constantinople had become a symbol of venetian pride and greed it was a moment of the utmost peril for the venetian authorities who knew that they would need the support and cooperation of all the people to avert a fatal outcome at the insistence of the crowds they released from prison vettor pisani who had been incarcerated for his defeat at pola he now became the popular champion and the principal defender of the city the doge himself andrea contarini helped to train crews for the new galleys that were being built the plan outlined by pisani was to sink barges and boats laden with stone in the deep channels around chioggia this was a way of cutting off the port and its genoese invaders from the mainland and from the genoese fleet still at sea the scheme was a success the genoese found themselves blockaded with dwindling supplies of food water and gunpowder the venetians were also suffering from privation but they had one advantage they possessed hope even as pisani harried and outmanoeuvred the genoese trying desperately to leave chioggia another venetian admiral returned to port carlo zeno had completed a military expedition that had captured the cargos and booty of many genoese ships in the mediterranean then he received instructions to return to the lagoon and assist his city in its trial of strength with genoa it was he who helped to prevent the increasingly desperate attempts of the genoese to fight their way out of chioggia there were great battles on the sands and the genoese commander pietro doria was killed when a cannon ball struck the tower from which he was observing the proceedings then in june the genoese surrendered there was still work to be done in the adriatic and in the mediterranean but genoa never challenged venice again genoese vessels never returned to the adriatic in this year of defeat a genoese friar delivered a homily to his congregation the genoese he said were like donkeys when many are together and one of them is thrashed with a stick all scatter fleeing hither and thither the venetians on the other hand resembled pigs when a multitude of pigs is confined together and one of them is hit or beaten with a stick all draw close and run unto him who hits it the victory had enormous consequences for venice in the fourteenth century it became one of the principal cities of the known world where in previous centuries it had been aligned with the east in cultural and mercantile terms by the end of the fourteenth century it had emerged as a properly european power after the war was over it went on to claim by right of conquest or dominion durazzo and scutari lepanto and patras argos and athens these were the homes of wine and wheat the venetian empire of italy also grew or rather was accumulated step by step in the early years of the fifteenth century verona and padua despatched ambassadors to venice to make the formal act of submission they were followed by ravenna and friuli and a host of other towns and cities from the alps in the north to the po in the south from bergamo and crema in the west to the sea itself venice claimed dominion it might even be claimed that the city had refashioned the ancient province of venetia from which its ancestors had come governors were sent to the towns and cities under its control and a captain was appointed to administer military affairs high service on the mainland became a prelude to political authority at home but each city was able to preserve its local privileges as well as its customary assemblies and magistrates only gradually was there a movement towards more professional and bureaucratic structures with the increasing significance of a small number of aristocratic families the pattern of venice was ineluctably beginning to repeat itself the greater bears down upon the lesser but the dominant citythe inclita dominante or illustrious mistress as it was knowndid not seek to impose union on these territories the milanese and florentines were far more ready to assert their authority over their subject cities the venetians were more cautious or perhaps more conservative there was some confusion over the status of local law as it related to venetian law but that was perhaps inevitable the empire of the mainland was driven by pragmatism and expediency there was no venetian state there was only a trade confederation relying heavily upon the revenue accruing to venice through the proceeds of indirect taxation the venetians also discouraged any enterprise that might challenge the commercial supremacy of their own city as for example the weaving of luxury textiles so that according to an english observer in the s every other town in the territory of the republick appears poor in the comparison of the mothercity the innate conservatism of the venetian state too actively discouraged the modernisation of the general economy of the mainland territories this led directly to venices eventual financial decline the italians were not able to compete with the resurgent english and dutch the inability or unwillingness to create a state and a modern state at that may also have encouraged the fissiparous qualities of the italian peninsula in one sense the opportunity for unification and centralisation had been squandered so italy remained a prey to foreign powers yet venice was still secure it was protected by the lagoon while the plains and hills of northern italy gave it space against the rival city of milan the deep valleys and mountains of the alpine region afforded it protection against northern rivals the further the dominion spread the more jealously it was protected issues of selfdefence as well as commercial gain were used to justify the absorption of towns and regions inaction was no longer possible in the first quarter of the fifteenth century therefore venice aligned itself with florence in order to fight the visconti family of milan this was its first departure from its policy of splendid isolation there was much opposition to this alliance in venice itself venetian merchants traded very successfully with the milanese territories and any overreaching by venice would require the presence of a standing army yet the leaders of venice determined to form an alliance with the free republic of florence against the tyrants of milan the strategy was successful and with the removal of the visconti family italy reached a state of broad equilibrium amenable to venetian pressure there were now no more than five territorial states with their claims and resources finely balancedvenice naples florence milan and the papal state each ruling city and its dependent territories was given the name of lo stato or the estate in time the word developed to mean the collective existence of a nation or people in the beginning these stati depended upon the personality of the ruler or ruling family eventually of course they would be politically and scientifically organised to merit the description of a state the interests of the state then became paramount of these new italian powers von ranke the german historian wrote that they were neither nations nor races neither cities nor kingdoms they were the first states in world and venice was one of them opening the way for the development of the modern world order milan was still the dominant city of lombardy and florence of tuscany but in the phrase of william wordsworth only venice did also hold the gorgeous east in fee the eastern association was evident in the streets and houses of the city even its national basilica was oriental in inspiration by the fifteenth century it was the richest city in italy with an annual budget equal to that of spain or of england there were many more palaces in venice than in any other city its navy was arguably the finest in the world it was also a much more stable city than any of its rivals on the mainland with a strength and persistence that derived from its earliest instincts for survival in the battle against the sea while the genoese in particular were plagued by civil war and internecine rivalries venice remained a model of constancy despite periods of plague and of economic depression the strength and security of its constitution rendered it powerful the trade of the city revived particularly in its intercourse with india and with china and the revenues of the rialto were never more strong it was triumphant a call to arms at the height of its intervention on the mainland venice could maintain a force of forty thousand troops it was estimated by the reigning doge in that the city possessed thirtyfive galleys three hundred round ships and three thousand other vessels they required a complement of thirtysix thousand sailors almost a quarter of the entire population of people there were ships christened la forza la fama and la salute they were used to protect the armed galleys of the trade convoys that left venice on prearranged dates they were used to combat pirates and to harass enemy traders no foreign ship was safe in the waters venice considered its own the officers were elected from the patrician class of the city service at sea was an indispensable part of the education of the young patrician the crews were at first all free men volunteers found in venice or in venetian possessions by the beginning of the sixteenth century conscription had been introduced this of course so lowered the status of galley labour that it became a burden to be avoided to be an oarsman a galeotto was considered to be part of a low profession so by the middle of the sixteenth century there was a change in the nature of these crews it was said that they comprised drunks and debtors criminals and other outcasts the courts of venice sometimes consigned the guilty to the galleys rather than the cells by prisoners made up the principal part of the crew the measure of their servitude can be computed by the records of the venetian courtseighteen months of galley service was considered equivalent to three years of close imprisonment and a period in the pillory while seven years in the galleys was considered to be equal to twelve years of confinement their rations were made up of biscuit wine cheese salt pork and beans the diet was designed to feed the sanguinary humour a franciscan friar was always on board to rouse them yet there are reports of disease and of early death of exhaustion and despair carlo gozzi in the eighteenth century saw some three hundred scoundrels loaded with chains condemned to drag their life out in a sea of miseries and torments each of which was sufficient by itself to kill a man he noticed that at the time an epidemic of malignant fever raged among these men it is not clear however that the changed personnel were in general any less proficient as oarsmen they helped to win a famous victory against the turks at lepanto the maritime marvel of venice was the arsenal the greatest shipbuilding concern in the world the word itself derives from the arabic dar sinaa or place of construction thus affirming the strong connection of venice with the east it was built at the beginning of the twelfth century and was continually being extended and expanded until it became a wonder of technology it was variously described as the factory of marvels the greatest piece of oeconomy in europe and the eighth miracle of the world the epithets are a measure of the respect in which new technologies were then held its famous gate made up of roman and of byzantine elements was raised there in the arsenal had become the centre of another empire it was the engine of trade it was the foundation of naval might it was a token of the supremacy of industrial enterprise in the most serene city eventually two and half miles km of walls and fourteen defensive towers surrounded sixty acres ha of working space it was the largest industrial enterprise in the world a population of skilled workers and labourers grew up around the site the number of workmen has been estimated at anything between six thousand and sixteen thousand in any event they worked in large numbers this shipbuilding neighbourhood in the eastern part of venice became a recognisable part of the city with its own prejudices and customs people lived and died were baptised and married within the three parishes of s martino s ternita and s pietro it is still an area of tiny houses crowded tenements small squares deadends and narrow alleys the inhabitants became known as arsenalotti and such was their importance to the state that the male population of shipmakers was also used as a bodyguard for the doge they were also employed as firefighters only the arsenalotti were allowed to be labourers in the mint they alone rowed the ceremonial barge of the doge proud of their status they never united with the other artisans of venice it is a case of divide and rule it is also a signal example of the subtle way in which the leaders of venice coopted what might have been an unruly group of people within the very fabric of the city the loyalty of the arsenalotti materially helped to secure the cohesion and the very survival of venice the arsenal was the first factory established upon the assembly line of modern industry and thus the harbinger of the factory system of later centuries one traveller in described it thus as one enters the gate there is a great street on either side with the sea in the middle and on one side are windows opening out of the houses of the arsenal and the same on the other side on this narrow strip of water floated a galley towed by a boat and from the windows of the various houses they handed out to the workers from one the cordage from another the arms it was known as the machine the armed galleys were constructed here the relatively unarmed round ships with sails instead of oars were also made here the key to its efficiency lay in the division and specialisation of labour there were shipwrights and caulkers ropemakers and blacksmiths sawyers and oarmakers thirty galleys could be built and fitted within ten days when the french king visited the place in a galley was built and launched in the two hours it took him to eat his dinner the whole process of industrial collaboration however might be seen as an image of the venetian polity itself everything is of a piece dante visited the arsenal in the early fourteenth century and left a description of it in the twentyfirst canto of the inferno as in the arsenal of the venetiansboils in the winter the tenacious pitch one hammers at the prow one at the sternthis one makes oars and that one cordage twistsanother mends the mainsail and the mizzen it may not be coincidence that dante places this vision in the eighth circle of hell where corrupt public officials are punished eternally the blatant sale of public offices became a problem in venetian governance eventually the arsenal was outmoded the development of craft technology in the seventeenth century rendered it obsolete it continued producing galleys when no galleys were needed it became inefficient its labourers underpaid and underworked yet it did not finally close until when eleven thousand families were removed from their ancient neighbourhood now the factories and production lines are used to house exhibitions for the various festivals that visit venice it is an apt token of the nature of the city the venetian army was as effective by land as the venetian navy on the oceans by the middle of the fifteenth century it could afford to maintain a standing force of twenty thousand troops with extra militia ready to be called up in an emergency by the beginning of the following century that number had doubled it was of mixed identity venetian engineers were well known for their skills in siege weaponry but it was said that the venetians themselves did not make good soldiers to a large extent therefore the city relied upon mercenaries for its defence its soldiers came from dalmatia croatia and greece as well as from germany and gascony there were light horse from albania and cuirassiers from other parts of italy when some venetian gunmen were captured at buti in and their hands cut off some of the unfortunate troops were from england and holland the acquisition of a land empire at the beginning of the fifteenth century was the direct motive for the creation of a standing army yet such an army posed problems for the leaders of the city an army could move through its streets an army could threaten its mainland possessions that is why no venetian was ever made general or commander the danger of a military coup was always present to the administration venetian patricians were not allowed to command at any one time more than twentyfive men it was a safeguard against faction instead a foreign commander was always chosen although he held his office under the watchful care of two senior patricians in the field with him it was not an ideal arrangement especially in the very heat of battle but it served venetian interests well the foreign generals were known as condottieri from the italian word for contract they were contracted men but they were also adventurers and sometimes brigands who were suited to the theatre of venice they aspired to the type of the classical roman general ferocious in war and gracious in peace they were deemed to be no less wise than courageous no less virtuous than judicious and they were paid well venice was known as a generous and prompt employer the condottieri were given ornate houses along the grand canal and were granted large estates on the mainland they seemed to be indispensable to the state but there were some who questioned the wisdom of employing them they could be persuaded to change sides if large enough bribes were offered and they could sometimes be feckless and excessively independent machiavelli blamed the collapse of venice in his lifetime on the use of mercenaries and mercenary commanders if the venetians did not excel at warfare they would soon become deficient in the arts of peace sir henry wotton at the beginning of the seventeenth century commented that by the lasciviousness of their youth by the wariness of their aged men by their long custom of ease and distaste of arms and consequently by their ignorance in the management thereof the venetian state was in sad decline yet decline was always being predicted for venice even at the acme of its power vi timeless city bells and gondolas the venetians needed to control time just as they controlled every other aspect of their insular world the bells rang out at precise times of day to coordinate the activities of the populace within the campanile itself in saint marks square there was a system of five bellsthe marangona that announced the beginning and end of the working day the nona and the mezza terza that rang the hours the trottiera that invited the patricians to vote in their various assemblies and the maleficio that called the spectators to the latest public execution the bells were a form of social control creating areas of forbidden time an edict was announced in that no person whatsoever shall be suffered without special licence to walk abroad after the third bell of the night in the private and public institutions of the city every phase of activity was signalled by the ringing of bells the people were summoned for waking for washing for praying for eating and for sleeping it is another indication of the paternalism or authoritarianism of venetian society yet since bells were intimately associated with religious devotion it was a way of making life itself a sacred activity it was a qualitative as well as a quantitative token yet time seems to shift in the city the tokens of various periods appear together and various times modify one another in venice there is no true chronological time it has been overtaken by other forces there are occasions indeed when time seems to be suspended if you enter a certain courtyard in a shaft of sunlight the past rises all around you this is not necessarily a private or individual sensation the organisations of the city were believed by the people to be perpetual in their work on the public monuments of the city the venetians were concerned to accrue various layers or levels of time with borrowings and adaptations from earlier cultures theirs was never meant to be an architecture of the present but rather of the past and present conflated the city affords visitors a glimpse of the porousness of history there is indeed a different sense of time in the city as any visitor will testify no one can hurry in venice no one can make up time there is no transport except by water and there are many hindrances to a pedestrians rapid journey it is a city that slows down the human world that is another reason for the sense of enchantment or dream that it induces there is a great will to wander and be lost the official institution of time was also different the beginning of the next day was dated from the hour of the evening angelus or six oclock thus pm on christmas eve was for the venetians already christmas day this system continued until the napoleonic conquest the continuity of the city and of its administration impressed upon the inhabitants a different sense of time also calculated in centuries rather than in decades venice measured itself in historical rather than chronological time the centuries are as it were enclosed on the island they are imprisoned in the labyrinth of the calli time on the mainland has the room to spread outward so that it becomes flatter and thinner in venice it echoes and reechoes the irish writer seán ofaoláin described it as a projection of the schopenhauerian will a timeless essence it might be truer to say that there are continuities through time a venetian of the sixteenth century if not earlier would have no trouble in finding his or her way through the streets of the modern city that is true of few other cities on earth the churches and markets are still in the same place the ferries still cross the grand canal from the same stations that they used five hundred years ago the same religious festivals are celebrated of all cities venice is the one that most fully manifests continuity it has become its reason for being it is reassuring because it represents permanence and stability in a world of change that is why its survival has become so important to variously concerned groups in england and america some of the cityscapes of the sixteenth century by carpaccio and others can still be identified in the contemporary city there is a famous view by canaletto of a stonemasons yard by the bank of the grand canal where now the accademia bridge has been erected from the painting itself approximately of the campo s vidal and the church of s maria della carità it is possible to identify still existing houses a small bridge and a little canal the painting is dated to so the territory has remained stable for almost three hundred years the most obvious sign of continuity is also the most familiar the gondolas have been plying the waterways of the city for a thousand years with only the smallest modifications in shape and appearance john evelyn described them in the seventeenth century as very long and narrow having necks and tails of steel some are adorned with carving others lined with velvet commonly black while he who rowes stands upright on the very edge of the boate and with one oare bending forward as if he would precipitate into the sea rowes turnes with incredible dexterity the gondolas are first mentioned in a document at the end of the eleventh century although they must have been in existence for many decades before that date the word itself has been granted many derivations from the latin cymbula or greek kuntelas both meaning small boat but the actual origins of the boat have been variously found in malta turkey and improbably avignon it found its definite and still modern shape by degrees originally it was shorter and squatter than the modern version with a cabin placed in the middle of the boat often protected by blinds or curtains this was the mode of transport used by the patricians of the city who might have many gondoliers in the pay of the household by the seventeenth century these cabins or felzi became places of assignation and intrigue adding to the legend of venice as a city of hidden pleasures they were removed in the s there was one other modification in the middle of the eighteenth century when the right side was made nine inches mm longer than the left this adjustment increased the little boats speed and manoeuvrability then the gondola sailed on through the centuries growing slightly longer and slimmer so that it might accommodate the growing number of tourists it was still a boat of pleasure but no longer reserved for the few there were ten thousand gondolas in the sixteenth century many of them festooned with ornaments and carvings this encouraged displays of showmanship and rivalry among the wealthier venetians who were allowed few opportunities of conspicuous consumption in public such a spirit was of course to be resisted by a venetian state that curbed individualism of any sort in the name of collective brotherhood so the ornamentation was in a decree of forbidden that is why the gondolas became black even though black was not considered by the venetians to be an unfavourable colour the gondolas ever since have regularly been seen as floating coffins shelley compared them to moths that have struggled out of the chrysalis of a coffin james fenimore cooper felt that he was riding in a hearse wagner fearful in a time of cholera had to force himself to board one goethe called it a capacious bier and byron saw it just like a coffin clapt in a canoewhere none can make out what you say or do byron is here describing the amours that might or might not take place in the private space of the cabin the gondolier penetrating the interior canals of the city has also been given a phallic importance so that in venice sex and death are once more conflated henry james wrote of the experience that each dim recognition and obscure arrest is a possible throb of your sense of being floated to your doom a ride on a gondola can prompt some very powerful instincts the metal beak at the prow the ferro has a complicated history some believe that its six teeth represent the six sestieri of the city it has also been considered to be a replica of the beak of a roman galley given the venetian fondness for antique copy that has the ring of truth the gondoliers are the most famous of the citys native sons their characteristic uniform of straw hat and blackandwhite striped top together with the red or blue scarf was really only formalised in the s but their braggadocio is very old they seem to enjoy the sound of their own voices on land as well as on water they bawl they bellow they sing but when they are hushed and the only sound is that of the gondola gliding through the water then the deep peace of venice begins to reign the gondoliers have been celebrated in song and ballad from the sixteenth century they were praised for their discretion when the gondola was used as a place of assignation the gondoliers were silent about their customers if a gondolier had denounced a lady to her husband he would have been drowned by his colleagues they were employed to deliver sensitive letters foreign visitors often denounced them as foulmouthed cheats or pimps but they received more praise from their compatriots they appear as goodhearted heroes for example in the comedies of goldoni here is part of a typical setting from his play the good girl two gondoliers arrive at the same moment from opposite directions each insists that the other shall give way by dropping back there then follows a dialogue of threat and insult known to all earlier travellers to venice yet their high spirits were part of the air of the city they were incarnate of the will to live and to survive upon the water the cries and songs of the gondoliers have been endlessly recorded in stones of venice ruskin himself devotes his first appendix to the gondoliers cry it might be the title to an opera premi to pass on the left stali to pass on the right and sciar to come to a halt the gondoliers love to call to one another across the water although such marine repartee is now as much of a theatrical act as the singing of o solo mio or torno a sorrento although in the city itself they are still a powerful and sometimes disruptive force they are now principally the delight of tourists they have in a larger sense become part of the selfconscious mannerism of contemporary venetian life their costume little more than fancy dress it has been said that no venetian would be seen dead in a gondola except perhaps in those that are used as ferries from one bank to another there are now only four hundred gondolas at work in the city only four are made each year the boat cannot last for ever after twenty or so years of service its woodwork will warp and weaken it is then taken to the island of murano where its wood is used to kindle the flames of the glassworks it becomes part of another city industry its energy transformed into venetian glass iustitia on one of the three exposed corners of the ducal palace there is a sculpture concerning the judgement of solomon on the west façade of the palace is the figure of iustitia with the sword of justice upright in her hand here also is the word venecia venice and justice have been combined in one eternal image with the inscription strong and just enthroned i put the furies of the sea beneath my feet above the porta della carta in the same complex of public buildings is enthroned the virgin image of venetia and iustitia with sword and scales the crowning figures of the palace are also those of iustitia the justice of venice is one of the myths of venice it is deemed to be ancient it is deemed to be divinely inspired it is related in ultimate form to the judicial salvation of humankind the actual nature of venetian law is less glorious but perhaps more interesting as in all aspects of the venetian polity it was of mixed inheritance elements of it came from roman jurisprudence and from byzantine legislation other elements were taken from the lombard and frankish codes having no firm territorial foundation venice was forced to adapt or borrow the traditions of other peoples it could be said that the venetians created a patchwork coalition of various legal principles flexible and accommodating for any circumstances venetian law was above all else efficient a nation all at sea must first save itself the first code of jurisprudence was promulgated at the close of the twelfth century and the laws were collected in the following century within the pages of five great books the majority of statutes as might be expected in a city of merchants dealt with matters of wealth and property commercial law was the most voluminous the five books might be said in fact to embody a mercantile attitude towards law despite the reverence for the customary image of justice the practice of the venetians seems to have been largely empirical and pragmatic the laws were often acknowledgements of what already existed in practice customary law unwritten and on occasions anecdotal seems to have been preeminent it was even declared that custom might override the written law this is in part evidence of the merchant spirit distrusting legal niceties and quibbles the offender must pay for dishonour done to god and disrespect shown to the city these were the important matters it was often said that venetians were more fond of talking than of doing certainly it is true that no other citystate produced so much legislation the contents of these laws are sometimes confusing inconsistent and contradictory they were passed and then not enacted they were issued or reissued when the very same laws were already on the statute books the leaders of venice legislated too much there is an air of fantasy or of unreality about their search for legal formulae some of the great council believed or thought that they remembered a certain law when it could not actually be found it was drawn up and entered anyway there was a saying that seven days suffice before time obscures a venetian law una leze venezianadura una settimana the sumptuary laws in particular entered the minutiae of social life where no practical supervision was possible so they were largely ignored they remain however the most bizarre example of the lengths to which the venetian state would go to influence social conduct if the city were a large family as was often claimed then it was of a harshly paternalistic kind thus in it was decreed that at any meal of meat not more than one course of roast and one kind of boiled meat may be provided this may not include more than three kinds of meat or poultry the legislation was designed in part to curb the enthusiasm for large family parties for gatherings of kin which could be considered as a threat to the state that is why the particular focus of legislation was directed at feasts and banquets where great numbers of people might gather oysters were not permitted at dinners where there were more than twenty guests there were rules on the number of pastries and fruits that could be served peacocks and pheasant were forbidden the slaves who served at such banquets were invited to spy on their masters the cooks were obliged to report in advance to the authorities what food they had been asked to prepare the legislation was also designed to arrest the tendency towards excessive flamboyance the common people faced with the extravagance of the rich might become restless in venice internal dissension had to be avoided at all costs that is perhaps the reason for the general disregard of sumptuary legislation it was seen only as a gesture to mollify the populace not as a serious attempt at enforcing law there was also the spiritual argument the example of vanity and greed would invoke the anger of the almighty at times of defeat on sea or land the venetians often blamed the debased morals of certain of the citizens this was of course a common trope in the medieval and early modern periods but it applied all the more aptly and sharply to a city that believed itself to be chosen by god the rules applied to the strictest regulations of dress no man or woman could possess more than two fur cloaks in it was forbidden for anyone to wear lace ruffles on the neck or wrists brocade and silk clothes were forbidden and no more than two rings could be worn upon the fingers three patricians were chosen as magistrates or sumptuary police to enforce these regulations it is not known whether they were successful in their attempts to curb extravagance and excess the practice of venetian law was in theory equitable anyone who owned property whether patrician or citizen or artisan was treated in the same manner patricians could not plead or expect any especial favours there was also a system of appeal established upon principles of fairness solicitations could be made to the doge himself there was a venetian saying pane in piazza e giustizia in palazzo bread in the piazza and justice in the palace venetian justice had a reputation for strictness on occasions to the point of barbarity but also for impartiality the state provided counsel for those who were poor even the slaves of venice could approach the legal tribunals and obtain redress from any grievances in may a venetian artisan antonio avonal and giacobello a tanner whiled away the time by pricking with a long pin the slaves who passed them on their way to vespers at saint marks they were taken before the authorities avonal was sentenced to three and giacobello to two months in prison almost uniquely in italy too the lawcourts conducted their business in the vernacular the court records are filled with the voices of ordinary venetians arguing pleading complaining about neighbours and employers and servants the tribunals were like family courts venetian life was one of almost continuous litigation in fact the sturdy tradition of the vociferous courts helped to stabilise venice throughout its history that is why the people of venice were known to be lawabiding rulers and ruled knew the common ground on which they stood saint bernard of clairvaux is supposed to have told the doge cristoforo moro that the republic would last as long as the custom continued of doing justice we have the intriguing spectacle of practical success and ad hoc or muddled legal theorising laws were made or unmade or ignored or thwarted or disobeyed there were so many laws that no one could remember them all the patrician judges had not received a legal education except that which they had picked up by observation they were politicians employed for a relatively short term so they relied upon the promptings of conscience conjecture and common sense they were in one sense amateurs there must of course have been abuses of power and of principle there must have been bribes and blackmail that is the nature of life yet the pragmatic workings of the legal system established upon custom prevailed the bond of equality before the law kept the city together it is a measure of the venetian temperament against the turks even as the sun of genoa set in the summer of a new enemy rose over the eastern horizon in the shape of the ottoman turks the venetians had been accustomed to underestimate the challenge of the empire of the osmanlis they considered it to be locked up by land and unable to threaten by sea but then the waters of the levant became the prey of turkish pirates who could never be successfully put down the gradual encroachment of the ottoman empire meant that venetian trade routes were also being encircled the ottoman advance threatened the venetian merchant colonies in cyprus crete and corfu the islands had constantly to be defended with fortresses and with fleets the two empires had their first confrontation in the waters of gallipoli where in the venetian fleet routed the turks after a long fight the venetian admiral later reported that the enemy had fought like dragons their sea skills then were not to be underestimated the proof came in when the turkish forces overwhelmed constantinople itself it had been an ailing city ever since the venetian sack in and its defenders could not match the overwhelming forces of the turks the osmanli dynasty was now knocking on the door of europe constantinople now for ever to be known as istanbul became the true power of the region there was for the venetians business to be done it would be better for them to turn putative enemies into customers the pope might fulminate against the infidel but the venetians saw them as clients a year after the fall of constantinople a venetian ambassador was despatched to the court of the sultan mehmed ii the conqueror declaring that it was the wish of the venetian people to live in peace and amity with the emperor of the turks they wished in other words to make money out of him the venetians were duly given freedom of trade in all parts of the ottoman empire and a new venetian colony of merchants was established in istanbul but the relationship could not endure mehmed increased the tariffs to be paid by venetian ships and entered into negotiations with the merchants of florence then in the turks seized the venetian colony of argos war was declared between the empires it was considered that by strength of numbers the turks would succeed on land while the venetians would maintain their old supremacy at sea the venetians may have been hoping for an eventual truce from which they could secure concessions but mehmed had a more formidable navy than the venetians had expected after much fighting the venetian fleet was expelled from the central aegean it was no longer a latin sea the island of negroponte in the possession of venice for years was occupied by the turks the turks conquered the region of the black sea also and turned that sea into the pond of istanbul the venetians were forced on the defensive fighting rearguard actions much closer to home in albania and dalmatia the florentines told the pope that it would be for the good of all if the turks and venetians fought each other to a state of exhaustion yet venice was exhausted first it was finally obliged to sue for peace in seventeen years after the hostilities had begun venice kept crete and corfu the corfiote capital was described by sir charles napier in the early nineteenth century as a town fraught with all the vice and abominations of venice but the real power of venice in the levant was gone for ever the turks now held the aegean and the mediterranean the grand vizier of the turkish court told the representatives of venice suing for peace you can tell your doge that he has finished wedding the sea it is our turn now a contemporary diarist girolamo priuli wrote of his countrymen that faced with the turkish threat they are in a worse condition than slaves this was hyperbole but it reflected the disconsolate mood of the people this was the moment when venetian ambitions in the east effectively came to an end the eyes of the city were now turned towards the mainland of italy the equilibrium in northern italy could not endure there were leagues and counterleagues drawn up between the territorial powers too weak to strike alone against their neighbours the peace to which venice aspired could be upheld only by the sword while there was still empire there would never be any rest there were fears among other cities that the appetite of venice had no limit and that the city was intent upon the conquest of all italy north of the apennines the republican alliance between venice and florence broke apart there were endless tirades against the citys cupidity and duplicity the duke of milan galeazzo sforza declared to the venetian delegate at a congress in you disturb the peace and covet the states of others if you knew the illwill universally felt towards you the very hair of your head would stand on end niccolò machiavelli was moved to comment that the leaders of venice had no respect for the church italy was not large enough for them either and they believed that they could form a monarchical state like that of rome the world around venice was changing the rise of the great nationstatesof spain of france and of portugal in particularaltered the terms of world trade the strength of the turkish empire and the intervention of france and spain on the mainland of italy created further burdens for the most serene city when the french king charles viii invaded italy in he inaugurated a century of national unrest his failure to take over the kingdom of naples did not deter the other great states of the european world maximilian of the hapsburgs and ferdinand of spain were both eager to exploit the rich cities of northern italy these states had large armies fully exploiting the new technology of siege guns and gunpowder the citystates of italy were not prepared for the novel conditions of warfare milan and naples came under foreign control then at the end of the great leaders of the world turned their gaze upon venice the french the hapsburgs and the spanish joined forces with the pope in the league of cambrai with the sole purpose of seizing the mainland dominions of the city the french delegate condemned the venetians as merchants of human blood and traitors to the christian faith the german emperor promised to quench for ever the venetian thirst for dominion the allies met with extraordinary success the mercenary forces of the venetians were comprehensively beaten by the french army in a battle by the village of agnadello near the po and retired in disarray to the lagoon the cities under erstwhile venetian occupation surrendered to the new conquerors without a fight within the space of fifteen days in the spring of venice lost all of her mainland possessions the response of the venetians was by all accounts one of panic citizens wandered the streets weeping and lamenting the cry went up that all was lost there were reports that the enemy would banish the people of venice from their city and send them wandering like the jews over the earth if their city had not been surrounded by the waters machiavelli wrote we should have beheld her end the doge according to one contemporary never spoke but looked like a dead man the doge in question leonardo loredan was painted by bellini and can now be seen in the national gallery he looks glorious and serene at the time it was widely believed that god was punishing venice for her multiple iniquities amongst them sodomy and elaborate dress the nunneries had become whorehouses the rich lived in pride and luxury none of this was pleasing to heaven so as a direct result of the war the doge and senate introduced sumptuary legislation to curb the excesses of the rich in the hope of reconciling their city to god men were forbidden to make themselves physically attractive the nunneries were locked up the wearing of jewellery was strictly curtailed it was necessary according to one diarist of the time to imitate our ancestors with all possible zeal and care this ancestor worship had one particular dimension there were some in the city who believed that the venetians should have remained a seafaring people as they were in the beginning and that the ventures onto mainland territory had constituted a singular and perhaps fatal error there was the threat after the battle of agnadello of an imminent siege by the imperial forces food and grain were stored in makeshift warehouses the doge sent envoys to the court of maximilian offering to place all the mainland dominions of the city under imperial control he even despatched ambassadors to the turks requesting aid against the imperial forces it is a measure of the desperation of the venetian leaders that they invoked the aid of the infidels against their coreligionistsunless of course the true religion of the venetians consisted in the worship of venice herself once the initial terror had subsided however the city once more came together its tribal instinct revived it manifested the unity for which it would become famous in the sixteenth century the ruling class drew together in a coherent body the richer citizens pledged their fortunes to the defence of the city the poorer sort remained loyal the state reasserted itself it was able to sow discord amongst the ranks of its enemies some of the mainland cities which had come under french or imperial control discovered that they preferred the more benign venetian rule venice in fact recovered padua with the active assistance of that citys inhabitants there were venetian victories on the battlefield too and by the beginning of it had recovered almost all of its territories it would not forfeit them until the time of napoleon it had also reached an agreement with the pope on matters of ecclesiastical power following the precept of a venetian cardinal to do what he wishes and later with time do what you will in what seems a typically ambiguous and duplicitous way the council of ten had already secretly declared the conditions of the agreement void on the grounds that they had been extracted by force venice once more made its way in the world it had forfeited much valuable territory in the levant and elsewhere but not all was lost it acquired cyprus which it systematically stripped of its agricultural wealth and it maintained its control of the cities around the po the grain of rimini and ravenna also was indispensable to its survival and survival was now the key after the league of cambrai venice could no longer extend any further its dominant position in the peninsula it was surrounded by too many and too formidable foes there would be no more aggressive expansion instead the patricians of venice continued their policy of buying up parcels of territory as opportunity presented itself there was soon a definite tendency to exchange the perils of trade for the security of land land was a good investment in a world of everincreasing population and rising food prices and concerted efforts were made to make it more and more productive nevertheless it represented another form of withdrawal from the world in the process the venetians created a new race of landed gentry the best chance for the state itself lay in watchful neutrality playing one combatant against another while alienating neither the only option was that of peace all the notorious guile and rhetoric of the venetians were now devoted to that purpose of balancing the turkish french and hapsburg empires and the strategy was successful until the arrival of napoleon bonaparte almost three hundred years later the remains of the venetian empirein crete in southern greece and on the mainland of italywere preserved the reassertion of venice was aided in by the brutal sack of rome by unpaid imperialist troops they raped and killed the citizens of the imperial city they stole its treasures and burned what they could not steal throughout the region waves of plague and syphilis compounded the despair the ravaged fields could produce no wheat once more venice seized the advantage rome had been one of the oldest and most formidable adversaries of venice the pope who reigned there had put the city under sentence of excommunication on more than one occasion the papal states were challenged by venetian power so the sacking of rome was welcome news to the administrators of venice many of the artists and architects of the papal court left rome and migrated to the most serene city where such riot was considered impossible the reigning doge andrea gritti had determined that venice would rise as the new rome he flattered and invited composers and writers and architects one of the refugees from rome jacopo sansovino was hired by gritti to remodel saint marks square as the centre of an imperial city another refugee pietro aretino apostrophised venice as the universal fatherland sansovino restored the public areas of venice in roman fashion he built a new mint with rusticated arches and doric columns he built the great library opposite the palace of the doge in the piazzetta in the form of a classical basilica in the same spirit he built the loggetta at the base of the campanile in traditionally classical form the shacks and stalls of the traders were removed from the square and in their place was constructed a sacred ceremonial space magistrates were appointed to supervise the renovation of other areas as well as the cleansing of the waters around venice there was new building everywhere the quays were refashioned the symbolism was not difficult to read venice proclaimed herself to be the new rome the true heir of the roman republic and the roman empire she saw no reason to prostrate herself before the german emperor charles v or the emperor of the turks suleiman the magnificent the city itself was conceived as a monument to this new status according to a declaration of the senate in from a wild and uncultivated refuge it has grown been ornamented and constructed so as to become the most beautiful and illustrious city which at present exists in the world it was the city of carnival and celebration there sprang up more parades and ceremonials more tournaments and festivals there were and are historians who assert that in this transition the venetians themselves lost their energy and their tenacity they became softer they were weakened they lost their fighting spirit when they embraced the principles of neutrality they became addicted to the pleasures of comfortable living it is perhaps unwise to adopt the language of human psychology in such matters the life of generations is more robust and more impersonal than that of any individual it is accountable to different laws all we can say with any approach to certainty is that venice was revived in the sixteenth century and it was a truly astonishing renewal first born out of defeat and humiliation it says much about the ingenuity as well as the pragmatism of the venetian temperament there was one more great test in the first months of the turkish forces of suleiman the magnificent seized the venetian colony of cyprus venice unsuccessfully appealed for assistance to the leaders of europe philip ii of spain fearing a turkish advance in northern africa despatched a fleet but it arrived too late and proved curiously unwilling to follow venetian strategy the demoralised venetian fleet under girolamo zane sailed back before ever sighting cyprus the island was lost one of the venetian dignitaries was beheaded by the turks and another was flayed alive his skin is still preserved in an urn in the church of ss giovanni e paolo meanwhile zane had been ordered to return to venice where he was consigned to the doges dungeons he died there two years later a year after the capture of cyprus pope pius v devised a confederation of three european powers to contain and to confront the turks venice spain and the papacy itself formed a new christian league or holy league with the avowed aim of regaining control of the mediterranean and of banishing the turkish fleet from the adriatic it was a crusade under another name a naval battle was staged at the entrance to the gulf of patras the battle of lepanto as it became known resulted in a great victory for the christian forces there were turkish vessels that were sunk or captured with only thirteen losses for the europeans fifteen thousand christian galley slaves obliged to work under turkish masters were given their liberty there was another singular outcome lepanto was the last battle in which the use of the oar held the key in later engagements the sails were raised it was the last battle too in which handtohand combat was the chosen method of assault artillery and in particular cannon took over after lepanto when a venetian galley returned to its home port trailing the turkish standard the city gave itself up to rejoicing at a funeral oration in saint marks honouring the dead it was declared that they have taught us by their example that the turks are not insuperable as we had previously believed them to be the predominant feeling was one of relief the venetians thought it prudent to follow the victory with further assaults on turkish power but the pope and the spanish monarch disagreed there was an inconclusive campaign in the spring of the following year but the spirit had gone out of the christian league venice returned to diplomacy and signed a treaty with suleiman cyprus was lost for ever of all the greek islands colonised by venice only corfu remained free of the turkish embrace yet the victory at lepanto had emboldened the leaders of venice there was some talk of regaining commercial supremacy in the mediterranean a new generation of younger patricians came to dominate public affairs so by the end of the sixteenth century venice could pride itself on having survived the encroachments of the europeans as well as the belligerence of the turks it had proved to be a formidable opponent in peace as well as in war the stability of its government and the loyalty of its people had remained steadfast it was the only city in northern italy that had not endured rebellion or suffered invasion the pope compared it to a great ship that fears neither fortune nor commotion of winds there emerged now what came to be known as the myth of venice its antiquity and its ancient liberty were celebrated by venetian historiographers it clothed itself in the glory of new public buildings the republic of venice free from faction and guided by sage counsellors was deemed to be immortal it refashioned itself as the city of peace and the city of art even as its overseas power entered a slow decline so the spirit of the city manifested itself in another fashion it is evident in the work of bellini of titian and of tintoretto who emerged as the influence of venice began to wane but who can speak of decline or decay when the city produced such riches venice had merely changed the nature of its power it now claimed the power to impressto dazzle as its imperial power declined so its image in the world became of vital importance vii the living city the body and the building the austrian writer hugo von hofmannsthal once described the archetypal city as a landscape built of pure life can this pure life therefore be seen as a living force can venice be shaped and governed by an instinctive existence which is greater than the sum of its people is it more than just a collective by the sixteenth century it was already being described as a human body where the head is the place where the shores are situated and that part towards the sea are the arms the canals were the veins of this body the heart lay in the city itself so wrote cristoforo sabbadino in venice was supposed to gaze out at the sea the english traveller james howell said that no foreign prince had ever come nere her privy parts where were these privy parts they were presumably the ducal palace and the basilica yet all these references affirm a belief or instinct that venice itself is a living organism with its own laws of growth and change does it exist and survive by the agency of some inner or intrinsic force that cannot as yet be explained or described it absorbed the islands that constituted its existence it had an alimentary system laid out among its canals and waterways everything wishes to give form and expression to its own nature the leaves of the tree aspire to their own shape so by obscure presentiment and by the steady aggregate of communal wishes venice grew that is why every part of veniceits topography its constitution its domestic institutionsreflects the whole its nervous functions are interdependent those who travel to the city for the first time seem to be made aware of a definite personality henry james always susceptible to the subtleties and obliquities of personal sensibility said that venice seems to personify itself to become human and sentient and conscious of your affection it was for him mild and interesting and sad does it subdue the lives and affections of the people who inhabit it the city is so old and so encrusted with habit and tradition that the people can be said to fit within its existing rhythms the venetians were often described as actors playing out their various roles in paintings of venetian life the city dwarfs its inhabitants so that it becomes the preeminent subject it has often been said that venice cannot be modernised more pertinently it will not be modernised it resists any such attempt with every fibre of its being on the lower façade of the palazzo dario along the grand canal the owner placed an inscription in latin announcing giovanni dario to the spirit of the city so of what if anything does the genius loci consist is there a city god in residence in other cities the worship of communal values was associated with the worship of place and with the worship of the dead in the early centuries the venetian dead were buried in the campo of the parish thus the passing generations trod upon the remains of their ancestors nothing could instil more awe in a venetian than to stand on the spot where the parish was created in addition the presence of the ancestors gave a true title to territorial ownership of the land no stranger could claim the ground where the bones were buried this may be the clue to the origin of all cities they began as cemeteries it was originally a city of wood there were so many carpenters marangoni that the great bell of the campanile in saint marks square was named after them as the marangona it was a city of wooden tenements occasional squares wooden churches waterlanes landing stairs and pontoons between islands yet the process that formed the modern city was already in evidence a network of parishes each with its own church was slowly forming with their centres accruing together wooden bridges were built to connect contiguous islands and footways were laid over marshy areas in the eleventh century this process was intensified under private rather than public initiative the ponds and marshes were filled or covered reclaiming all the available land the burgeoning government systematised the various parishes creating a core of population from which the city was gradually extended in the early years of the twelfth century there were proposals for a large market in the rialto a great civic square beside the ducal palace and an arsenal for the maintenance of the venetian fleet these public works changed the face of the city and determined the shape that it would eventually assume flood fire and earthquake shook it from time to time in a great fire destroyed almost the whole of wooden venice but the process was now too powerful to be reversed there were many other fires but the city always rose from them renewed the great urban project had begun and it could not be diverted venice grew and grew as if it were indeed some natural force by the thirteenth century the venetian state had taken charge of land reclamation the city was defined as a public space rather than an aggregation of individual communities the state became the master of the land and of the water overseers of embankments streets and canals were appointed they were eventually formed into a commission with officers in every parish only certain canals were to be used for the transport of wood dyers were only allowed to use the water of the lagoon not of the canals thus begins the flood of venetian urban legislation dealing with every aspect of life in the city a system for the management of waste was created the streets of the city were paved for the first time with flagstones or cobbles the first permanent bridge over the grand canal at the rialto was erected in this continual enlargement of the urban fabric continued well into the fourteenth century at a time when the population had reached one hundred thousand it was already one of the most inhabited cities of europe the major streets of the city were laid out new quays and bridges were built work on a new hall for the great council was approved in by that date several great churches were beginning to rise among them s maria dei frari the basilica of ss giovanni e paolo s maria della carità s alvise and madonna dellorto new streets were built a public granary was instituted there was a diminution of activity in the middle years of that century under the weight of fatalities caused by the black death but the beginning of the fifteenth century saw a wave of new works private and public that is how venice developedin waves of activity sudden increases in the temperature of the city an access of fresh vitality the temptation to speak in organic terms is strong some two hundred palaces many of them still standing along the grand canal were built in this period the medieval town of wood had finally given way to a renaissance city the process was finalised was set in stone in the sixteenth century the appointment of jacopo sansovino as public architect in was the first stage of a deliberate programme of public works to create a second rome both magisterial and gorgeous the first general planning act is dated from it envisaged among other things an embankment of istrian stone encircling the city venice became what lewis mumford called in the city in history an absolute city it had become the setting for the sedulous dissemination of the myth of venice as an enduring and impregnable polity the work of palladio in the middle of the sixteenth century added further adornment to a city that would never willingly change again he reinvented the shape of its sacred architecture with the conception of the churches of s giorgio maggiore and il redentore the city needed only one more thingthe first stone of the great bridge across the grand canal at the rialto was laid on may the creation of venice was complete yet despite its manifest grandeur venice was still an intensely local city there were divisions and divisions within divisions the largest was that which separated the saint marks side and the rialto side of the grand canal then there were the six sestieri or divisions of the city that were established in twelfth century in the late nineteenth century they were still described in popular speech as nations there was the nation of castello for example and the nation of cannaregio horatio brown in life on the lagoons noted that the people of the various quarters are different in build and type of features one from another their speech was different even the dialects might vary within each district the parishes were congregated the parish the contrada or contrata was the essential and fundamental unit of venetian society in official documents the members of the popolani identified themselves in terms of their parish the parish had its own festivals and rituals and the parish priest was elected by the freeholders of the neighbourhood there were small parish markets and the church was a refuge in times of trouble many parishes had their own specialised trade it was an administrative as well as a sacred entity neighbourhood rivalries between the parishes on either side were common the identity of each separate parish was also fully formed so in spirit if not in structure the city still reflected its origins in one hundred or so islands the square or campo was at the heart of the neighbourhood it spread before the church and was once its burial ground in each squareor in the calle just around the cornerwas a fruiterer a greengrocer a general goods store a retailer of pasta a café a barbers shop and various other tradesmen from the mercer to the carpenter it was a selfcontained entity marked out by its well and its carved wellhead where the women of the parish came to gossip it was a venice in miniature if there is indeed a spirit of place within the city it is still to be found here the houses were tightly packed together the parishioners knew each others business strangers were quickly noted the city in other words was crisscrossed by individual boundaries going from one district or from one parish to another was like walking into a different town the people of one district might not know the topography of another there were parts of the city to which many if not most venetians had never been it was not unknown for a venetian to live his or her own life without venturing beyond the bounds of the sestiere there were venetians who had never entered saint marks square the author was told of an old lady of cannaregio recently deceased at the age of one hundred who had only been to the square twice in her life the canals are the signs and tokens of division they are essentially the old streams and rivers that once crossed the territory the stretch of water dividing the island of giudecca from the rest of the city was once the mouth of the river brenta there are canals threading through the city ebbing and flowing with the tide for more than sixtytwo miles km the grand canal itself has a length of two miles km some allow only oneway traffic and others accommodate twoway movement some are deadends or blind canals they have influenced the nature of the people as strongly as the nature of the city it has been said that the presence of flowing water induces tranquillity these boundaries of water also inhibited the rapid assembly of people in riot or rebellion the peace of venice may derive from its canals if the canals are the sign of division then the bridges are the token of unity there are more than of them in the city linking parish with parish many of them have honorifics or nicknames such as the bridge of fists or the bridge of assassins or the bridge of the honest woman they were used as battlefields and as places of assignation the earliest bridges were simply wooden planks laid across pilings or the hulls of boats and the first one built of stone was not constructed until the latter half of the twelfth century in that period too the first great wooden bridge or pontoon was erected across the grand canal at the rialto the sixteenth century was the great age of the stone bridge when the wooden structures were replaced by their more durable substitutes they rose on either side to a hump in the middle and there were no parapets or balustrades the pedestrian or horseman had to be nimble and fearless the bridgebuilding has not finished yet a new bridge has just been put into place across the grand canal linking the two transport centres of piazzale roma and ferrovia in the west of the city so out of this medley of disparate parishes and districts emerges the miracle of a sovereign and recognisable city out of difference springs identity out of the parts related or unrelated emerges the whole it is the secret of the citys entire life one of the first sights that greets the traveller arriving at the bacino or pool of venice are the two columns of oriental granite standing guard over the piazzetta on the column closest to the ducal palace stands the lion of saint mark from a distance it looks like a splendid composition in fact it is made up of separate parts created in different periods and held together by iron cramps the age of some of the pieces is not known but the majority of them can be dated to the late twelfth century the wings of the lion are the work of restorers and were originally divided into feathers so by some instinct or by some compulsion the builders of the column joining the separate parts of the lion together represented the creation of the city on the other column is poised the statue of saint theodore the original patron saint of venice if you were to come closer to this image you would notice that it is not in any sense the work of one hand the head is of parian marble and is believed to represent mithridates king of pontus the torso is a roman piece from the time of hadrian the great the dragon or crocodile is in the lombardic style from the first half of the fifteenth century it is a glorious and apparently haphazard exercise in historical assembly it deserves to be on its column once again it is an image of venice itself the architecture of the city is heterogeneous and apparently random combining gothic greek tuscan roman and renaissance elements the sum of their combination can be defined as venetian architecture various styles and stylistic modes exist simultaneously the art of venice lay in amalgamation it is a reminder of how oddly sorted the appearance of venice has always been it is based upon random accumulation of objects and materials it reflects thoroughly eclectic tastes there is no consistency and no uniformity that is why for the traveller venice can be so fatiguing it resists interpretation it denies the single vision minarets can become crosses byzantine columns can rise towards corinthian capitals parts of one statue can be attached to another théophile gautier writing of the basilica of saint mark observed that the singular thing which upsets any idea of proportion is that this jumble of columns of capitals of bas reliefs of enamels of mosaicsthis mingling of greek roman byzantine arab and gothic stylesproduces the most harmonious possible whole there are endless fragments that paradoxically only make sense as part of a perceived unity in this most noble city of venice the architect sebastiano serlio wrote in it is the custom to build in a way which is very different from all the other cities of italy it is an insular architecture it is architecture built on water of course it will be different the buildings of venice reflect the spirit and the nature of the city they are the emanations or exhalations of the territory ruskin entitled his magnificent appraisal the stones of venice the stones are its soul so the architecture of venice is noticeable for its lightness for its balance and for its harmony it represents all the aspirations of its citizens that is why the architecture is unique and identifiablethe deep central windows the pattern of recess and shadow the surface ornamentation the intricate variety of styles the preference for curved shapes the screens of arcades the general emphasis upon light and space the thrust is towards the horizontal rather than the vertical hugging the surface of the lagoon the façades of venetian buildings are not loadbearing the effect is one of magnificence without monumentality volume is denied being always broken up by the effects of glittering light the façades seem to float freely as if the architecture itself were a magnificent illusion the buildings often seem to be the sum of small parts rather than being dominated by one central conception it is in that sense a very practical architecture venetian builders did not seem to mind asymmetry they placed together styles that were a century or more apart they shortened and lengthened buildings according to the exigencies of the site the emphasis is upon contrast and variety rather than uniformity different systems of decoration could be employed in the same space the proportions of the various architectural orders were breached this architecture is one of natural exuberance there is nothing solemn nothing portentous nothing menacing one of the essential forms is that of the threestoreyed front decorated with pilasters it is the basic shape of the houses along the grand canal the focus of the house is towards the exterior rather than the interior and no one seems to care about the back of the building as long as the front is sumptuous this is the city of masks hence the reliance upon external pattern it is an ornamental and pictorial architecture it has elements of the picturesque the surfaces were encrusted with carvings and coloured marbles with decorative patterns spreading in all directions it is as if lace embroidery had been turned to stone the first architectural style in the city can be loosely called byzantine it is a style of arcades and of domes of round or inflected arches upon pillars and of mosaics clothing the walls with beauty the domed basilicas of venice were based on an eastern pattern with the dome hovering over a cube of space in perfect alignment it was an image of infinity the byzantine style in venice can be dated from the seventh to the twelfth centuries for five hundred years the city took constantinople as its inspiration then the style renewed itself in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries in the thirteen and fourteenth centuries the eyes of venice turned towards the west rather than the east and that attention led in turn to the rise of venetian gothic it is significant that at the close of this period venice was poised to gain a land empire on the mainland of italy the churches were now given vaulted naves although they could not be built very high the watery foundations of venice could not sustain any great weight there was a new interest in interplay of shapes and of materials in the exfoliation of pillars and pilasters in great portals in trefoil arches in quatrefoil tracery and in double lancet windows it was a style of pattern and ornamentation again deeply congenial to the venetian genius yet it was also a question of selfimage by coopting a western imperial style and of a new form of magnificence the style was dominant in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries surviving even into the sixteenth century and giving a gothic aspect to the city that still survives many gothic churches replaced their byzantine predecessors on the same site they were built in homage to a different god or to a different conception of god but it was a secular as well as a sacred architecture most of the wellknown palaces or great houses are created in the gothic mode the basilica of saint mark is an example of byzantine the ducal palace is the embodiment of gothic ruskin despised the renaissance architecture of venice that followed gothic he considered it to be a symptom of the citys decline and fall the classical columns and pediments the sheer symmetries were alien to the life and spirit of the place what had venice to do with classical antiquity what had venice to do with the purity the austerity and massive uniformity that are at the heart of the renaissance style the great exponents of the renaissance stylecodussi sansovino and palladiowere not themselves venetian they cast a foreign eye over the city palladio did not even like traditional venetian architecture believing it to lack grazia and bellezza it has been said that the edifices of palladio do not suit venice they do not fit venice yet in venice everything fits certain features of venetian architecture have had a continuous history the domestic dwellings of the people for example have always conformed to a simple pattern they are not the most inviting aspects of venetian life the ordinary venetian house is a mysterious place it is the very opposite of the public spaces that seem to be at the heart of the citys life the house is generally small narrow and dark it does not willingly receive guests or welcome strangers the original timber houses of the city were of one storey built around a central courtyard and that sense of inwardness never left the venetian domain the innate conservatism of the city was such that by the thirteenth century the essential structure of all subsequent houses had been laid out they were simple affairs of two or three storeys with one or two rooms on each floor a wooden balcony ran around the front and on the roof was the flat enclosed space known as the altana from here the venetians could take the air or observe their fellows in the streets below there were few windows heavily shuttered or protected by iron bars the larger windows faced inward towards the central courtyard there was very little furniture but the pieces were richly decorated and ornamented flat roofs were preferred chimneys were popular the shutters were painted dark green there were no venetian blinds in venice and of course there were no cellars there were small houses with shops opening onto the street there were rows of small terraced houses each room or floor accommodating a family in parts of the city two identical rows face each other across a narrow street the effect surprisingly is rather like that of industrial housing in the northeast of englandexcept for the well in the middle of the street in areas of workingclass housing there were also often tunnellike passageways with arches known as sottoportici if the various styles of architecture represented the spirit of the place as a distinctive and recognisable genius loci that may be because all of them rose directly from the same foundations the building of venice was an act of communal perseverance against nature beneath the waters of the city lie strata of mud and clay and sand the foundations of the buildings piles of tough oak were driven into that ground with heavy drophammers they reached a depth of between ten and sixteen feet to m below water crossbeams were then laid down and the interstices between the wooden piles were loaded with cement and broken stone then a thick surface decking of wooden planks bedded in cement was placed on top of the wooden structure it became the true ground of the city a second foundation was erected on top of what was essentially a great wooden raft two to four feet to m below the level of the tide from these foundations venice rose resting upon a petrified forest somehow it manages both to defy and to make use of nature these great trunks of oak and larch and elm had always to be submerged if they were exposed to the air they would begin to rot in their waterlogged condition they were sturdy however and almost imperishable the weight they bore was immense the campanile in saint marks square for example weighs tonnes tons yet the piles of wood carry it the rialto bridge is supported by twelve thousand piles of elm the church of the salute is borne up by piles of oak and larch the weight of the building itself helps to stabilise them there is no complete rigidity that is impossible in the lagunar waters yet even though the piles may shift a little they do not collapse many of them have lasted for a thousand years there is a chant sung by the piledrivers dating from the latest variant of which was transcribed by an englishman in the nineteenth century up with it wellup to the topup with it wellup to the summit the primary materials of construction are brick and timber with stone used as a decorative rather than a structural necessity at the waterline is placed a foundation of istrian stone that is impermeable to water ruskin described that stone quarried on the mainland there is of course no natural stone in venice itself as smooth sheets of rock glistering like sea waves that ring under the hammer like a brazen bell above the stone is brick faced with stucco so that the church or dwelling also glisters the absence of stone walls also gives an incomparable feeling of lightness to the material fabric venice is a floating world in the galleria dellaccademia hangs titians presentation of the virgin it is placed on a wall that was once part of the albergo or hall of a notable confraternity in the foreground of the painting is a great staircase which the young virgin is ascending in fact the staircase itself leaves the picture and enters the venetian world just to the left of the canvas is the tower staircase of the albergo itself which seems to obtrude into the painting among the crowd of people accompanying the virgin are pictures of recognisable individuals these are the members of the confraternity it is typical of venetian painting to incorporate local detail as part of the overall design the background wall of the presentation is constructed out of pink and white bricks set in diamond pattern as an unmistakable reference to the façade of the ducal palace when carpaccio needed to depict cologne in his cycle of paintings concerning saint ursula he simply used the image of the arsenal in the district of castello tintoretto uses saint marks square as a setting for biblical miracles the humble houses and shops of his paintings are directly modelled on venetian interiors he placed the image of his contemporary aretino in the company witnessing the crucifixion in veroneses conversion of saint pantalon the elderly man cradling the miraculously healed child is the parish priest of the church of s pantalon who in fact commissioned the work there is no attempt here to honour the individuality of the priest rather he becomes part of the company of the blessed and in so doing reflects beatitude upon the city itself when titian depicted the miraculous draught of fishes from the narrative of luke he ensured that the boatmen took up the characteristic stance of venetian gondoliers it is said that in his paintings from the new testament tintoretto always made the apostles gesture like gondoliers in his miracle of the relic of the true cross on the rialto bridge carpaccio faithfully depicted the wooden bridge the sign of the sturgeon inn the houses and institutions along both banks of the grand canal and the members of the confraternity of which he was the official painter it represents the poetry of urban detail with its bricks and balconies and chimneytops more than any other painters in the world the venetians readily depicted the environment of their home city never has a city and its people obtruded so much on artistic traditions learning and language the renaissance came late to venice that european revival in humane letters and in classical scholarship made a slow and fitful entry into the city it was not necessarily on congenial soil the venetians have never been known for their commitment to scholarship or to learning for its own sake they are not inclined to abstract inquiry or to the adumbration of theory a humanist on the mainland giovanni conversino reported to the venetians in that even if you desired to be learned you would not be able to do so everything you have you possess through drudgery talent and danger the sheer necessity of survival transcended questions of abstract principle it may be true too that venice did not share in the italian renaissance because it had never been part of the mainland where classical art and literature once flourished literature was not in a literal sense part of its territory the young patricians were characteristically trained in the arts of practical statesmanship if they learned greek the essential language of the new humanism it was primarily so that they might administer the greek colonies of venice what did the enlightened leaders of venice do they codified the state laws and compiled state papers humanism in general was put at the service of the administration the leaders of learning were also the leaders of the senate and of the great council their concern was to engender political values that maintained and preserved the social system of the city they were characteristically magistrates ambassadors and even doges there was a great debate in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries upon the rival claims of the active life and the contemplative life in christian history the venetians always espoused the active life gods providence was a political matter if they wrote texts at all these were concerned with specific problems and circumstances their theoretical context if it can be called such was one of pride in the venetian state the only history with which they were concerned was their own history there were no works that challenged political or economic orthodoxy there were no volumes extolling the progress of the individual soul in search of beatitude there were no testaments burning with the chaste flame of aesthetic philosophy all was rigorous and severe and restrained in florence the movement of neoplatonism had its fervent and almost mystical adherents in venice the only interest in plato sprang from a general respect for authority there were of course venetian collectors of coins of manuscripts and of antiquities but they were animated by an acquisitive rather than an intellectual spirit they were merchants rather than scholars when one famous scholar cardinal bessarion came to the city he was so impressed by its magnificence that he left his collection of rare books and manuscripts to the venetian state they were stored in crates in the ducal palace from which some of them were stolen or sold the rest were allowed to gather dust for eighty years bessarion had bequeathed his collection four years before his death in but the library for them was not erected until the s petrarch known as the father of humanism bequeathed a selection of his library to the state in in his manuscripts were found heaped in a small room above the great door of the basilica of saint marks damp and decay had got to them there was no university in the city itself the absence might seem a singular omission for any citystate but there of course was no university in london either that other centre of trade and business in any case it would be wrong to report an utter dearth of learning there were schools and academies for those of an enquiring mind the principal disciplines were those of mathematics geography physics astronomy trigonometry and astrology botany was an important discipline too with the emphasis on horticulture there were public lecturers freelance schoolmasters and private tutors a school of rhetoric was established in with the aim of improving the level of public speaking in the city there were masters of grammar in each of the six sestieri and small schools were also established in the houses of certain patricians it is not clear however how high they aspired certainly a large proportion of the population was literate and numerate perhaps a quarter of the citizenry by the end of the sixteenth century but it would be hard to claim much refinement or subtlety in a venetian education it was designed really to increase the efficiency of the state cultivate learning one fifteenthcentury patrician told his son both for the honour of your country and for the glory and amplification of our family venice was always a city of clubs and fraternities each one of them a state in miniature with its officers and festivals so there were in the city thirty or more academies where the more educated venetians might meet and converse there was an academia dei filosofi and an academia dei nobili for example both situated on the adjacent island of giudecca the situation was pertinent implying that the patricians could escape from the centre of politics and commerce in order to discourse of higher matters the geography of the lagoon was always important in the venetian imagination and there were salons formal or informal where scholars and intellectuals mingled with the leading patrician families yet the salon was the home of patronage and in a city devoted to fashion of every kind a marketplace for the dissemination of novel ideas or fancies there was singing reading of poetry playing of musical instruments and sometimes even dancing it is hard to estimate however whether the discourse of the salon ever reached higher than the level of informed gossip galileo was one of the learned italians attracted to venice at the age of twentyeight he was appointed by the venetian authorities as principal lecturer in mathematics at the university of padua a venetian colony and he stayed in that institution for the next eighteen years he devoted himself to the pure and applied sciences inventing the thermometer and the telescope during his residence there and his appeals to the venetian administration for patronage were based upon a very practical determination he understood the true nature of the city very well when in he devised the first telescope he wrote to the reigning doge that the invention may be of inestimable service for every business by land and sea for it is thus possible at sea to discover the enemys vessels and sail at a far greater distance than is customary he displayed the powers of the telescope from the top of the campanile in saint marks square and the venetian officials were duly impressed a few weeks later he was appointed professor of astronomy for life with three times the highest pay ever granted to any lecturer in padua so we may celebrate the practical genius of venice there were no visionaries in venice they produced no machiavelli and no plato there was no speculation on utopias there was no concern for dogma or theory there was no real interest in pure or systematic knowledge as such empirical knowledge was for the venetians the key to truth experience rather than reason was the furnace in which solutions were to be forged in this they were also very close to the english genius the venetians were well known for their adaptability and their common sense in diplomatic negotiations they were inclined to compromise and to accommodate varying points of view in the affairs of the world they tended to be efficient and unsentimental there may have been no great poetry in the city but there were important texts on hydrostatics and geography on hydraulics and astronomy the venetians also possessed a practical inventiveness in pursuits as different as glass and instrumentmaking they invented easelpainting as well as the science of statistics the real intellectual success of venice however came in the practical manufacture of books the first licence to print was issued in just eighteen or nineteen years after the invention of movabletype printing by johannes gutenberg the venetian senate announced that this peculiar invention of our time altogether unknown to former ages is in every way to be fostered and advanced in this the senators were five years ahead of william caxton the venetian authorities had sensed a commercial opportunity and the city soon became the centre of european printing they created the privilege of copyright for certain printed works in so the investment of the printers was guaranteed it was the first legislation for copyright in the world venetian bankers underwrote the costs of the new ventures the paper came from venetian territory near lake garda all the conditions for what would now be called mass production and mass marketing were in place indeed printing was the first form of mass production technology creating identical objects at identical cost it was only right and natural that venice should be the pioneer of that trade venice in was said to be stuffed with books at the time of the counterreformation too the authorities maintained a more liberal attitude towards censorship than the other citystates of italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century there were almost two hundred print shops producing a sixth of all the books published in europe venice excelled in printing rather than creating literature its most famous printer aldus manutius was a wandering scholar from bassanio near rome he came to venice as a lecturer and despite his great learning he was soon imbued with the commercial spirit of the city he became aware that knowledge of the classics could be wrapped up in packages like bales of raisins he could turn learning into a commodity so in he formed a workshop for the production of greek texts in this pursuit he was aided by the greek scholars who had fled from ruined byzantium with the words of the past in their heads they brought with them too manuscripts and commentaries almost by accident venice found itself at the forefront of the revival of learning its commercial spirit had consequences in the sphere of the intellect in the summer of an edition of the plays of sophocles was published with the colophon venetiis in aldi romani academia thus inaugurating a remarkable sequence of all the important greek authors in meticulously edited versions the fontsof latin greek and hebrewwere beautiful and are in fact still in use the manuscripts were scrupulously copied in type that seemed aesthetically to rival the original handwriting of the compilers the printing shop had become an academy where visiting scholars were employed to edit the texts and to proofread the sheets coming off the press greek scholars were also hired as compositors so by degrees there grew up an aldine circle devoted to the dissemination of learning in which the spoken language was largely greek prompting aldus to describe venice as another athens erasmus became a part of that circle as well as other itinerant scholars and humanists and at a later date he recalled that some thirtythree employees slept and worked on the premises he also found the food frugal and the wine vinegary aldus mixed with the venetian patricians who considered themselves to be patrons of learning they believed that he added to the glory of venice the press of visitors became so great however that aldus put up a notice before his door at the corner of the campo di s agostino whoever you are aldus earnestly begs you to state your business in the fewest possible words and begone unless like hercules to weary atlas you would lend a helping hand there will always be enough work for you and all who come this way yet the turning of knowledge and learning into commodities had other consequences it was said at the time that the abundance of books made men less studious there were complaints about the vulgarisation attendant upon the new technology in an age of cultural transition there are always anxieties expressed by those who are still reliant upon the old order the aldine press helped to bring the classical authors within the view of a wider audience the editions were smaller and cheaper than any others for some scholars this represented a threat to their cultural supremacy the printers of venice also became masters of musical printing map printing and medical printing spreading information around europe books on the human anatomy and on military fortifications were published works of popular piety light literature in the vernacular chapbooks all issued from the city of the lagoon printing linked the various strata of the literate classes of europe together otherwise there would have been no such general response to the teachings of luther the publication of maps helped to create a new international trading economy the commercialisation of knowledge as a consequence of renaissance humanism indirectly led to religious reformation and the industrial revolution the venetians did have a university but it was located twenty miles km away in padua the city having been taken in venice itself would not have welcomed a large body of freethinking students within its domain it was also concerned with the loyalty of its own young men and forbade venetians to study anywhere other than padua so the patrician youth migrated to the mainland city in search of enlightenment together with students from england germany poland and hungary sir francis walsingham the famous elizabethan spymaster and sir philip sidney studied in padua many of these foreigners were by the sixteenth century followers of the reformed religion of luther and zwingli but their apostasy did not bother the venetian authorities who were in any case accustomed to the various faiths of the world padua itself was most celebrated for its schools of law and of medicine and became in the words of thomas coryat a sweet emporium and mart town of learning there was a chair of agriculture and a veterinary school there was a famous department of anatomy to which the venetian authorities guaranteed a plentiful supply of corpses by the middle of the sixteenth century padua had become the most significant centre for scientific learning in europe in a world of institutional faith and individual piety it offered a secular education that was the reason for its success we despise one venetian of the sixteenth century wrote knowledge of things of which we have no need that is one of the reasons why the arts of literature as opposed to those of painting and music were not cultivated there was a social and political as well as a practical reason for this neglect literature asks questions and poses problems whereas art and music celebrate and affirm writing may encourage disruption and even revolution whereas art and music aspire towards harmony and balance francesco sagredo was a venetian patrician and humanist who in the early part of the seventeenth century became a companion and associate of galileo sagredo himself had a reputation as a wit and scholar his own testimony therefore may hold the clue to venetian humanism in general i am a venetian gentleman and i have never wished to be known as a literary man i have good relations with literary men and have always tried to protect them but i do not expect to grow wealthy or to acquire praise and reputation from my understanding of philosophy or mathematics but rather from my integrity and my good practice in the administration of the republic distinguished writers have been drawn to venice over the centuries but the city has not nourished many writers of its own the two most famous of its native sons are marco polo and casanova both of whom wrote what were essentially memoirs casanova offers an interesting case history of the venetian genius the chief business of my life has always been to indulge my senses he wrote i never knew anything of greater importance this might be justifiably described as a main article of the venetian creed his knowledge did not lead him to any measure of selfawareness except in the endless duplicity and theatricality of his nature despite his many seductions and attempts at rape he shows no sign of conscience or manifestation of guilt casanova does not indulge in interior reflections of any kind it is as if he were a character out of commedia dellarte doomed to continue with the same impersonation in every scene and in every play it is perhaps no wonder that his story of his imprisonment in the dungeons of the ducal palace and of his subsequent escape is a central text in venetian social history he was in the prison of his unreflecting self it is in any case rare to find in venetian literature any attempt at analysis or selfcriticism there is just no interest in the subject the fruit of a culture in which individualism of any kind was discouraged the true literature of venice was neither tragic nor confessional there was some epic poetry but it is wearisome there was in reality very little poetry of any kind once more emphasising the low value placed upon selfexpression the real literature was popular and demotic or it was historical and journalistic the historical tradition was grave detailed and prosaic the popular tradition was in love with fantasy and superstition with wonders and apparitions with elements of the exotic and the fanciful how else to explain the huge popularity of the plays of carlo gozzi the most famous of which is the love for three oranges in which three beautiful princesses are born out of three enchanted oranges it was taken from an old womans tale to quieten children and gozzi said that he wrote it simply to please so thoughtless a nation as the venetians the venetian audience applauded the first performance frantically according to an italian critic giuseppe baretti leading him to declare in the manners and customs of italy that the venetians do not greatly care for the labour of searching after truth and their imagination runs too often away with them while their judgment lies dormant gozzis dramas were fantasias of the eighteenth century with magicians and monsters knights on horseback and devils in red costume they were a curious mixture of magniloquence and parody lamentation and farce thus continuing the venetian tradition of commedia dellarte in a more sensational setting that form is the distilled essence of literary culture in the city there was much interest in letters and diaries too as if the quotidian life of the city was of paramount importance to keep a recordthis was the venetian style many venetian patricians maintained diaries of daily events covering many years and encompassing many volumes they were not concerned with their individual reflections in the manner of other diarists but only in recording the tidings of their city nothing was too trivial to be beneath notice one of them marino sanudo wrote some forty thousand pages in minute handwriting it was a way of celebrating and commemorating the city some of the more bizarre passages of venetian history can also make their way into these narratives on august sanudo wrote that today the execution took place of the albanian who foully murdered zuan marco first his hand was cut off at the ponte della late and note that this resulted in a curious incident while his wife was saying farewell to him he moved forward as if he wanted to kiss her then he bit off her nose it seems that she was responsible for revealing his crime to the authorities if there is not much poetry in venice there is a great deal of song the folk songs of the city however bear no resemblance to the expression of high deathless passion in other folk traditions there is no pity and no tragedy there is pathos and sentimentality would you weep if i were dead a mother asks her infant child how could i help weeping for my own mamma who loves me so much in her heart sentimentality is the enemy of true feeling and suits a city where the mask is preeminent but the folk songs are also filled with gaiety and optimism a joyful seizing of the day that might be related to the mercantile tradition of the city there is also an element of shrewdness allied with the fantastical it was once believed that cities could not create or nourish folk songsthat such songs flourished only in rural areasbut venice disproved that pastoral myth in these songs there is much local patriotism but no politics there is also satire and obscenity like the venetian liking for sweet and sour in food the songs are a mixture of acid and honey no city in the world has produced so many proverbs as venice they go with the capacity of the citizens for sharp retort and instant wisdom there were many singular expressions reflecting the life and spirit of a mercantile culture one of them notices with pride that money is our second blood the conservatism of the people emerges in such phrases as novelty pleases those who have nothing to lose the first sin is to be born desperate and he who loves foreigners loves the wind many of them refer to the unique situation and quality of the city and its inhabitants venetians first then christians the lord of the sea is also the lord of the land as soon as a law is made an evasion is found venetians are born tired and live to sleep venice is a paradise for priests and prostitutes to make an impressionto make a splashis to drown yourself in a big sea he who looks for help at a gaming table will grow long hair like a bear god wants us injured but not dead wine is the milk of the old this litany could go on for ever but it is wise to recall another proverb the first sign of madness is to remember proverbs it is a curiosity of venetian culture too that it is the home of the rise tale a version of folk literature in which a young man or woman battles against poverty and by an advantageous marriage usually to royalty becomes rich beyond measure it is the fairy story of a mercantile society dreaming of the impossible one of these stories the tale of costantino and his cat travelled through the englishspeaking world as puss in boots there was always a problem with the venetian dialect in which these folk tales were generally written it was not considered to be a serious or proper language for literary art by the end of the thirteenth century the major works of venetians were being written in the then fashionable language of provençal it is a reflection of the fashion for gothic architecture in venice during the same period this literary french then developed into a form of francoitalian the language in which marco polo dictated from a genoese prison in the memoirs of his exotic journey it may seem strange that venetians would write in french rather than a version of italian but there is a more recent example to throw light upon this curious cultural phenomenon in the nineteenth century the upper classes of russia conversed and wrote in french considering their native language to be too low for refined speech in the sixteenth century too the venetian language was demoted in favour of the more literary tuscan language that had been fashioned three centuries earlier the language of dante and of florence became the language of polite literature the venetian dialect was reserved for populist drama and popular song epics and histories were composed in tuscan the models of polite discourse were petrarch and boccaccio asserting the dominance of a foreign and archaic tongue over the living vitality of the native dialect this is perhaps not entirely unexpected in other cultures too a highly stylised or liturgical language has the mastery over the demotic written anglosaxon was a very different thing from native english the venetian dialect was still used for public purposes however it was the official language of public administration and of the courts of law the laws themselves were composed and published in venetian and of course it wasand is stillin use among the people of the city it varies between districts but like every other european language it is becoming standardised and flattened all the time is it indeed a language or is it a dialect this is a question about which experts differ but spoken venetian has very ancient roots indeed it is a native development out of the low latin in use in the early centuries of roman dominion each region of the lagoon had an indigenous population that used the common language differently so the sound of venetian must surely derive from the speech of the early veneti certainly it is a language older than italian the sound is distinctive it has been said that the seamists and northern winds have changed the timbre of venetian voices so that they are harsher than the liquid and sonorous accents of the rest of italy the sound of sixteenthcentury tuscan for example was described even by one venetian as sweeter and more pleasing lively and fluent yet venetian the expression of a predominantly mercantile society is also more powerful and energetic it can be loud and it has been said that the venetians have the loudest voices in all of italy it can be raucous and in the fourteenth century dante reported that a venetian woman sounded very much like a man it has a chantlike or singsong quality known as cantilena so its phonetics differ from those of standard italian madre becomes mare signore becomes sior figlio becomes fio words and phrases are run together so that the name of the church of s giovanni grisostomo became zangrisostomo there was a habit of eliding the last syllable of proper nouns so the patrician name of faliero became falier having previously metamorphosed from faletrus and faledro santo becomes san bello becomes beo and casa becomes ca it increases the melodic disposition of the words in that manner sotto il portico becomes sottoportego it is more rapid and perhaps more alive than other italian dialects it is for example rich in colloquialisms the economy of utterance has another effect it creates what observers have called the infantine or babyish quality of venetian speech byron described it as the language of naivetyhe also compared it to the somersetshire version of englishwhile the french writer george sand said that it was destined for the mouths of infants two adjectives will be used instead of a superlative to express magnitude like a child calling out bella bella plural subjects have singular verbs so that in english it might be translated as the boys does this and the girls weeps a lot grammar is not the strong point of venetian speech harsh consonants are elided so that fagioli becomes fasioi the g ordinarily becomes z as in doze rather than doge and zorno for giorno it is in some ways a simple language lacking sophistication but that does not make it any the less charming colour and light it was known as venezia la bella an incomparable union of art and life a byzantine historian of the fifteenth century compared it to an exquisitely proportioned sculpture in its setting upon the waters it was born to be painted and engraved some have even suggested that it looked better on paper and on canvas than it ever did in the light of day in the drawings and paintings of venetian life from those of jacopo bellini in the middle of the fifteenth century to those of francesco guardi in the latter part of the eighteenth century the setting and architecture of the city take precedence over the activities of its inhabitants the physical space and the stone face are preeminent who can remember any of the human figures in canaletto in the many images of the public processions of venice the spectators and the participants become part of the architecture the buildings themselves seem to embody the harmony and joy of the people the stone is a monument to human will but in the process the stone itself becomes revered the presence of stonewalls stairways balustrades and alcovesis very noticeable in venetian painting the city might have been composed by a painter seeking symmetry and contrast weighing the vertical against the horizontal combining shapes and colours in the most harmonious whole latin elements are balanced against greek elements gothic against byzantine in order to symbolise the sway of different empires the sight lines are perfect as in the stage scenery for a play or for an opera and the perspective subtly diminished the details and motifs are carefully mingled the coordinates of the public buildings were appraised in the light of renaissance theories of numbers so that the vistas have a mystical or magical enchantment it was another form of power guardis paintings of the city are called vedute or views emphasising the primacy of the eye in the city everything is for display the first album of venetian views a series of relatively inexpensive engravings was published in generations of travellers noted that the absence of dust in venice guaranteed that the great houses and churches would remain relatively bright and clean one of the reasons why there were and are so many balconies and terraces in the city was to provide vantage points from which the beautiful scenario could be observed it is sometimes hard to know whether the art imitated the reality or whether the architecture was inspired by the paintings in tintorettos paradiso placed in splendour within the ducal palace the figures of saints theodore and mark of moses and of christ are arranged one to another in the same positions as their respective principal churches in venice so a civic aesthetic is immortalised in paint public space becomes artistic space venice was pictorial in another sense with the frescoes of tintoretto and giorgione and others adorning the outward walls of the principal houses there was a unique appetite in the earliest cities for wall painting as in the frescoes of bronze age knossos or in the wall paintings uncovered in the ruins of the worlds first city catal huyuk in mesopotamia it is as if the conditions of urban living prompted the desire for colour and display in venice the essential city that desire was given full expression a traveller from the court of burgundy in philippe de commynes noted that most of the great houses along the grand canal had painted façades so he dubbed venice urbs picta or painted city in the early part of the sixteenth century pietro aretino described venice as if it flowed from the brush of titian ever since it was created by god he wrote in never has the city been so embellished by such a lovely picture of lights and shades oh how beautiful were the strokes with which the brushes of nature pushed back the air separating it from the palaces in the same way as titian does in painting his landscapes the lights and darks created the effects of distance and relief the city then becomes a living painting a work of art in its own right yet if a city is a work of art does it in some sense cease to be a living city whistler commented that the people and buildings of venice seem to exist especially for ones picturesand to have no other reason for being this of course has been the fate of venice in more recent years and it raises questions about its ultimate authenticity if we conceive of the city as artefact something made and not found then we will understand something else about the nature of venice we might say that the cities of the mainland like london or rome were indeed found they were part of the natural world before they boasted walls and gates they were part of the lie of the land and their growth into cities was a product of many hundreds of generations of settlement and toil venice is not that kind of city it was created it is a magnificent invention it is an inspired improvisation at the hands of man it was from its beginning artificial a product of a battle against nature itself the houses did not grow out of the ground they were built up piece by piece the cities of the mainland were always in part defensive structures because of the sheltered position of the city of the lagoon the instinct for defence was displaced by the appetite for display there was no natural evolution therefore but an artificial construct that can only be preserved by further intervention the modern restoration of the city offers an instructive lesson in the nature of the artefact in the latter half of the nineteenth century giambattista meduna and his successor pietro saccardo restored large portions of the basilica of saint marks including the south and west façades curved lines were straightened and old marble was replaced with new the pavement of the left aisle was remade rather than renovated columns and capitals were scraped clean it became essentially an imitation or simulacrum of the medieval structure so that we can say part of the great church was constructed in the s and s rather than the eleventh century the architects wished to revert to some original state of the basilica but in a building created by accretion and assimilation there never was any original state the church represents a process rather than an event its new campanile was constructed in the early years of the twentieth century after the collapse of the original earlysixteenthcentury tower the new campanile may look genuine to the casual observer but it is in essence a fake it is a facsimile designed to maintain the illusion of the tourist that he or she is walking through an ancient city this architectural quietism never in practice works nothing can be rebuilt as it was the very fact of rebuilding precludes that possibility the larger houses of the city have been restored to look more authentically venetian as already noted with brighter colours and more regular ornamentation such restoration is connected with a loss of nerve and a loss of identity after the fall of the republic at the hands of napoleon in the city lost its authority in the world its economy was eclipsed with its power over the past two centuries it has attempted to create a phantom of its glorious past it has become in part a fantasy city the process has been called in somewhat ugly terms the aesthetification or commodification of venice the nineteenthcentury french architect eugène violletleduc suggested that to restore a building is to reconstitute it in a more complete state than it could have been at any given moment thus we have the fullness of the public rather than the local and private venice more complete than it was in any one period inviolate idealised conceptual transcending the general inflictions of time it has never looked more medieval than it does now yet in another sense it resembles a visage swollen and unreal after too many facelifts the light of venice is as important as its space and form the light on the water casts illumination upwards and outwards the sunlight plays upon the walls and ceilings with an incessant rippling effect it stirs the air and makes everything dance what is solid is diffused buildings shimmer against the surface of the water stone becomes colour on the water it can make the battered marble and the weatherstained brick the slime on the surface of the canal seem marvellous there is a sparkling light on winter days but the characteristic of venice is a pale soft light like a drifting haze powdered part wave and part cloud it is a pearly iridescent light wreathed in mist it is drawn from the horizon and the sea as much as from the sun it lends everything unity that is why venetian painters have always been drawn to the gleam of light upon water of the reflection of figures and of objects there are many mirrors of local manufacture in venetian painting the art of bellini has always been celebrated for its luminosity for its ability to charge the air with light the diffuse sky and the bright horizon contain a glowing world the surfaces of his canvases emit and receive light as in the streets of the city itself even the shadows become sources of light it is a truism that in venetian painting colour rather than contour is the key surely this is related to the vision of reflections in the water light was in every context a token of splendour and of nobility in the twelfthcentury chronicles the basilica of maria assunta was celebrated for pellucida claritas or admirable lightness the range of associations is intrinsic to the power of the word the polished flooring of venetian houses known as terrazzo compounded of lime and wellpowdered stone was prized for its ability to reflect light it was buffed and polished with linseed oil until it shone as everyone testified like a mirror venetian houses were always designed to catch the light in the sixteenth century it was noted that the windows were made of glass rather than paper or waxed cloth according to francesco sansovino they were bright and full of the sun there were of course gloomy recesses dark courtyards and hidden passages the venetians were affected by the chiaroscuro of brightness and shadow it was part of their nature it is part of their painting there was a passion for artificial light the chandeliers or lampadari of venice seeming to float in the great upper spaces of venetian apartments were renowned for the myriad and innumerable crystals that seemed to vie with the sparkle of the water outside the windows venice was the first city in europe to have in its streets lit by lamps london followed in in this period an english traveller edward wright noted that the venetians are excessively lavish of their white wax tapers in their processions at their nightlitanies when these lights were seen mingling with the jewels the gold the crystal and the silver there was such a glittering there was scarce any looking upon them this is a quintessential venetian effect this glittering it is related to the glittering of the sea all around light is the lifegiving force it quickens life it is an emblem of vivacity and vitality both associated with the venetian temperament the numinous is luminous light is the first created thing if light is seen as a spiritual substance then it changes the way we look at the world the streets and buildings are illuminated by the divine and are thus themselves sacred light has always been depicted as a sign of heavenly grace there is a light of holiness and a light of vision the renaissance churches of venice designed by codussi and palladio exclude any frescoes or mosaics from their interiors the walls are purely white in this way the quality of the light was preserved the istrian stone of venice is in the sunlight dazzling the passion for colour existed like the veneration of light as a token of energy and bravura it was a symbol of being the harmony of colours was akin to the warmth of the sun in venice the term was colorito rather than colore intimating the active and expressive possibilities of colour the nineteenthcentury english artist william etty described venice as the birthplace and cradle of colour in the same century john ruskin noted that the venetians resembled the arabs in their intense love of colour which led them to lavish the most expensive decorations on ordinary dwelling houses in addition they possessed that perfection of the colourinstinct in them which enabled them to render whatever they did in this kind as just in principle as it was gorgeous in appliance so they coated their palaces in porphyry and gold where the northern architects employed oak and sandstone the inner walls of the houses were hung with painted leather or with green and crimson damask there is expansive colour in the brilliant polychromaticism of their architectural detail in marble and in mosaic the basilica of saint marks is a hymn to colour we may also surmise that this was a culture in which sensory experience was deeper and more intense than our own in which beautiful colour and beautiful sound had a more direct impact upon the human consciousness taste and smell and sight and hearing were stripped bare life itself was altogether more vivid the world had not lost its aura it was not coincidental perhaps that the city itself was the centre of the pigment trade in europe the painters of the netherlands and the rest of italy would purchase their colours from venice where there were merchants who specialised in that trade here were the finest orpiment and realgar used for yellow and for orange as well as vermilion and lead white there is the famous venetian red a red earth extracted from the veneto and characteristically to be seen in fifteenthcentury venetian painting it was said to be as red as the blood of christ the dyeing industries of the city indispensable in the production of luxury textiles guaranteed the supply of the pigment known as red lake the history of fashions in colouras red lead for example gave way to orange at the end of the fifteenth centurywould also be a history of human sensibility the venetian painters often pursued the most expensive colours for the sake of their price and rarity thus for example the profound violet blue of bellini or titian was taken from the ground semiprecious lapis lazuli of what is now afghanistan red pigments from silver or sulphur were valued very highly the venetian republic was the home of saffron imported from the east in his grande dictionnaire de la cuisine alexander dumas père remarked that it was to spices that we owe titians masterpieces what are the colours of the most serene city there are of course the sacred colours bellinis colours blue and gold many of the public buildings of venice were decorated with a blue sky of night irradiated by stars of gold upon the pala doro the richly metalled altar screen in saint marks panels of translucent blue enamel were set within golden borders it was heavens colour blue is the colour of calm and serenity adopted in the most serene city in the paintings of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the most favoured colour was a deep blue there was the violet blue of the sky and the greenish blue of the soft distance the colours of salmon magenta orange and white are reflected upon the blue and green waters the sails of the fishing boats upon the lagoon through the centuries were orange or crimson there is also green so much wished for in a city of stone bellini luxuriated in deep green the venetian builders loved green marble it was an intimation of the natural world so that we can speak of forests of marble springing up in the city it was a reminder of the sap and the leaf of the miracle of rebirth ruskin noted that one of the favourite chords of venetian colour was the sweet and solemn harmony of purple with various greens there is the pink of dawn too and the pink of evening henry james described it as a faint shimmering airy watery pink the bright sealight seems to flush with it and the pale whiteishgreen of lagoon and canal to drink it in is this a just description of the water pale whiteishgreen what is in any case the colour of water the colours of the sea approaching venice were once distinguished by the porti into which they issued thus the waters from the lido were red those from malamocco were green and those from chioggia were purple what is the colour of the waters in the canals and in the lagoon they have variously been described as jade green lilac pale blue brown smoky pink lavender violet heliotrope dove grey after a storm the colour changes as the water becomes aerated on a hot afternoon the waters may seem orange the colours of the sky and the colours of the city are refracted in little ovals of ochre and blue it is all colours and no colour it reflects and does not own colour it becomes what it beholds pilgrims and tourists the city needs people it demands to be seen the pilgrims of the middle ages were the first tourists they were given guided tours and certain state officials had the task of inspecting taverns and checking merchandise sold to tourists these inspectors were also supposed to lead the strangers to the most expensive shops where they could buy glass beads or silver crosses there were other guides and agents known as tolomazi who offered a range of services from interpreting to money changing the owners of the various galleys set up booths in saint marks square each with the flag of their ship prominently displayed the masters of these galleys offered snacks of food and glasses of wine to the passing custom while each abused the other and defamed him to the pilgrims the pilgrims themselves were lodged in especial taverns and hostelries such as the little horse and the lobster it was said of some crusaders on their way to the holy land that they never got further than the luna hotel the luna was on the quay down from the piazzetta it was full of guests by the white lion opened its doors five years later venice has been the cynosure of all eyes for almost a thousand years some figures suggest that at the beginning of the twentyfirst century it attracts three million residential tourists and seven million day trippers each year other estimates vary from fourteen to sixteen million annual visitors it is safe to conclude therefore that millions upon millions of people enter a city that has no more than sixty thousand inhabitants at any one time there are more strangers than citizens this is not an unusual situation however since by the s tourists began to outnumber residents yet the imbalance has never been so large it has been claimed that in twentyfive years at the current rate of dispersal there will be no native venetians left in the city it will be a city of tourists and of those who serve them it is no wonder that venetians feel themselves to be under threat yet through the centuries venice has passively colluded in its own fate at the free fair held on the feast of the ascension in the fourteenth century it was claimed that two hundred thousand strangers came to the city the authorities invented a season of festivals and fairs from the end of april to the beginning of june which could be used to inveigle more visitors by the fifteenth century there were more than twenty hostelries most of them situated near saint marks square and the rialto they offered good food clean linen and a plentiful supply of prostitutes engravings of festivals and of processions were sold as tourist souvenirs a city where everything is for sale will naturally wish to sell itself so the eventual fate of venice was being decided at a relatively early date by the end of the fifteenth century a milanese priest pietro casola complained that it was a city about which so much has been said and written that it seems to me there is nothing left to say a sixteenthcentury tourist fynes morisson said that venice was another word for veni etiam or come again the natives were always friendly and in the early sixteenth century sir richard torkinton said of his hotel in venice that the good man of the howse seyd he knew me by my face that i was an englysshman and he spake to me good englyssh in a similar spirit the venetian authorities encouraged any form of entertainment that would entice visitors to the city including plays and operas and festivals they also countenanced even if they did not actively encourage the belief that the city was the centre of illicit sex the venetian courtesan became famous throughout europe but anyone from boys to transvestites could be purchased in venice and of course venetian hospitality came at a price a huguenot tourist of the eighteenth century françois misson commenting upon the large number of foreigners in the city wondered how much money all this multitude must bring to venice it was said that every fifth house had a bed to let and such was the press of boats that you need but cry out gondola and you have them launch out presently to you the first guidebook venetia città nobilissima was published in in the seventeenth century venice became the centre of the grand tour meant to form an essential element in the progress of an english gentleman at the beginning of the eighteenth century the english ambassador lord manchester reported of the venetians that the chief part they intend to act here is to amuse the rest of europe and do nothing this was the century in which venetian artists began to create images of their city expressly designed to appeal to tourists francesco guardi for example saw his city as a tourist might see it as a place of romance and of quasitheatrical scenery canaletto specialised in idealised topographical views that were then exported to the rest of europe in general and to england in particular in that period there were more than thirty thousand visitors at the time of the carnival but the true acme of venetian tourism was reached in the nineteenth century the grand tour had given way to uppermiddleclass travel with venice as the most desirable destination of all by the s tourist guides to the city were being written the first cooks tour of venice was arranged in the venice of today henry james wrote is a vast museum where the little wicket that admits you is perpetually turning and creaking the city became for the victorians an acceptable relic of the past a place of cultural respectability it offered a refuge from the horrors of industrialism that were even then afflicting england and a cosy metaphor for an admired and muchlamented past the gothic architecture of nineteenthcentury england found some of its meaning and context in the churches and grand houses of the city it was already a place of historical nostalgia the victorians were in a sense the new pilgrims the ancestors of those who had gone on a spiritual journey to jerusalem yet the pilgrimage now ended at venice and its religion was that of art and history it was in this century too that the conventional image of venice was fixed for ever in the public imaginationthe gondolas the pigeons the openair cafés of saint marks square it had become a peepshow a diorama a bazaar but there were some who anticipated that the city itself would be altered in the process in the english periodical the builder warned its readers that the tourists of venice had no right to require the inhabitants of any old city that they should be content to reduce themselves to the condition of the custodians of a museum in the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries the project of venice may be said to be complete it has been called the disneyfication of venice venice has been true to its destiny that is all it is still a working city but it has acquired a new character there are those who speak of decline or decay but there is no real evidence for this in some respects venice is the most successful city in the world cities are of their nature artificial venice will simply take the urban concept to a new height the nineteenthcentury american writer francis marion crawford put it best when he declared that it would not surprise those who know her to come suddenly upon her and find that all human life was extinct within her while her own went on as strong as ever it is no good pretending that the tourists do not see the real venice in the way that tourists do not see the real london or the real paris the tourist venice is the essential quintessential venice some tourists are more famous than others everyone who is anyone has now been replaced by anyone who is everyone but in the past the famous and the notorious have been drawn to the city as a stage on which they could perform shelley came to lament and byron came to ejaculate aretino came to celebrate and ruskin to denounce nietzsche proust and dante all visited the city petrarch came here on many occasions and declared it to be the most marvellous city that i have ever seen turner and whistler painted venice as have hundreds of other foreign artists in his ten oclock lecture in describing london whistler conjured up the image of another city and when the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry as with a veil and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky and the tall chimneys become campanili and the warehouses become palaces in the night and the whole city hangs in the heavens and fairy land lies before us by the late nineteenth century there was not an inch of venice that had not been painted it has also been a city of literature if not exactly a literary city there are forty references by shakespeare to venice and its dominions not all of them complimentary two of his plays the merchant of venice and othello are set wholly or partly in that city the first act of othello with its dark street and its shuttered house well captures the imaginative ambience of the place it has been proposed by some scholars that shakespeare actually visited the city but that is most unlikely he did not need to do so venice is preeminently an imagined city sir politique in ben jonsons volpone boasts that after the first week of arrival all tooke me for a citizen of venicei knew the formes so well he is also well aware of the predatory habits of the venetians for your venetian if he sees a manpreposterous in the least he has him straighthe has he strippes him the early nineteenthcentury english poets were instrumental in creating what might be called the mythography of venice byron composed two historical dramas set in the city but his enduring contribution to venetian sentiment is to be found in poems such as beppo don juan and the fourth canto of childe harolds pilgrimage where he associates the city with the melancholy outcast who is also the quintessential romantic hero in venice tassos echoes are no moreand silent rows the songless gondolierher palaces are crumbling to the shoreand music meets not always now the earthose days are gone yet romance can turn to romanticisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there appeared a number of somewhat whimsical and selfindulgent travelogues or diaries devoted to the picturesque possibilities of the city many writers have composed the same sentence under a venetian skythe solemn movements of the gondolier the market boats at dawn laden with fruits and vegetables the beautiful children the marble tables of florians the honeysuckle against a crumbling wall the solemn mellow tone of the great clock in the piazza the clangour of the bells of the campanile in the more serious works of literature however venice appears in quite another guise it becomes a setting for the secret life it becomes a place of selfdiscovery too when the usual boundaries between outward and inward private and public become blurred it is a setting where unconscious or repressed desires come forward it is a place of strange meetings and unexpected encounters one of the first english novels to be set in venice thomas nashes the unfortunate traveller has as its plot an adventure in disguise and masquerade when the earl of surrey exchanges identities with his servant in order to sample the delights of the city unobserved venice was already supposed to be the city of lechery and of doubleness or ambiguity the central part of ann radcliffes the mysteries of udolpho takes place in venice although the author herself never visited the city she imagined it so intently that her descriptions have the utmost verisimilitude it is a place of intrigue and of danger of horror and of extravagance viii the art of life hurrah for carnival byron enters what he considered to be the true and enduring life of venice despite his selfdramatising laments at its degradation by means of the carnival i have hardly had a wink of sleep this week past he wrote to tom moore in we are in the agonies of the carnivals last days and i must be up all night as well as tomorrow i have had some curious masking adventures this carnival but as they are not yet over i shall not say on i will work the mine of my youth to the last veins of the ore and thengood night i have lived and am content the carnival was instituted at the end of the eleventh century and has continued without interruption for almost seven hundred years after a period of desuetude it was resurrected in the s all the world repairs to venice john evelyn wrote in the seventeenth century to see the folly and madness of the carnevall it was originally supposed to last for forty days but in the eighteenth century it was sometimes conducted over six months it began on the first sunday of october and continued until the end of march or the beginning of lent this was also the theatre season in a city that prided itself on transcending nature it was one way of defying winter yet if the festivities last for half a year does real life then become carnival life it was said in fact that venice was animated by a carnivalesque spirit for the entire year it was no longer a serious city such as london or a wise city such as prague there were bands and orchestras in saint marks square there were puppet shows and masked balls and street performers there were costume parties in the opera houses where prizes were awarded for the best dress there were elaborate fêtes with gilded barges liveries of gold and crimson gondolas heaped with flowers the venetians according to william beckford in the s were so eager in the pursuit of amusement as hardly to allow themselves any sleep in this season everyone was at liberty evelyn described the carnival as the resort of universal madnesse with the women men persons of all conditions disguising themselves in antique dresses with extravagant musique a thousand gambols but sir henry wotton believed that there was method in the madness the carnival was used for diverting men from talking of greater matters another english observer believed that the promotion of pleasure and even of vice was one of the main hinges of the venetian government it is perhaps the old truism of bread and circuses but the festivity was directed at strangers as well as natives it encouraged trade of course and the carnival supported seven theatres two hundred restaurants and innumerable gaming houses but the show of joy was also a show of strength an illusion designed to emphasise the wealth the independence and the impregnability of the city there were bullfights and bullruns through the streets there were firework displays the venetians were well known for their skill at pyrotechnics with the reflection of the coloured sparks and flames glittering upon the water there were ropewalkers and fortunetellers and improvisatori singing to the guitar or mandolin there were quacks and acrobats there were wild beast shows in the rhinoceros was first brought to venice there were the elements of the macabre there were mock funeral processions and on the last day of the carnival a figure disfigured by syphilitic sores was pushed around in a barrow here once more is the old association between festivity and the awareness of death venetians dressed up as their favourite characters from the commedia dellarte there was mattacino dressed all in white except for red shoes and red laces he wore a feathered hat and threw eggs of scented water into the crowd there was pantalone the emblem of venice dressed in red waistcoat and black cloak and there was arlecchino in his multicoloured costume there were masked parties and masked balls there were masked processions through the streets of the city the carnival in fact became intimately associated with the wearing of the mask or volto it is first mentioned in public documents of when masked persons were forbidden to gamble it came out of the east the most popular form of the carnival costume was the bauta a mantle of silk or velvet that covered the head and shoulders a threecornered hat was worn on top of the hood of this garment the face itself was covered by a halfmask of silk or velvet black or white or by a white beaklike object known as larva there were some masks that had to be held by the teeth thus prohibiting speech secrecy and silence consorted the masker male or female also wore a black cloak known as a domino the women tended to wear black masks and the men white even if the disguise of the mask was less than perfect the identity of the masker was never to be revealed he was always addressed as signor maschera it was all highly ritualised as befits a ceremony that has its roots in ancient worship by the eighteenth century at the very latest the masks had become indispensable during the six months of the carnival everyone in the city wore themthe rich and the poor the shopkeepers and the priests the magistrates and the prostitutes the priest was in fact denounced by his parish if he did not wear a mask in public the dignitaries of the city wore them in public ceremonies and processions only the money changers were not permitted to wear them it was reported that a masked mother was seen suckling a masked infant even the beggars wore masks altogether it was a curious spectacle there were assignations there were betrayals there was spontaneous sex behind doors and in the corners of alleys pleasure is addictive it can have all the elements and attributes of a fever pleasure is a dream one venetian described how women of every condition married maid or widow mingle freely with professional harlots for the mask levels all distinctions and there is no filth they do not practise publicly with their paramours young and old there were also less salacious diversions three or four women in masks might go up to various acquaintances and in squeaky assumed voices tease them for their wellknown weaknesses it was a case of dressingup and pretending a game beloved by children of all kinds the word bauta itself is supposed to derive from the childish lisping of bau bau and it was often said of course that the venetians were essentially children addison believed that the intrigue and secret history of the carnival would make a collection of very diverting novels venice always seems to prompt the telling of stories the carnival offered the possibility of another world and of another reality it represented a second life for those who had been or who had felt themselves to be cheated in the first one the masked balls were known as i festini and were open to anyone wearing a mask their location was marked by a lantern garlanded with flowers within could be heard the music of the cello and the spinet and the guests danced the minuet and the gavotte the kind owners of the house would then go among their guests and demand their fees nothing was free in venice there were various rules concerning the use of the mask promulgated through the centuries but they were generally disregarded in the nineteenth century for example it was decreed that no reveller might touch or walk with a masked person without being given express permission how was that to be policed it is appropriate to speculate about the nature of the mask so associated with venice that it has become its unofficial emblem there are masks carved out of stone still to be seen on the bridges and arches of the city the making of masks even in the twentyfirst century is one of the most profitable of all venetian trades goethe wrote from venice that masks which in our country have as little life and meaning for us as mummies here seem sympathetic and characteristic expressions somehow the mask fitted the venetian countenance it became expressive the mask is an emblem of secrecy in the city of secrets it suggests that the city itself might like the maskers lead a double life venice was known for the greed and duplicity that existed beneath the festive or aesthetically appealing surface it is a city of doubleness of reflections within reflections in every sense the mask is a sign of ambiguity it has been said that nothing in venice has a single meaning everything from art to government is open to endless interpretation the derivation of carnival is itself ambiguous does carne vale mean farewell to flesh or flesh mattered vale may have either signification some derive it from carnem levare or the giving up of meat it is also perhaps significant that the mask was known as larva it suggests the secret hatching of life and the birth of a butterfly from a grub so the carnival also celebrates the city as a place of protean identity and delight ruskin glimpsed proteus himself latent in the saltsmelling skin of her the mask itself has perverse connotations with the black bauta and the black tricorner hat it has associations with death it might conceal a grinning deaths head it might conceal nothing at all contemporary venice has been described as an empty mask so sartre wrote that when i look at the palazzo dario i always have the feeling that yes it is certainly there but that at the same time there is nothing there there is nothing left to find there is nothing left to describe the carnival also served a social purpose in a city where the roles of patricians and citizens were well defined the loss of identity was often very welcome in the course of their duties the patricians adopted the appearance of severity and gravity as the mark of their public status the carnival allowed the release of the social and personal tensions that must inevitably have spread the carnival thereby stabilised the people and the institutions of venice it encouraged the feeling of community among all the people it afforded a glimpse of the eternal principles of brotherhood and equality it was a reminder of the presumed original equality of the venetian people when they first sought refuge in the lagoons so the carnival became a form of public renewal in other cities and other states the celebration of the freedom of carnival life became the occasion for riot or even rebellion this never happened in venice in the late s after a period of decline the carnival was revived for the islanders of burano it then migrated to venice itself where the officials quickly realised its value as an enticement to visitors in this endeavour they have been wholly successful it is now a carnival of and for tourists it is of course heavily commercialised with corporate organisations sponsoring different events in it was in fact entirely given over to private hands and was organised by a company provisionally known as venice events limited the head of the casino in venice announced that sponsors will have at their disposal rooms at the best hotels for their guests tickets exclusive tables and deals with the casino but the carnival was always a commercial operation aimed in part at strangers it has simply fulfilled its essential nature while in the process becoming unreal and empty there were other fairs and holidays there were trade fairs such as that of the festa della sensa in the middle of may which were essentially celebrations of trade and of commerce the mercers of venice put on display their finest silks and the goldsmiths put out their finest plate there were elaborate processions staged by various guilds where the distinction between commerce and religious ceremony was hard to find the children blew trumpets of glass the shops were ablaze with lights and mirrors the brethren of the guild of s rocco held up a banner on which was inscribed copious riches cheerful labour public joy a painting by gabriele bella shows the fair of the late s with saint marks square covered with innumerable shops tents booths stalls and awnings so that it resembles an arabian souk it is not surprising therefore that venice became known as the city of performance with the multifarious mountebanks and jugglers and acrobats saint marks square was famous for hustlers and buskers of every kind they were freed from oppressive legislation in venice and so they flocked there they were dressed in outlandish gear singing and dancing on the especially prepared stages the quacks among them would make elaborate and splendid speeches on the benefits of their elixirs and soverayne waters there were illusionists who would pretend to cut open their arms with much blood only to reveal that their flesh was untouched there were snakecharmers and toothpullers and magicians who according to coryat performed strange juggling trickes as would be almost incredible to be reported othello is suspected of drugging desdemona with medicines bought of mountebanks the venetian kind was notorious throughout europe the carnival was also the home of voracious and incessant gambling at the end of the twelfth century the first public gaming tables in europe were erected by niccolò barattieri they were his reward for raising the two columns of the piazzetta and his tables were placed between them it soon became the place of judicial execution and is still known as a conventionally unlucky spot but the fever spread in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries there were various attempts to organise and to supervise the games of chance it was found necessary for example to pass statutes forbidding gambling in the courtyards of the ducal palace and in the basilica of saint marks itself yet nothing could stop the obsession with gaming playing cards were not invented in venice as is sometimes claimed but the venetians soon enjoyed something like a monopoly on their manufacture there were private ridotti or gaming places in many grand houses and in the houses of courtesans an edict of referred to places with gaming drunkenness and other dishonesties to the manifest shame of the state servants were asked to denounce masters who set up gambling tables the patricians were not alone in their predilection for gambling the people of venice were also addicted with dice and cards played in taverns and squares in wineshops and barbers shops upon bridges and even in gondolas they were ready to bet on anything from chess and chequers to skittles and rackets one of the most popular forms of gambling involved the results of public elections money would be placed on one candidate rather than another and bookmakers set up stalls in the rialto crowds would gather to see who had been elected to the senate or to the council of ten but they were not being publicspirited they were interested only in the outcome of the race so the authorities of the city decided to control and to profit from that which they could not prevent by the sixteenth century the ridotti or public gaming houses were already being licensed for various games of hazard and what was called honest conversation then in the venetian state financed a public gambling house the ridotto which became the paradigm or prototype for all the casinos of europe in the early eighteenth century gambling was seen as an essential element of the carnival it also became the sport of the patricians run in expensive clubs and under strictly commercial auspices it was said that to risk nothing is a thing for a man worth nothing so gambling was transformed into a sign of magnanimity and nobility one english visitor to a gaming house noticed that the crowd is so great that very often one can hardly pass from out of one room into another nevertheless the silence here observd is much greater than that in the churches to see in how much tranquillity and gravity very considerable summs are lost is really so very extraordinary the venetian gentleman was supposed to suffer loss or gain with the utmost indifference there were other public games of chance at the very beginning of the sixteenth century a city lottery was established it was a way of turning the attention of the populace from the private diversions of the gaming table into the safer realm of state enterprise it was of course also a means of raising money a lottery was conducted at the rialto in which the prizes included clothes and furniture paintings and jewels in a lottery was instituted to meet the costs of the newly rising rialto bridge tickets went on sale for two crowns and the prize was one hundred thousand crowns when the winners of the public lotteries were announced everything else came to a halt priests prostitutes and poltroons were all at the mercy of lottery fever pietro aretino noticed that those under its sway employed the filthiest and most blasphemous language to express their feelings the losers believed themselves to have been disembowelled and crucified yet still they came back for more gambling is a necessary occupation in a city of merchants dependent upon the sea for the merchant there was always the prospect of enormous future wealth yet it depended on the shifting sea a man might be wealthy beyond measure on one day poor and ruined on the next the rise of gaming in the city was often noted as a sign of increasing venetian decadence but of course it is the necessary consequence of the atmosphere and ethos of the city it has been claimed in this book that venice was the first home of capitalism in europe the essence of capitalism lies in risktaking otherwise known as financial speculation gambling reproduces the essential mysteries of economic fluctuation in a smaller and more intense space and then there is the importance of the concept of fortune in venetian public affairs the venetian state was always being urged to avoid fortuna belli the fortune of war in conflicts where there could be no certain victor there is some evidence to suggest that in the course of the fourteenth century a less sanguine attitude towards fortune and to risktaking spread among the people fortune too is the goddess of the venetian gaming table now all things are subject to fortune the venetian historian bernardo giustiniani wrote in the late fifteenth century and empires are daily changed and transferred it is fortune which plays this game fortune which must be obeyed when the greatest of all public gaming houses was closed in by the order of the government a contemporary reported that the whole population grows melancholy the merchants drive no trade the maskmakers perish of hunger and the hands of certain impoverished nobles accustomed to shuffle the cards for ten hours a day have now grown shrivelled and shrunk in truth vices are absolutely necessary to the life of a state gaming was the lifeblood of venice just as trading had once been when all the risk of empire had gone when all the risk of a great commercial life had disappeared for ever what was there left to hazard but cards and dice the sports and games of venice have an especial meaning for the students of state power one famous venetian pastime for example was the human pyramid it was known to the venetians as forze dercole the labours of hercules and consisted of men climbing on each others shoulders with the number at the base slowly tapering to one man on the summit it was usually performed upon a raft of boats thus emphasising an uncanny resemblance to the structure of the state itself where through a complex machinery of association the doge surmounts the people the human pyramid was also the human image of venice it was a feat of equilibrium the concepts of lightness and balance are of immense consequence in venice so it is perhaps significant that one of the most famous amusements of the carnival was known as volo della colombina or the flight of the dove a rope was tied from a moored boat to the top of the campanile in saint marks square from which another rope was secured to the ducal palace an acrobat dressed as an angel then climbed to the top of the campanile before sailing down towards the palace and scattering flowers as he descended in there was a more daring feat a boatman known as scartenador ascended by rope to the campanile on horseback there were many games and sports including rackets and fencing there were wheelbarrow races and horse races and gondola races in the sixteenth century there was a game known as balloon a kind of aerial football these games and others like them had a reputation for violence the young venetian patricians enjoyed shooting matches all of these amusements were forms of competition at the end of which a prize was awarded the venetians were a highly gregarious and therefore highly competitive people this was not true of londoners in the same period for example who preferred to attend bullbaitings and bearbaitings where there were no true winners and no awards there was one game however that more than any other symbolised the stability and strength of the venetian state it was known as la guerra dei pugni or the war of the fists fought between the inhabitants of the various territories and neighbourhoods there were the rialtini and the cannaruoli the bariotti and the gnatti but the largest division of all lay between the castellaniin the western parishes of cannaregio castello s marco and dorsoduroand the nicolotti in the eastern parishes of s croce and s polo the dominant factions were the fishermen of the nicolotti and the shipbuilders of the castellani their internecine rivalries have already been described a team from each of these territories met for battle on a chosen bridge while thousands of spectators lined the streets and houses beside the canal dumplings and chestnuts were served to the crowds by street vendors it was a glorified fistfight in which the object was to hurl opponents into the water and to gain possession of the bridge this became the sport of venice according to one sixteenthcentury chronicler so beloved and esteemed by all the venetian people as well as by foreigners visiting monarchs were invited to witness the proceedings as the castellani and the nicolotti vied for mastery when henry of valois visited venice in the summer of two armies of three hundred men did battle for his amusement it was said at the time that it was a way of displaying to the frenchman that the people of venice were very fierce indomitable headlong and uncontrolled they wore helmets and carried shields many of them came armed with sticks of tough rattan the fighting could last for several hours such violent delights often had violent ends many competitors were maimed or injured they were sometimes even killed it was of course an occasion of ritualised violence in which all the brute force of the populace could be expended popular energy was being exploited for the purposes of spectacle so that it might not be harnessed for any more dangerous cause at times of holiday when the fights took place there was no other subject of conversation among the people the cause of possessing the two paving stones on the crown of the bridge became an obsession the victors became heroes and the vanquished were lost in shame the winning parishes would light great bonfires in their campi and arrange impromptu dances the best fighters became famous all over the city with their portraits hanging in the houses of their parish they were given honorifics such as ditch jumper and eats the dead and destroyer of boldness they considered themselves to be soldiers although of course venetians were never soldiers in a military sense that may be one of the explanations for their pugnacity at home the first record of such fighting is found in but the first battle upon a bridge seems to have been staged in the roots of the contest are much older of course dating from the first period of exile when the groups from various cities made their homes upon separate islands in the lagoon there were then real wars for mastery of which the battle of the fists was a token on the islands that eventually comprised venice itself it was said that there was a landward people looking towards the mainland and a seaward people looking towards the other islands the canals were at one time real boundaries the water between the small plots of land or parishes which would suffer more than ritual transgression many factions still clashed in fifteenth and sixteenthcentury venice the denizens of one parish might gather on a bridge and shout insults at the people of the rival parish the youth of a parish might even initiate rapid raids on the camp of a rival and throw sticks or stones at the natives the experience of living in such crowded conditions fostered an intense spirit of territorial loyalty it was said for example that the most partisan supporters of la guerra dei pugni were those who lived at or near the boundaries of their parish the battles were also a way of celebrating the role of bridges themselves in venetian communal life they were the very axis around which the city turned the city has always been an emblem of intense struggle of the battle for life and in the city in history lewis mumford alludes to a bloody ritual fight with clubs between the forces of light and darkness held within an egyptian temple precinct civilisation always retains elements of barbarism that is how it survives the essence of the city itself lies in competition and aggression a divine art there is an anecdote concerning tintoretto in the spring of one of the venetian guilds the scuola of s rocco ran a competition for the painting of their hall tintoretto and veronese were two of the contestants it was agreed that each artist should submit a design for the central ceiling panel of the room the artists went away and began work but tintoretto had no intention of sketching a design he obtained the measurements of the panel and began work at once upon a large canvas the artists gathered one morning with their designs ready for scrutiny but tintoretto had forestalled them he had brought the completed canvas to the hall a day or two before and by secret means had it fixed upon the ceiling where it was to be displayed he merely pointed upwards when asked for his design when the masters of the guild remonstrated with him he replied that the only way he could design an image was by painting it he added according to vasari that designs and models should always be after that fashion so as to deceive no one and that finally if they would not pay him for the work and his labour he would make them a present of it vasari concluded that the words of tintoretto had many contradictions but nevertheless the work is still in the same place the painting san rocco in glory is on the ceiling still the comments of his thwarted competitors are not reported although they are not likely to have been complimentary he had in essence played a trick on them the stories of vasari are not necessarily to be trusted but there is some documentary evidence to support this particular anecdote the records of the guild reveal that a competition between three or four of the most excellent painters in venice was announced on may but it was abandoned four weeks later when the guild accepted the finished painting of tintoretto he had completed this mighty canvas within a matter of days vasari was no doubt eager to reveal the somewhat devious tactics of tintoretto in obtaining the commission although it might be said that the artist was behaving in a manner perfectly understandable to any venetian merchant or shopkeeper he may have been prompted too by political machinations within the guild intrigue is always in the venetian air throughout his life tintoretto would be an adept and wily bargainer cutting his prices and changing his terms whenever the occasion demanded vasari was also intent upon disclosing the lack of diligence and of preparation on the artists part how could he possibly take up his brush without first preparing a design yet the anecdote also reveals the full force of tintorettos personality it reveals his restless and headlong resort to paint as the medium in which he revelled his figures sport like dolphins on the canvas a reflection of his own mastery and exuberance he was a controversial figure from his earliest youth another story places tintoretto in confrontation with titian tintoretto was for a short time apprentice to the older painter it is said according to family legend that titian came upon some figures drawn by him observing at once their facility and fearing for his own reputation titian ordered the young man to leave his studio it is an improbable account of jealousy but one of tintorettos sons spread it abroad after the death of his father it may reflect the essential tension between titians utterly expensive art created largely for foreign patrons and tintorettos more local and artisanal genius there is no doubt that the artists talents became quickly known he was born as jacopo robusti in the autumn of in venice and in that city he would live and die it owned his being he is a distinct example of the territorial imperative whereby the ground itself helps to shape him he is the most thoroughly venetian of all painters he was the son of a dyer of silks hence the name he gave himself as an artist he was happy to be known as the little dyer because it was a token of his relatively humble venetian origins he only left the city once in his life and then on a journey to mantua he insisted that his wife accompany him like other venetian artists he was a fervent amateur musician he painted stage sets and designed costumes for the theatres of the city his art cannot be understood without venice his great works are still to be found in the city his paintings were once to be seen in more than forty of the citys churches only in venice can his fieriness and extravagance be properly realised his art is venice in its purest and most spiritual form one contemporary reported that in his gestures expression movement of the eyes and in his words he is alert and quick in argument so his art embodied his person he had what stendhal called venetian liveliness to the utmost degree vasari called him hotheaded his speed of execution was known to everyone he could complete a painting in the same time as another artist might finish a sketch his was a vivacious and exuberant and impetuous art he was filled with divine fury with all the rage and energy of creation he was the lightning flash when some young flemish artists came to his studio they showed him certain drawings over which they had laboured for weeks he took up his brush and with three strokes of black paint created a figure he put in some white highlights and turned to his guests this he said is how we poor venetians paint our pictures it was the venetian way known throughout europe as prestezza the venetian painters too were known for the art of improvisation they were also known for their speed tiepolo said that he could finish a painting while other artists were still mixing their colours two centuries earlier vasari remarked that a work by tintoretto was finished before others thought it begun yet his was not entirely an improvised art he fashioned little models out of wax and placed them in tiny houses made out of wood and cardboard then he would suspend lights above and around them out of this toy theatre came his great creations filled with radiance and majesty saints hurtle through the air at enormous speed then they come to a halt suspended a few feet above the ground vistas of figures stretch into eternity light floods the dwelling place of mortals his figures are always in energetic movement quick and furious they whirl around some central pillar of light their limbs and muscles transfigured in centrifugal flight in his later work light does not follow structure it supersedes structure it becomes structure the world is dissolved in radiance drama was an essential element of venetian art canaletto was trained as a designer of theatrical sets tiepolo worked as a costume designer veronese built up his canvases on the model of the sixteenthcentury stage tintoretto himself worked instinctively and naturally caught up in the rush of inspiration which seems never to have flagged some have sensed in his pictures a certain anxietyan unease an insecurity in the perpetually whirling forms it is of a piece with his endless activity and prolificity he could never rest if this is so then it may coincide with the anxiety of venice in the sea and with its endless search for meaning in the wilderness of the world tintoretto once said that the further you go in the deeper is the sea in the late spring of at the age of seventyfive he died of a fever in a venetian collector wrote that there were more paintings in venice than in all the rest of italy painting ruskin said is the way that the venetians write can a graphologist of art therefore identify some salient characteristics in the wealth of venetian painting are there certain harmonies between one artist and another that can be plausibly credited to the nature and position of the city itself the way in which painting replaced painting in the ducal palace and in the churches of the city suggests that the art of venice was deemed by the authorities to possess an identifiable history and an independent unity it was capable of endless renewal without compromising its essential identity for venetians themselves there was such a thing as venetian art it was not the invention of art historians in the mosaics and in the sacred paintings of the fifteenth century for example there is a mingling of byzantine gothic and tuscan art that is uniquely venetian the city drew on the traditions from east and west throughout venetian history various styles and stylistic traits were mingled it was a port at which many called the art of venice in the thirteenth century was byzantine in inspiration the images of christ pantocrator of the virgin and of all the saints were painted on wooden panels burnished with gold at least one workshop in the city specialised in copying or faking early byzantine originals thus by imitation venetian art acquired an identity it had no other past the looting of constantinople in created the conditions for a byzantine revival in the chief city of the looters in previous centuries the art of venice had been provincial and stiffly medieval there was in fact no really important venetian work until the middle of the fifteenth century yet there were frequent byzantine revivals in the city most notably in the latter half of the fifteenth century when hostility to the cities of the mainland led to the rejection of the classical and the gothic venice wished to create an historical and cultural identity with the region of the upper adriatic where the byzantines had once held dominion the byzantine influence had emerged earlier in the first mosaics for the basilica of saint marks the earliest of them dated to the latter part of the eleventh century were the work of greek artists imported from byzantium by the beginning of the thirteenth century however there had emerged a distinctive venetian school of mosaic art the mosaic then became an essential element of venetian cultural identity it has been described as painting for eternity the materials do not fade or decay in demonstrably historical time mosaics reflect the venetians passion for surface and decorative pattern as elaborate as the lace of burano they embody their love for rich and hard material the smallest pieces or tesserae are cubes of gold or enamelled glass they possess the sensual pleasure of jewels and other glittering merchandise so dear to the imagination of a trading city mosaics fulfil the venetian desire for colour and detail even the later work in saint marks betrays no interest in the linear perspective of fourteenthcentury italian art perspective is a reminder of the fallen world pattern and colour are eternal the lesson was not lost on venetian painters who seemed to compete with the mosaicists in creating a glowing and richly tinted world the art of the mosaic was taught in venice long after it had fallen into disuse in other italian cities and indeed a school or establishment of professional mosaicists was organised as late as the shining glass and gold surfaces glow with the hieratic detail and brilliant colour of the icon but they also set up a play of light and shadow that is intrinsic to the venetian genius the glass was to hand in murano where the workshops were well known for the lucidezza or lucidity of their product when commynes came to venice in he noted on the walls of saint marks the curious work called musaique or marquetry the art also whereof they vaunt themselves to be authors of this typically venetian vaunt was of course without foundation but his comment suggests how odd and exotic the mosaic seemed to a foreign eye when thomas coryat came to venice in the early seventeenth century he remarked that i never saw any of this picturing before i came to venice so venice became associated with the art of mosaic the city was the focus the city was the arena for competition and display there is not a huge leap from the art of tintoretto to the art of tiepolo although they are separated by almost two centuries they are both recognisably venetian the city absorbed them the city gave them strength whereas the great artists of florencedonatello leonardo michelangeloseem unyielding and separate from their home city the artists of venice are at home and at ease with their birthright giorgione titian tintoretto and veronese were not attracted to the patronage of other cities or other courts they rarely if ever left the city on the lagoon giovanni bellini spent his entire life in the neighbourhood of castello titian hated leaving venice they seemed to be family men whereas the artists of florence tended to be single and of homosexual persuasion but there was also a larger continuity bellini is to be seen in the context of the work of his father jacopo bellini in turn giorgione learned from bellini and titian learned from giorgione tiepolo was called veronese redivivio it is perhaps a familiar pattern of influence and inheritance but one that takes place more fully and intensely in the small and relatively isolated city of venice the conservative bias of the citizens in all matters of social and political policy must also have had its effect upon the local artists the importance of tradition and authority was asserted on all occasions of public discourse if the mosaics in saint marks were faded they were replaced by exact replicas if the paintings in the ducal palace were damaged or destroyed they were replaced with images of the same historical or mythological scene all of the instincts of the venetian painter were to maintain or to learn from the past their methods of working were different from their respective contemporaries in other cities in venice artists were characteristically viewed as a particular kind of artisan in a city noted for its pragmatic tendencies theirs was a wholly practical training they were concerned with craft skills they were not considered heroic with the possible exception of titian they were not filled with the divine afflatus they were essentially servants of the state the painters belonged to a guild that was supervised by three magistrates alongside tintoretto and titian were signpainters and makers of playing cards painters were also expected to practise their expertise in other matters pertaining to the state they were hired as cartographers or as designers of festive banners and of shields they made their own tools like any other craftsman they considered their work in its material rather than its aesthetic guise they looked at a canvas as a carpenter might look at a wooden chest or a cobbler look at a pair of shoes in venice too there was much greater specialisation of trade than in other cities that again is part of the inheritance of the venetian merchant tradition the carvers of frames had their own guild while the gilders formed a column of the painters guild the goldsmiths often practised their art in consortium there were painters of furniture panels and painters of chests there were the ivory carvers their art first emanating from byzantium it was always a question of supply and demand painted organ shutters for example were a venetian speciality painting in any case is bound to be different in a city so attentive to the appetite for luxury goods luxury represents the love of the material world is that not the quality present in the paintings of bellini and of titian the imperatives of trade are to be seen in the replacement of wood by canvas as the preferred support for oil painting the supply of material was guaranteed by the presence of a thriving sail industry in any case the sea air rotted wood canvas was also easier to transport in a city and a lagoon notoriously difficult to navigate the line between aesthetic and economic preference is a fine one in venice of all cities it is hard to know which of them was predominant it is also worth noticing that the painters of venice turned to landscape at precisely the time of the citys colonisation of the mainland so the studio or workshop known as bottega of the venetian painters was created in response to the trading practices of the city tintoretto had one of the most efficient studios for example based upon the venetian instinct for familial ties his two sons were his assistants and they continued to turn out replicas of their fathers work long after his death in his will tintoretto left all of his property as far as appertains to my profession to the sons his wife was responsible for the finances and his daughter married a young man on the perfectly acceptable grounds that he had proved himself to be a good artist as she explained in her will if the said sebastian proved to be an able painter i should take him for my husband in this way by virtue of his talent the tintoretto name would be maintained indeed the tintoretto business lasted for more than a century and involved three generations in a city that was established upon the primacy of family too the artists followed precedent the sons of bellini were painters the studios of tiepolo and bassano veronese and zuccaro were family businesses they were clearly created on the pattern of the merchant families of the city in which trade was passed from father to son a man might become a painter for the simple reason that he was part of a painters family art was seen as a communal rather than an individual enterprise paintings were worked upon by many hands a master like bellini would provide drawings of heads as patterns that his apprentices could copy the same was true in other studios of figure and gesture in a city that had pioneered the model of the production line in the shipyards of the arsenal such enterprise is hardly surprising so it is that the workshops created the identity and unity of venetian painting from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries it was a distinct and distinctive venetian phenomenon there was nothing comparable in the other cities of italy art was preeminently a trade and a profitable one at that which may explain why artistic change was always slow in venice so by indirection we may be able to provide a rudimentary portrait of the venetian artist he or she there were female artists in venice was hardworking and energetic content to be a member of the larger community and happy to serve that community concerned not with aesthetic theory but with trading practice intent upon contracts and profits it is significant that not one venetian artist ever completed a treatise on painting in florence there were many such works it is not altogether surprising perhaps that the ordinary venetian seemed to know nothing whatever about art there was a great appetite for devotional pictures of course but little debate about the quality of such productions throughout the centuries there has been a general indifference to the more sublime work of the natives as wd howells put it in venetian life published in the middle of the nineteenth century as to art the venetians are insensible to it and ignorant of it i would as soon think of asking a fishs opinion of water as of asking a venetians notion of architecture or painting in the modern age of the biennale the same judgement may apply from the latter part of the fourteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century there were two dominant schools in the city one emphasised sensuous and decorative effects while the other relied upon narrative exposition the former encompassed the venetian love for opulent surface and gorgeous texture the latter served the venetian passion for scenic display yet through them both can be traced the same instinct for rhythmic grace the same flowing line when the venetian patrician pietro bembo described the venetian dialect as softer more imaginative more rapid and more alive than any other variant of italian he might have been referring to the brushwork of the venetian painters there is a sense of movement and of rhythmic display there has always been a certain sensuousness and voluptuousness in venetian art most clearly seen in the female nudes of titian planes and lines are supplanted by curves when manet travelled to venice he had decided to paint the scene of the annual regatta on the grand canal while sitting in a venetian café he told a friend and compatriot charles toche that there can be no sharp definition no linear structure in something that is all movement only tonal values which if correctly observed will constitute its true volume its essential underlying design this is also an interesting observation on the nature of venetian painting itself the instinct for narrative is in part the instinct for drama the venetian stage was well known for its machines and spectacles the public spaces of venice were the home for elaborate processions the earliest mosaics in the basilica of saint marks are driven by narrative and the first great narrative painting was executed by the school of paolo veneziano in the spring of in these early works human existence is seen as a series of communal events in that sense it is a public art in the narrative paintings there are always groups and crowds of people that would have been the experience of venice itself such art lends coherence and impressiveness to the public record it imparts significance to the diurnal life of the city when carpaccio for example depicted the occurrence of miracles in the streets and canals of the city his works were taken as proof positive that such events had in fact occurred the artists of the city were concerned with the glory of the city they were attuned to social rather than individual reality it is instructive that they did not suggest the content of the narrative cycles themselves but were content to fulfil the demands of the state if the state was not the patron then the commissions came from the many social and religious institutions of the city the patrician statesmen also wished to commemorate the role of their families in the increasing glory of the entire polity so there is not much selfcommuning in the art of venice this may help to explain the intense conservatism or rather the reliance on tradition in that art art was also a form of political life everything in venice has to do with politics and is enmeshed in the intricate network of power relations that linked state with guild and church public art for example can be an example of social control this is as true of sixteenthcentury venice as of the twentiethcentury soviet union in venice the essential notion is one of the underlying unity of the city in its customs and in its traditions the death of a doge made no difference to any of the artistic commissions then being completed the death of a prince in milan or the death of a pope in rome would have meant absolute rupture the paintings of the doges arrayed in solemn lines on the walls of the great council hall are themselves designed to represent calm continuity one to another and loyal impersonality they are images of stability they bear themselves and their robes of state well their lucid gaze is not troubled by hesitation or inward meditation venice was the first city to preserve images of its rulers not as individuals but as guardians and representatives of the city the painter of these state portraits was himself known as pittore di stato or state painter he also restored the paintings in the state collections designed the banners and stage machinery for the pageants and designed the mosaics for the basilica collectors often bequeathed their acquisitions to the city for the sake of la patria after two great fires in the s had partially destroyed the ducal palace a new programme of public art was instituted so complex was the symbolism and so significant the interpretation that in a book was published under the title of a declaration of all the histories contained in the paintings recently placed in the halls of the scrutinio and great council of the ducal palace the long title concludes with an adumbration of the most famous victories won over various nations of the world by the venetians if history is seen in sacred terms then historical paintings can become objects of devotion no less than the icon or the triptych they preempt critical enquiry in funerary monuments and in sacred paintings the doge is to be seen in the company of saintseven in the presence of the virgin and the crucified christ thus the city is blessed by divine favour and protection the myth of venice was therefore in pictorial terms endlessly being patched and redesigned in the work of giovanni bellini the image of the madonna and child in the landscape was in part a sacred representation of the domination of venice over the mainland more than a century later in the work of veronese the queen of the adriatic becomes the queen of heaven almost two centuries after that giambattista tiepolo was depicting the homage of neptune to venetia these images are all part of the same enterprise a social and political project deeply imbued in the work of the venetian artists we may seize upon the vigour and brilliance of venetian colour as a token of cultural splendour volumes have been written on the subject the painters of venice laid one colour over another they experimented with tonal harmonies lending the world of the painting vibrancy and movement it was an intuition about the nature of life it was also a form of thought when scarlet and green are joined then power is created in the world the words used to describe it are rich sumptuous glowing radiant that is why from the mids the venetians became pioneers and innovators in the use of oil paint the idea may have come from flanders but it reached its apotheosis in venice the venetian artists worked from light to dark colour building up layers of oil in which forms shimmered and dissolved with oils there came light the colours were said to participate one in another and to produce the effect of harmony the same might be said of the governance of venice itself vasari disapproved of the colorism of venice he noted that the artists worked immediately on canvas without making a drawing he elucidated the general venetian rule that painting only with the colours themselves without any other work of drawing on paper was the best and true method giorgione never drew at all it was in abstract terms the difference between disegno or drawing and colorito or colouring vasari considered disegno to be the father of art architecture and sculpture the venetians believed colorito to be the mother of painting they enjoyed the bliss of its warm and capacious embrace colour was soft and intimate and harmonious that is why venetian painting has often been associated with the depiction of the female nude the naked woman can be said to be the invention of the venetian artists of the sixteenth century willem de kooning once remarked that flesh was the reason that oil painting was invented it may not be accurate but it is suggestive where design was the product of intelligence and discipline colour was the token of emotion and sensory pleasure that is the setting in which english artists like william blake and joshua reynolds expressed their disapproval of venetian painting they couched their criticisms in moral rather than aesthetic terms there are certain consequences of this method it has been suggested that as a result the artists of venice were less concerned with the inner meaning of the world than with the variety of surfaces and textures there was no evident concern for ideality or profundity but what do these resonant terms mean in the context of paint and canvas as wilde said and pater intimated only superficial people do not judge by appearances venetian art is never learned or even historically accurate but instead elusive and evocative the emotion and passion of the venetian painters are to be found precisely in the revelation of the surface their profundity lies in the relationship between colours and tones are not colour and light and shade the happenstance of the eye as aretino said of titian he has the sense of things in his brush there is optimism and exuberance in the air there is a lightness of being manifest for example in the aerial figures of tiepolo who skim the empyrean uplifted by a wind of light it might be depicted as venetian gaiety with the knowledge that eternity is in love with the productions of time the constant refrain in vasaris account of titian is that the venetians work seems alive it captures the movement and the appearance of life it captures the effect of the transient moment it is ardent it has no sense of calculation or theory it irradiates and envelops the spectator so that it seems to acquire more than planar dimensions it becomes part of the world there may on occasions be a certain straining after effect that is the less pleasing aspect of the theatrical genius there seems in venetian art to be a taste for the extraordinary veronese and tiepolo were condemned by some for creating vast and exuberant stage sets there were also less than flattering comments upon the apparent gaudiness and overelaboration of venetian art it was noted that venetian painters liked to present what were almost inventories of goods of fabrics of ceramics of furnishings even of the latest fashions in dress they had a tradesmans eye they display tapestries and cloths and hangings like a hawker in a market we may speak in almost a literal sense of the richness of the surface even the beggars of tiepolo are sumptuously clothed joshua reynolds concluded that a mere elegance is their principal object as they seem more willing to dazzle than to affect with many venetian works painted with no other purpose than to be admired for their skill and expertness in the making of painting and to make a parade of that art yet what is venice but an endless parade the eternal feminine who is the woman on the balcony it is a familiar venetian motif in the paintings of the public ceremonies of venice the women are to be seen looking down at the processions from a myriad of balconies and terraces it is a sign not of their presence but of their seclusion they are in the prison of the home yet in this ambiguous territory of the open balcony half public and half sheltered there are other possibilities byron wrote in beppo i said that like a picture by giorgione venetian women were and so they are particularly seen from a balcony for beautys sometimes best set off afar the women are perhaps available therefore they are all the more alluring turner painted many venetian windows and balconies his jessica derived from the merchant of venice is seen at an open window the painting is accompanied by turners version of shakespeares text jessica shut the window i say the window is an opportunity for sexual display it is a way of showing off the goods the gaze is intrinsic to venice in marco polos account of social life in china he congratulates the young ladies of that country for their modesty they do not he wrote hang out at the windows scanning the faces of the passersby or exhibiting their own faces to them it is not hard to see the allusion here to his native city venice has been called a feminine city henry james noted that it is by living there from day to day that you feel the fullness of her charm that you invite her exquisite influence to sink into your spirit the creature varies like a nervous woman he then expatiates on the various moods of the city before reflecting on the fact that you desire to embrace it to caress it to possess it this from a man who is never likely to have possessed any real woman suggests the amount of displacement that venice can provoke it was considered to be licentious in action and attitude it was after all the city of touch the city of sight the city of texture it spoke openly to the senses it revealed itself the presence of water is also believed to encourage sensuality luxury the stock in trade of the city represents the apotheosis of sensuous pleasure the lovers of the world came and still come here it was known to be the capital of unlimited desire and unbridled indulgence this was considered to be an expression like its trade and its art of its power venetian conversation was known for its lubriciousness and its vulgarity the french poet guillaume apollinaire called venice le sexe même de leurope in poetry and drama venice was often portrayed as the beloved woman all the more charming for being constantly in peril it could be said in jungian terms that when the masculine identity of the city was lost at the time of its surrender to bonaparte in it became wholly the feminine city enjoyed by exiles and tourists from the nineteenth century onwards the journalism and literature of the last two centuries for example has included many representations of venice as a faded beauty it has been celebrated for its power to seduce the visitor to lure him or her into its uterine embrace the narrow and tortuous streets themselves conjured up images of erotic chase and surprise the city was invariably represented as a female symbol whether as the virgin in majesty or as venus rising from the sea it was stated in legend that venice was founded on march the feast of the annunciation and on that same day venus was in the ascendant the city was doubly blessed how could it not be invincible so venice was the city of venus the goddess was born from the sea she was intimately associated with the sea it was said that she was created by the white spume that neptune cast on the islands where the city arose implying the deep sexuality of the city within the lagoon for the traveller crossing the water from marco polo airport the city does seem to rise up miraculously from the waves it is one of the primal sights of the world the word venice conjures up venus within its syllables the naked venus was represented by the city without walls venus and venice are great queens james howell wrote in his survey of the signorie of venice with a further pun on quean or prostitute venus was queen of love and venice was queen of policy thus in the dunciad alexander pope apostrophises the city but chief her shrine where naked venus keepsand cupids ride the lyon of the deepswhere eased of fleets the adriatic mainwafts the smooth eunuch and enamourd swain but venice was also the city of the virgin images of the annunciation are to be found on the rialto bridge on the façade of saint marks and on the walls of the ducal palace as well as diverse other places in the city the worship of the virgin entailed even demanded the glorification of the state the endurance of the republic was another proof of its divine origin like the virgin herself it had been taken out of time that is perhaps still its condition in the paintings of mary swooning before gabriel executed by tintoretto and titian as well as by a host of lesser venetian artists the virgin is portrayed as a venetian maiden in a typically venetian house the cult of mary penetrated every aspect of venetian society the doge attended mass at saint marks according to a sixteenthcentury chronicler on all the days of our lady there were processions and festivals like that of the twelve marys which culminated in the ritual journey of twelve statues along the grand canal the celebrations lasted for eight days there were more than three hundred altars in the fifteenth century devoted to the worship of the virgin in the church of s maria gloriosa there were no less than eight separate altars dedicated to her the famous nikopeia a byzantine icon of the virgin supposed to have been painted by saint luke himself was carried in state around saint marks square on the feast of the assumption this relic became the palladium of the republic its safeguard and defence and is still to be found in the basilica of saint marks it was also a source of prophesying it was said that if anyone wanted to know if a friend was alive or dead it was only necessary to place a lighted candle before the image if the friend was alive the candle could not be put out by any wind but if the friend was dead its flame would be extinguished by the merest breath or sigh venice was the virgin too because she had never been assaulted she was inviolate and immaculate protected by the waves of the sea like a precious girdle mary is peace peace is stability james howell in his instructions and directions for forren travell declared of venice that this beautious maid hath bin often attempted to be vitiated som have courted her som bribd her som would have forcd her yet she hath still preservd her chastity intire no other city had remained so pure for so long the coronation of the virgin in heaven by christ was then employed in painting and poetry as the victorious image of venice the queen of heaven is also the queen of the sea like the dawn fair as the moon bright as the sun terrible as an army with banners as late as fiftyone years before the republic was destroyed a venetian friar fra francesco could utter a prayer to the divine protrectress o great virgin look down upon this city which you have elected here on earth as the principal object of your maternal love hers was a popular devotion there were many shrines on the corners of the calli with a votive lamp burning before the virgin these were maintained by the people of the immediate neighbourhood there was not a venetian home however humble without its picture of the virgin there were artists who did nothing else but execute cheap images of the madonna known disparagingly as madonnieri they were however only following in the tradition of bellini when the bells rang for the enunciation of the prayer ave maria the venetians would fall down on their knees in the streets and squares images of the madonna were venerated as the workers of miracles one icon in a niche on the exterior of an old house in the parish of s marina was believed to possess powers of healing votive lamps candles and flowers were piled before it in ever greater profusion and the crush of worshippers in the narrow street became so great that the statue had to be removed to an inner courtyard on the site was erected the splendid jewel box of a church named s maria dei miracoli one evangelical englishman of the early seventeenth century william bedell wrote of the multitude of idolatrous statues pictures reliquies in every corner not of their churches onely but houses chambers shoppes yea the very streets the sea it self is not free they are in the shipps boates and watermarks the virgin was also the archetypal mother in whose capacious embrace the sons and daughters of venice could rest in venetian folk songs the city is depicted as the mother the mother is such a formidable figure in the venetian imagination that there may be other and more remote forces at work is it possible that the venetians yearned for the mother because their city was not built on the soil mother earth did not bear it or rear it in jungian theory the mother represents the place of origin but in a sense venice had no place of origin the mother also represents aspects of life and consciousness for which the venetians longed materiality and sensuousness among them could the art and culture of the city therefore be a form of recompense for a motherless state and then as living proof of the efficacy of virgin love there emerged in the sixteenth century a mysterious woman who became known in fact and legend as the virgin of venice she appeared from nowhere she began cooking for hundreds of homeless people every day in one of the public squares she begged from the rich to feed the poor and such was the force of her example that a permanent institution was found for the dispossessed named the ospedaletto dei derelitti she uttered prophecies concerning venice the first of which began with the declaration that the beginning of the reformation of the world will take place in venice she called both herself and the city jerusalema ponentina and as a result in sixteenthcentury literature venice became known as the new jerusalem the artificial city was also the archetypal city michael kelly an irish tenor who lived in venice a century earlier than henry james declared that the city was the paradise of women and the venetian woman worthy of a paradise note that for him it is a paradise of rather than for women mrs thrale in the same century remarked more astringently of the venetian woman that the government knows every pin she wears and where to find her at any moment of the day or night this sense of watchfulness and of close scrutiny is part of the truth the patrician women stayed out of sight they appeared in public only on ritual occasions and if they ever did stray from home they were accompanied by servants they always wore veils theirs was an almost eastern seclusion the women of the middle and lower classes possessed considerably more freedom of movement peasant women brought their produce to market and the middling sort to use an ancient phrase often worked in their husbands shops or studios women are listed in the public records as linenmakers bakers spicesellers and cobblers it was often said that venetian females were stronger and hardier than the males a venetian wife was not considered legally to be part of her husbands family she remained within the family of her father marriages were arranged between families rather than between individuals in public documents the woman was known only in relation to her father or her husband there were more severe restrictions in a statute of the fifteenth century adultery on the womans part sometimes merited the death penalty yet legal convention is not everything it was widely reported that venetian women commanded much authority at home it is clear from testamentary bequests that after the death of husbands or fathers women of the upper and middle classes could often accumulate great wealth there were also institutions such as the singing schools that consolidated the female presence in the city the female servants or concubines of the venetian priests often became the matriarchs of the local church ministering to the community there were also wise women and healers known in every neighbourhood in such a superstitious place as venice they were fully employed there were many other social ties between women the patrician females in one district for example might act as patrons to younger and poorer girls the plays of goldoni and the memoirs of venetian citizens reveal a closeknit parish community of servants neighbours and friends who would stand on the thresholds of their houses or cluster around the wellhead to exchange news and gossip there was not the sense of privacy that obtained in england or in northern europe if a husband was beating his wife unduly or unjustly according to the standards of the time he would become the target for abuse and even prosecution in venice it was the society that determined individual behaviour the parish was essentially the female preserve in a male city where the public areas were dominated by men the private and domestic spaces were the realm of women the parish was the place where they bartered bought and sold exchanged services this arrangement satisfied all parties and to a large extent maintained and consolidated the famous harmony of venetian society yet women had one crucial advantage on marriage they brought their dowries with them there was always a dowry it was the central feature of marital negotiation in the marriages of the working people as well as of the nobles and merchants one old venetian song asks the question how many merchants got their start with dowries they were paid yet although the dowries were in the control of the husband during his lifetime they were returned at his death to the wife to manage as she pleased most females became brides at the age of fourteen or fifteen their spouses tended to be twentynine or thirty since the women were younger they were likely to live longer some women became very rich so even if they were invisible they were still influential the more astute mothers used that wealth to increase the dowries of their own daughters thus augmenting their eligibility by the late fourteenth century in fact there was a phenomenon in venice known as dowry inflation the expenses and the rewards of a marriage were so great that only one girl in the family could be exchanged and only one male in the family could reap the rich harvest as a result there was in the city a huge store of unmarried men and women the men lived with their families and the women characteristically were consigned to convents herodotus wrote in the fifth century bc that the tribes of the veneti were accustomed to sell their daughters at an open auction to the highest bidder as late as the tenth century ad there are reports of annual matrimonial fairs in venice itself conducted on the feast day of saint mark april at s pietro di castello where the young girls came holding their dowries it is an example of a persistent venetian tradition continued by other means in a city of markets unmarried women were the ultimate commodity the merchandise of female flesh and money was exchanged for increase in nobility or political power it was essentially a transfer from visible to invisible assets when the newly married bride went in procession to her marital home it was a way of making the exchange public and accountable it represented the free circulation of capital through the body politic since the goods could be easily damaged young girls were often placed in convents for a time the nunneries were a kind of warehouse on the day for the signing of the marriage contract in the families of the patricians the bridegroom repaired to the house of his prospective fatherinlaw when the groom and his friends were all gathered the young girl dressed according to convention in white gown and brilliant jewels was paraded twice in a circle to the sound of fifes and trumpets then she proceeded into the courtyard was greeted by all her female kin and by means of a gondola was transported to all the convents where her relations were immured the brides gondoliers were obliged to wear scarlet stockings behind the walls of the convents the young girl was shown to the nuns who may have had mixed feelings about the matter on the dawn of the marriage day a small orchestra would play outside the brides house as she prepared herself for the procession to the parish church after the marriage ceremony itself there was a public feast to which all the guests brought presents in the marriages of the other classes there were customs no less rigorous the aspiring groom would wear velvet or broadcloth he would wear a dagger on his girdle and he would be elaborately coiffed and perfumed he first declared his love by singing under the window of the beloved at a later date he would relay a formal request to the family if he was judged suitable the two families would meet at dinner and the two parties would exchange gifts of handkerchiefs and almond cakes there was then a sequence of gifts carefully regulated according to convention and superstition at christmas the man gave to the woman a confettura of fruit and a raw mustardseed and on the feastday of saint mark a buttonhole of rosebuds other gifts were given and received there were prohibitions no combs were to be exchanged because they were the instruments of witches scissors were also prohibited because they were a symbol of a cutting tongue the pictures of saints curiously enough were forbidden they were considered to be an evil augury the marriage day was always a sunday the other days deemed for a variety of reasons unfortunate the brides family was supposed to furnish the bedroom of the newly married couple according to custom it had to contain a bed of walnut wood six chairs two chests of drawers and a looking glass walnut was the only permissible wood it is an example of the stolid conservatism of the people no race had a smaller propensity for social or political revolution in this city therefore married life was not necessarily a pleasure it was a solemn social and familial duty perhaps that is the source of the venetian proverb that marriage comes from love in the way that vinegar comes from wine the relative anonymity of women in venetian society is confirmed by the paucity of female portraiture tintoretto completed portraits of men and only of women there are surviving portraits of men painted by titian with only of women titian also left the women out of the family group portraits upon funerary monuments this is not simply the consequence of a patriarchal society there are plenty of examples of female portraiture in florence for example this erasure of women from the public record is distinctively venetian it has to do with the authority invested in the state rather than in the individual it has to do with the concept of restraint and control characteristically seen as male virtues that is why there are many female nudes and far fewer women in full dress the woman was considered to be the subject of sensuousness and delight rather than of serious attention the women who do emerge on venetian canvas are in any case almost always anonymous they may not even be venetian so we have the paradox of the innumerable studies of the virgin alongside the dearth of real women and that may be the key the image of the woman was idealised and sacred it was not to be sullied by studies of the female in time when the wives of the merchants or richer shopkeepers did become visible they were the subject of much comment in the late fifteenth century pietro casola noted that the women of venice do their utmost particularly the bestlooking to show their bosoms when you view them you become astonished that their clothes do not fall from their backs he also observed the fact that they neglect no artifice to improve their appearance in fynes morrison described them as tall with wood fat with ragges red with paint and white with chalke the wood was that of large platform shoes in an unnatural city therefore they were the image of unnaturalness in the city of trade fashion was a large element of consumption in venice female fashions changed faster than anywhere else in italy for many travellers venice was a vast openair brothel the flesh shambles of europe as one visitor put it even boccaccio writing in the decameron which is not dainty declared that the city was the common receptacle for all sorts of wickedness roger ascham two centuries later said that he saw in nine days more libertie to sinne than i ever heard tell of in our noble citie of london in nine yeare it was remarked that the young men who went on the grand tour to venice invariably returned with the present of syphilis to bequeath to future wives and children venice had no famous lovers only famous roués and courtesans in the early seventeenth century thomas coryat estimated the number of prostitutes to be twenty thousand whereof many are esteemed so loose that they are said to open their quivers to every arrow it sounds like the overestimate of an outraged moralist but the figure may not be so inflated a century before a venetian chronicler marino sanudo estimated the number at a great deal can happen in a hundred years especially in a city that grew increasingly notorious for its incidence of lust and libertinism sanudos figure is also to be placed in the context of a population in the early sixteenth century of one hundred thousand on this evidence approximately one in five venetian women was a prostitute it was reported that venetian men preferred prostitutes to their wives one explanation for their ubiquity may rest in the large proportion of unmarried patricians fornication according to fynes morrison in the late sixteenth century was esteemed a small sinne and easily remitted by confessors saint nicholas was the patron saint both of sailors and of prostitutes the two indispensable venetian trades there were certain areas devoted to venality there were brothels in certain favoured streets some thirty or forty streets altogether with a fair selection of them in the area of the city known as castelletto in one house thirteen prostitutes shared an apartment the main centre was from the fifteenth century the campo s cassiano known as carampane close to the inns and hostels of the rialto saint marks square itself was used as a meat market by venetian mothersevery mother a french traveller of the seventeenth century put it that is willing to be rid of her daughter carries her thither every day as to a market nor are you obligd to buy a pig in a poke for you may view and handle her as much as you will in the memoirs of casanova there is an account of just such a transaction casanova met a mother and daughter in a coffee house where on understanding his intentions the mother asked for money her daughter was not to lose her virginity without making a good profit out of it casanova offered ten sequins for her maidenhood but wanted to assure himself first that he was not being swindled and this in his inimitable manner he proceeded to do this was an everyday story of venetian folk the genteel courtesan or honest courtesan was a venetian speciality she was not to be confused with the common prostitute or meretrice she was deemed to be a free woman cultivated and refined coryat who had become something of an expert in the flesh trade described the courtesan as decked with many chaines of gold and orient pearles like a second cleopatra but they are very little divers gold rings beautified with diamonds and other costly stones jewels in both her eares of great worth he recommended that travellers carry with them a herb called moly or ulysses herb a type of garlic to ward off her attractions but the merits of the courtesan were not merely carnal she was disposed to intellectual conversation to repartee and to poetry she was considered to be the embodiment of the renaissance ideal of sensuality leading to the salon if not to sublimity she also became the embodiment of a new type of woman and a new form of female consciousness the courtesans of venice were significant figures achieving a social and even intellectual dominance that other women could not equal that is why they became notorious all over the european world if venice is indeed a female city then it is best represented by the courtesan sexuality also led to the painters studio the status of the unnamed women in venetian paintings is not at all certainalthough it must be the presumption for example that titians nudes were indeed courtesans images of the repentant whore mary magdalen may also have been based upon living originals the ambassador of ferrara in venice revealed in a letter to his sovereign that i suspect that the girls whom he often paints in different poses arouse his desires which he then satisfies more than his limited strength permits the city was a market in most commodities so why not in the human body you had to be able to see what you were purchasing by the light of a candle according to one venetian proverb you do not judge women or paintings a false mole placed by the nose indicated insatiability in the cleft of the chin it signified an adventuress the state itself condoned and encouraged these venereal practices the prostitutes of the city had their own guild and they traded under the auspices of the department of public health the reasons for this toleration have more to do with money than with morals the tax revenues from the earnings of prostitution were reputed to be worth twelve warships for the protection of the state the prostitutes also encouraged what might be now called the tourist trade the adult males would spend money on other commodities thus increasing the general prosperity of the city in the process the women helped to parade the famous liberty of venice they became part of the myth of venice when othello says to desdemona i took you for that cunning whore of venice everyone in the audience would understand the allusion there were other social forces at work it was argued that the presence of prostitutes meant that the more respectable women of the city were safer and purer it was suggested too that the ready availability of women was a means of preserving order among the lower classes they were also considered to be a guard against homosexuality in the fifteenth century in a period of sodomitical excess the prostitutes of the city were ordered to bare their breasts as they leaned out of the windows some of them however decided to dress as young men the city was thereby also known as a centre of homosexuality and of homosexual prostitution it was considered by many to be an eastern vice and of course venice was deeply indebted to eastern culture it was believed that the men of venice were in the words of one eighteenthcentury critic enervated and emasculated by the softness of the italian musick the tenderness and luxuriance of the city were considered to be corrupting but there was also the ambiguous status of land and water of frontier and mainland anyone of weak sensibility might thereby be aroused or stimulated into transgressing ordinary boundaries the love of boys is reflected in thomas manns death in venice where the elderly aschenbach is lured to his death by the sight of tadzio in the course of this novella mann hits the perfect note to depict the sensuous genius of the city our adventurer felt his senses wooed by this voluptuousness of sight and sound tasted his secret knowledge that the city sickened and hid its sickness for love of gain and bent an ever more unbridled leer on the gondola that glided before him venice appeals to those of ambiguous sexualityproust james baron corvo diaghilev and many others as the french writer paul morand put it in venises in venice homosexuality was nothing more than the most subtle of the fine arts in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries however it was the most feared and punished of all sex crimes the shops of apothecaries and pastrymakers were denounced as centres of this criminal activity the porticoes of certain churches and the schools of gymnastics were also considered to be dangerous venice was full of dark passageways in any case where sodom might rise again it was believed that homosexuality might engulf the city it was believed that it was against nature and natural law but then was not this also the case of venice itself the city in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was being characterised as a whore it was known for its apparent decadence and for its mercantile greed the queen of the sea was transmogrified into the whore of the adriatic just as byzantium was once derided as the whore of the bosphorus there seems to be something deeply troubling about cities of luxury and of sensation in sixteenthcentury london there was a brothel known simply as venice the city was a decrepit courtesan sporting its baubles of gold the futurist marinetti described it at the beginning of the twentieth century as steeped in exotic lewdness the english poet rupert brooke depicted it in a tawdry and sensual middleage it was perhaps inevitable a place that continually asserts that it is a sacred centre a city of the virgin mary will inevitably incur disgrace and disillusion that reputation has since changed for the better is it a matter of degradation that venice has become a museum city there is no reason to believe so the pervasiveness or at least the acceptance of prostitution may have led to a change in public morals by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries at least there was a perceptibly more indulgent culture when the women of venice wore their dresses so low that their breasts were exposed they may have been copying the example of their frailer sisters the discipline of venice essential to its early survival had relaxed in particular the presence of the confidant or lover the cicisbeo became noticeable in patrician circles he became the intimate partner of the married woman he rather than her husband escorted her to festivities or sat with her in the opera box he dined with her and travelled with her he became her devoted servant there was no remonstrance from the patrician husband in fact the husband encouraged such a liaison a wife without a gallant would lose prestige certain marriage contracts stipulated their presence in the household the relationship may not have been a sexual one it is possible that many of the cicisbei were in fact homosexual but it was a sign that the desires of women were not altogether ignored the sensuousness of the women of venice was the stuff of travellers tales the women kiss better than those of any other nation byron wrote which is notorious and is attributed to the worship of images and the early habit of osculation induced thereby so romanist piety is associated with profligacy this was nowhere more evident than in the reputation of venetian nuns in there were two and a half thousand nuns in venice that figure rose or fell a little over the centuries but it is good as an approximation a century later for example there were three thousand nuns scattered across thirtythree convents in the city and seventeen in the lagoon one of the reasons for these cowled and huddled women was the tendency of patrician families to place their unmarried daughters in captivity over per cent of the patrician women of venice ended in a convent in theory they represented the purity and inviolability of the ruling class but the outward appearance was deceptive one seventeenthcentury venetian nun arcangela tarabotti wrote that nuns were created for reason of state too many dowries in other words would impoverish the ruling class the young women were sacrificed for money their enforced seclusion also enhanced the financial status of the marriageable females the cult of the virgin sanctified what was essentially a commercial exchange assuring the exclusivity of the ruling class religion was a good investment at the beginning of the senate declared that the nuns of the republic were collected and preserved in those sacred sites as in a safedeposit there is in any case something typically venetian in the creation of these little prisons or little islands of unmarried females within the city the ideal life in the city of the lagoon was one of enforced community convent life was itself modelled upon the constitution of the state with a mixture of ruling powers including the abbess and a group of elders or mothers of advice abbesses like doges were elected age and money were venerated on the wall of one convent is inscribed the homily hope and love keep us in this pleasant prison it might have been the motto of the venetian citizens the lives of the more saintly nuns were recorded in the annals of the city in contemporary testimonies collected in such pious volumes as the necrology of corpus domini there are many references to holy lives and deaths there are references to pure virgins and the purest virgins whose demise is accompanied by visions and miracles virginity was a venetian obsession one of the enduring laments of the nuns on their deathbeds was the wish to be released from this prison the prison is of course the prison of this life but the wish is all the more heartfelt for issuing from the city of venice for other nuns the aura of pure virginity had evaporated long since some in fact earned a secondary living as prostitutes or courtesans one english traveller of the mideighteenth century reported of the nuns that their convents are light the parlours of more extent and more open the ladies have a gay air fresher complexions and a great deal of freedom in their behaviour and manner of talking i need not add what is said of some greater liberties of the venetian nuns when officers were despatched to close down the convent of s zaccaria in the summer of the nuns stoned them from the walls until they were forced to retreat there were reports of fist fights between the sisters an abbess and a sister duelled with daggers over the sexual favours of one gentleman at times of carnival the nuns dressed up as men one of them was known for having ten lovers on receipt of an expensive papal dispensation the more fortunate among them were allowed to go on leave for weeks or even months at a time placards were put outside the gates of the convent forbidding all games noises tumults speaking obscene words committing improper acts fouling the ground yet what was to be expected in a society where most of the nuns were confined against their will they were filled with resentment and with jealousy arcangela tarabotti claimed that venetian convents represent a theatre where the darkest tragedies are performed everything is vanity perspective and shadow deceiving the eye it is remarkable how all forms of venetian life were at one time or another denounced or celebrated as theatre a diarist of the first years of the sixteenth century girolamo priuli castigated the nuns as public prostitutes and the convents as public whorehouses fifteen or more were nothing less than bordellos it was a common theme a franciscan preaching in the basilica of saint marks in declared that whenever a foreign gentleman comes to this city they show him the nunneries scarcely nunneries at all in fact but brothels and public bordellos to announce this fact from the pulpit suggests that it was recognised very widely indeed the nuns of the convertite convent in the middle of the sixteenth century were receiving gentlemen behind the walls their father confessor was also their pimp the male customers often dressed as nuns in order to escape detection in his memoirs casanova reports that he was offered the abbess of the convent of the virgins for one hundred sequins there seems to have been some deep consonance in the public imagination between the nun and the prostitute certain brothels were organised on the model of the convent the madam was known as the abbess and the women were called sisters their behaviour just as severely restricted as any female taking the veil prostitutes were known to frequent convents and discourse with the nuns very freely there was a camaraderie between them established perhaps on their curious status within the venetian community both nuns and prostitutes were unkept without spouses or families they might merit the description of temple prostitutes well known in the ancient world in the modern world venice was their proper home what to eat it is a truth universally stated that the food of venice was and is not of the highest italian quality the venetians are wretched cooks an englishwoman wrote in jan morris one of the most perceptive observers of venetian life remarked two centuries later that venetian cooking is undistinguished the cuisine is to say the least limited yet this may be the fate of all small islands the food of corsica and malta for example is well known for its poverty there can be no doubt about the quantity if not the quality of food in the city travellers noted the abundance of bread of fruit of vegetables and of fish thomas coryat in the early seventeenth century remarked upon the marveilous affluence and exuberancy of all things tending to the sustenation of mans life in venice he went on to describe the grapes peares apples plummes apricockes figges most excellent of three or foure sorts the banqueting scenes of venetian painting particularly in the work of veronese and tintoretto are well known for their munificence there are endless last suppers in the venetian canon tintoretto himself painted six of them here at least in idealised form is the epitome of what coryat called sustenation the triumph of food represents the triumph of trade and of commerce it can also be construed as the triumph of empire with the colonies of venice being obliged to provide comestibles to their mother in a city obsessed by show and the lure of the market the colour of food was also important oysters were gilded saffron was indispensable in the kitchen as well as in the painters studio yet all was not as it seemed one fifteenthcentury observer canon casola remarked that although there was much fish in venice he never saw a fine one nor ate a good one there were fish everywhere of course but the fish in the canals were never eaten it would be like eating rats the venetians were in any case considered to be an abstemious people easily pleased with plain fare there was in the nineteenth century a typical venetian invitation to dinner venga a mangiar quattro risi con me come and eat four grains of rice with me they never gorged they were rarely if ever incapacitated by drink there was also a social as well as a dietary principle at work in venetian temperance to be drunk was to embarrass the whole city whereas in paris or in london drunkenness was considered to be a necessary fact of life reaping no dishonour the tight community of venice exacted its own particular control over the appetites of its citizens the patrician diet through the centuries was solid and unadventurous consisting of meat and vegetables such as cabbage and turnip as well as fruit and cheese the patricians had a fondness however for chocolate and ices these may be classed as luxury items in a city of luxury goods there were other forms of culinary display the patricians of venice were the first people in the world to use forks and glassware sauces were often sweet and cloying but there was also a propensity for vinegar and other sharp ingredients it is pertinent that the venetians had a monopoly on the salt and sugar trades throughout europe the people had their circuses but they also needed their bread it was one way of forestalling civic unrest for in the words of one venetian saying if your mouth is full you cant say no many households possessed bread ovens the government kept large stocks of millet in case of scarcity but it was not much liked its only virtue was its capacity for long storage maize was introduced on terra firma in it was a success the venetians according to fynes morrison spend much on bread and oyle and the very porters feede on most pure white bread i never remember to have seen brown bread bread and wine were the only items about which the venetians could be considered connoisseurs white bread was a necessity of life there was also the food of the poor the ubiquitous polenta consisting of white cornmeal mixed with water it was and is still a dull and unappetising meal rice was introduced in the s thus creating the first dish of risotto when the bell rang to summon workers to their midday meal the general fare was fish bread and fruit with the occasional helping of pork or poultry pumpkin and melon were sold by the slice the labouring people were inclined towards raw fruit and vegetables disdained by the more refined elements of the population raw food was considered to be bad for the health on the venetian mainland beans and rye were the typical foodstuffs of the poor it is claimed that such a diet kept the peasants weak and compliant the venetians had a proverb to the effect that god would take water away from the man who did not like wine there was a large variety of wines in venice throughout its history although by the sixteenth century much of it came from the venetian colonies of crete and cyprus yet foreign observers tended to be dismissive of the quality of venetian wine in general one of them comparing it to vinegar and water that cannot be said of the champagne of venice known as prosecco from a white grape grown in the veneto region venetians were and still are generally content with a small glass of white or red wine known as ombra taken with modest quantities of cheese or green olives it is an ancient drink its name meaning shade it refers to a custom of the late fourteenth century when winesellers of saint marks square moved their stalls out of the sun into the shadow of the campanile it was a way of attracting custom venice has always been more famous for its cafés than for its restaurants in the eighteenth century they were calculated to number two hundred with thirtyfive in saint marks square itself venice was in fact one of the first cities in europe to favour coffee which was borrowed from the turks of constantinople patrician ladies had a favourite café as did their husbands government secretaries frequented another establishment and as in london there were coffee shops for all the various occupations of the city the most celebrated of them florians opened its doors in under the name of venice triumphant and has been doing business ever since the venetians seemed to favour entertaining out of doors with cups of coffee and cups of chocolate with glasses of lemonade and syrup the people could also sit and drink in the barbers shop or the bookshop the shops of apothecaries or pharmacists were also popular for the exchange of gossip and news the city was constantly watching and talking about itself there were taverns and wineshops or malvasie for nobles and merchants gondoliers and workmen in the morning they were the haunts of those coming for a small glass of wine in the evening they became the eating places of the poorer people they could also act as pawndealerships and gambling dens the government was always suspicious of even moderate gatherings of people fearing subversion of the state and spies were employed in the more famous taverns and hotels such as the black eagle and the white lion the senate also legislated to reduce the size of such places as a result there were many that could only hold five or six customers at any one time the casks of wine were stacked at the back while above them was placed an image of the virgin with its everrenewed light ix sacred city divine and infernal venice was the gate of heaven at a time of religious crisis in the middle of the sixteenth century a cleric wrote that christ was about to return to italy and i believe venice will be the door the ranks of the rulers and the judges of venice were compared to the numbers and dominions of angels and archangels it was the nature of the city to inspire its citizens with the aeterna beatitudo quae in visione dei consistit the eternal happiness which lies in the vision of the godhead this is the context for tintorettos great vision of paradise in the ducal palace it was proclaimed if not believed that the constitution and laws of the city had been sent by god the success and expansion of the venetian empire were then seen as the workingout of divine providence in the world of time the very survival of a city upon the waters was a miracle the venetians themselves referred to their home as our holy earth or as the holy city in the venetian writer francesco sansovino declared that venice was revered by everyone as a sacred thing on earth to be worshipped were this possible it was not permissible of course it might have provoked comparison with the israelites worshipping the golden calf one of the favourite subjects of venetian painting yet it was not altogether a novel doctrine in the ancient religion of mesopotamia for example the city was considered to be the essence of the divine it need hardly be added that such worship encourages despotism and authoritarianism on a very grand scale that is why the identity of church and state in venice was so powerful it allowed the governors of venice to maintain their distance from the jurisdiction of rome and the roman pontiff the doge was the pope of venice and the senators his cardinals on palm sunday the doge released white doves from the doorway of saint marks in commemoration of the arks coming to rest after the flood it was an invocation of the citys own rescue from the waves but was it a religious rather than a political ritual the distinction in venetian culture did not apply it was an accident of geography perhaps that this was the city from which the pilgrims sailed to the holy land the pilgrims came to venice to purchase supplies and provisions for the long voyage and slowly the city itself was seen to be an integral part of their holy journey they participated in all the sacred rituals of the venetian church they worshipped at the same oratories and chapels they venerated the same icons the shrine of saint mark attracted many thousands and hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors the tomb smelled of spices the venetian trade the intimate association between venice and the east also helped to convey the image of the city as part of the holy land an intimation or glimpse of the divine worthy of pilgrimage in its own right the city was a sacred space containing many intimations of the spiritual world there were innumerable images of the saints as well as the virgin in its dark passageways the candles or lamps in front of them created a luminous area banishing vice and crime there were more than five hundred street shrines or capitelli but their purpose was political as well as religious they were a means of curbing disorder among the people the virgin would not look kindly down upon civic unrest the archangel michael guards the southwest corner of the ducal palace with his drawn sword the landscape of the city is dominated by bell towers ringing out holy holy holy the churches of venice like the convents and monasteries were all carefully sited the church of s maria dei miracoli for example is placed on the frontiers of the two northern districts of cannaregio and castello one of the oldest churches in venice that of s giacomo is situated at the very centre of the rialto market it was here that commercial contracts were signed machiavelli wrote that we italians are corrupt and irreligious beyond all others that was not true of the venetians they were corrupt and religious where there is the divine there is always the infernal one cannot exist without the other there were many folk stories of the devil walking confidently over the bridges and along the calli of the city he was reported to have taunted the mason working on the rialto bridge for example with the claim that no one could build so wide an arch of stone he offered to perform the work in exchange for the soul of the first person who crossed the bridge it turned out to be the masons infant son venice was a sacred text to be read and meditated in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the city was first seen as a totality to be carefully structured it had survived by the exercise of the divine will and now had to be sculptured the body of saint mark supposedly preserved in the basilica was the central point of the configuration between the ducal palace the market and the arsenal this was the sacred geometry of venetian power it is noticeable in venetian painting that the miracles of the scriptures often take place in a venetian setting for tintoretto the events of the new testament were seen as an aspect of familiar venetian life in a manual of devotion written for young venetian girls the garden of prayer the author instructs his readers to take a city that is well known to you hold in your mind the principal places where the episodes of the passion would have taken place so the agonies of christ were to be pictured along the calli and within the campi of la serenissima it was itself a city of miracles no city in europe with the possible exception of rome has witnessed so many every parish had its own sacred events the compiler of the cronica venetiarum writing in the middle of the fourteenth century describes miracles and portents in the same spirit of verisimilitude as more mundane events and actions miracles were announced with impressive frequency by the authorities of the city it was another way of reaffirming its sacred destiny an angel rescued a workman falling from the scaffolding around the basilica of saint marks a holy virgin walked across the water of the grand canal a slave was rescued from condign punishment in saint marks square by saint mark himself the same saint together with his brothers in christ nicholas and george exorcised demons threatening the city with flood miraculous events became particularly common in the s just after the end of the turkish wars in which venice lost its domination of the mediterranean in these miracles the virgin became the agent of divine intervention thus in theory restoring the status of venice as queen of the sea carpaccio painted miracle of the relic of the true cross on the rialto bridge when a lunatic was healed by the presence of the relic there was the miracle at s lio in the early years of the fifteenth century when in the parish of that name a holy relic would not be associated with the funeral of a wicked man it grew so heavy that it could not be carried over the threshold of the church giovanni mansueti completed a painting of the event in it is still possible to recognise the site and certain of the larger houses in that is another venetian miracle the sacred sites of venice can be enumerated the first of them by common consent must be the basilica it is the umbilicus the central point the core it is the place where the divine and human meet in the beginning there had been another church on this site dedicated to saint theodore but when the supposed body of saint mark arrived in the lagoons everything changed as soon as the relics arrived in a church with a wooden roof or dome was raised on the model of the church of the holy apostles in constantinople the church was largely destroyed by fire in but was subsequently restored the final reconstruction vaulted and built in brick assuming the shape of the basilica still before us was undertaken in the second half of the eleventh century the fact that it was based upon a model already five hundred years old was a material blessing it emphasised the supposed antiquity of the venetian religious tradition the city had no true religious history of its own so it borrowed or adapted what it saw the undulating pavement of the basilica for example was not an accident or a mistake it was deliberately modelled on the floor of the church of s giovanni evangelista in ravenna built in the fifth century the pavement was to rise and fall as if agitated by winds and to present the likeness of a storm it was supposed to invoke the position of venice upon perilous waters in the thirteenth century a programme of mosaics was formally introduced taking their example from the church of the holy apostles but introducing specifically venetian motifs these in turn were erased restored only in the seventeenth century in the fourteenth century the façade of the basilica was partially transformed in gothic style so the church arose by a process of accretion and accommodation encrusted and adapted over the centuries marbles and statuesbought or stolen it made no differencewere attached to it in almost haphazard fashion the basilica is unique to some it has a moorish air to others it appears to be a relic of byzantium others admire the window traceries and the great screen as miracles of the gothic style the derivations do not matter it is possibly the most beautiful building in the world it rises from the square like an apparition wreathed in clouds of jasper and porphyry of opal and of gold as a piece of chromatic decoration it is unsurpassed the pillars and porches and domes rise one above the other ornamented with mosaics and sculptures that tell stories from the divine and human worlds the play of light and dark across the façade is increased by the deployment of closely ranged columns it exudes a kind of barbaric splendour upon entering the interior the visitor is lost in twilight it is like some great cavern beneath the sea filled with sunken treasure it has been shaped in the form of a cross but there are shadowy aisles and alcoves lit by the flame of a candle or the gleaming of an icon there are five hundred columns of porphyry serpentine and alabaster the roof is a sea of gold the mosaic work covering forty thousand square feet sq m is a skein of iridescence thrown across the walls and arches divine light was more significant than natural light the interior is filled with silks and enamels gold and rock crystal as if it were itself a bejewelled reliquary it is a church of merchants suffering from what one english traveller described as religious horror in the sense of awe and dread it is a church of material wealth and costly display it is also a church of rare commodities here is the icon of the virgin painted by saint luke here is the stone of granite from mount tabor on which christ preached to the people here is the executioners block stained with the blood of saint john the baptist here are marble columns from the temple of solomon here in the chapel of saint isidore lies saint mark it is the perfect stage setting for ritual devotion in its present form the campanile or bell tower of the basilica was erected at the very beginning of the sixteenth century taking the place of an old watchtower that had stood on the site for seven hundred years there had been an attempt to build a new bell tower in but the structure had sunk into the ground the present campanile was used as a vantage point from which to view the city and a defensive station from which to scan the sea it was continually being struck by lightning until the introduction of a lightning rod but there was no disaster worse than that of bastille day when it buckled and folded upon itself neatly imploding into a large pile of rubble it fell as the venetians said at the time like a gentleman there were no fatalities except that of the caretakers cat the largest of the bells la marangona fell two hundred feet m without incurring any damage it was then determined to rebuild the tower dovera comerawhere it is and how it is ten years later the campanile rose again indistinguishable in its outward appearance from its predecessor that was the venetian way it is said that if the visitor arrives in venice to the sound of la marangona then that visitor has the soul of some dead venetian being welcomed back to the city the palace of the doge beside the basilica itself is the other sacred site of the city prousts grandmother journeyed to venice when she was dying simply in order to visit this place proust wrote that she would not have attached so much importance to that joy she got from the ducal palace if she had not felt it to be one of those joys which in a way we imperfectly understand outlive the act of dying and appeal to some portion of us which is not at the least under the dominion of death the original palace was erected at the beginning of the ninth century but was destroyed in during one of the few civil riots in venetian history it was continually enlarged and adapted wings were pulled down and constructed halls and passages and galleries were introduced in the early fourteenth century according to the narrative of ruskins stones of venice the original byzantine palace was supplanted by a gothic palace the latter coinciding with the final triumph of the aristocratic polity this is the building that faces the bacino or pool it became the home of government architecture has always been a statement of power this gothic palace itself grew and grew with new halls and saloons to accommodate the increased complexity of the government apparatus ruskin compared it to a serpent that eventually bites its own tail the apartments of the doge were still within what was known as the old palace or in other words the decayed byzantine original in it was decreed that it should be pulled down and what ruskin called the renaissance palace erected in its place ruskin believed that the demolition of the byzantine structure was an act of vandalism dating from its removal the knell of the architecture of venice and of venice itself his eschatological tendencies may not now find favour yet by degrees the whole complex took the form that can still be seen it was gutted by fires endlessly restored and adapted but it survived the ducal palace as it is now took its final shape in the middle of the sixteenth century like the city and the government the development of the palace was gradual and pragmatic it was not the home of the doge only it was the site of government with chambers for the great council and the senate and the multitudinous committees that made up the venetian state it housed the prisons and the stables what is most remarkable however is what is not there it is not defended there are no walls or barbicans a wall was thrown around it at the beginning of the tenth century in response to the threat of hungarian invasion but that was demolished two centuries later the government was considered secure both from internal and external enemies the palace is or seems to be a miracle of lightness the european observer is accustomed to heaviness of foundation and lightness of summit in the ducal palace the expectation is disappointed the long doublestoreyed arcade at ground level creates the illusion of space and airiness the deep shadows within the arcade act as a metaphor for the foundation the darkness has the illusion of volume the upper part of the façade is made up of tiny marble pieces of pink and white and grey in the pattern of damask shimmering in the light of the lagoon the whole structure has the exact proportions of a cube but it is a cube of light the palace might be said to float like the city itself it is not in prousts phrase under the dominion of death two great fires of and enveloped the halls of the senate and great council the works of bellini titian tintoretto and others were destroyed yet their destruction provided as it were a blank canvas on which the late sixteenthcentury mythmakers of venice could work their wonders a new sequence of paintings was commissioned the official artists of the time among them veronese and the now elderly tintoretto did not invent any of the artistic programmes they submitted to the wishes of their political masters they were ordered to recreate the ideology of the ruling class in triumphal terms this they proceeded to do they invented a completely imaginary history of the city they defined its power they celebrated its virtues they deliberately copied the venetian art of preceding centuries in order to project the idea of enduring identity lost images were restored old symbols reaffirmed it is the essence of the conservatism of venice the artists depicted the battles won by venice they painted votive images of deceased doges they proclaimed venice as justitia and liberator the works were not considered as individual masterpieces but as parts of a coherent whole the paintings in the palace represented the ethos of the venetian community in a more embracing sense the project lasted for twenty years it was an allegory of the state itself before the palace lies saint marks square perhaps more properly known as the piazza it is the only true square in venice it was once the site of two islands facing the bacino di s marco separated by a narrow canal much of the present square was a grass field on an island named il morso for its hard and tenacious soil this was the site of the first ducal palace and the ducal chapel on the same island were two churches and a hospice for pilgrims travelling to the holy land they were the nucleus from which the present square grew it was decided that a place of assembly should be erected for the venetian commune it was necessary to build courts also for the administration of justice so power and authority gradually accrued to the site in the twelfth century the square was enlarged approximately to its present size the trees and vines were cleared and the new site was paved with bright brick of herringbone pattern the new pavement covered the old canal that had once divided the two small islands its waters still run beneath the present square now all was a coherent whole covered walks were built around three sides of the square against which houses were constructed leaving the basilica clear to sight the effect according to marino sanudo was as if one were at a theatre the effect had not been planned by one architect or designer it was a miracle of collective will the importance of the square was sealed when two great columns brought from constantinople in were placed on the edge of the bacino there was a third but it fell into the lagoon the remaining two have stood there ever since surmounted by a lion and an image of saint theodore the columns and the basilica however are the only surviving remnants of the medieval arenawith the possible exception of the pigeons or doves as some prefer to call them the birds have haunted the square since its beginnings shops appeared under the newly built arcades in the twelfth century and in venetian fashion proceeded to monopolise the territory the square became a place of trade sheds and stalls of every description selling food and merchandise littered the site the stalls of moneychangers were set up beneath the campanile a meat market conducted its business beneath the windows of the ducal palace rows of shops selling cheese and salami and fruit once stood where now the tourists line up for the vaporetti the buses that run upon the water where the famous library now stands there were bakeries in the piazzetta the smaller part of the square facing the lagoon five hostelries competed for custom the pillars of the ducal palace were used as public latrines and it was noticed that the patricians would lift their gowns and paddle through the pools of urine without complaint in fact it was observed that the venetians relieved themselves wherever and whenever they wished and of course beggars congregated beneath the arcades displaying their wounds and diseases it was the space for the great religious and civic ceremonies of the city it also was the arena for bullfights and horse races it was the place of punishment prisoners were hung in cages from the campanile and beheadings were carried out between the two monumental pillars in the summer of the gibbet was removed from the square and three flagpoles put in its place before the basilica that was the final touch for the official canonisation of the space between the ducal palace and the basilica stood the stone of proclamation a truncated pillar of porphyry from which the doge pronounced judicial sentence it was like any large medieval town in other words except for the overwhelming majesty of the site itself this order and this disorder this beauty and this squalor are the key to any understanding of fourteenth and fifteenthcentury venice in the s one architect above all others modelled the square as it now appears jacopo sansovino was charged with the task of creating a classical space out of the medieval confusion he built the church of s geminiano on the opposite side of the square from the basilica demolished later on the orders of napoleon he constructed the great library and the mint that faces the bacino he also recreated the loggetta at the base of the campanile he found a square of brick and turned it into marble the square was for thomas coryat of that admirable and incomparable beauty that i thinke no place whatsoever may compare with it it was the central point of the city the place to which all of the tourists were directed or towards which they drifted an englishman of the eighteenth century noted a mixed multitude of jews turks and christians lawyers knaves and pickpockets mountebanks old women and physicians people of every character and condition after his victory in bonaparte razed the church of s geminiano in order to build a third range of stately apartments this completed the trilateral shape of the square in triumphant form he also removed the bronze horses and dispatched them to paris they were returned in throughout the centuries of turmoil it remained the place of meeting and assignation ruskins wife effie described it as a vast drawing room lighted enough by the gas from the arcades all around the square where wandered a dense crowd in the centre of men women children soldiers effie ruskins husband saw it in more apocalyptic terms he described it as filled with the madness of the whole earth filled with idle venetians of the middle classes and military bands in the recesses of the arcades lay men of the lowest classes unemployed and listless while around them begged the urchins of the city full of desperation and stony depravity and this is what aroused his angernot one venetian ever glanced at the wonderful basilica you will not see an eye lifted to it nor a countenance brightened by it it is still one of the paradoxes of the city it has been often said that if you sit at a table in florians or quadris for long enough everyone you have known in your life will eventually pass by if it were once the case for the middleclass englishman or german it is not the case now you will see only knots of tourists from every country under the sun of belief pope gregory xiii once confessed that i am pope everywhere except in venice a venetian historian in reminded the cardinals of his city that venice was their true parent and the church only a stepmother that is why venetian cardinals in rome were often considered by the papal authorities to be little better than spies because the bones of saint mark were preserved in the heart of venice the city claimed an apostolic status equal to that of rome its power and authority effectively meant that it had inherited the mantle of the holy christian empire so it was a very venetian church overwhelmingly subject to state control the doge was considered to be a sacred no less than a secular figure when the bishops of venetian colonies on the terra firma received instructions directly from the pope they relayed them to the council of ten for approval members of the clergy were forbidden entry into any of the state archives and those patrician families who held ecclesiastical benefices were prohibited from involvement in ecclesiastical affairs it was believed and widely stated that the supposed divine origins of the city meant that it had received its powers directly from god and was simply retaining the traditional authority of state over church the state supervised all matters pertaining to the church including the content of sermons and the administration of the mass bishops were appointed by the senate the bishops themselves never questioned the process in any case since all of them came from patrician families no churches could be erected without the permission of the government in the official documents of every period there are references to our see of grado or our bishops of olivolo there was also such a thing as state theology it was painted on the walls of the ducal palace the state had its own liturgy quite different from that in use elsewhere with texts that included homage to mark above all other saints heresy therefore was principally a crime against the state it has been suggested that the venetian church was inspired by the byzantine state church in which religion was seen as an aspect of proper governance but it was also directly rooted in the experience and situation of the city it was not part of the italian mainland it had created its institutions ab novo it refused to submit to any external authority so venetian religion was a very potent and efficient mingling of superstition with practicality and good sense when an italian movement of fervent proselytisers known as the bianchi for the white robes that they wore came to venice in they were forbidden to process or preach in public they were spreading an apocalyptic message on the eve of a new century when one group did try to file into the square before the church of s zanipolo the leaders of the council of ten were waiting for them they wrenched the crucifix from the hand of the principal worshipper tore off its arms and threw the pieces of the cross at the others the procession was then broken up according to a chronicle with many insults and injuries that is how the venetian authorities dealt with any threatening minority they could not endure dissent or disorder however pious in origin venice however did tolerate those who posed no threat at the time of religious innovation in the sixteenth century the authorities were not opposed to the presence of protestant students at the university of padua venice became known as a haven for european reformers who had fled the more orthodox kingdoms of the north the city had always been open to travellers and merchants from the rest of the world so it had no problem with foreign faiths it had important trade relations with heretical nations such as england and the netherlands commerce came first venice had to remain an open port the german merchants lodged in the centre of the city were lutherans it made no difference the english ambassador to venice at the time of james i henry wotton believed that the city might in fact join the reforming nations that was wishful thinking venice may have distrusted the papacy but it would never cease to believe in the virgin and the intercession of the saints it was unthinkable they would have liked to reform the catholic church of course they would have liked to reform the pope out of existence the people were in any case excessively devout they evinced what defoe called prodigious stupid bigotry in a more kindly tone philippe de commynes wrote that i believe god blesses them for the reverence they show in the service of the church there were more than a hundred churches from which to choose there were statues and pictures at every corner the aisles were filled with worshippers there were endless processions each with its own particular form of ritualthe procession of corpus christi when a senator and a poor person walked side by side ahead of the others and rose petals were strewn across the route the procession of good friday when lamps and torches and candles were placed in front of the great houses the ceremony of palm sunday when a myriad of pigeons was set free in front of the basilica the procession of the doge to the convent of s zaccaria on easter day each ceremony had its own social as well as religious purpose a culture of public processions is very common within authoritarian societies effie ruskin remarked of the ordinary venetians that they dont seem to believe anything particularly but are superstitious by habit that is possibly the best definition of venetian piety when an englishman visiting a venetian church did not kneel at the elevation of the host he was taken to task by a venetian senator the englishman said that he did not subscribe to the doctrine of the real presence to which the venetian replied no more do i but kneel as i do or else leave the church the devotion of the people was also the greatest possible bulwark for the state itself the use of icons and relics meant that such devotion knitted all of the people together in a bond of piety the body of saint mark guarded all of the citizens but there were many other saints to be touched and seen there were at the last count more than fifty dead saints in defensive formation they were considered in a city without walls to be essential one monastery possessed the relics of twelve separate saints it is surprising that there were enough saints to go round in november two gunmen rushed into the church of s geremia ordering the priest and congregation to lie on the floor they then seized the mummified skeleton of saint lucy and stuffed it into a sack the head of the saint was broken off unfortunately and rolled into the aisle the silver death mask of lucy was also left behind a month later the poor saint was found discarded in a hunting lodge near venice the venetians greatly preferred what might be called full body relics they needed the whole body because insecurity in the spirit demands completeness yet in exceptional circumstances an arm or a leg would do the head of saint george was lodged in the benedictine monastery on the island of s giorgio maggiore his arm had arrived some decades before there were pieces of saints peter matthew bartholomew and john the evangelist scattered through the various shrines of the city the head of the prophet jonah saved from the belly of the whale had also somehow made its way to the city of the lagoon the body of saint tarasius was doubly celebrated because it had miraculously escaped fragmentation two robbers from another city had tried to remove his teeth but the saint refused to yield them up the whole thing came to the city when a dutch traveller of the seventeenth century went to gaze upon one piece of sacred flesh he found it whole and undamaged with her breasts and her carnal appearance looking as though it was smokedried meat feet and hands since this holy body had been in the fire or perhaps some enterprising merchant had burnt another body so that it might pass as the genuine article saint isidore of chios was buried in the doges chapel the head and the body of saint barbara unfortunately separated were stolen from their shrine in constantinople and transported to the lagoon when the venetians were forced out of crete by the turks they took the body of saint titus with them two venetian merchants smuggled the body of saint simeon the prophet from a church near saint sophia it was reported that they had encountered some difficulty it was said that whenever a venetian entered a famous shrine the first question would always be what can we steal for saint marks monks of foreign monasteries were bribed to give up their honoured dead other saints were simply pillaged so the basilica itself was compared to the house of a pirate retired from business of course the thefts were excused under the guise of piety it was said that these translationswe may call them borrowingssucceeded because the saints themselves wished to be enthroned in venice they wished to receive more prayers and more veneration otherwise they would have refused to leave their original shrines saints can be very stubborn so the arrival of a purloined relic in the city was yet another sign of gods grace it was a very convenient argument the relichunters were merchants under another name the relics were in a sense also merchandise they were collectable they were a source of revenue from the religious tourists coming to the city they were in themselves valuablethe crown of thorns that had once rested on christs head was valued at the sum of seventy thousand ducats in the basilica of saint marks was a vessel containing drops of the blood that christ shed while enduring the agony in the garden of gethsemane there were thorns from the crown fragments of the true cross and a portion of the flagellation pillar on which the saviour had been bound here also are to be found portions of the hair and a sample of the milk of the holy virgin the basilica is an enormous reliquary in this way the venetian church could be associated in spirit with the heroes and heroines of early christianity by forging relics as often happened the venetian authorities were inventing a religious history for themselves but they could not supply the native saints to close the deal there were more venetian artists than venetian saints there were a few native saints but typically enough they were all in some sense connected with the political status of the republic saint pietro orseolo had been a doge of the tenth century before retiring to a monastery saint marina recovered padua for the republic saint lorenzo giustiniani was a favoured son of the city who was intimately involved in the struggle to reestablish the doctrine of the immaculate conception the holiness of the virgin surrounds him it has been observed with some surprise that in the absence of candidates from home the venetian authorities named many of their churches after old testament prophets there are in fact forty old testament figures in the venetian calendar of saints that is not a feature of western christianity but it is an integral aspect of the eastern church from which venice borrowed so many details of its devotion there were churches for saint moses saint job saint daniel saint samuel and saint jeremiah the venetians identified themselves with the chosen race that had similarly wandered over the wilderness in search of a divinely ordained homeland there were some visiting saints venice was after all the city of tourism from earliest times the most famous of these divine travellers must be saint francis who after attempting to convert the sultan arrived in the city at some point in the s he stayed in venice itself and soon became aware of some birds singing on certain trees among the marshes he rowed to that spot with a companion and when they alighted on the marshy ground saint francis began to pray aloud but the birds kept on singing the saint then commanded them to be silent they obeyed and would not depart until he gave them approval on this site then there rose a church and a monastery of franciscans the venetians themselves had no particular fondness for the pope or for the catholic faith beyond venetian territory the jesuits considered to be the agents of the papacy were unpopular in venice it was the practice of children to follow them crying out go away go away take nothing with you and never come back pius ii called the venetians traders and barbarians and hypocrites he declared that they never think of god and except for the state which they regard as a deity they hold nothing sacred nothing holy the venetians in turn regarded the papacy as an enemy a ruler of italian lands rather than a representative of god the city was an arena for popebaiting there was a famous story of a venetian prisoner who on hearing the news of the accession of sixtus v clapped his hands i will be free now he said for he buggered me when i was a boy that was the kind of story venetians enjoyed they were delighted to hear from one of their ambassadors to england in the sixteenth century that there were prints in london of the pope shitting out medals and mitres and beads so the powers of the inquisition were in venice restrained and restricted there was no spanish or roman fervour the venetians insisted that on the tribunal three secular judges should act as a balance against three ecclesiastics it was established in the city in but typically in a city known for its superstition the principal objects of its enquiries were women accused of witchcraft the testimonials of these trials reveal an informal and almost relaxed mode of interrogation the venetian authorities had a tendency to record the most trivial details so we can hear the people againand as she said these things she was crying oh he said theres one thing ive forgotten to say as he did not know how to reply he kept silence for the length of one miserere it cannot be assumed that the venetians were necessarily genial judges it is simply evidence of the fact there was already in the city a wellattested culture of civic denunciation venetian citizens were used to being accused by one another but harsh punishment was rare there were few executions for heresy in comparison with other catholic states and there was little use of torture those women who were convicted of witchcraft were commonly sentenced to a period in the pillory the venetian church was capable of independent power because its authority was firmly based upon the will of the people the priests were elected by the property owners of each of the seventy parishes it was a relatively democratic system that demonstrates how indissolubly religion and society were mingled reminiscent of the procedures of the early christians it has been estimated that one quarter of the priests of venice were of patrician status but this must mean that the overwhelming majority of the approximately six hundred clergy were ordinary citizens or even perhaps from the popolani the word for parish priest in venetian dialect pievano is derived from the latin word plebs so the unique role of the priest in the parish may ultimately spring from the earliest democratic societies of those who came first to the lagoon it certainly helps to explain the rootedness and strength of venetian popular devotion the priests acted at every level of the parish they took on the role of notaries drawing up wills and marriage contracts they were financiers arranging the wages and costs of their churches they were arbiters in social disputes the priest could also act as a lawyer or as an accountant their parishioners were undoubtedly the most superstitious in italy the transcripts of the witch trials themselves reveal the intense credulity of the people it was a city of omens and of prophecies in the senate consulted an oracle known as the spirit of ferrara asking such questions as are we to have war or peace with milan and shall we lose pisa in the doge and the council of ten were informed of the birth of a winged and hairy monster in the council of ten deliberated on the warnings of an astrologer there were many superstitions and superstitious practices it was good to die on a saturday if it rained on the bier of the departed the soul would be saved it was unwise to walk between the two columns in the piazzetta misfortune would surely follow you a guest who crumples a napkin at dinner will never come to that table again if the clock strikes the hour when you are asking the time you have heard the knell of your own death the first person whom you meet on new years day holds the clue to your fortunes a humpback is a sign of good fortune a lame person is an omen of bad luck these superstitions and many others like them were still current in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the witchcraft of venice was different from that of the mainland it was the witchcraft of a tightly knit urban and mercantile society open to all the superstitions of the east as well as of the west it was said that it was the delight of witches to unchain the gondolas by night and set sail to alexandria when the hair of children was cut their mothers used carefully to gather it up in case it fell into the hands of the hags you could recognise those who had been cursed by witch or demon their faces had the colour of green fruit and their eyes were narrowed those who fell under a curse experienced a range of unpleasant symptoms some felt as if dogs were devouring their flesh or that a mouthful of food had stuck in the throat or that their bodies were invaded by a freezing wind storms at sea were blamed upon the agency of fiends which is why saint mark and the other saints stood guard by the side of the lagoon yet the witches were also part of the religious culture of the city they invoked the virgin and the saints one notorious witch known as apollonia told the inquisition that she prayed in the name of god and the virgin mary who puts her hands before mine to stop a bleeding nose it was necessary to recite a ritual formulablood stay strong as messer lord jesus christ stayed strong in his death blood stay in your vein as messer jesus stayed in his passion one of casanovas earliest memories concerned a nosebleed his grandmother immediately took him in a gondola to a witch on the island of murano where he was promptly cured it is an indication of catholic folk culture with very ancient roots it survived in venice the key to venetian witchery however lies in the acquisition of money it was a culture in which scholarly necromancy was used to find hidden treasure the discovery of treasure was a venetian preoccupation the pursuit of magical gold recurs again and again in the records of the inquisition one patrician had secretly imparted to friends that he knew of a huge mass of gold guarded by spirits in a deep cavern it is as good as a fairy tale suited to venetian ingenuity and credulity alchemists were always welcomed in venice the prospect of turning base metals into gold was too alluring to resist at the end of the sixteenth century there was a famous venetian alchemist giambattista angello living in london and of course the spirit of commerce was also present in dealings with the supernatural powers the devil had always to be paid for his services for example with salt or with a coin the transaction had to be seen to be fair on both sides magic could be used for political purposes there were many cases when the devil was summoned to reveal the names of those who would be successful in the election to the great council gamblers used spells and symbols it was a culture also in which love potions flourished one such potion was sage mingled with menstrual blood when it was mixed with the food and drink of a male he became irresistibly attracted to the woman who had dispensed it to him where people are packed so closely together the passions may run high more than any other place in italy venice was a harbour for ghosts there are few other italian cities where ghost stories are part of cultural tradition yet by the eighteenth century the city had become the setting for wraiths and phantoms continued in a book such as alberto toso feis venetian legends and ghost stories published in in a real sense venice was haunted by its past it wanted to keep hold of its past what better way to express it than to see ghosts in the corners it was said that on the vigil of all souls the dead left their resting places on the cemetery island of s michele and crossed the lagoon into the city each spirit visitant then returned to his or her home and sat invisible by the kitchen fire how did you see a ghost only those whose baptismal rites had been interrupted or improperly conducted possessed that ability the lure of money to the venetians was also to be found in the spirit world the most frequent type of ghost was one who had concealed its treasure before death some of the grander houses were reputed to be haunted certain passages of water were avoided there are stories of shrieking skulls of statues coming alive of strange creatures of the deep the venetians have always loved the bizarre and the fantastic living on water opens the mind to the supernatural and to unconscious association from this watery and uterine landscape strange shapes will emerge representing the dreams or nightmares of humankind hence in venice the intense fear of magic x the shadows of history decline and fall at the beginning of the seventeenth century the city was no longer building enough ships its share of the import trade from the near east was shrinking the merchants of holland and england exploited the recently discovered cape route to trade with the indies the german market collapsed in part as a result of the thirty years war there were only three venetian merchants in constantinople the depredations of sea pirates meant also that the mercantile routes were under constant threat the venetian government in the face of economic competition from other european states decided that its preeminent duty was to maintain standards of production costs therefore remained high in the face of challenge and competition the city reverted to its innate traditionalism it retained all the institutional rigour of its existing guilds the work practices of the manufacturers were unchanged laws were passed that gave priority to venetian shipping in venetian ports goods destined for venice could only be carried in venetianowned ships its conservatism and its new protectionism meant that it could not effectively confront the quickly changing mercantile world of the s and s cheaper manufactures undercut the venetian markets in such areas as dyeing and printing venice retained its hold in the trade of luxury goods in all other items it fell behind the annals are dominated by the melancholy long withdrawing roar of a once great economic and imperial power in the first decade of the seventeenth century venice was placed under solemn interdict by the pope thus effectively being excommunicated the interdict failed of its effect largely as a result of the indifference of the venetian people to papal disapproval when a member of the government told a prominent ecclesiastic that no papal bull was to be opened or read in the territories of the republic he replied i shall proceed as the holy spirit inspires me the venetian official told him that the holy spirit has already inspired the council of ten to hang all disobedient subjects when a priest conformed to the papal edict and closed down his church a gallows was erected outside the porch on the following morning these leaders of your senate one pope had told a venetian ambassador fifty years before are tough fellows and need a lot of cooking the successful rebuff to the pope materially hindered papal ambitions in the rest of italy but the threat of excommunication added to the impression that the independence of the city could never be taken for granted the sense of threat was given dramatic expression in the discovery of and almost hysterical reaction to what became known as the spanish plot it is said that in a mercenary from normandy approached the spanish government and its representatives in italy with a plan to destroy the city of the lagoon on a certain day his agents would set fire to the arsenal the mint and the ducal palace at the same time all of the venetian nobles would be massacred and the spanish fleet would take charge of all the passages into the city venice would fall to spain such was the plan according to report it was enthusiastically received by the spanish ambassador in venice the marquis of bedmar and by the french authorities the duke of osuna the spanish viceroy of naples was deeply complicit yet as so often happened in venice the conspirators were betrayed by secret informants the scheme was revealed to the council of ten who took prompt measures on may by chance it happened to be the day when a new doge was to be elected so the city was filled with travellers and interested observers on the morning of may the people of venice woke to find the bodies of two men suspended from a gibbet between the two columns of the piazzetta the celebrations for the election of the new doge took place over the next three days with the bodies of the condemned in full view nothing was said about them by the authorities it became known that they were frenchmen some of the inns populated by frenchmen suddenly found that they had vacant rooms it was said that five hundred other conspirators had been drowned on that night in the canals bedmar was forced to flee the french ambassador also under suspicion took the opportunity to make a pilgrimage to loreto the silence of the authorities might be construed as embarrassment it seems very likely that there was no real conspiracy at all and that the council of ten acted in panic on the basis of false information their reaction suggests however that the leaders of the city considered venice to be in imminent danger of destruction in historical literature the spanish plot has taken its place with the gunpowder plot and the massacre of saint bartholomews as an emblematic event it was according to sir henry wotton the foulest and fearfullest thing that hath come to light since the foundation of the city there were various explanations and interpretations of the conspiracy none of them entirely convincing it has for example been claimed that the venetian authorities were in league with osuna to bring naples under venetian domination but on fear of discovery of the plot they had covered up the evidence by killing all of osunas emissaries in the city there may have been a conspiracy and a conspiracy within a conspiracy with all the machinations of a convoluted plot utterly suited to a suspicious and theatrical city it became the subject of plays and pamphlets of the most melodramatic nature it inspired otways greatest play venice preservd venice has always been preserved it always will be one venetian proverb sempre crolla ma non cade tells the story it is always collapsing but it never falls down there was a further and major blow to civic harmony twelve years later in the course of the great plague of almost fifty thousand residents of the city died the government undertook a major effort in health care and sanitation at all costs at a time of weakness civic panic or disorder had to be avoided yet the population dipped to and never properly recovered in the following centuries this was not necessarily a matter of lasting regret to the authorities there was of course a fall in tax revenues but the relative depopulation meant that there were more jobs available for those who remained and that wages increased exponentially incomes rose and prices fell at times of emergency too the city could prove its selfsufficiency how in any case can we speak of failure and decline in the context of a city that still survives intact by the end of the seventeenth century venice had a working polity the english ambassador had in described the senators as growne fractious vindictive loose and unthriftie yet they had held together in fact venice experienced a commercial resurgence by the end of the century trade with germany and the turks of constantinople enjoyed a revival the revenues from taxes on shipping increased by some per cent in the last three decades of the seventeenth century the standard of living in the city had not fallen at all it may have been no longer an international market but it became a vital regional port serving the territories of the po valley a great scheme of public works was instituted to increase the traffic along the adige river new roads were built along the skirts of the lagoon projects were formed for legal educational and technological reform the functions of the city had changed it had adapted and survived it became in every sense a local rather than a western power by the eighteenth century at the very latest the city lost any illusion about its status as an imperial force it held only dalmatia and some of the ionian islands but this was not necessarily a matter for regret it was said of england in the twentieth century that it had lost an empire and had not yet found a new role this was not the case with venice the city acted as the entrepôt for goods destined for western europe in general and for the north sea shores in particular thirty english and fifteen dutch merchantmen visited the port each year trade in the latter half of the eighteenth century was in no way inferior to that of the fifteenth century canals were being deepened to accommodate the larger sailing vessels and new canals were being dug on the mainland to divert the waters of the rivers threatening the levels of the lagoon in regional matters venice adopted a stance of studied neutrality having realised that wars and rumours of wars were not good for business on the italian mainland the city perhaps unwisely in the light of subsequent developments became accustomed to peace yet its removal from battle also helped its reputation as a wise arbiter and a standard of good governance the constitution was in no way adapted or amended in the eighteenth century venice as we have already observed set itself the task of becoming the city of art and the city of pleasure it redefined itself as the most seductive haven for foreign visitors the public buildings were renovated and the churches were restored new theatres and new hospitals were erected this was the age of canaletto whose views of the city have created a perfect myth of graceful urbanism but this was also the century of giambattista tiepolo born in and dead by he inherited all the liveliness and energy of his venetian forebears and thus is an apt token of the fact that the spirit and greatness of the city did not die they revived and flourished under new circumstances the first half of the eighteenth century too witnessed the music of vivaldi is there not something more glorious about making music than making war this was not a dying city it was a city more vibrant than ever before that happy state would not last for ever quick bright things often end in confusion by the end of the eighteenth century venice had lost its freedom it did not lose its fabric or its inheritance but it lost its status as a republic twenty years before the catastrophe there was already nervous fever in the air when carlo contarini addressed the great council in he declared that all is in confusion in disorder our commerce is languishing bankruptcies continually prove it food is extraordinarily dear that which sufficed to maintain our families and left a margin to help the state is now insufficient to keep us alive in the following year the doge paolo renier conveyed approximately the same sentiment we have no forces he told the great council neither on land nor on sea we have no alliances we live by luck by accident and solely dependent upon the conception of venetian prudence which others entertain about us in the patrician andrea tron completed the litany of complaint the old enduring maxims and laws that created and could still create a great state have been forgotten the trade of venice was now confined to comforts excessive luxuries vain shows alleged amusements and vices the three men were in their different ways intuiting what could otherwise not have been foreseen who could have predicted the rise of the napoleonic empire in europe and the submission of venice to one mans will yet of course it is not the consequence of one man in war and peace tolstoy enquired in relation to the phenomenon of napoleon why do wars or revolutions happen we do not know we only know that to produce the one or the other men form themselves into a certain combination in which all take part and we say that this is the nature of men that this is a law the fall of venice was just a change in its historical identity we cannot say that it was a disgrace or a triumph because we do not know who in the end is triumphant and who is disgraced that is the flaw in all moralistic interpretations of historical events we must discount the possibility of ever discerning a purpose in human affairs except that of blind instinct reaching its fulfilment and we must admit that any ultimate purpose will be for ever beyond our understanding why did venice fall we may return to war and peace to understand that an answer is not possible why does an apple fall when it is ripe is it brought down by the force of gravity is it because its stalk withers because it is dried by the sun because it grows too heavy or the wind shakes it or because the boy standing under the tree wants to eat it the end came quickly ludovico manin was elected the doge of venice in it was by far the most expensive election in venetian history costing half as much again as the previous ducal election of the cost was hardly worth it manin the th doge continuing an unbroken line of rulers since ad was the last doge in venetian history eight years after his accession the city of patrician government was shaken and destroyed by the conqueror still riding on the back of popular revolution bonaparte twentysix years old was annoyed by venice he was annoyed that some of its mainland territories had become the centre of french émigré activity and that the venetian authorities had allowed the austrian enemy to pass through its territories when he arrived in the po region he sent his agents into the city with the message of liberation the forces of napoleon were not to be considered as bloodthirsty plebeian revolutionaries but as a dedicated army ready to remove the injustice and ineptitude of an antique and discredited regime there were indeed some venetians who would have welcomed him when he crossed the river po the end was close a new guardian of venetian territories a provveditore was appointed with the official purpose of preserving intact the tranquillity of the republic and of administering comfort and consolation to its subjects it is a most inexpedient turn of phrase suggesting the onset of panic when napoleon occupied verona the provveditore and his staff entered negotiations with him he was apparently affable and even amicable but no concessions were drawn from him it was reported that he threatened in the friendliest possible terms to demand a ransom of six million francs for the safety of the city the venetians had no troops and only the remnants of a navy they were to all intents and purposes defenceless napoleon meanwhile continued his campaign of occupation throughout the venetian territories the stated policy of venetian neutrality between france and austria now turned back and bit the city the french accused the senate of aiding the austrians and of course in turn the austrian government denounced the venetians for assisting bonaparte the doge and the senate did nothing it was as if they were speechless with fear a paduan writer ippolito nievo said of this period that the venetian nobility was a corpse that could not be revived when a truce was declared between france and austria bonaparte waited for venice to fall into his hands he tested its responses he sent a ship into the harbour of the lido on april and a venetian galley attacked it that was enough to signal war the senate met in permanent session napoleon instigated popular risings against venetian rule in the cities of the mainland two venetian nobles were sent to bonaparte on april he was magnificent in his assumed wrath he blamed the venetians for atrocities against his soldiers i will have no inquisition no antique barbarities he ended by saying that i will be an attila to the venetian state he knew something of venetian history then over dinner he asked for reparations to the amount of twentytwo million francs from the venetian treasury on april the french soldiers occupied the venetian frontiers as the guardians of the city anxiously convened on the following day the sound of the french artillery could clearly be heard the doge walked up and down the hall of his private apartments where they had gathered for safety and told them that tonight we are not even safe in our beds the procurator then rose to his feet i see that it is all over with my country he said i can certainly be of no assistance to an honest man every place is his country one may easily occupy oneself in switzerland he was persuaded to stay for the time being and comforted himself with snuff the nobles then agreed that they would introduce any democratic changes that bonaparte required of them in the hope that this would forestall an invasion the great council met on the following day may when the doge addressed them he told them that it was necessary to make peace at any price and that they must resort to prayer so matters stayed for the next few days with venetian envoys going to and from the camp of napoleon they capitulated on every point the great council met on may to ratify their proceedings those present did not meet the required quorum of six hundred members but they decided to go ahead anyway they had just got to the point of debating the measure to accept the proposed provisional representative government a french government when the sound of musketry was heard it was in fact the parting salute of some sailors leaving the lido but the patricians believed it to be the noise of an invading army they fell into a panic the doge called out divide divide to conclude the vote they did so and promptly left the council hall never to return ippolito nievo recorded that after sixty years i still see some of those frightened dejected alarmed faces i visualise the deathly pallor of some the discomposed almost drunken aspect of others the nervous hurry of the majority who seemed as though they would gladly have jumped out of the windows to escape this scene of infamy it is reported in the histories of the period that the doge returned to his apartment and gave his ducal bonnet to his manservant take it he said i shall not be needing it again so ended the republic of venice the last carnival before the end was supposed to have been the most magnificent and the most expensive in the entire history of the city the french army occupied the city on may an official report to bonaparte on this occasion reported that the ordinary people of venice retired in silence to their homes exclaiming with tearsvenice is no more saint mark is fallen the lion of saint mark was indeed toppled from its column and a tree of liberty erected in the square the ducal insignia and the golden book of patrician membership were ritually burned the former doge and members of the great council joined in the dancing around the tree thus ended a polity that had endured for more than a thousand years the most ancient government in the whole of europe was another indirect casualty of the french revolution napoleon also plundered the art and treasures of the city just as venice had plundered constantinople and the dominions of its empire there is something apposite about the transference of the four bronze horses to paris they had been snatched by venetians from constantinople six hundred years before they were always the spoils of victory then napoleon bartered venice itself in the autumn of he handed it to the austrians as part of the treaty of campo formio eight years later having defeated the austrians he took it back in it became part of his unified kingdom of italy for venice accustomed to stand apart from the mainland this was a further humiliation it had never played any part in the burgeoning national consciousness of the italians and only reluctantly accepted its status as a peripheral part of a nation in the city again returned to the control of austria it suffered these changes of regime with docility it bowed its head it was now a spectator of its own fate at the beginning of the nineteenth century napoleon had instituted a policy of public works a new royal palace was erected at the west end of saint marks square churches and monasteries were pulled down to create public gardens just beyond the arsenal a new road the via eugenia now known as the via garibaldi was built along the waterfront towards the gardens the public works continued under austrian occupation the lagoon was fortified the accademia bridge only the second bridge across the grand canal was erected in yet the most radical change of all consisted in the building of a railway bridge that connected venice to the mainland the city was no longer an island and it lost its hallowed status as a refuge from the world this meant too that the prime significance of the water had gone for ever it became a city of mechanical rather than of natural time it had perhaps been prophesied in the early s the doge andrea gritti consulted the delphic oracle he had been assailed by rumours concerning the imminent collapse of venice there appeared to him beside the statue of apollo a panorama showing venice surrounded by green fields rather than by the sea the priest told him that this signified one thing the republic would die when venice became part of the mainland throughout this period in fact there was an accelerating economic slump from which the city scarcely recovered in the twentieth century the patrician class was emasculated and one family in three simply died out some of the remaining nobles were awarded honorary titles by the austrian government but these were empty forms they fooled nobody except their holders the general population diminished too as a result of epidemic sickness and migration there had always been beggars in venice but by the beginning of the nineteenth century the poverty and mendicancy became the most obvious aspect of city life it was estimated that a third of the population depended on charity this was precisely the time when the english romantics became interested in venice they were drawn to decay and desuetude in some ways it was the most interesting period in the history of the city the grass and weeds had sprung up in the campi and the various palazzi had been converted into ruined tenements for the poor the stone steps and bridges were covered with green algae and the wood of the mooring posts was rotting away the houses crumbled venice indeed appears to be at her last gasp an englishman wrote in the winter of and if something is not done to relieve and support her she must be soon buried again in the marshes from whence she originally sprang every trace of her former magnificence which still exists only serves to illustrate her present decay a generation later however some of the prosperity of the city was recovered it reverted to type it became once more the haven for travellers and tourists eleven large hotels and innumerable smaller hostelries were opened to serve them gas lighting was introduced to increase the romantic charm of the nocturnal city this was the venice that turner depicted the population began to rise the merchants and the glassmakers and the gondoliers were prosperous by the s there were no less than eightytwo shoeshops and one hundred retailers of silk yet the city was still part of the hapsburg dominion with the principal social and economic decisions being taken far away in vienna venice had become only one distant and subsidiary limb of a large empire of course the venetians resented their loss of status there were complaints concerning high taxes and oppressive censorship the austrian soldiers in particular were not liked they were even compared unfavourably to their french predecessors there is hardly a venetian house to which an austrian is admitted the english consul general wrote persons supposed to have a leaning towards the government are held up to public execration and their names are written upon the walls as traitors to the country shelley believed that the venetian people themselves had forfeited their identity under the occupation of the french and the austrian armies i had no conception he wrote of the excess to which avarice cowardice superstition ignorance passionless lust all the inexpressible brutalities to which human nature could be carried until i had lived a few days among the venetians yet it would be quite wrong to say that the venetians had entirely lost their spirit or their energy these human characteristics are stubborn and persistent when the test came in a few months of they rose to the challenge this was the time of the siege of venice it began in the year of revolutions when the dynasty of the house of orleans fell and the second republic was instituted in france the contagion of liberty spread all over europe most significantly there was great unrest at the heart of the austrian empire vienna and the emperor was forced to grant a new constitution to his entire dominions on receipt of this news brought by a postal steamer from trieste the venetian people rose up against the austrian army of occupation they congregated in saint marks square and demanded the release of a jewish lawyer daniele manin who had been imprisoned for uttering patriotic venetian sentiments the arsenal was captured by the local people in the face of general insurrection with which they could not adequately deal the austrian army agreed to withdraw from venice and retired by sea to trieste on march manin was declared to be president of a newly formed republic when he was told that the people were idle and selfindulgent he replied that neither you nor anyone else knows the people of venice they have always been misunderstood my boast is that i know them better it is my only merit it seemed at the time that venice had once more risen from the depths an editorial in the gazzetta di venezia announced that we are free it took up the ancient cry of viva san marco but there can be no certainty in human affairs all is miscalculation error and confusion what is predicted does not take place the unforeseen and the unexpected make up the life of the world in the austrians defeated the nationalist forces on the italian mainland and reoccupied the veneto venice once more stood alone against a threatening world it was the crisis that throughout their history the venetians had always most feared their fears then took material shape the austrian army laid siege to the city it lasted for seventeen months yet popular feeling demanded resistance at all costs it was the ancient spirit of independence reasserting itself in a city that had for two centuries been dismissed as effete and inglorious the venetian people were ready to risk everything in order to defend themselves from foreign oppression they gladly gave up their plate and jewellery to help in the noble cause of saving venice even the poorest of them donated their thin bracelets and silver hairpins the workers of the arsenal laboured through the night to produce more vessels of war there were rumours at one stage that the city was about to be bombed from the air by means of balloons but the threat was lampooned mercilessly in cartoons and street placards some air balloons were released on july but they lived up to comic expectations they fell into the lagoon or drifted back to the austrian side at the end of july however began a serious bombardment that continued for twentyfour days all of the palaces along the grand canal were struck most of the austrian bombs fell in the northern cannaregio district but the fire and smoke dominated the entire city many citizens built towers or turrets on the roofs of their houses so that they could eat or rest at the same time as they enjoyed the spectacle the venetians had always enjoyed fireworks the spirit of the venetian people like that of londoners during the blitz of remained cheerful and steadfast they would hold out it was said until the last slice of polenta the children chased the austrian cannon balls as they landed and then brought them to be used in the venetian batteries the horrors of this period are well documented in the face of famine and an epidemic of asiatic cholera the venetian people refused to surrender consoling themselves with the chant of viva san marco but in the end resistance became impossible on august manin signed the articles of surrender the austrian army returned to the ravaged city and manin was arrested he was despatched as an exile to paris his dream of republican independence based upon the remote history of the city had come to nothing yet for a time venice had once again become the emblem of republican liberty and was admired by all those who despised hapsburg imperialism that support was short of material benefits of course and was not enough to save the city yet the bravery and endurance of the venetian people were enough to dispel for ever the belief that they were spineless and spiritless in retaliation for the rebellion the austrians removed the status of venice as a free port it was the final phase in the maritime life of the city the occupation of the austrians after the siege lasted for seventeen years it was essentially a city in mourning there is no greater social dullness and sadness the american consul wrote in on land or sea than in contemporary venice it was the home of despondency it resembled a sepulchre of the living in early photographs the city has a slumlike appearance the women in shawls and the men in battered hats then the events of the outer world to which the venetians had become largely indifferent cast a new light upon the city in the austrian troops withdrew and the province of lombardyvenetia became part of the new kingdom of italy the air of gloom and abandonment that had hovered over venice began to lift the success of the lido as a pleasure resort from the s into the twentieth century opened up new vistas of trade and prosperity for the lagoon two luxury hotels were built on the island venice had once more become a pleasure ground for the rich and for the famous there were any number of dethroned members of royal families dukes and duchesses popular singers film stars and what were once called playboys the astors and the desboroughs came the middle class followed in the first international exhibition was organised this soon became known as the biennale inaugurating what has become a thoroughly venetian tradition of art money and celebrity from this time forward it became clear to everyone that the only future for the city lay in tourism the creation of the industrial zone on the mainland at mestre and marghera in the early decades of the twentieth century just within the purview of venice only served to reinforce the belief that the developments of contemporary life were somehow to be kept in the margins it was only the latest manifestation of the ancient instinct of the city to banish its industries to the borders venice had come to rely upon its history real or imagined the actual past was not specified the city simply encouraged a sense of pastness the decayed fabric of the thirteenthcentury palace known as the fondaco dei turchi was purchased by the municipality as it now was and restored to a symmetrical elegance it never actually possessed it was in the language of architectural historians hypervenetianised in the new fish market was built on the rialto in the style of the fifteenth century there was a gothic revival and a byzantine revival new hotels were built in classical or renaissance style new palaces rose up along the grand canal that to all outward appearances might have been designed and erected in the twelfth or thirteenth centuries during the first world war venices old masters the austrians came dangerously close to the city when its army moved ever nearer to the borders of the lagoon barrage balloons could be seen from the campanile and the port was closed for fear of enemy attack but the city did not fall in fact it emerged almost intact from the ravages of both world wars there was very little bomb damage and through all the years of hostilities there were only two hundred fatalitiesmost of whom had fallen into the canals during the hours of blackout but there were other victims the jews of venice were destined to suffer on the orders of mussolini and of hitler the city had been quick to embrace fascism in the s and organised groups of mussolinis supporters were soon a powerful force in the city the racial laws of and the active persecution of the jews from to opened a wide wound in venetian jewry jews were dismissed from their jobs and were not allowed to use the beaches of the lido in public buildings there were signs stating dogs and jews prohibited the historical tolerance of the venetian people had come to an end when the german army took over the city in approximately two hundred jews were rounded up and deported to the concentration camps of the mainland some were sent on to auschwitz the mentally ill were taken from the hospital islands and despatched to their death the world beyond venice the real world had taken over the last half of the twentieth century was marked by the exodus of venetians to the mainland where industrial expansion promised better paid jobs and less expensive housing the industrial activity of mestre and marghera has also helped to poison the waters of the lagoon emphasising the vulnerability of the environment of the city yet the city continued and continues to be beset by bureaucratic timidity and ineptitude gianfranco pertots study of modern venice venice extraordinary maintenance chronicles the nonfulfilment of obligations the failure to programme or to plan and consequently to act on the part of the venetian authorities for many years it is part of the inertia this immobilismo of the city allowing and even encouraging scandalous exploitation speculation destruction and decay bribery and general corruption are said to be rife throughout the city yet what community has not been invaded by corruption it is the human condition and it has been the condition of venice itself for many centuries for centuries also it was almost impossible to locate the source or centre of power which was always distributed among overlapping governmental bodies was it the doge or the senate did it reside in the council of ten or in the great council the present bureaucratic arrangements of the city have inherited that complexity and that obliquity to quote from pertot once more who is in charge in venice is a question that has still not been settled it was always thus in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries new laws accrued upon old laws this history is still repeating itself in the late twentieth century special law followed special law concerning the preservation of the city there were delays and obfuscations in every part of the administrative machinery there is still no general agreement among all the interested parties about the future of venice should it be a museum city and research centre should it be simply a tourist haven and stage set for the various international exhibitions that have gravitated to the lagoon or should it attempt to restore its past as a living city of residents it is perhaps too late for the last proposal that great migration of the venetian population to mestre began in the s and has continued ever since by the early twentyfirst century the inhabitants of venice had the lowest incomes in the whole of the veneto region one third of the population was over the age of sixty the death rate had overtaken the birth rate by a factor of four that is why at night venice now seems so empty it is empty it is hard to imagine a time when it was a city full of local people of course in the day it is full of tourists but paradoxically tourists empty a place by their presence they turn it into a spectacle without depth there are now approximately sixty thousand residents within the city and demographic experts have suggested that the last venetian will leave in or about most young venetians have migrated to the mainland where there are jobs other than those within the service sector venice has become too expensive for them foreigners have been buying or renting the houses and apartments so affordable housing is scarce many houses have been turned into pensions or hotels many of the local shops have become little more than souvenir kiosks for tourists butchers and bakers have gone while icecream shops have multiplied contemporary venetians are under siege in another sense away from the main tourist routes however the fabric of the city seems neglected the stock of private housing has been deteriorating under the twin threats of subsidence and water seepage the pollution from the chemical plants and petroleum refineries of marghera on the mainland has also taken its toll on the brick and stone fissures appear walls shift and crack stonework falls off the buildings the plaster peels in an air laden with salt one recent study of venice by john berendt is entitled the city of falling angels derived from a sign posted outside the church of s maria della salute in more general terms it is hard not to detect a mood of cynicism among the remaining inhabitants of the city the great flood of when the afternoon tide rose more than six feet m higher than its average reminded venetians that their city was still precarious the world shared the general sense of anxiety and organisations such as venice in peril were established to raise funds for the restoration of venice as the city gradually subsides the incidences of flooding increase it has been estimated that saint marks square is flooded on fifty occasions each year the sea is still rising the silt continually piling upon the floor of the lagoon and the extraction of methane gas from the adriatic have combined with the more general threat of global warming the sea is returning to its old domain unless it is prevented by assiduous and energetic human enterprise a scheme is now under way for example to erect seventynine barriers at the tidal inlets where the sea and the lagoon meet these would be raised by means of compressed air at the time of dangerously high tides the proposal is controversial however and is opposed by many venetians who claim that a tideless lagoon would be in danger of becoming a stagnant pond it has also been argued that so much money has been expended on this project that the needs of the city itself have largely been ignored but venice is now for better or worse part of italy when it lost its autonomy it forfeited its authority it cannot control its own destiny and when it lost its uniqueness did it also lose its energy peggy guggenheim once said that when venice is flooded it is even more truly beloved like ophelia it seems to float expiring on the water all that is hopeless and all that is hoped for yet we have seen throughout this book that venice has always been in peril its existence most fragile it is a manmade structure relying on the vicissitudes of the natural world yet it has endured its survival is exemplary let us hope that its will to survive will remain a potent source of energy here ends the history lesson death in venice at the foot of the baroque campanile of the church of s maria formosa there is sculpted over the doorway a hideous mask of decay and suffering ruskin believed that it is well that we should see and feel the full horror of it in this spot and know what pestilence it was that came and breathed upon her beauty until it melted away for him the deformed visage was an image of the decline of venice from the time of the renaissance in fact the stone mask is more interesting than that it is an exact representation of the face of one suffering from neurofibromatosis or von recklinghausens disease venice is associated with death it is in large part a dilapidated city the water lapping against crumbling brick and plaster john addington symonds in a venetian medley recounts that the blackness of the water whispers in our ears a tale of death it is a city of shadows the city is linked with pestilence too and with the hidden knife of the assassin there is still a rio terra degli assassini the most famous narrative to have emerged from the city is still thomas manns death in venice threnody suits the city well venice is doomed that is the tale the waters tell in the city of faded stone byron meditated on decay oh venice he wrote venice when thy marble walls are level with the waters there shall bea cry of nations oer thy sunken halls it was a place of slime and ooze and mould marinetti described it as a putrefying city a magnificent sore from the past for ruskin it was already a ghost floating upon the sea its silence was forbidding its ruins were somehow more deathlike than elsewhere because there was no touch of nature about them with the promise of regeneration these ruins of stone are final no moss or grass will cover them they are what shelley described as a windowless deformed and dreary pile in the last man mary shelley depicted a similar scene of desolation as the tide ebbed sullenly from out the broken portals and violated halls of venice in a city that seemed to have deserted the changing world of time the only fate awaiting it is apocalypse it will be submerged it will descend into the water silently and permanently it is the image of the city as the final end of all human achievement and aspiration wordsworth wrote a sonnet on venice that ended men are we and must grieve when even the shadeof that which once was great is passed away i do not feel any romance in venice ruskin told his father it is simply a heap of ruins in more remote ages too the venetian chronicles are filled with accounts of churches or bridges or houses suddenly disintegrating and collapsing in piles of dust and broken stone in the eighteenth century the city became part of the cult of picturesque ruins there were ruins even in the fourteenth century many houses were left in a decayed state and never restored there are of course no ruins of the classical pastalmost alone among italian cities venice has no such relicsbut rather the slow and continuing decay of a still to be apprehended beauty the city does not have the security of great and primordial ancestors that is why decay and dissolution in venice are somehow more beautiful than the most splendid edifices elsewhere they are part of its unique enchantment they are part of the sweet melancholy of transience they are reminiscent of the human frame as it moves towards the tomb it was for henry james the most beautiful sepulchre in the world where the past has been laid to rest with such tenderness such a sadness of resignation the churches are filled with graves there was once a campiello dei morti but the name has been changed to campiello nuovo there was a bridge of the dead but it is now called the bridge of the tailors there is still a calle della morte yet the cemetery may also become a metaphor in the eighteenth century venice was described as a tomb of noblemen in which healthy people are locked up there is now an island of the dead close to the city s michele once sustained a monastery devoted to learning but in the nineteenth century a cemetery was constructed here so that the cadavers would no longer be close to the living population of venice the bodies are placed in little marble drawers like an enormous sideboard of mortality the church of s michele built some four centuries earlier is like a whitened sepulchre guarding the site its recumbent corpses outnumber by many times the inhabitants of the city after a certain number of years the dead are taken up their skeletons removed to an island of bones known as s ariano is this not the real laguna morte the dead lagoon among the skulls and bones slink rats and reptiles bony plants spring up amid the decay there is a cult of death in venice the futurist movement of italy believed that it was the temple of the cult of ladorazione della morte the worship of which was the foundation and being of the city in its manifesto the movement declared that it was time to fill the stinking little canals with the rubble of the tottering infected old palaces let us burn the gondolas rocking chairs for idiots the entire city was a great sewer of traditionalism the funerals were once very magnificent even in the beginning the rites of the dead in venice resembled those of egypt and of assyria rather than of any italian city the corpse was laid on a floor that had been covered in ashes the bereaved were obliged to enter all the paroxysms of grief howling and moaning and it became a custom for the relict to lie across the threshold of the house to prevent the corpse of the loved one from being removed he or she was then ritually dragged away the corpse was generally carried through the streets with its face and feet bare the funeral processions were accompanied by banners torches and flambeaux while the rooms of the house of the departed were draped in black velvet the family of the dear departed were then expected to cry and scream throughout the entire funeral service it is another example of the eastern affiliations of the city anyone who died a virgin male or female was buried with a green garland around the head anyone who has seen the film dont look now will recall the hearse being carried across the water in a dark gondola when the cemetery island was first in use there grew up a tradition of almost triumphal processions to the centre of the dead there were funereal gondolas designed for that purpose with five gondoliers in gilded uniforms one of them stood at the front of the hearse and coffin with a staff of office while at the prow and stern were the sculpted images of saints and prophets even for the more modest funerals the gondoliers wore scarves and sashes of black while the hearse and coffin were heaped with bright flowers there is a genuine morbidity in the folk tales and superstitions of the city louis xii of france said that the venetians were too afraid of death to succeed in war they had a merchant fear of violence and insecurity the city is surrounded by islands to which the mad and the dangerous have always been expelled in venice jan morris wrote that venetians are fascinated by dead things horrors prisons freaks and malformations that is perhaps because the city itself is a freak and a prison there is also a suspicion abroad that it is already a dead city there are people who seem physically to feel the onset of disease on their arrival in venice the french writer maurice barrès declared that as soon as he had stepped out of the railway station and walked to the gondola standfeeling the wind of the lagoon upon his facehe knew that i have taken quinine in vain to protect me i believe that i can feel within me the reemergence of millions of bacteria one sees everywhere in venice the conquests of death wagner glimpsed this too when he stepped into a gondola wagner died in venice browning died here too diaghilev died here there are some who expire here by proxy dante died in ravenna from a fever he contracted in venice byron had decided to end his days in the city but events elsewhere overtook him it is presumably a matter of statistical probability that a certain amount of artists would die in this most artistic of cities but the truth is that many people come to venice precisely in order to die henry james intuited the fatal appeal of the city in the character of the suffering milly theale in the wings of the dove i think i should like she said to die here there is something consoling about death near water in a city that is itself in the throes of decay to die in a grand venetian house as did wagner and browning is to inhabit a vast funerary monument without the expense of building one the perpetual sound of bells is a rehearsal for death it can be a melancholy and enervating place it is not a city for the old or for the ill or for the mournful the atmosphere can induce lassitude and depression when the french painter léopold robert committed suicide in venice his compatriot george sand blamed it on the atmosphere on hearing the music and the singing during a venetian evening anton chekhov wished to weep it has been a city of tears wagner was thrown into a mood of extreme melancholy when he first arrived in venice when the irish balladeer tom moore visited byron he instantly hated the city and declared it to be a sad place that is the reaction of many travellers who become afflicted by a strange and sudden gloom even in the carnival air of the eighteenth century the underlying mood was declared to be one of melancholy why else would you want to make so much show of gaiety in the nineteenth century the english residents of venice warned their compatriots on their arrival not to spend too much time in the city it was supposed that a long residence would lead to a morbid depression of spirits there is a cultural as well as a psychological explanation for this mournfulness the english travellers believed at the time that the whole history of venice was one of loss and decaythat the city had lost its purpose had become hopeless and aimless it was a way perhaps of anticipating the decline of england and of the british empire there is melancholy too induced by the presence of water water represents memory and passing time water is an emblem of oblivion so it attracts those who wish to hide from the world it attracts those who wish to forget and be forgotten there is something about the broken state of venice that acts as a refuge and consolation for those who have failed in the struggle for life the vast and often silent lagoon still broods over the city for those departing for the east merchant or pilgrim this place was the last port on the western shore all those farewells perhaps have left a tangible sense of nostalgia in the air those of an atavistic turn of mind may even regret the loss of the life of the past so painfully apparent in the sometimes garish streets of contemporary venice cocteau described it as a sick and fevered city floating on stagnant waters discharging miasmal vapours it was believed that the mixture of salt water and fresh water at the edges of the lagoon created noxious air and actively propagated malaria through the agency of the mosquito in the early centuries too the use of fish traps and wooden piles meant that the water could no longer flow freely other once flourishing towns and islands were soon surrounded by pestiferous marshes the mosquitoes of venice in the summer months can still wreak havoc the correspondence of sir henry wotton is filled with allusions to what he considered to be the unhealthy air he was much weakened by sweats which are cheap in this air his chest pains were more increased by this vaporous air he felt himself prone to hypochondria by the very inclination of this watery seat venice also induced in him my infirmity of the spleen the stench of venice especially in the summer months was remarkable in the eighteenth century the city was known for its filthy state the rubbish was heaped up in corners by the bridges while the canals were the receptacle of human waste of every description some of the smaller canals were little better than rivulets of ordure throughout the centuries the rubbish was discharged into the canals in defiance of all the sanitary legislation of the city on the understanding that the tide would scour them clean this laxity spread so that housewives would simply throw their rubbish into the streets hester thrale in the s remarked that disgust gets the better of every other sensation the basilica was filthy and malodorous all the incense from all the altars could not disguise the rank smell the prison reformer john howard in the same period as hester thrale described the city as a stinkpot charged with the very virus of hell goethe noticed that on days of rain a disgusting sludge made up of mud and excrement collected underfoot the venetians themselves were considered to be dirty and unhygienic this was a time when smell was itself considered to be the token of the presence of disease it filled gibbon with satiety and disgust it is not perhaps surprising that most of these reports come from the eighteenth century venice had not suddenly become noisomeit always was and in some respects still is a malodorous citybut it was only in the eighteenth century that travellers began to comment upon such matters before that date stench human or otherwise was a matter of course it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the association between smell and disease was plausibly denied one doctor writing in remarked that the many odours of venice were harmless being caused by the decomposition by drainage of the sulphates of the salt water into sulphides than which there are no worsesmelling gasses it was one explanation but it was not necessarily reassuring ralph waldo emerson in the nineteenth century noticed a smell as of bilgewater and in the late twentieth century donna leon the author of crime novels set in venice described in the anonymous venetian the penetrating stench of corruption that always lurked beneath the surface this may be taken in a metaphorical as well as literal sense in the same period another crime writer michael dibdin wrote in dead lagoon of a canal where the fetid odour of the disturbed mud hung heavy in the air a noxious miasma so strong that it was almost tangible the writers of crime are drawn to this noxious city where fugitive odours can be sensed beneath the beauties of the surface at times of famine and dearth particularly in the early decades of the sixteenth century the poor were struck with fever before they suffered from malnutrition fever was in the air there were other diseases gastroenteritis typhus and influenza came and went with the various seasons diarrhoea and weakness of the eyes were considered to be endemic a sixteenthcentury physician blamed the ailments of venice on sexual excess and gluttony then in a previously unknown disorder known as grippe laid low the whole of venice the great council was for the first time in its history empty grippe seems to have covered a multitude of symptoms but the available evidence suggests that it was a virulent form of influenza and then of course there was the disease known colloquially as the death it is reported that the plague came first to venice of all european cities when a venetian galley returned to its home port in the autumn of after a trading voyage to caffa on the black sea it carried within its hold certain black rats troubled by a flea known as yersinia pestis the market of trade between east and west became the entrepôt of death venice exported the epidemic too it is said that the great plague of london more than three centuries later began when two venetians expired in a tenement house in the north of drury lane so the black death of europe began by the spring of the venetian authorities appalled at the massacre of its citizens appointed a board of three men to consider diligently all possible ways to preserve the health of the city and avoid the corruption of the air this is the first recorded instance of public health administration and legislation in europe from an early date too a network of public hospitals was established in the city there were many pious and charitable institutions catering for poor women for infants for orphans and for the dangerously ill by for example special wards had been set up for patients suffering from tuberculosis these were the first in the world to be so determined there was already a guild of doctors and apothecaries by and fifty years later the state was paying an annual salary to twelve doctorsurgeons in an academy of medicine was established in that century doctors were treated very well they were lightly taxed and were permitted to dress in any fashion they wished so they wore white silk stockings and coats of lace they were also allowed to sport as many rings on their fingers as they desired they were under strict instruction to supervise the work of pharmacists and apothecaries but on no account to share in their profits the pharmacy was of ancient date in venice sustained in part by the flow of remedies from trading ports such as cairo and byzantium from the east came that most magical of cures known as triacle a potent mixture of amber and oriental spices that was supposed to treat all ills from plague to snake bite from this came the english word treacle the economic and social consequences of the first onset of the plague were profound but there was a difference in the city of the lagoons the black death indirectly triggered the revolt of the jacquerie in france and the peasants revolt in england but there was no such insurrection or rebellion in venice the people remained quiescent nevertheless the shortage of workers was so severe that in october the venetian government announced that it would grant citizenship to anyone who settled in the city within the next year it was an unparalleled and unrepeated offer in the annals of the city there are recorded no less than seventy visitations of the death a plague of took off one fifth of the population and venetian diarists noted that the afflicted were dying on the streets and that their bodies were floating on the canals but the worst distemper of all occurred in and when it is estimated that a third of the population was lost from july to february people died in venice for fear of contagion wives abandoned husbands and sons left behind mothers titian who had in the course of his long life never suffered from any dangerous sickness was one of the victims the nearby islands of lazzaretto nuovo and lazzaretto vecchio previously the home of lepers were given over to the victims of the plague those who were healthy but suspect such as travellers who had just returned from foreign cities were confined to nuovo for twentytwo days those caught flouting the restriction were banished from the city for several years those already suffering from the sickness were despatched to vecchio where the conditions were predictably fearful the dormitories were filled with screaming some of the sick threw themselves into the surrounding water clouds hung over the little island from the burning of the dead the city itself was plunged into one of those fits of selfhatred that were the dark side of its belief in its sacred destiny the undefiled virgin had suddenly become in the eyes of one venetian poet orrido mostro or fearful monster the vice and luxury of the citizens had called down the vengeance of god yet the status of venice as the ultimate model of the city was also held against it all cities are meant to be sick all cities are supposed to harbour death and disease so in myth and story venice itself had to be an actively unhealthy place the distemper repeated its visits from july to october people expired in the summer of that first year people fled from the city in order to escape the peculiar cloying and oppressive heat that is itself an inducement to fever at the time of plague a range of saints was invoked to provide divine protection but the saints were of no great assistance the doctors of venice clothed themselves in black robes coated with wax and aromatic oils they wore a hood and cowl over their head large glasses to protect their eyes and a long beaklike nose with a filter at its end they looked themselves like ghouls but by a curious act of transference this sinister outfit became a popular costume of the venetian carnival it was a memento mori so natural to the carnivalesque but it was also a manner of laughing at death yet in general those who mastered the climate of venice enjoyed extraordinarily good health the patrician population of venice at least characteristically lived to a great age the mildness of the climate was supposed to lead to lassitude and sensuality in appearance the venetians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and perhaps beyond were characterised by softness of flesh and roundness of form their skin was considered to be of a velvety whiteness yet appearances can sometimes be deceptive the chroniclers of the city remarked upon the vivacity of spirit and the impulsive nervous energy of the citizens just as the venetians had formed a city out of adverse circumstances so they had formed a firm character out of the constant need to defend and maintain it life as was claimed in the nineteenth century is sustained by excitation many of the doges of venice were elected when they had reached their nineties the city was the nurse of old men and has rightly been considered to be in essence a gerontocracy i never in any place observed fynes morisson wrote in the early years of the seventeenth century more old men or so many senators venerable for their grey haires and aged gravity there is a report in the venetian archives of the abbess of a convent delivering a complaint to the reigning doge in the summer of the abbess was years old titian died at the age of ninetyone while tintoretto was seventysix and bellini eightysix guardi was eightyone and longhi eightythree these were great ages in their respective epochs their age is a measure of their endless activity that elasticity and energy that are the hallmarks of the venetian genius it was said in general that venetians lived longer than other men the citizens and the poorer population according to machiavelli kept illness at bay through their continual industry the expenditure of energy in the business of life might withstand the assaults of sickness the absence of transport in the modern era means that it is necessary to walk through the streets and over the bridges so contemporary venetians suffer from relatively less high blood pressure and heart disease the damp air however makes them more liable to rheumatoid afflictions it was a city of death in quite another sense its judicial murders were renowned throughout europe for their secrecy and swiftness those who had offended the state were despatched with efficiency on a march morning in the venetian diarist marino sanudo heard mutterings on the street to the effect that justice had been done when he passed through saint marks square he saw a high government official hanging between the two columns of the piazzetta the official accused of treason had been hanged in the night without notice given to the populace he had been dressed up in his uniform with great billowing sleeves almost three hundred years later the english artist james northcote was shocked to discover a body suspended between the columns bearing a notice for treason against the state it was reported that if the supply of the condemned grew low the authorities would borrow corpses from the hospitals and string them up in order to overawe the populace this is very doubtful the ceremonies of public execution were designed to emphasise the fact that the state itself took on a quasireligious role as avenger of evil the condemned was accompanied to the block or gallows by the members of a venetian guild of death wearing black hoods he or she then turned to an image of venice and intoned the salve regina before the last act the doge was present wearing his richest and most elaborate clothes the people stood in silent order as if they were members of a congregation it was a sacred ceremony designed to purify the collective state of an errant individual these public executions had nothing of the disorder or gaiety of tyburn where individual felons were cheered and applauded as they made their path to the gallows in venice they were solemn communal rites many internal enemies of the city were strangled in the cells of the ducal palace however their bodies secretly consigned to the waters of the lagoon when a nephew of the doge was in seen in a gondola with a spanish diplomat he was taken to the cells of his uncles palace and swiftly despatched behind the island of s giorgio maggiore was a deep channel known as the canale orfano where the bodies were released into the sea one general a mercenary lured by vast pay to the venetian side was suspected of dealing with the enemy he was recalled in great state to the ducal palace on the pretence of consultation and on arrival was directed towards a secret door that is not the way he said yes yes he was told it is perfectly so the corridor took him to the prison cell i am lost he is supposed to have said there was an old venetian saying a dead man makes no war there was no mercy either for any venetian admiral or commander who failed the state the sentences were often very severe in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries false coiners were burned alive the sons of two senators convicted of singing blasphemous songs had their tongues ripped from their throats and their hands cut off a friar convicted of impregnating no less than fifteen nuns was burned at the stake two priests accused of treason were buried alive face down on top of one another the cruelty is somehow reminiscent of eastern practice there was a novel method of death by starvation the condemned man was placed in a wooden cage with iron bars which was then suspended from a pole above the campanile in saint marks square he was fed on diminishing amounts of bread and water conveyed to him by a cord until he expired from thirst or hunger or exposure in full view of the crowds that thronged the area the venetians were also well known for their methods of secret assassination in the council of ten decided to poison the duke of milan and agreed to test the liquid on two pigs the results are not recorded in a venetian doctor concocted the quintessence of plague to use against the turkish enemy it is the first instance in recorded history of an attempt at biological warfare it was in fact popularly supposed in the capitals of europe that venice employed a trained band of assassins ready to strike at their enemies wherever they could the story was not true but it represented the deep suspicion that venice aroused in other states as the power and wealth of the city began to disappear the hostility also abated it was said in the eighteenth century that the poison used by the officials of venice had congealed and that the recipe for its manufacture had been mislaid if the reports of state violence were ever true do they reflect a state of violence also the nature of the violence is in itself important it was identified by the authorities as that which abrogated the peace and honour of the society the rights of the victims to use a contemporary expression were seldom invoked crimes against the state such as treason were treated with swift and brutal punishment lesser crimes against the state were treated with no less severity some of the most telling punishments for example were reserved for those who insulted the city a genoese sailor on arrival was heard declaring that he would like nothing better than to wash his hands in venetian blood he was immediately seized and hanged the soles of his feet cut off so that his own blood might be sacrificed to the stones of venice when in a venetian marco rizo declared that he wished to throw the nobles or dogs into prison he was arrested and his tongue was cut out before he was banished from the city for ever crimes against property were considered more important than crimes of passion torture was regularly used in cases of theft for example but not in cases of murder anyone convicted of robbery more than once was automatically hanged it seems likely that rape was relatively common particularly the rape of workingclass women by patrician men but the crime merited only the mild punishment of eight days imprisonment the rapist being freed when he had forfeited a sum equivalent to the womans dowry it was not considered to be important the court records show that women under attack would often call fire rather than rape because the threat provoked more interest the patricians were often the most violent class of venetian society although their peers were inclined to moderate any punishment against them if their crimes did not threaten the status quo the young patricians in particular could be ferocious casanova always carried a knife with him that as he said all honest men in venice carry to defend their lives the citizens and the people were more docile there was a large police force and the popolani were themselves vigilant and fierce in protecting public safety in a heavily populated mercantile city it was in everyones best interest to maintain order there was room for party faction but not for gangs the individual criminal was not fêted as for example jack sheppard was in london in any case in a city ringed with water where was the criminal to flee is it surprising therefore that many people go mad in venice this author has heard howling as if from the damned coming from the tiny tenement houses of the district of castello madness afflicts islanders more insidiously than others there has never been a madhouse in the city itself that might be considered to be too provocative the insane were instead incarcerated on the various islands of the lagoon the female mad for example were from the eighteenth century locked up on the island of s clemente where for various transgressions they could be suspended in cages above the water the male asylum on the island of s servolo was immortalised by shelley what we beholdshall be the madhouse and its belfry towersaid maddalo and even at this hourthose who may cross the water hear that bellwhich calls the maniacs each one from his cellto vespers from the grated windows of their cells the mad used to call out to the passing gondolas the city itself can be said to exhibit certain psychopathic tendencies it has always been a city in a state of high anxiety ever since its difficult and dangerous origin in the waters it has felt itself to be besieged by all the forces of the world it was once literally isolated and it has always suffered from great ontological uncertainty it is not difficult to understand the reasons for this if you can imagine new york or paris suspended upon water you may be able to understand the deep fear engendered by the position water is unstable water is unpredictable that is why venice has always emphasised its stability and permanence throughout its history it has considered itself to be under threat it conveys images of fragility and vulnerability and thus insistently elicits responses of caring and nurturing in the twelfth century a number of earth tremors sent the citizens into a panic in the island of malamocco was overwhelmed by water and it was believed that the city of venice would suffer the same fate in the thirteenth century the danger of fire was almost hysterically emphasised it was considered to be the enemy within smouldering in concealment ready to break out in the shadows of the night in the fifteenth century the city was considered to be in great danger from the silting of the lagoon and the drying of the canals it was said that it became more fragile with every passing year in the latter half of the century it was believed that venice was in imminent peril because of its sinfulness the judgement of god would not be long delayed there was a terror of total submersion as a sign of divine anger there has never been a time when venice was not in peril in every century it was concluded that the city could not survive deep and endemic anxiety is perhaps the key to all of the citys actionsits absorption of the mainland and its acquisition of an empire were attempts to reduce uncertainty the slow grave government of the patricians was in effect a defence mechanism the venetians hated unpredictability there was a genuine fear of the future the acquisitiveness of the city the lust after gold and other riches can perhaps be explained as the miser scrooge of a christmas carol was explainedyou fear the world too much yet its great triumph the essential source of its civic pride in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries its claim to enduring fame lay in one simple factit had placed itself in a vulnerable position and yet it had remained inviolate what other nation on earth could claim as much it has always been a selfconscious indeed a selfobsessed city it has also been a selfdeluded city it has lied about itself it has woven myths of itself it has fabricated a history utterly at odds with the true one it was at the mercy of conflicting impulses it preached civic liberty for example at the same time as it demanded total control over its population it could give all the appearance of festive gaiety but at the centre of its polity was commercial calculation there was selfhatred too in the numerous calls for the people of venice to eschew the temptations of luxury and sensuality and prodigality the message was that we must be pure we must ourselves be inviolate like the city we must be above reproach that is why any threat of disorder or danger was expelled to the margins the fluctuations in the public mood were severe any sudden reversal or unexpected defeat threw the people into despair the sixteenthcentury diarist marino sanudo often used the refrain that the whole city was mightily downcast there was always the fear of conspiracy in a human being this would be considered a dangerous symptom of psychic disorder yet venice can be said to represent all cities it embodied the anxieties that afflict citiesthe fear of disease the fear of contamination the fear of being for ever cut off from the natural world it represents too the anxieties concerning citiestheir luxury their power their aggression it is a fearful place xi city of myth the map unrolls there are many maps of venice not all of them very reliable it must be one of the most mapped cities in the world and yet in a sense it is unmappable the calli are too labyrinthine the connections are too circuitous there are just too many alleys and passageways to be set down on paper the city does not in any case exist on one level but on the canals along the bridges beside the firstfloor windows an all too familiar sight is that of tourists brandishing maps and looking up vainly at the names of streets and bridges they may find themselves somewhere that is not there it is impossible for the stranger not to get lost in venice cities of the mind in any case cannot be found on any map the first surviving map of venice where the eventual shape of the city can clearly be seen was produced in the early twelfth century the most famous map however remains jacopo de barbaris birdseye view of this was the map that created the image of venice as significant form its detail was unparalleled its execution unrivalled yet it was a symbolic rather than naturalistic representation it imparted a form of sacred geometry and in the process emphasised the role of artifice in the creation of the city mercury sitting on a cloud above the city with the axis of the rialto market and the basilica of saint mark directly beneath him announces that i mercury shine favourably upon this above all other markets neptune gazes at him from the waters of the lagoon declaring that i neptune reside here smoothing the waters of this port the city itself takes the form of a dolphin disporting on the waves it is also deserted lending credence to the belief that venice was more important than any of its passing inhabitants they were merely the shadows upon its walls the map was of course useless for any practical purpose as another fifteenthcentury venetian cartographer fra mauro put it my map was only one version of reality it would only be of any use if it were employed as an instrument of the imagination it occurred to me that the world itself should be seen as an elaborate artifice and the expression of a will without end many venetian maps were also an expression of the citys mercantile interests they were designed not simply to outline the trading routes to cathay or trebizond but to facilitate the passage of trade in places where no one from the city had ever traded before there was much competition for example to find a sea route to the spices of the indies on the back wall of the loggia beside the rialto market were frescoes composing a mappamundi in the loggia itself was kept a copy of the travels of marco polo the venetians were expert and famous cartographers they were looking for fixity and certainty in their watery world it is easy to understand their obsession in a city where map and reality rarely meet mapmaking represents the desire for order and control it is another aspect of the allobserving government the venetian authorities for example commissioned many detailed maps on all aspects of the provinces on the mainland under their dominion it was perhaps in this spirit of conquest that a venetian cartographer wrote the first essay on landscape painting there were no landscapes in venice landscapes could only be created out of colonised territory in another venetian mapmaker andrea bianco first intimated the existence of the americas by drawing an island in the approximate position of brazil a venetian giovanni contarini executed the first accurate map of africa at the beginning of the sixteenth century maps of the world covered the walls of the houses of the prominent merchants and patricians the apartments of the ducal palace were decorated with maps that outlined the trading routes of venice across the known world in a painting of the mideighteenth century by pietro longhi the geography lesson a fashionable patrician lady consults a globe with a pair of compasses in her right hand an open atlas lies at her feet fra mauro himself a benedictine monk from murano created a famous mappamundi complete with symbolic detail and scriptural reference he declared that he had created it for the meditation of the illustrious rulers of the city by the middle of the fifteenth century there was a workshop in venice devoted wholly to the production of maps the venetian mapmakers were particularly renowned for their portolano charts maps of coastlines designed specifically for the use of sailors in there was established in venice an academy of the argonauts that specialised in the publication of maps and globes it is no wonder therefore that a copy of the travels of marco polo was kept in the rialto polo is the most famous of all venetians with the possible exception of casanova and he is the most famous of all travellers his was in one sense a typical venetian business story he was part of a trading family there were once two brothers born in the venetian parish of s giovanni grisostomo who were at the head of a mercantile house in constantinople it was a branch of their family business they were patricians but in venice patricians thrived on trade in niccolò and matteo polo at a time of great turmoil in the byzantine city decided to travel east in order to find new markets they took with them a stock of jewels well hidden in their clothes and began a long journey into central asia they made their way to the city of bukhara in the region now known as uzbekistan where wars and rumours of war delayed their progress for almost three years it was their good fortune however to become acquainted with some envoys on their way to the court of the great khan the lord of all the tartars in the world it was not an opportunity to be missed so they travelled to the city of kublai khan the emperor was courteous and inquisitive he questioned them closely about the laws and customs of their society at the end of their stay in peking he entrusted them with a message for the pope and requested them to return to him with oil taken from the lamps that burned before the sepulchre of christ in jerusalem it took them another three and a half years to make their way back to venice they had not seen their city for fifteen years and on their return niccolò polo found in the household a son who was now sixteen he had been named after the guardian saint of venice eventually they received letters of papal blessing and privilege from the new pope gregory x and were able to take a phial of the precious oil then they returned to the court of kublai khan with young marco polo as part of their company once more their journey lasted for three and a half years yet the most intriguing part is yet to tell twentyfour years later three strangers arrived in the parish of s giovanni grisostomo they wore coats of coarse wool like tartar warriors they had long hair and long beards their skin harshly burned with long exposure marco polo together with his father and uncle had finally returned home they were not recognised as members of the ca polo they spoke a barbarous venetian they would very likely have been removed from the parish as imposters then marco put the matter to the proof he took the three coats of homespun wool and ripped them open sewn within them were multitudes of precious jewelsrubies sapphires diamonds emeraldsthat they had acquired through the generosity of the great khan the venetians were of course instantly convinced by this lavish display of wealth and according to the chronicler received the travellers with the greatest honour and reverence marco polo became known as marco millione and the courtyard of his house became known as the corte millione recent excavations on the site of his family house have revealed the laying of new foundations that date from the time of polos return his money did not remain in jewels the world knows that the story does not stop there marco was a great patriot and at his own expense fitted out a galley for the war against the genoese at the battle of curzola in september polo was captured and taken he was incarcerated in a genoese gaol where he lay for about a year during that time he became known for his fabulous stories of distant lands and he found an amanuensis an old man from pisa known as rusticiano took down his narrative in a curious antique french borrowed from the romances the written account has all the marks of verbal deliverythis is enough upon that matter now i will tell you of something else now let us leave the nation of mosul and i will tell you about the great city of baldoc but first i must tell you the manuscript was copied it began to spread but after his imprisonment marco polo returned to a quiet and obscure life in his native city engaged in nothing more than the usual commercial routine he presented one copy of his book to a visiting french knight but there is no record of any other connection with the work that has made him immortal he died in at the age of sixtynine on his deathbed he declared that he had not told half of the things that he had seen it was once believed that his stories were just thatstoriesbut in recent years it has become more and more evident that he was in fact giving a true record of the nations and cities through which he travelled he was practical and prudent clearheaded and with an eye for detail he also has an almost childlike energy and curiosity that permitted him to survive many years of wandering among bewilderingly strange peoples he was very much a venetian we might almost deem him to be a venetian hero except that the city detested heroic individuals as a threat to the wellbeing of the state from the narrative of his travels it is clear that polo journeyed across the whole longitude of asia on behalf of kublai khan eager to know the details of his empire only a venetian perhaps could have carried out such a mission he was the first traveller to reveal the wealth and greatness of china to describe the steppes of mongolia and the fastness of tibet he wrote of burma and of siam of java and of india he expatiates on the sorcerers of pashai and the idolaters of kashmir he narrates the battle between genghis khan and prester john his was in many respects a miraculous journey but polo was really following a venetian tradition diplomats and other officials were required to give detailed written reports or relazioni of the foreign cities they had visited polos book was in part intended to provide the venetians with an object lesson in good governance it could be said in fact that a few years after the travellers return the venetian government did introduce some of the principles if not the details of the mongol system they were following the precepts of the great khan the great lord of lords whom polo describes as the most potent man as regards forces and lands and treasure that exists in the world or ever has existed from the time of our first father adam until this day the merchants of venice too needed precise relation of the conditions of local societies and local economies what were their needs what could they sell just as they were trained to appraise goods with an objective eye so they were keenly observant of local conditions they needed above all else information it is appropriate then that polo particularly observed the trade in all the cities that he visited of the city of kubenan in persia he wrote that there is much iron and steel and ondanique and they make steel mirrors of great size and beauty once he had described how people earn their livings he would often add that there is nothing else worth mentioning the venetian patricians were professional travellers predominantly in their role as merchants unlike their contemporaries in florence or in hamburg they could not survive without accurate knowledge of the coasts and seas so the spirit of travel was always part of venetian consciousness how could it not be when the city faced outwards to the adriatic and the mediterranean by the ninth century venetian traders had visited egypt the euxine region and the sea of azov in the early fifteenth century there was a venetian serving as a knight in denmark a century later a venetian shipbuilder was prospering in the yards of elefante in india there are travellers tales of greenland and of tartary pietro querini sailed into the arctic ocean in forty years later giosafatte barbaro touched the shores of the caspian sea when john cabot a citizen of venice by choice and state decree made landfall in the new world he planted the flag of saint mark beside the english standard it is worth mentioning perhaps that sebastian cabot was born in venice he went on to discover labrador in and was to be found in the lower reaches of the rio della plata in in the middle of the fifteenth century a young venetian patrician alvise da mosto travelled to senegal and discovered the cape verde islands he wrote down the details of his journeys in true venetian fashion since he was the first that from the most noble city of venice have set forth to sail the ocean beyond the straits of gibraltar towards the south to the land of the negroes he was first and foremost a trader however exchanging horses and wool and silk for slaves and parrots the object of the venetian travellers was to achieve both profit and honour social authority and esteem were derived from commercial wealth and these journeys of discovery were designed to acquire all of them that is why many merchants kept journals of their progress it was a way of confirming their exploits and their diaries acted as memorials for the family business the first travellers accounts were published at venice in the fifteenth century in was issued an anthology of travel writing entitled journeys from venice to tana persia india and constantinople the first steps were taken from the city of the lagoon maps transcribe frontiers venice was always a frontier it was called the hinge of europe it has the essence of a boundarya liminal spacein all of its dealings it is a perpetual threshold it is half land and half sea it is the middle place between the ancient imperial cities of rome and byzantium it was the place where italy mingled with the orient and where in more general terms europe mingled with africa it was the place to take ship for the levant and leave behind the world of christendom that is why some considered it to be the sacred mission of venice to unite western christendom to the rest of the worldto the greek christians of the bosphorus as well as to the adherents of islam and hinduism goethe described it as the marketplace of the morning and evening lands by which he meant that the city poised between west and east is the median point of the rising and the setting suns when the empire was divided in the time of charlemagne the lagoons of venice were ascribed neither to the west nor to the east according to the venetian historian bernardo giustiniani they were left inviolate and intact almost as certain holy places he went on to say that these places were left as kinds of boundaries between both emperors in the medieval period the postal service provided by venetian galleys was the only means of communication between the courts of germany and of constantinople the first images of the muslim world came from venice it was a frontier too between the sacred and the profane the public spaces of the city were liminal areas between piety and patriotism the boundaries between past and present were illdefined just as the boundaries between private and public were endlessly transgressed this was the place where catholics and protestants jews and christians turks and europeans roman and orthodox all met and mingled all the civilisations that made up the mediterraneangraecoroman muslim judaic and christianfound a focus in venice it was said of venetian painters of the fifteenth century that they had effected a synthesis between the tuscan and flemish styles of art the city was the doorway between the cold north and the warm south first fashioned for trade but then a means of access for the general business of life that flowed across europe venice in every sense represented cultural and social heterogeneity by some it was considered to be oriental with the basilica of saint mark as the very model of a mosque and the rialto as a souk that was why the city was so distrusted by other european nations it contained within itself intimations of the other it is pertinent and suggestive that the arabic words that penetrated the venetian dialect are largely concerned with tradeso we have zecca mint and doana customs house and tarifaor concerned with luxuries such as sofa and divan and caravanserai alas venetian race pius ii wrote in how much of your ancient character have you lost too much intercourse with the turks has made you the friend of the mohammedans the façade of the ducal palace facing the lagoon is muslim in inspiration there are in fact borrowings and adaptationsof islamic architecture and islamic artthroughout the city even the venetian colours ultramarine blue and gold are derived from the middle east the trade routes the organised seagoing caravans even the craft guilds of venice were muslim in origin there was a genuine sympathy with and admiration for islamic civilisation that was not unconnected with distaste for papal pomp in the paintings of carpaccio for example venetian interiors are shown to be decorated with objects of eastern provenance the throne of the virgin in gentile bellinis virgin and child enthroned is placed carefully on a turkish carpet or prayer rug venice was in many respects akin to byzantium it borrowed both concepts and practices from the ancient city to the rule of which it had once submitted it was even known as the second constantinople it was a hierarchical rather than a feudal society the influence of byzantine civilisation was noticeable in the way that the young girls of venice were kept secluded and in the custom of separating men and women at church services it can be seen too in the stiffness and pomp of the religious ceremonies where the rituals and relics of the byzantine church are to be found in abundance there is something oriental too about the stateliness and symbolism of venetian political life with its elaborate bureaucratic machinery and its solemn practices of election was the doge not also a form of emperor he could be seen in a similarly sacred light in holy week the doge impersonated the last days of christ this was also the role of the byzantine emperor the basilica of saint mark was based upon the model of the apostoleion in constantinople the chroniclers of venice also report that the church was the work of an architect from that city but the claim is disputed there seems to be no doubt however that there were muslim artisans resident at the time the religious polity of venice with its notion of a state church is based upon byzantine example the head of that church was known as the patriarch as at constantinople there are many other derivations the notion of the arsenal an arms manufactory funded by the government is taken from byzantine practice the long black cloak worn by the male patricians of the city is taken from the model of the byzantine kaftan the ritual scattering of coins to the people on the occasion of the election of the doge is a practice borrowed from the eastern emperors the art of keeping detailed records is surely derived from the early experience of byzantine bureaucracy the word itselfbyzantinehas become a synonym for excessive detail in venice too everything was committed to writing when venetian males grew beards at times of national or personal sorrow they were following their eastern contemporaries the love of puppets and of puppet theatre has an ancient ancestry of course italians in general have long maintained a tradition of puppetry and mask theatre but venetians acquired their love of puppets from the more spectral tradition of byzantium that emphasises the melancholy aspect of the inanimate doll until human desire gives it breath the huddled family until very recent times there was always a sense of brotherhood among the people of venice it was the merest cliché to state that they all represented one family everyone noticed it it manifested itself in an air of sociability the popolani were the children of the republic and the male patricians were their fathers goethe described the doge as the grandfather of the race the provision of public health care and the foundation of orphanages for fatherless children testify to the fact that the state considered itself to be in essence one extended family the governors of these institutions strove to create little families within the larger family this was the venetian way the degree of harmony can be overstated there were the usual disputes and enmities that occur in any enclosed community the venetians were not saints but there was none of that raucous disharmony or that partisan rancour that affected cities such as genoa and florence the affections and attitudes of the people were confined within a small and insular space it was natural and inevitable that social life would take a familial tone the topography of the city was seen as an immense family house james described it as a collective apartment and remarked upon the splendid common domicile familiar domestic and resonant it is said that napoleon coined the description of saint marks square as the finest drawing room in europe this was a family however that could never leave the house the family was itself the defining social force of venetian society political and commercial alliances were built upon the foundation of family life the phrase lhonorevolezza della casa the honour of the house was often used and quoted the success or failure of a political career depended in large part upon the influence of the patricians family the same namesvendramin barbo zen foscari and dandolo among themappear through centuries of venetian history they are far more enduring than the bacons or the cecils the great council was essentially a meeting of families tied together by sets of obligations and responsibilities it was temperamentally a place of accommodation and compromise therefore rather than a partisan assembly it was not an arena for the display of principle or ideology individual families were not able to form factions or excessively influence the results of elections they survived on the foundation of mutual dependence in law the venetian authorities considered the entire family to be responsible for the misdeeds of an individual member of the household the anonymous compiler of the cronica venetiarum in the middle of the fourteenth century described particular families just as if they were individuals with certain habits and characteristics the dandolos were audacious whereas the barberini were senseless sporting themselves throughout the world it was said that there never had been a rich barbo a poor mocenigo or a compassionate erizzo the same surname will occur among lists of the senate of the episcopal authorities of the great traders there was an obsession in venice with genealogy and in the fifteenth century libri doro or golden books were instituted to record patrician marriages and births the major agent of business in the city was the fraterna or family collective its ledgers would comprise household accounts and business accounts as part of the same equation brothers who lived together were treated as business partners unless they formally dissolved their association family businesses were considered to be more efficient and more responsive fathers and sons according to one patrician worked for each other with more love more honour more profit and less expense certainly the overheads could be cut there were many more bachelors in venetian society than anywhere else in italy in the fifteenth century for example more than half the adult male patricians of the city remained single when they died they left their property to the married brothers children thus keeping the business in the immediate family the household itself was considered to be an image of the state it was an institution in which the individual will was obliged to submit itself to the collective decision the husband held an impersonal authority the wife was meant simply to breed the children were ordained to silence and obedience masters and servants were bound together in a tight context of control without the family there would be no state without the state there would be no family the ideal of familial harmony was therefore very strong the statutes of the building commissioners of venice invoked love and fruitful happiness between good neighbours and dear friends the members of the confraternity of s giovanni evangelista desired grace through love of brotherhood while the stonecutters worked for the good and welfare of all we may compare the people of venice therefore to the bees working together in their hives of gold bees are obedient to the general purpose of the hive they compete but they do not struggle they are tireless in their work but there is no obvious coercion exercised upon them other than the search for the common good there are no civil wars in the feminine monarchy or the history of the bees published in charles butler named certain characteristics of the bees they were profitable laborious loyal swift nimble bold and cunning all of those qualities have also been ascribed to the venetian people pliny the elder remarked that bees are beelike because they recognise only what is in the common interest that is also the key to the understanding of venetian society we may also adduce the nature of venice from bee wilsons the hive in which she states that the beehive is a place where the world of nature and the world of artifice collapse into each other which is why it is so mysterious this is also the mystery of the city what is that common good for which the people of venice strive it might be called the necessity of survival itself the continuation of being there need be no other goal than the maintenance and preservation of life itself it is primordial manifest in the cry of a child and the gasp of a dying man on one point alone is there agreement the spanish ambassador wrote of venetian government in the early seventeenth century and that is the perpetuation of ruling all the other motives for human actionwealth power gloryare subordinate to this central need it is a principle of interrelation or interaction based upon organic force rather than mechanical power it is the flow of connected purposive activities that is the history of venice in history of course we trace separate events and attempt to designate causes to them but the central cause is beyond reach it is part of the inner being of things instead we may glimpse only a network of relations more important and more fundamental than the events or objects that are related the common good embodied the communal will and the communal sensitivity every individual was supposed to subordinate his or her interests to those of the state if it is possible for protocapitalism also to be a form of protocommunism then venice represents that condition but these terms may be anachronistic it may be better to subsume them within the context of the medieval collective and with the notion of the city as a human organism created in the image of god capitalism and communism then become instruments of the instinctive need to battle and to survive it was said that in a republic such as venice unlike a dukedom or kingdom the common good took precedence over the role and will of individuals the nature of the republic lies in a legal and institutional process not in power or in personality there was no single focus of power in venice it was a pluralistic force there were no despots in the whole course of venetian history the city itself was always preeminent the idea of the family manifests itself in four different instincts or beliefs the territory of the city is deemed to be a common heritage the government of the city represents a sacred covenant the origin of the city is to be found in family or clan the piety of the city lies in the respect for forefathers the citizens of venice were born into a setting of human interdependence and natural need this is perhaps the condition of life itself social life is mans state of nature there is no need to posit some rousseauesque social contract this was also the insight vouchsafed to george eliot who on observing sunset in the venetian lagoon remarked that it is the sort of scene in which i could most readily forget my own existence and feel melted into the general life the goals were unanimity and solidarity the major projects of venetian trade for example were collective endeavours whereby groups of merchants bound themselves together in formal treaty for the carriage of goods the government itself took responsibility for the largest galleys the people of venice found their meaning in the network of guilds and parishes and scuole that formed the social life of the city there were endless committees and councils and boards of control the equality of the venetian people themselves is a matter of argument the division of the populace into patricians citizens and popolani might suggest that there was indeed a hierarchy of social position and social responsibility but there is also no doubt that there were levelling tendencies at work within the venetian polity as early as the sixth century cassiodorus the ostrogothic leader remarked to the venetians that among you there is no difference between rich and poor your food is the same your houses are all alike according to tradition all the houses in the city had once been of the same height when in the eleventh century two or three old families tried to create ruling dynasties they were rebuffed by the patriciate who said that we did not come here to live under a lord there is in fact a broad equality among merchants money knows no class or barrier so thomas coryat noted that their gentlemen and greatest senators a man worth perhaps two millions of duckats will come into the market and buy their flesh fruites and such other things as are necessary for the maintenance of their families the streets of the city and the narrowness of its bounds meant that there was a constant mixing and mingling of classes as merchants too the patricians could not divorce themselves from the common life that is why the lowest floors of the grander houses were often let out for shops and warehouses the laws of venice prohibited displays of ostentatious extravagance but frugality or what was known as mediocritas was in any case a venetian instinct many wills stipulate that the person is to be buried with as little pomp as possible and then there is the natural environment water is a great leveller it has been remarked for example that the river thames is a great haven of social equality on water all are at an equal level so there was a pronounced cordiality among all the people of venice an english aristocrat of the eighteenth century observed that there is a universal politeness here in every rank the people expect a civil deportment from their nobles towards them and they return it with much respect and veneration but should a noble assume an insolent arrogant manner towards his inferior it would not be borne with they were all in it together in the comedies of goldoni servants often lose their tempers with masters and masters never ever strike their servants there were some who deplored this freedom of manners in a dialogue entitled discorsi morali of the late sixteenth century a speaker remarked that in venice servants are licentious dissolute vicious and disrespectful whereas those who attended princely courts were good loyal sincere and wellmannered there was a stated belief then in the concept of freedom manifested in the original notion of a state that was not the servant of princes the myth of communalism when in reality the refugees had fled under the leadership of bishops or local lords was very strong for the government freedom did not consist of private liberty but of freedom from interference by other states from at least the fourteenth century venice offered visitors and strangers the luxury of liberty of belief that is why it was seen as an open city accommodating calvinists and anabaptists as well as greek orthodox and muslims and jews bigotry does not consort easily with free trade because i am a man born in a free city one senator told his colleagues i will freely express my feelings it is not a sentence that could have been uttered in many places at the beginning of the sixteenth century at the end of the seventeenth century too a french chronicler wrote that the liberty of venice makes every thing authentick for whatsoever the life is or religion one professes provided you do not talk or attempt anything against the state or the nobility one may be sure to live unmolested for no body will go about to censure their conduct or to oppose the disorders of their neighbours that is the reason why this freedom of conscience migrated into freedom of behaviour it has always been a feature of the city and in the fourteenth century petrarch had condemned the foul language and excessive licence of the venetians but it became the defining feature of the city in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries venice became known for what would now be called permissiveness and it was soon remarked that personal liberty was not incompatible with ordered government this was a revelation to the rest of the world english tourists often contrasted the atmosphere of venice with that of london in which city the major occupation consisted in censuring the behaviour of other people nothing of the kind ever happened in the city of the lagoon there was method however behind the emollient atmosphere freedom prompted visitors into spending more and more money there was another kind of liberty in venice you could leave your past and acquire a new identity it has often been remarked that there are very few biographies or autobiographies in venetian literature the individual is indeed absent in venetian life the children of the patrician class were taught at an early age that they must not strive to stand above their fellows it was said that the venetians never forgave failure by their admirals or commanders but similarly they never forgave success individual glory might imperil that of the city the predominant mode of portraiture in venice was group portraiture it has in fact been suggested that the collective portrait first emerged in the city the great nineteenthcentury historian of venice pompeo molmenti remarked that in venetian painting the individual is lost in the joyous throng tintoretto for example was fascinated by the movement and orchestration of crowds he was rarely interested in the depiction of individual human beings who are subordinate to the overall rhythm and unity of the composition in much the same way as the venetian people are part of the rhythm of the state in the paintings of carpaccio there are always groups of people exchanging pleasantries and engaging in gossip they are never arguing there is never a sense that they could change anything about their lives that is the nature of venetian society venice was always a place for crowds rather than for solitary wanderers the most common sight in the twentyfirst century is of groups of tourists if the individual is depicted by the venetian portraitist he and it is almost always he is shown in his social and political role there is no trace of the inner life and no attempt at psychological revelation there is instead a careful anonymity the expression is characteristically remote or aloof the note is one of reserve and decorum what was known in venice as decoro the individual is less important than the rank or class of that individual the sitter is seen to be absorbed by his role in the state it is almost invariably the case that the hands are concealed it is hard therefore to praise the famous men and women of venice there were great artists but there were no great individuals such as lorenzo de medici or pope julius ii in literature as well as history venetians were not individualised they were not well known for their eccentricities or for their triumphs the comedies of goldoni are the comedies of ordinary life they are filled with the poetry of domestic fact and local intrigue not the exploits or adventures or sensibilities of outstanding individuals or aberrant types they reflect a benign social order the people of venice were always known for their docility they might have been easily aroused to private passion but they were always respectful to the authorities burckhardt could never have written of venice as he once wrote of florence that the individual was led to make the utmost of the exercise and enjoyment of power and that the leaders of the people acquired so marked a personal character none of the doges or governors of venice ever had a personal character the city had never been and could never have been a feudal state feudalism was a system that sanctioned and maintained individual lordship machiavelli observed that the security and happiness of the city derived from the fact that unlike any other state its gentlemen did not have castles or private armies or retainers venice was a great reputable work of joint human endeavour goethe wrote a splendid monument not of a master but of a people this was a matter of congratulation to the people themselves gasparo contarini in his book on the state and government of venice published in remarked that our ancestors from whom we received so prosperous a commonwealth all came together to maintain honour and increase their country without any thought of personal glory or advantage they remained anonymous in life and in death their only memorial was the state itself though these venetian gentlemen are extraordinary wise when they are conjunct james howell wrote in the seventeenth century take them single they are but as other men the secret lay in their cohesiveness one to another outside this context these patricians had no identity their private selves were taken up by their political selves they were nothing without the state with no great men venice represents tolstoys dictum that human history is governed by a million different chances and interests bound together by what can only be called a communal instinct each period is an unveiling of that instinct the author is truly overwhelmed by the complexity of this process moon and night the night and silence of venice are profound moonlight can flood saint marks square venice is most characteristic at night it has a quality of stillness that suits the mood of time preserved then it is haunted by what it lovesitself the doorways seem darker than in any other city lapped as they are by the black water the little lamps still flicker before the statues of the virgin on the corners of the calli there are many kinds of night in venicethe capacious blue of the summer night and the fierce blackness of the winter night the modern venetians rarely seem to go out at night there are no drunkards roaming through the street in the hours of the early morning there are no raucous shouts one contemporary acoustics engineer has measured the level of nocturnal sound in venice at thirtytwo decibels the night of other cities is approximately thirteen decibels louder there is no background noise in the second half of the thirteenth century a government agency was established known as the signori di notte or lords of the night who were obliged to safeguard public order under cover of darkness the venetian night seems to have been an object of suspicion it contained the horror of unseen water deep and dark and of winding labyrinthine alleys it is the time of assault and of subversion the night was the time for the spy or the assassin night was the opportunity for secret groups or even for the writing of graffiti on the walls of the city against the lawful government for a city that prided itself upon its rational order and control the night was an especial enemy in decrees it was announced that there were many pericula or dangers in the night there was always the risk of disordines et tumultationes or disorder and riot night was chaos night was threat the night of venice seemed to invoke the original blackness and silence of the lagoon from which the city rose the night was the memory of origin yet the ubiquity of the carnival in later centuries literally lightened the mood in the eighteenth century the memoirs of goldoni reveal a little world of night the shops remained open until ten oclock in the evening many of them not finally closing their doors until midnight at midnight too all the taverns are open and suppers are in preparation in every inn and hotel what then are the sounds of the night the sound of the footfall echoes through this city of stone venice is a good acoustic instrument there is the occasional chime there is the sound of water lapping and slapping against stone as part of its everlasting movement there may be a call upon the water pure and resonant still water carries the voice very far the narrow streets can also act as funnels of sound then there is the scarcely discernible sound of the gondola in the nineteenth century the more romantic travellers noted that there were times when music crept over the waters liszt more perceptively invoked the silent noises of the city the murmur of the boat floating across the water is one of them there are always moments when silence seems to descend upon venice everywhere dickens wrote in pictures from italy the same extraordinary silence for him it was the enforced silencing of modern lifeno carriages no wheels no machinery for many victorian travellers the charm of venice lay in its distance from modern industrialised civilisation two centuries before john evelyn had described venice as almost as silent as the middle of a field there being neither rattling of coaches nor trampling of horses nor noise of cars you may turn a corner and come upon an area without sound no other city still has so many pockets of silence in michael dibdins dead lagoon the narrator declares that such absolute unqualified silence was troubling as though some vital life function had ceased there was a dark side of venice a side that the night conceals there were many poor and many outcasts beggars have always been an aspect of venetian life in the late fifteenth century the senate discussed the problem of old men and others who lay each night in the precincts of the ducal palace a home and a hospital were constructed but they were not enough at times of famine as in the winter of the poor died against the pillars children stood in the market of the rialto or in the square crying out i am dying of hunger i am dying of hunger and cold one contemporary recorded that the city stank with their odour this is a measure of the intense confinement of urban living and of course venice could produce no food of its own in the early seventeenth century a new institution the ospedale dei mendicanti was erected to clear the streets and squares of the countless vagrants all beggars in venice were obliged to obtain a licence and to lodge at the hospital unlicensed beggars were expelled and those who were reported to be too successful in their trade were consigned to the galleys the owner of an unofficial beggars lodging house was whipped all the way from saint marks square to the rialto bridge not all of them however found their way into the public haven effie ruskin noted that in the evening we see them all lying packed together at the edges of bridges wrapped in their immense brown cloaks and large hoods one venetian patrician gasparo contarini was not sure if they were citizens of the venetian republic or stray animals some families lived on rickety boats beside the quays in the nineteenth century the palaces along the canal were converted into tenements where the poor huddled no pictorial view of venice in that century was complete without the appearance of a picturesque vagrant preferably young and female and pretty in the middle of the sixteenth century there were estimated to be six thousand beggars in the city by the end of the eighteenth century that number had risen to twentytwo thousand this was perhaps partly a reflection of the reputation of venice as a centre for travellers it has always been the case that beggars are more likely to find succour from foreigners mrs thrale described them as saucy and airy and odd in their manners she also noticed that they were treated by the venetian people themselves with great softness and courtesy an account of the venetian beggars of the sixteenth century records their words i made the people think i was a madman i dressed up as a pilgrim and with an image of saint james in my hand i covered my face i made piteous signs and gestures and the rich gave me money they showed their wounds their cancers and their ulcers in the public squares there were familiar calls for succour pity pity i will pray for your life if you throw me a coin give money for the blessed virgin the beggars came to venice from many other cities a list dating from the summer of registers them from milan sicily pisa and even france in the twentyfirst century for example old women and young men are to be found lying bowed on the bridges with their hands outstretched venice has been known as the haven for the outcast and the exile in every sense why should it not extend that courtesy to the genuinely dispossessed there is no dawn chorus of small birds in venice yet as day breaks the life of the city wakes from its silent slumber once more the traveller hears the rising voices the whistles the songs the shouts the pealing of bells it is the morning of a human city there is endless chatter in the air while the music lasts friedrich nietzsche wrote in ecce homo that when i seek another word for music i always find only the word venice one evening in the city in the late nineteenth century richard wagner was being carried home on a gondola across the dark waters his gondolier plied the oar when suddenly from his mighty breast came a mournful sound not unlike the howl of an animal swelling up from a deep low note and after a longsustained oh it culminated in the simple musical phrase venezia so venice is the music while the music lasts in a guidebook to venice published in the city is celebrated as the seat of music la sede di musica it was the harmonious community with an unrivalled tradition of sacred and secular music the ducal orchestra played every day for an hour in saint marks square throughout the centuries that central space has always been filled with music there were other street bands as well as concert halls and choirs all of the sestieri echoed with the sound of voices and of instruments on good friday the members of each parishthe winesellers the fishermen the gondolierswould sing out the long chant of the twentyfour hours this was nothing to do with church observance it was the choice of the people themselves each guild had its own songs and melodies there were popular choral societies there were many accademie or private societies where amateur musicians performed the inventories of middleclass venetian households reveal the presence of string or keyboard instruments in most of them all the public festivities of the city were conducted to the sound of music there were concert barges moored in the grand canal and elsewhere performing for the venetian public and for visitors an engraving of shows a host of musical entertainments upon the canal concerts were also given by virtuosi in private houses musicians were even employed in the gambling houses of the city and there were always comic ballets at the time of the carnival one english traveller noted in that the people are so musical here that all day long the houses send forth the most melodious sounds which die off charmingly along the water the presence of water invites song and music there is something about its flow and the sound of its flow that elicits other melodies so we read of the solemn flow of venetian church music in the late eighteenth century charles burney remarked that the venetian people seemed to converse in song the gondoliers were notorious if that is the word for singing recitatives taken from the sixteenthcentury poetry of torquato tasso yet these were laments because the sadness of venice entered its songs goethe has described how the women of the other islands of the lagoon sitting on the seashore would sing tasso to their husbands fishing in the waters the men would then reply in song setting up a domestic conversation in music tasso was one of venices favourite sons having lived in the city during his early youth his father was a member of the aldine circle there were also popular songs known as vilote sung by the women as they sat sewing or preparing food these were often laments of love concerning hopes and dreams and desires the vilote were also danced out in the campi to the music of harpsichords and of course there were the famous venetian serenades sung beneath the ubiquitous balconies to the accompaniment of the mandolin or the guitar it could be said that the venetians were infatuated with music they loved love and they loved melody it is reported that when the byzantine exarch longinus visited the city of the lagoons in he was almost deafened by the sound of bells and musical instruments waiting to greet him so there are records of venetian music from the earliest periods of its history in priest giorgio of venice became so expert in the art of organbuilding that he was said to be guided by mirifica arte subsequently the organbuilders of venice became famous throughout europe there are records of a singers guild in the basilica of saint marks from the beginning of the fourteenth century a singing school for males was established there in yet essentially the beginning of the sixteenth century initiated the long period when venetian music took the palm after the great expansion of its empire had ended it aspired to other forms of supremacy venice was the home of the madrigal invented in the city it was the centre of church music it was the capital of opera there was scarcely a european composer of note who did not make his way to venicescarlatti gluck mozart wagner handel mendelssohn monteverdi stravinsky all visited the most serene city wagner and monteverdi died there the masses in the churches sustained by music and choir lasted for many hours some passages of that sacred rite particularly at the gradual and at the elevation of the host were sustained by instrumental music so that people attended church as if they were visiting the concert hall instrumental music was also employed to suggest wordless prayer what might be private and intimate becomes in venice public and theatrical the words of the songs for the heroes and heroines of the opera were altered to celebrate the male and female saints of the day arias could be transformed into oratorios churches were in fact designed to be zones of sound the church of the incurabili for example was constructed as an oval space on one occasion in the s five orchestras were deployed in the basilica of saint marks under the direction of baldassare galuppi in that church too there was a tradition of polyphony taken up by two or more choirs singing antiphonally or simultaneously to the accompaniment if they were needed of four organs it was a divine machinery of sound amplified by the labyrinthine acoustics of the space it is not at all extraordinary that musical events were held there on the afternoons of sundays and of holidays the nature of these polychoral events in which opposing forces eventually achieve harmony was uniquely suited to the bias of the venetian state the echo effects of polychoral music were not inimical either to a city of reflections upon water the orphan girls in the charitable institutions of the state were given an extensive and elaborate musical training so that their concerts became the wonder of the age these institutions known as ospedali became in essence musical conservatories where young girls learned how to sing to play and to compose new works they also attracted the maestri of venice as their instructors antonio vivaldi for example was for four decades the musical master of the ospedale della pietà the girls were situated in singing galleries enclosed by wroughtiron grilles so that their voices and melodies might have come from unseen angelic powers charles burney reported in the summer of that the girls played a thousand tricks in singing particularly in the duets where there was a trial of skill and natural powers as to who could go highest lowest swell a note the longest or run divisions with the greatest rapidity individual girls had their own cabals of admirers the fact that they were orphaned only contributed to their power but they were not nuns young men came to the ospedali with offers of marriage to those whose voices pleased them best there was no sound of applause in the churches of these institutions but instead the audiences wept and prayed there are reports of men and women fainting at the intensity of sound gondolas were moored in the adjacent canal or rio with their passengers straining to hear the sounds from within diverse observers rousseau and goethe among them have testified that these girls ravished and stupefied the senses i cannot imagine anything rousseau wrote so voluptuous so touching as this music this sensuousness strikes the right venetian note the harmonies of venice had another aspect the ancients believed music to be the token of the ordered cosmos since venice was the preeminent exponent of ordered governance in the world it was only natural that music should emanate from it it contained the music of the spheres it partook of heaven and of earth the gates of paradise had opened in the city all the various forms of constitutionmonarchy oligarchy and republicwere moulded and mingled together these were celestial harmonies imparted by god even the merchants of venice were educated in the rules of proportion in mercantile textbooks such as the rule of three also known as the golden rule or the merchants key pythagorean mathematics was an important feature of commerce the architecture or architexture of the city was conceived harmoniously if it is indeed true that buildings have been raised by the power of music then the churches and noble houses of venice have assuredly embodied the melody of the world the architects of the day studied theories of harmony in foreign policy the doge and senate strove to maintain a balance of powers they strove for peace it was said because peace reflected harmony in every sense just as in a sonata or concerto no one instrument must dominate the others so in the venetian state no one interest or authority could be allowed to influence the rest all was of a piece no one may rise too high or fall too low nothing was out of proportion the aim was perfect order and that to a large extent and to the amazement of the rest of the world was achieved when the figure of apollo was carved in a niche of the loggetta at the base of the campanile of saint marks its sculptor jacopo sansovino declared that it is known that this nation takes natural delight in music and therefore apollo is represented to signify music extraordinary harmony perpetuates this admirable government the dances of the city therefore have some significance the diaries of venetians suggest that there was almost uninterrupted public dancing in the squares and courtyards of the city in the noble houses dancing in the ballroom was a favoured means of expression there were dances for women events in which more than a hundred females might participate there were scores of dancing schools teaching the hat dance the torch dance and the hunt dances were performed on barges they were an important aspect of the ubiquitous street theatre so the movement of the spheres was reproduced in the streets of the city in one painting by gabriele bella festo dà soldo in campiello a group of venetians male and female are to be seen dancing in formal measures to the accompaniment of two violins and a cello their fellow citizens watch from the balconies or from the neighbouring tavern as the women twirl their aprons and the men raise their arms in the air and of course the popular performances of the commedia dellarte had their own frenzied dances together with a litany of vulgar and satirical songs and then there is the nature of music as an expression of political life thus we may say that humankind comes into the world to maintain and to celebrate the structure into which it is born there is a joy in formal order and display there is a joy in the endless echoes and repetitions so much like the governance of venice there is deep solace to be found in the experience of harmony where is heard the voice of tens of thousands rather than that of one the music of saint marks was under the direct control of the state procurators an expression of the evident fact that roman catholicism had been transformed into a state church there was or was supposed to be a profound concord between faith and the city and the harmony of song to put it more crudely music became a form of political propaganda the paintings and engravings of the various civic processions always depict the drums the cymbals and the silver trumpets music then became a method of maintaining social order many venetian operas used allegory to comment upon contemporary events with venice as the heroine of all encounters venice then became venetia the unassailable virgin holding sword and scalesecco venezia bella in one production il bellerofonte an exact and elaborate model of the city arose from the sea to the accompaniment of music the painters of venice were also devotees of music vasari seems to consider tintorettos musical skills for example as more worthy of praise than his painterly achievement veroneses wedding at cana shows a quartet playing to the invited guests the members of that musical group have been identified as titian tintoretto bassano and veronese himself thus when walter pater in his study of the venetian artist giorgione suggested that all art constantly aspires towards the condition of music he was identifying one of the central tendencies of venetian art pater adds that in the venetian school following giorgione the perfect moments of music itself the making or hearing of music song or its accompaniment are themselves prominent as subjects oil paint can be liquid music so we read of titians tonic harmonies and rhythmic movements and of the eager quick tempo of lorenzo lotto the language of tintorettos composition seems invariably to be also the language of music when we gaze upon the architectonic harmonies of tiepolo we hear the music of vivaldis violins energetic and triumphant on the other side there are references to vivaldis delight in orchestral colour in the language of the venetian arts music and painting seem to be twinned in his painting known as the vision of saint augustine vittore carpaccio the great designator of venetian scenes depicts the saint in a musical universe augustine has written on sheets of music the notes for tenor and contralto while at his feet lie works of music sacred and secular the vision then is one of transcendent harmony the painting of music is a thoroughly venetian art there are many hundreds of paintings that show men and women holding musical instruments the angels of venetian religious painting are generally musicians angel choruses are replaced by angel orchestras but no other artistic tradition places so much emphasis on these images of celestial harmony there are drawings of girls and boys singing there are paintings of music being played by pools and by wells as if the venetian consonance between music and water was being endlessly celebrated titian was entranced by the spectacle of musicmaking and of concert scenes heard melodies are sweet but those unheard are sweeter yet the music of venice is the music of performance and of display it is never the music of meditation or of sorrowful introspection it relies upon improvisation and dramatic interpretation once more it is the love of surface and the rich deployment of the effects of the surface that define the venetian sensibility it is what is known as coloratura yet venice would not be venice without the smell of trade as well as the sound of music the city became the capital of musicpublishing and of instrumentmaking there were many collections of instruments designed for investment as much as display the great venetian composers can in another light be seen as very successful men of business we may take the case of that quintessentially venetian artist and violinist antonio vivaldi no one was more eager for commission and more avaricious for gain he had the trading instinct in his blood at one point he called himself un franco intraprenditore or candid businessman he was born a venetian in and baptised at the parish church of s giovanni in bragora his father giambattista vivaldi was a musician in the basilica of saint marks it was here that vivaldi himself began his training as a violinist his father taught him the rudiments of the family profession this was the venetian tradition at the age of fifteen he was received into the minor orders of the church and ten years later he was ordained as a priest he became known as the prete rosso or redhaired priest the red hair perhaps being an expression or indication of his fiery temperament he had a prominent arched nose pointed chin and large expressive eyes vivaldi had a congenitally weak constitution having been close to death as a premature baby and he always needed assistants to help him travel as he explained in a letter written towards the end of his life when i had just been ordained a priest i still said mass for rather more than a year and then gave it up because three times i was forced to leave the altar without finishing mass on account of my illness for this reason i spend my life almost entirely at home leaving my house only in a gondola or carriage because with my chest complaint known as heart seizure i cannot walk no nobleman invites me to his house not even our doge because they all know of my ailment i can usually leave the house immediately after breakfast but never on foot yet this was the man who plunged himself into a relentless round of composition administration and direction he was quixotic and impulsive by all accounts surrendering himself to the moods of the moment like his music he seems to have acquired some extraordinary internal energy from an unknown source of power he was said by one english musician of the time william hayes to have too much mercury in his dispositionwhich meant that he was impulsive and quixotic he was perhaps a little eccentric in at the age of twentysix he was appointed to the music school of the orphanage the ospedale della pietà and was music master there for most of his life when he joined that institution he became a thorough master of all its music he became teacher director and player nine years later he was appointed as the official composer of the ospedale during those years his fame as a composer had increased and spread throughout europe the king of denmark frederick iv made an especial visit to the ospedale to hear one of vivaldis oratorios yet already his energy and determination were driving him in another direction in the same year that he was appointed official composer his first opera was staged in the city of vicenza on the mainland of the veneto this was a prelude to the performance of his operas in venice itself where he quickly earned both popularity and income for the rest of his life he divided his compositions between operatic and sacred work the pursuit of profit was part of his purpose he was in the habit of offering his works to foreign musicians demanding very high prices he marketed venetian music in the same way that his contemporary canaletto marketed venetian views on commission to visiting tourists he haggled over prices and costs he decided not to publish his works on the supposition that he could earn more money by selling the manuscripts he discussed his finances with an english traveller edward holdsworth who reported that he finds a good market because he expects a guinea for every piece in his operatic works he was an entrepreneur as well as a musician he rented the theatre he engaged the singers and the musicians he chose the libretti he conducted the orchestra and provided solo accompaniments on the violin he had to respond to the demands of the public if an opera were unsuccessful he found a replacement within a matter of days yet this supreme impresario was also a man of the cloth the venetian dramatist goldoni recorded a visit to vivaldi i found him surrounded by scores he wrote his breviary in his hand he rose made the sign of the cross with broad gestures put his breviary down this conflation of piety and business of the sacred and the secular seems so thoroughly venetian as to need no further comment yet all things in venice were dependent upon fashion a close friend of vivaldi charles de brosses wrote in that to my great surprise i found that he is not so highly regarded as he deserves to be in this country where everything follows the trend of the moment it was for this and other reasons that vivaldi looked for patrons abroad he journeyed to vienna and was about to travel on to dresden when in at the age of sixtythree he died it was reported that after a life of excessive prodigality he died a pauper yet this may be the usual pious epilogue for a career of extravagant genius in his rapidity of execution vivaldi is thoroughly venetian he wrote more than five hundred instrumental works and almost one hundred operas he boasted that he could compose a concerto with all its parts faster than a copyist could copy it his playing too had the fire and energy of lightning the german scholar zacharias von uffenbach attending one of vivaldis concerts noted that he quite confounded me for such playing has not been heard before and can never be equalled he placed his finger but a hairs breadth from the bridge so that there was hardly room for the bow he played thus on all four strings with imitations and at an unbelievable speed von uffenbach then commissioned vivaldi to write for him some concerti grossi three days later vivaldi delivered ten of them on the manuscript score of his opera tito manlio there is the inscription musica del vivaldi fatta in giornimusic by vivaldi completed in five days in his manuscripts there is evidence of a tremendous force of conception and execution outstripping the ability of the hand to register it there is such animation and rhythmic drive that the momentum is irresistible the coloristic effects the vivid impressionism the shimmering harmonies the fantastic ingenuity of venetian music find their acme in vivaldi any imitated pattern creates excitement agitation creates excitement vivaldi is vivacity speed of composition and of execution is the key the words used by his contemporaries were fierezza fiery energy and prestezza or rapidity the melodic force is overwhelming the impression is one of inexhaustibility he was also a man of the theatre creating an environment of insistent and unrelenting sound for the expression of extravagant and violent feeling his most famous work the four seasons is intensely expressive it was a way of translating a pictorial and operatic genre into music there is in fact in his art a thoroughly venetian tendency to combine display with melody so that he introduces operatic effects within his instrumental music and sustains his operas with the techniques of his concerti the first page of the solo violin part of the spring concerto resembles a composition by mondrian the notes seem to dance together they arch and leap and soar in serried ranks on his scores vivaldi will scrawl down hurriedly spiritoso or allegro sometimes he will continue the notation for three or four pages then pause then cross it all out then with the same vigour and rapidity begin all over again from the first notes on occasions he would write out two movements for the same place and then leave it to the interpreter or musicians to make their preference he worked sometimes so quickly that he forgot his original key his writing became more abrupt and elliptical in the course of composition the same rush of genius the same facility and prolixity are evident through the history of venetian culture tintoretto was well known for the ferocious energy of his artistic practice he could paint the walls of a church or the hall of a guild within a week in a later century tiepolo was known for being able to finish a large canvas in ten hours so in the music of vivaldi there is a tremendous quickness and pressure guided by a driving force and rhythmic impulse that astonished his contemporaries it is as inexorable as fate it rushes forward like the tides of the lagoon what is the secret of this exuberance in the artists of venice it is joy joy in creation it has to do with the fact of living in an harmonious city yet it is also the joy of living in unity with the culture and society that surrounded them they were at home the ground of their being was venice itself is it then possible to interpret the nature of venetian music as an organic whole it is marked by exuberance and spontaneity a ferocious gaiety that is manifest in other forms of venetian art the most used and favoured word is brilliance it has associations with the glitter of venetian glass and the glittering light upon the water yet venetian music also has associations with the richness of colour and texture in venetian art we read of the brilliant tone colours and chromatic phrases associated with the musicians of venice as opposed to those of naples or of florence the venetian manuals of music written in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries rely largely upon expounding the arts of improvisation and ornamentation venetian music therefore is predominantly expressive the temperamental affinities to put it perhaps too crudely are with show over substance one german musicologist of the eighteenth century contrasting venetian melodies with roman harmonies remarked that the venetian makes its way to the ear more quickly but its spell continues for a shorter time the art of echo already noticed in sacred polychoral music was also an aspect of secular music the venetian sonata for example has been noticed for its marked contrapuntal effects the music of venice has a certain sweetness it was often light and clear in that sense it could be suggested that it contains little interior life there could be no beethoven in venice it has an irresistible flow it has the rhythm of the sea not of the wheel it provokes astonishment and admiration rather than contemplation yet it could also be unruly and abrupt with sudden and unexpected turns both in melody and in harmony it is often eccentric or extravagant it sometimes relishes strangeness or what were known as bizzarria it has an eastern flavour it can even be claimed that through the agency of venice the music of the east entered the classical european tradition venetian music is sustained by constant and subtle variation it favours contrast and intricacy it can be fast and florid it perfectly suits the genius of the virtuoso it has been suggested that the solo concerto was first heard in venice it may be possible then to define the nature of this music as an expression of the venetian temperament stendhal remarked that the glittering reflection of the venetian character falls across the texture of venetian music the process of transmission and inheritance has never properly been understood except in the evident relish of a language that describes art and character in identical terms and so we have the wordsvivacity gaiety radiance extravagance energy buoyancy spontaneity urgency facility exuberance impetuosity oh venezia a venetian chronology fourth fifth and sixth centuries ad the veneti
