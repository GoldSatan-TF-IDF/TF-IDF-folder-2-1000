a five year plan philip kerr chapter one ahchoooo the sneeze reverberated like a gunshot jimmy figaro glanced around his wellappointed office to check nothing was damaged fuckin hay fever sniffed rizzoli from behind a napkinsized handkerchief according to the fuckin herald the pollen index is thats on a scale of on account of all the fuckin mango trees we got down here in florida rizzoli sneezed again a great explosion of noise that was half growl half whoop like the yahooing sound a rodeorider might make on exiting the ring aboard a bucking horse he said it was up to me id burn every fuckin mango tree in miami figaro nodded vaguely he liked mangoes hed never given the trees much thought but now that he did his minds eye saw ursula andress in doctor no singing a song about mango trees as she wiggled her ass out of the caribbean sea with a conch in her hand why couldnt he have a client like that for once instead of a minor mobster like tommy rizzoli every fuckin one of them bonfire of the mango trees rizzoli chuckled just like that fuckin movie huh which movie is that tommy bonfire of the mango trees figaro felt himself frown he was uncertain if rizzoli was making a joke or if he really did think that was what the movie was called you mean tom wolfe rizzoli rubbed his nose furiously and shrugged yeah right but it was plain to figaro that tommy rizzoli knew as much about tom wolfe as he did about fine porcelain figaro turned his attention back to the notes hed been making the facts were as clear as tommy rizzolis guilt he and an unnamed associate but most probably it had been rizzolis halfbrother willy barizon had taken extortionate control of most of dade countys icetrucking there was that and the assault on one of the arresting police officers that had left the man with a broken nose ahchooo the troopers nose it was almost ironic in view of the allergic condition of rizzolis own durantesized hooter but rizzoli was adamant that the trooper had slipped and fallen how do you feel about a plea tommy as in guilty plea or plea for mercy he took hold of his nose and bent it one way and then the other almost as if it had been broken no fuckin way as in plea bargain i figure theyll drop the assault if we put our hands up to the extortion meanwhile i suggest you sell your interests in the ice and trucking business and get ready to pay some kind of fine both men flinched as outside the office door a woman screamed figaro tried to ignore it the peoples evidence is at best not much more than hearsay he continued just a couple of undercover cops i can make them look like swiss cheese thats the cheese with the holes in right precisely the da knows it too i dont see that you have to go to jail for this you dont rizzoli snorted like he had been fast asleep you dont well thats great jimmy you know i never much liked ice anyway there was a knock at the door its a bitch to handle on account of the interesting crystalline structure come somethin i read about sgot a laminar structure which means it deforms by gliding thats why ice kind of falls apart the way it does like a deck of cards figaros secretary peered round the door and i ask you jimmy what kind of business can you build on a crystalline structure like that i dont know tommy yes carol mister figaro i wonder could you spare a minute please figaro glanced at his client i think were about through here he said standing up ill speak to the das office give me a week to structure a deal tommy ok rizzoli stood up automatically straightening the cuffs and the creases on his shiny sharkskin suit thanks jimmy predate it a lot man naked tony was right youre one of us buttoning his own jacket and ushering rizzoli toward the open door figaro looked pained no dont make that mistake tommy yknow tony means well by that remark but its not true im your priest is nearer to it priestly intercession before judgment on your behalf only dont ever fuckin confess to me i dont want to know if youre guilty i dont give a shit any more than i would if you were as innocent as a walk round a church on a sunday afternoon all i care about is whether we can make a better case than the other guy he grinned its a lawyer thing i got ya the two men shook hands which served to remind figaro of how tough and strong the other smaller man really was so long jimmy and thanks again figaro waved rizzoli through the reception area and beyond the doors of figaro august and then glanced questioningly at carol i think youd better come and see this for yourself she said and led the way through the suite of offices to the boardroom when we saw what it was we thought wed better have it put in here carol explained nervously ginas in the ladies room with smithy it was smithy who unpacked it i think she had a bit of a shock it was smithy who screamed shes sort of a nervous individual mister figaro nervous but loyal smithy cares about you we all do thats why an incident like this is so upsetting i suppose with our client list its understandable but this this is like something out of the movies now i really am intrigued said figaro and followed her into the boardroom smithy was now lying on the sofa beneath the window and gina was fanning her palelooking face with a copy of the new yorker figaro recognized the cover it was the issue that included the profile of himself he glanced around the room his dark quick eyes serving a usefully photographic memory taking in the probable chain of causation the new yorker piece the dismantled packing case the pubic clumps of straw the delivery item itself free standing about five feet high and looking like something that had met the stony gaze of a gorgon was a topcoat made of stone what kind of sick person carol bleated no wait just a minute i know what kind of person theres a name on the delivery note she handed him a sheet of pink paper and placed a tentative hand on her bosss shoulder it was the first time in three years of working for figaro that she had ever touched him and she was surprised to find hard muscle underneath the jacket of his expensive armani suit he was a tall attractive man in good shape for someone who spent most of his time in the office and the rest of it in court kind of like roy scheider she thought the same long nose the same high forehead the same glasses only paler almost as pale as the woman lying on the couch do you feel all right mister figaro you look a little pale figaro who was rarely in the sun looked away from the stone topcoat and met her eye for a moment he said nothing then he laughed im fine carol he replied and started to laugh again only this time it really took hold of him until he had taken off his glasses and was leaning with both hands on the boardroom table tears streaming down both cheeks chapter two two things happened on the morning of dave delanos release from the miami correctional center at homestead one was that benford halls recently transferred from homestead to the state penitentiary at stark was executed although stark was many hundreds of miles upstate the circumstances of hallss final hours meticulously reported on almost all of floridas tv and radio stations caused a lot of anger and resentment among the cons at homestead not only had halls been kept waiting for several hours after his scheduled pm execution because of a problem with the ancient electric chair but it had also been reported that movie actor calgary stanford had been allowed to attend the execution in order to research a deathrow role he was soon to play dave delano had good reason to remember benford halls they had both been sentenced in the same miami courthouse on the same day exactly five years before that dave should have served the full term since parole for federal prisoners had been more or less eliminated didnt seem so bad when he compared it with waiting around for five years to be put to death in front of some movie actor if that didnt rank as cruel and unusual then torquemada must have been one of the worlds great humanitarians the second thing that happened was that dave received an airmail letter it was from russia and written in the unmistakably clear hand and cryptic style of einstein gergiev gergiev had been released from homestead some six months before dave after serving eight years on a racketeering charge released and then deported as an undesirable alien undesirable he may have been but it was mostly down to gergiev that dave had used his time inside so well it had been gergiev who had persuaded the younger man that he had a real flair for foreign languages and that the peculiarities of the federal penal system would give him the opportunity for study and selfimprovement people with liberty could only dream about just a few months before an amendment to the crime bill had banned federal grants to prisoners for postsecondary education dave had obtained a diploma in russian he had always had good spanish growing up on miamis south beach it might as well have been cuba for all the good english did you and on a fine day when he had a tan to complement his dark hair and brown eyes dave could just about pass for one of the marielitos who helped make miami the sometime crime capital of america daves potential as a russian scholar might have come from the fact he was the son of a russianjewish immigrant who had fled the soviet union after the war his fathers real name was delanotov which he had changed to delano upon arrival in america choosing the middle name of the previous american president in order to enhance his future prospects such as they were when he wasnt drunk he spent the next thirty years installing airconditioning systems in luxury yachts out of love and gratitude for his adopted country and hatred of the one he had left behind daves father never again spoke his own native language dave looked at the postmark and shook his head it was four weeks since it had been sent another day and it would have missed him fuckin aeroflot he muttered before carefully reading the letter written in russian prices crime and the incompetence of government things did not sound so very different from what was happening at home dave read the letter several times making certain of some of the more difficult words with the aid of a russian dictionary speaking russian was a lot easier than reading it the cyrillic alphabet was a whole different ballgame to the western writing system for a start there were six more letters than english used by the time the guard came to escort dave to freedom he had memorized the letters contents and flushed the pieces down the toilet under the eyes of his cellmate angel who had been lying silently on the top bunk it was always tough when the guy you roomed with got his freedom his departure brought home the fact that you were still in prison equally troublesome was the prospect of a new cellmate suppose he was queer man gets a letter and gets hisself released all on the same day grumbled angel somehow it dont seem fair dave picked up the cardboard carton containing his books notebooks correspondence art reproductions and photographs tucked it under one wellmuscled arm and then tugged at the uncle sam beard that helped to disguise his boyish face ok man im outta here angel a tall hispanic with a gold tooth descended embraced dave fondly and tried not to cry tamargo the trucksized guard loitered patiently on the landing outside the cell door i left you everything that was in the cabinet all my shit candy vitamins cigarettes smoke em soon though dave laughed smoke em or trade em theyll be turning this into a no smoking prison like everywhere else and they wont be worth shit thanks man predate it you take care of yourself youll be out in no time yeah right without another word dave turned and followed tamargo along the groundfloor tier shouting his goodbyes to the other prisoners and trying not to look too damn pleased with himself he felt vaguely nauseous the same feeling he used to have when hed been about to sit a test or face a courtroom but it was nothing to what benford halls must have felt dave shivered fuck that he muttered say something returned tamargo no sir they exited the twotier modern building and crossing the neat lawn dave realized that this was the first time he had ever been allowed to walk on the grass it was in the small things that freedom was to be discovered in the laundry and supply building he submitted meekly to the last indignity the system had to inflict upon him the strip search it was a palindrome of the way he had entered the system he took off his prison clothes and bending over spread the cheeks of his buttocks so that one of the other guards who were waiting there for him could inspect his ass then they returned his own clothes and he started to get dressed in the sports coat shirt and pants he had worn to the last day of his trial to his surprise the coat was too small and the pants were too big wish i had a dollar for every time i seen that happen guffawed the man searching the box containing daves personals he glanced around at his equally amused colleagues spend five years pumping iron like you was arnie fuckin schwarzenegger and then you wonder why your clothes dont fit dave gave himself up to their amusement look at these pants he grinned holding the waistband away from his stomach i must have lost twenty pounds you know you could market this place as a fat farm the homestead plan diet safe serious weight loss through lifestyle change personalized care from corrective professionals youre lucky you did your time here slicker said one guard in arizona theyd have had you in a chain gang youd have lost a heck of a lot more weight out there the guard searching daves personals riffled through the pages of a book and then regarded its cover with mild distaste what is this shit anyway he grumbled crime and punishment by dostoevsky said dave russias greatest writer in my opinion you some kind of communist or something dave thought it over for a second well i believe in the redistribution of wealth he said just about everyone in here believes in that dont they chain gangs arent the answer said tamargo nor anything else that keeps a man in shape prison shouldnt make guys who are comin out more of a threat to lawabiding citizens than when they went in you ask me when guys come in here we should give em all lots of fatty food cheeseburgers icecream cocacola french fries much as they want whenever they want no exercise and plenty of tv phil gramm wants the system to stop turning out hardened criminals then thats the way to do it plenty of fuckin junk food and easy chairs that way when these fuckers eventually hit the streets theyre regular couch potatoes like the rest of us instead of musclebound badasses dave straightened his tie as best he could on a shirt collar that he could no longer button and grinned affably at tamargo and his cushionsized stomach youre an enlightened man he said at least you would be if you could get on the homestead plan not even out yet and youre talkin like a wiseguy observed tamargo your mission should you decide to accept it slicker is to stay the fuck out of trouble and this place got that is that your rehabilitation speech yeah your lawyers here said the guard who had asked him if he was a communist magine that wants to give you a ride back into the city must be your witty conversation slicker youve noticed it too huh the guard waved him toward a door see ya commie dave shrugged now that he had thought about it some more communism just seemed like a different kind of theft that was all and what was happening to the whole corrections system to people like benford halls made him realize that the government didnt really give a shit about releasing human beings from prisons all it cared about was the next election he remembered a scene in his favorite movie the third man orson welless famous cuckoo clock speech the one where harry lime meets his old friend holly martins on the ferris wheel dave had seen the movie so many times he could remember the speech word for word these days old man nobody thinks in terms of human beings governments dont so why should we they talk of the people and the proletariat and i talk of the mugs its the same thing they have their five year plans and so have i he took a last look around and nodded come on urged tamargo i want to get out of here too yknow im going off duty now i got some plans so have i said dave so have i chapter three so whats the plan the plan your schedule for the first day of the rest of your life dave was sitting in jimmy figaros sevenseries bmw appreciating all the leather and woodwork and thinking that it looked and felt like a small rollsroyce not that he had ever been in a rolls but this was what he imagined when he thought of one adjusting his seat electronically he glanced through the tinted window as they drove away from homestead onto highway there wasnt much to look at just broad fertile fields where for a few dollars you could pick your own crop of whatever was growing out there peas tomatoes corn strawberries they had all kinds of shit only dave had a different kind of crop in mind i dunno jimmy i mean youre driving the car and what a car it is like it you got room service on this said dave inspecting the phone in the armrest and ive never seen a car with a tv in front trip computer only picks up tv when the engine is off what about the feds does it pick them up too figaro grinned youve been reading the new yorker i read all kinds of shit these days so i hear as a matter of fact i sweep the car every morning and i dont mean the fucking rugs i got this little handheld bug detector in the glovebox there then he jerked his head back on his shoulders and allowed a big smirk to climb up onto his face but just in case they decide to get on my tail with one of those directional mikes we have double glazing on the side and rear windows of the automobile double glazing on a car youre joking a joke is not an option on a bmw can you hear any traffic noise now you come to mention it no i cant no more can anyone hear what youre saying not that youre saying much as usual its whats kept me alive until now dave shrugged and then flipped open the glovebox the bug detector was a black box about the size of a cigarette packet with a short aerial neat youre pretty serious about this surveillance shit arent you with my client list i have to be house counsel to naked tony nudelli yeah youve sure come a long way since you defended the likes of me jimmy what puzzles me is why you came all the way out here to fetch me back into the city i could have got the bus tony asked me to make sure you were all right and house counsels putting it a little strongly dave that fucking article made me sound like bobby duvall however unlike the name of that character he played in the godfather tom hagen yeah hagen unlike him i have more than one client you for instance should you ever need my advice on anything well thanks jimmy i appreciate that ok if you have no particular plans for the day then heres what well do like i say tony wanted me to make sure you were ok well drop by the office where ill show you a balance sheet ive prepared what ive done with your money that kind of thing then if youll allow me to ill make a few suggestions as to what you can do with it after that we can maybe take an early lunch only i have to be in court at sounds fine jimmy ive got nothing but appetite youre hungry for what just tell me i know this little haitian place on second avenue we could stop there for some breakfast if you wanted ive had breakfast thanks and it isnt food im hungry for jimmy sounds a little cheesy but its life im hungry for yknow its life they drove along north bay shore drive round the side of the modern building where figaro august had its suite of offices and into the underground parking lot figaro led the way toward the elevator so he said yesterday morning our office receptionist takes a delivery addressed to me while im stuck in a client meeting figaro started to chuckle as they rode the car upstairs this is apropos of what we were just talking about she and my secretary unwrap the item and nearly pass out with fright when they see what it is because people in jail arent the only ones who read the new yorker anyway to them the delivery item looks like a concrete topcoat and the delivery docket says its from someone called salvatore galeria so they think this is a mafia message along the lines of luca brazzi sleeps with the fishes etceteras etceteras only its not a mafia message at all its this piece of sculpture i bought in a gallery on south beach last week salvatore galeria on lincoln avenue cost me i bought it as a kind of conversation piece something i thought the types on my client list might appreciate to keep wise guys like you amused while i was taking a leak thats some black sense of humor you have there jimmy smithy shes our receptionist we had to send her home in a cab she was so upset by the sight of what she perceived to be a threat upon my life kind of touching when you think about it i mean its like she really gives a shit what happens to me when you put it like that it is kind of hard to believe the two men stepped out of the elevator and went along the quiet corridor into the suite figaros office occupied a corner of the building with a wraparound window affording a panoramic view of brickell bridge and the bookshelf shapes of the downtown skyline as an apartment it would have seemed generous but as an office for one man it was awesome daves eyes took in the limeoak panelling the cream leather sofas the humveesized desk the crummy art and the concrete overcoat and he found himself admiring everything except maybe the mans sense of humor and taste in paintings after the confines of his cell in homestead figaros office made him feel almost agoraphobic he glanced down at his feet he was standing on a parquet floor at the corner of an enormous sandcolored rug in the parquet was a brass plate inscribed with some sentiment that dave did not bother to bend down and read whats this first base jesus jimmy you could play ball in here of course remarked the lawyer you havent been in these offices have you business must be good when youre a lawyer dave business is always good figaro motioned dave towards a sofa checked through the notes that were stuck to the edge of his walnut partners desk and waited for carol to hike across the floor with the file she was carrying is that mister delanos file asked figaro yes it is she said and laying it neatly on the desk in front of him glanced at the man sitting down on the sofa carol was used to seeing all kinds of characters that was the politest word for who and what they were appearing in her bosss office mostly they were walking mugshots blunt faces in sharp suits knuckledraggers with silk shirts and ties as loud as mardi gras this particular character appeared to be a little different from the rest with his matching gold earrings laughing cavalier beard and mustache and elvissized quiff he looked like a pirate who had borrowed some clothes after swimming to shore but he had a nice even smile and even nicer eyes would you like coffee she asked figaro dave no thanks smiling back at him as she went out of the office carol decided that with a haircut and a shave and a change of clothes he might look younger and a little less like someone who was on his way to the gas chamber cute was what he would look the door closed behind her and she knew that the feeling she had got on her tightly skirted butt had been from those big brown eyes figaro sat down opposite dave and flipped a sheet of paper across the glass coffee table towards him his eyes still on the room dave made no move to look at the paper cigar dave shook his head they give me a throat could use a cigarette though figaro helped himself from the box of cohibas on the table a present from tony and then fetched dave a cigarette from a silver cigarette box on his desk it was the smart move dave he said through a speech bubble of blue smoke keeping your mouth shut dave smoked his cigarette silently he figured it had been figaros advice and figaros mistake so let him do the talking now it was too bad the grand jury decided to construe your silence as complicity in what happened i guess maybe the judge was taking your previous conviction into account but even so five years for something you had nothing to do with it seemed excessive and if they pinch you for something jimmy even if its something you had nothing to do with and they want you to finger one of your clients maybe your biggest client what will you do keep my mouth shut i guess right its not like you really have a choice you know youre dead for a lot longer than five years let me tell you its a big consolation when youre in the joint theres not a day passes when you dont say to yourself this is hell but it could be worse i could be doing time at the bottom of the ocean wearing jimmys overcoat dave jerked his head at the work of art occupying a corner of figaros office and grinned coolly it is a conversation piece just like you said it would be yes sir i can see how that is going to come in very handy but more object lesson than objet dart id say keep your mouth shut or else youre a talented guy dave sure look where it got me a lifetime achievement award at homestead talents for people who play the piano not the angles jimmy its not something i can afford to indulge you can afford said figaro and tapped the sheet of paper meaningfully just look at this balance sheet in consideration for your time and inconvenience thats a nice way of icing a fiveyear slice of cake two hundred and fifty thousand dollars like we agreed paid into an offshore account and then invested at percent per annum i know five percent thats not much but i figured that under the circumstances youd want zero risk on an investment like this so that comes to tax free less percent for my own management services which comes to leaves you with which works out at a year said dave figaro thought for a moment and then said is the right answer theres no end to your talents math too in case you ever wondered thats how i got started in the rackets i used to do numbers for a living when i was a kid harvard business school was not an option i was the only heebie in our neighborhood and the italian kids thought it would be cool if they had a jewish banker it figures well figure me this figaro i never charged more than percent for my financial services ten percent seems more like vig than commission most clients who pay five percent will also pay tax and theyll usually take a cheque point taken figaro stood up and went behind the desk when he returned to the sofa he was carrying a sports bag he dropped it beside dave and sat down again you do prefer cash dont you doesnt everyone not these days cash can be hard to explain anyway have you thought what youre going to do with it this isnt exactly fuckoff money jimmy three hundred grand minus the change doesnt buy you a lifestyle i could recommend some things some investments maybe thanks jimmy but i dont think i can afford the green fee consider it waived you know now is a perfect opportunity to get onto the propertyowning ladder theres plenty of good value real estate throughout the county it so happens i have an interest in the development of some country club homes on deerfield island isnt that the island capone tried to buy figaro grimaced through the cigar smoke this is fifty years ago youre talking maybe but i thought that was all zoned as a nature reserve racoons and armadillos and such like not any more besides racoons arent nature theyre pests you should really think it over go and take a look ninefoot ceilings gourmet eatin kitchens a fitness center intercoastal views from as low as twoten thanks a lot jimmy but no leaning over the arm of the sofa dave unzipped the bag and glanced inside i need this money to set me up in something something that feels a little more real than landfill real estate yeah like what for instance ive got some ideas floating around figaro shrugged would you like to count it and leave myself with nothing to do this evening no thanks dave decided to skip lunch with jimmy figaro the sight of jimmys car his twothousand dollar suit and the wideeyed look on his secretarys face had been enough to remind dave of how out of place he now appeared the lucifer beard and the curtain rings in his ears might have helped keep his ass out of trouble in homestead but things were different on the outside in the kind of respectable wellheeled places dave expected to be going maintaining the dontfuckwithme image would not be good for what he had planned it was like shakespeare said the apparel proclaimed the man he was going to need a complete makeover but first he had to find a car and well aware that he stood zero chance of driving away in something leased or rented it made sense to keep the meanasshit look going for a while at least until he had his wheels sorted that way he figured he wouldnt get sold the kind of fuckedup automobile that might have to bring his bad ass back to the showroom now that he was out of homestead he wanted to spend as much time in the open air as possible that meant a convertible and in the sports section of the herald he found what he was looking for a mazda dealer offering a selection of keenly priced sports cars a cab took him west of downtown along fortieth to bird road mazda and thirty minutes later he was driving back east toward the beach in a miata with cd alloys and only on the clock he had just started to enjoy the fresh air the sunshine the sporty stick shift and the music on the radio he didnt own any cds when pulling up at a traffic light to turn north onto second avenue he looked across at the car alongside and found himself staring into the mean eyes of tamargo the guard who had escorted him from his cell in homestead not three hours before tamargo was driving just worth of old olds and seeing dave in a car that had cost almost ten times as much the prison guards sofasized jaw dropped like hed had a brain hemorrhage the fuck dyou get that car slicker dave shifted uncomfortably in his leather seat and glanced up at the still red traffic light serving his full sentence gave him certain advantages now that he was on the outside not the least of these was the absence of any noseyfuckingparker parole officer interfering in his life but the last thing he wanted was the city police asking awkward questions about where the money for the car had come from the major question was whether tamargo could be bothered reporting what he had seen right now all the information the cops had on his whereabouts was care of jimmy figaros office there was no sense in letting them discover the license plate on his car and maybe a whole load of other shit as well so keeping one eye on his rearview mirror and tightening his grip on the leather steering wheel dave smiled back hey im talkin to you motherfucker i said whered you get the fuckin car the car yeah the car the one that says stolen on the fuckin license plate still watching the traffic light this is a clean car man oh yeah you know something tamargo youre part of a detestable solution a detestable solution in an infernal recurrence of guilt and transgression those are not my words but those of a great french philosopher if you had a shred of fuckin intelligence you would know that your very accusation implies the failure of the very same institution you represent its your kind of prejudice thats the single most important factor in recidivism maybe you dont know but thats what they call it when a con commits another crime recidivism the best thing you could do on behalf of the whole detestable corrections system drive on and shut your fuckin mouth the light turned green dave revved the engine hard and slipped the clutch tamargo stamped on his own gas pedal hoping to keep sight of dave delano long enough to read his license plate instead the little sports car just disappeared and the prison guard was more than fifty yards up the road before he realized that dave had reversed away from the traffic light tamargo braked hard and twisting his bulk around in his car seat searched the rear window for the excon in the convertible but dave was gone after that dave thought he could not change his appearance a moment too soon he was heading for bal harbor on miami beach where figaro had told him there was an excellent shopping mall opposite a classy sheraton with the sea view he had stipulated finding a different route onto biscayne boulevard and route he was soon driving across mcarthur causeway and over the intercoastal waterway with the cruise port and ship docks of miami on his right the sight of a couple of big passenger liners pointed toward the ocean gave him a little thrill for he knew that if things worked out as planned he would soon be taking a sea voyage himself right now he was arriving on south beach driving up collins and through the socalled historic district that just meant art deco but that was all the history there was going in miami which was one of the reasons why dave couldnt wait to leave the place even so it felt good to be driving along through the gaudy pastels and flashy neon of collins again with all the people around it was like rejoining the human race ten minutes up collins he pulled into the bal harbor shopping mall parked the car and still carrying the bag full of money went in search of his new look straightaway he knew he was in the right place ralph lauren giorgio armani donna karan brooks brothers jimmy figaro could hardly have recommended a better place for what dave had in mind there was even a beauty parlor offering a special a massage a haircut a manicure a facial maybe a facial could include a shave dave walked inside the place was empty a girl reading people magazine stood up from behind the counter and smiled politely can i help you dave smiled back his best feature i hope so i just got off a ship ive been at sea for several months and well you can see the problem i must look like robinson crusoe the girl chuckled lightly you do look kind of grungy she said tell me have you seen that movie trading places you know with eddie murphy yeah he was good in that one but not since thats what i want an eddie murphy makeover shave haircut facial manicure massage the whole deal one of the girls colleagues wearing a clinical white dress and a name tag that said janine had come over and was regarding dave through narrowed eyes the way he himself had looked at the mazda before buying it were more pretty woman than trading places in here honey said janine but we are kind of quiet right now so i reckon we can fix you up make you look like a regular choirboy if you want only its been a while since i shaved a man janine turned to look at her receptionist martin my ex right i used to shave him no really i used to enjoy it naturally if i had a razor near his throat today itd be a different story id murder the son of a bitch but then she smiled as if the idea of shaving dave suddenly appealed to her well what do you say honey how are you with female empowerment dave threw down his bag janine im willing to take the risk if you are chapter four so jimmy whaddya think can i trust delano to keep his fuckin mouth shut figaro looked up from his softshell crab salad and into the large bluetinted glasses worn by the man sitting opposite tony nudelli was around fifty with a face that had as many creases as his beige linen suit they were lunching in the normandy shores country club just a few minutes north of bal harbor through the arched windows of the restaurants miznerstyle layout you could just about see chers million mansion over the bay on la gorce island sure you can trust him he spent the last five years keeping his mouth shut didnt he why the hell should he rat now because now i cant keep tabs on him thats why when his ass was in prison he knew that i could get to him people i knew on the inside could fuck with him now that hes outside he can do what he likes without watching over his shoulder and i dont like that it does not sit well at ease with me cmon tony the feds could have offered him protection if hed wanted to spill his guts a whole change of life thats like the menopause it just means your fuckin life is over in any meaningful way you just ask my wife if thats not true i havent fucked her in ages naw jimmy most guys with blood in their veins would do the five years and take the money nudelli selected a toothpick from a silver holder and began to search for something stuck in his upper molars what about that did you pay him off was he happy i think so you think so nudelli snorted inspected the shred of food on the end of his toothpick for a moment and then ate it shaking his head wearily he added jimmy jimmy if i wanna know what people think ill read the fuckin herald ok from you and your sixfigure retainer plus expenses plus bonuses i want a little more than a farmboy grin and the seat of your fuckin pants i want the laws of physics as described by isaac newton if x then y do you copy im certain of it said figaro you play poker jimmy im not much of a card player tony that doesnt surprise me you say youre certain of something and yet you shrug like there were still a few doubts weighing on the padded shoulders of that expensivelooking suit of yours certainty looks a little more positive jimmy like you nod a couple of times and smile some jesus the fuckin weather man looks more certain of what hes sayin than you do tony if you dont mind me saying i think youre being a little paranoid here believe me dave is very cool while he was in homestead he used his time to full advantage got himself an education a diploma and a positive mental attitude he just wants to get on with the rest of his life doing what precisely precisely i dont know nor does he right now he just wants to chill out spend some of his money you paid him i already said so in cash with interest i asked him what he was going to do with it and offered him some financial advice he said no thanks nudelli looked thoughtful as he considered what figaro was telling him he emptied his wine glass and then flicked the crystal rim with his fingernail what were his exact words when he said that what is this exactly exact i dont know exact jimmy youre a fuckin lawyer exact is your middle name and the birthmark on your ass he said it wasnt exactly fuckoff money he said it wasnt the kind of money that buys you a lifestyle well that sure doesnt seem like someone who was happy with his kissoff im quoting him out of context you understand i dont care if youre quoting him out of bartletts familiar quotations what you described sounds like a man whos just had a tendollar coke tony if you could have been there you would have seen a guy who was happy believe me the waiter appeared to refill their glasses with the california chardonnay tony nudelli liked to drink it was a little too oaky for figaros bettereducated palate like drinking liquid furniture polish maybe not borne up to heaven in a whirlwind like elijah added figaro but content yeah is everything all right here asked the waiter fawning fine thank you yes elijah oozed the waiter thats a lovely name elijah why couldnt my parents have called me something like that instead of john tony nudelli sat back in his chair abruptly and glanced up at the waiter his top lip drawn back with irritation from his yellowing and by now wellpicked teeth because your round white face with shit on it reminded them of a fuckin toilet bowl you little cocksucker and if you and your fuckin drippy personality ever interrupt my conversation in here again ill fix it so that people get to callin you vincent on account of how youll only have the one fuckin ear to stick into other peoples business get it now fuck off before you chambre that fuckin wine with your hot jerkoff hand the waiter made a hasty withdrawal i guess id better not order any dessert chuckled figaro part of him quite liked it when tony nudelli talked tough so long as he wasnt on the sharp end of it himself it gave him a thrill to experience albeit vicariously the kind of power that nudelli wielded are you kidding pecan pie heres the best i was thinking he might try and get his own back in some plausibly edible but disgusting way people have wound up dead for a lot less he doesnt know that youre right jimmy snapping his fingers loudly nudelli waved the maitre d over to their table goddamn little faggot might trojan horse just about anything into a piece of pecan pie how are things here mister nudelli louis wed like two pieces of pecan pie and id like you to serve them to us yourself understand yes sir right away itd be my pleasure the maitre d disappeared in the direction of the kitchen jimmy let me ask you something sure tony he chuckled as he caught sight of the cowed waiter im all ears nudelli glanced angrily after him fuckin dipshit whassa matter with waiters in this country its not enough you give em a tip they want your goddamn assurance that you dont think any the less of them for what theyre doing to make a buck dont start me on waiters the other day i order a steak at the delano and when the waiter brings it he tells me that the vegetables will be along in just a few minutes i tell the guy what is this am i supposed to eat this meal in instalments figaro laughed at his own story and laughed some more when he saw that it had amused nudelli only he wished hed thought to substitute another restaurant for the delano it was one of the smartest on south beach beloved of madonna and stallone but the name didnt help to take nudellis mind off the one thing that was obsessing him right now which was dave delano what was it that you wanted to ask me tony before we got started on shitty waiters just this whats the statute of limitations on murder there is no statute of limitations on murder and thats precisely my point suppose delano does decide to talk to the feds take a chill pill tony delanos no snitch hear me out jimmy like a good lawyer just suppose he does for whatever reason lets for the sake of argument assume that he holds my ass responsible for his period of incarceration after all jail does funny things to a man turns him queer makes him vengeful maybe he wants to take my quartermill and my liberty with it i mean whats to stop him just answer me that will ya he probably holds me more responsible than anyone shrugged figaro after all it was me representing him before that jury but he isnt going to do it tony no no were not talking predictive sequences here were addressing a hypothetical situation you understand like we was two philosophers in a roman sauna bath what is there in the way of hard facts that enables us to say that it wont ever happen that dave delano wont decide to snitch wait wait i thought of something suppose he does something wrong a crime and the cops arrest him his ass is going down for it but he might not want to do any more time and who could blame the guy after five years in the joint not me for sure but maybe knowing this the feds figure to scare him into telling them what he shoulda told em in the first place trade his ass for mine nudelli slapped the table hard like he was killing a fly just as the maitre d arrived bearing two pecan pies whats to stop him doing that huh jimmy here we are mister nudelli pecan pie thanks louis my pleasure sir enjoy well when you put it as coldly as that tony i do put it as coldly as that in a frosted glass with ice in it whats to stop him eh figaro gouged a piece of pie onto his fork but he left it lying on his plate for a moment nothing except maybe hes more afraid of you than he is of the cops nudelli raised his large hairy hands into the air and gestured in a way that reminded figaro of the pope benevolently greeting the faithful from the balcony of st peters on christmas day but the lawyer could see that there was nothing particularly benevolent about the way this conversation was headed you see maybe were back with uncertainty again you put your finger right on it jimmy maybe now put yourself in my position i gotta family to look after a business to run people whose livelihoods depend on me he sighed with loud exasperation and forked a piece of pie into his mouth you know what the problem is here language the corruption of the fuckin language words dont mean what they used to because of all the fuckin minorities we gotta tiptoe around like we cant say this and we cant say that and because of all the politicians who use language to say nothing at all i give you a for instance jimmy a guy says to a girl will you let me fuck you now if she says maybe you know its a real possibility but if you were to say to some politician will you build more schools and more hospitals if we vote you into office and he says maybe then you know for sure that he aint gonna do it for him maybe means never you see what im saying figaro was not sure that he did there were times when he thought tony nudelli one of the sharpest clients he had and others when he thought him as dumb as daytime tv this extended thought had left figaro wondering what nudellis original point had been but he nodded anyway and said yeah sure he decided to try and steer the conversation to a different conclusion from the one he feared nudelli still had in his malicious old mind you want me to have a word with delano tony impress upon him the absolute necessity of keeping his mouth shut hes coming by the offices tomorrow to talk about some things i can straighten him out then if you want me to willy barizon said nudelli shaking his head what about him hes halfbrother of tommy rizzoli the guy you put out of the ice business figaro smiled uncomfortably tony i advised him to sell the business in order that he might avoid a prison sentence thats all same thing anyway im gonna get willy to go and talk to delano are you gonna whack him nudelli looked pained you should eat some of this pie its the best figaro lifted the fork to his mouth he had to admit it was good i hate to hear my attorney use a word like that nudelli said stiffly but no i am not going to whack him i just want delano reminded forcibly reminded that he should still fear me he licked his lips and then wiped his mouth with a napkin i think maybe i want something sweet to drink with my dessert a glass of muscat maybe you like muscat figaro shook his head now wheres that cocksucker got to he grumbled looking around for the waiter he stared back at figaro sides id like to know more about these new friends of his before i even think of whackin him i heard he shared a cell with some ivan while he was in homestead and that this ivan has some important new york connections id hate to whack delano and find myself with those russian bastards comin after me they like killing people i think they like killing people more than they like making money well blood will out i guess killings in their history making money never was the roommates name was einstein gergiev reported figaro people called him einstein because he was a former physicist and computer guy before becoming involved with the russian rackets and then here in florida clever son of a bitch huh he had some twin town scam going with the two cities which two cities the two st petersburgs the one on the gulf of mexico i heard of but wheres the other in russia northern russia i didnt know that it was quite a fraud i hear cost the city of st petersburg the one in florida several million dollars is that so anyway gergiev was released six months ago and deported back to russia but i didnt know he was connected in new york all russian wiseguys the redfellas are connected there brighton beach you should see it fuckin russkie home from home little odessa they call it connected there in new york or in israel tel aviv half of them jews that left russia are connected thats how they got the money to get out in the first place nudelli shrugged i got this cousin in tampa maybe he can find out something about this eisenstein redfella wheres delano staying he said he was going to check into the bal harbor sheraton thats a nice beach hotel classy these days you can forget the fontainebleau nudelli straightened in his chair the waiter was in his sights hey you elijah cmere seeing tony nudelli the waiter backed toward the door of the restaurant like a quarterback searching out one of his receivers seconds later he was out of the door and running through the old world mediterranean courtyard in the direction of biscayne bay jesus laughed nudelli whad i fuckin say chapter five dave had missed the ocean even one as busy with people and boats as the one off miami beach sandwiched between the pale blue sky and the pink rock dust that passed for sand the gray snakeskincolored sea rolled toward him in white scribbles of water in homestead he had often imagined having this view again but it was not his regained sight of the ocean that served to underscore his freedom but its accompanying salty smell and visceral breathy sound he had forgotten that part back inside the four walls of his hotel suite luxurious though it was it had been all too easy to conjure the nightmare of being in his cell again in the same way that an amputee could still feel the severed limb he had only to close his eyes and listen to the airconditioned silence but here on the beach with its sounds and the smells thrusting in upon his consciousness the feel of the wind in his neatly cut hair and the late afternoon sun warming his smoothly shaven face like the hot plate of a giant stove it was impossible to mistake his surroundings for anything but the outside world dave lay on his beach towel and breathed deep from the sky above him he didnt even read his other neglected senses wouldnt allow him to concentrate on anything but where he was and what that meant a few days relaxation in bal harbor would help him to begin dismantling the walls inside his head after that he could go to work willy four breakfasts barizon got his nickname from the time when he ate four whole cooked breakfasts two eggs sunny side up two strips of bacon a sausage and hash browns each in a dennys on lincoln avenue a little over six foot three he weighed around pounds in his shorts and when he was dressed the extra twenty being mostly referable to the two handguns he wore underneath his loose hawaiian style shirt his tongue was a couple of sizes too large for his face which meant he spoke out of the side of his wetlooking mouth as if he still had one of the breakfasts pouched in the other cheek like a chaw his black hair was naturally curly although the cut made it look as if hed just had a permanent with small dreadlocks that hung loosely over the tops of his elephantine ears like a hasidic jews with a passing resemblance to a budgetsized giant willy barizon was a hard man to miss besides it was a while since he had done this kind of work and he had forgotten how to be subtle the icetrucking business had been all front looking tough when you turned up to collect was nearly all you needed to know it was rare that you actually had to smack someone dave made willy the minute he saw him or rather he made the look the big man received from the bellboy when dave came out of the hotel restaurant and asked the front desk to send the fax he had written out in neat cyrillic capitals while having his dinner five years of watching his ass in homestead had given dave eyes in the back of his head the bellboy might as well have shot a neon arrow into the big mans chest theres your mark go get him dave stepped into an elevator car alongside a woman with hair as tall as a chefs hat what was it with miami women and big hair with one eye on this confection of hair and the wizened doll beneath it he pressed his floor button and stood back in the car as the woman selected her own floor then she moved to one side as willy joined them it was a second or two before he thought to press a button himself which more or less confirmed daves suspicion that the big guy had been waiting to follow dave up to his room but the question of motive still eluded him not a cop that much was certain a cop would have pinched him in the lobby and for what suspicion grand theft auto as the doors slid shut dave turned toward willy barizon and held out his left wrist to display the watch he had bought in the bal harbor mall that same afternoon you see this watch man what not what watch this watch is a breitling chronometer best watch in the world baby doll was pretending that he didnt exist forget rolex i mean thats just for the movies and national geographic this this is a goddamn quality timepiece cost me so fuckin what snarled willy wait i havent finished you wanna see my wallet dave took out his wallet and flipped it open see that coach leather isnt that beautiful and theres in cash too youre nuts the elevator chimed as it reached baby dolls floor really she said stepping smartly out on her high heels some people just dont know how to handle it do they youre so right lady agreed willy dave returned the wallet to the coat pocket of his linen suit and took out his new fountain pen as the doors closed again then theres this fountain pen fuck you pal and fuck your fountain pen said willy and instinctively patted one of the two pieces he was carrying under his waistband daves prisonsharp eyes took in the telltale bulge at a glance im telling you all this for a reason he explained coolly im telling you this so youll know how high i rate your fucking chances of robbing me youve got the wrong guy delano who said anything about robbing your dipshit ass dave took a step back in the car the tongue almost fell out of the guys mouth when he talked dave had felt the spittle on his face like early rain his eyes lingered on the tongue momentarily fascinated by its grotesque aspect at best it looked like the record label for the rolling stones that andy warhol had designed sticky fingers he still had the album in his record collection if his sister hadnt sold it at worst the tongue looked like some kind of hideous pink jellyfish that lived inside a ring of yellow coral the elevator chimed again as it reached willys chosen floor only he paid it no attention the guy had used his name he was carrying a piece and he had followed him into the elevator what else did dave need to know he unscrewed the cap of his fountain pen are you finished giving me a guided tour of your personals theres one more thing insisted dave theres this pen this pen is a mont blanc meisterstuck its called mont blanc because the fourteencarat nib tells you the height of mont blanc should you want to know thats the highest mountain in france go ahead and take a look dave held the pen up for willys inspection four thousand eight hundred and ten meters high go ahead and look because im gonna give you this pen as a gift willy looked dave hardly hesitated stabbing the big man in the white of his eye with the mitreshaped point of the cohibasized pen simultaneously spattering willys face neck and shirt collar with a galaxy of inkspots willy howled with pain pressing both hands to his injured eye leaving dave free to hit him hard with a punch to each kidney as if was working the heavy bag in the prison gym he finished a trio of blows with a low arcing hook to willys balls that had his whole shoulder behind it and felt as cruel as if hed tugged pieces of willys flesh from his body with redhot pincers the elevator doors opened with a gasp of air that echoed the sound from willys misshapen mouth crouched down on his haunches one hand on his balls the other on his eye willy looked more dwarfish now and easily manageable dave could see that there was no need to hit him again but he had questions that needed to be answered and placing the allleather sole of a smart new loafer in the small of willys back dave launched him into the hallway willy bellyflopped onto the thickpile carpet hit his head against a fire extinguisher attached to the wall and then passed out dave collected his pen off the floor of the elevator and stepped quickly out of the car before the doors closed a glance both ways no one about he took hold of willys legs and dragged him down the hallway and into his suite safely through the door dave frisked willy carefully relieving him of a ruger securitysix worn on a belt inside his pants that he figured was mostly for show and underneath a belly band a smaller quieterlooking automatic that was probably what usually got the job done dave unloaded the big revolver and kept the handy for when the guy came round the name on the drivers license he found in the sweatdampened wallet was willy barizon dave had never heard of him there was a mastercard eighty dollars a ticket from the sheratons valetparking service a slip for a dog at hollywood and a hookers business card with a area number foxy blonde young voluptuous beauty i visit you on the back was written a name tia dave flicked the card into the trash i dont think youll be visiting willy for a while he said recalling the ferocity of his blow to the big mans balls dave ducked into the bathroom and returned with the cords from the two bathrobes with which he bound willys hands behind his back and then his ankles he fixed himself a drink and gathered some matchbooks from his bar area as willy groaned his way back to consciousness dave squatted down on the backs of willys thighs facing his feet and began to remove the big guys shoes and socks he glanced over his shoulder and said how are you doin there moose ready to have a little socratic dialogue yet that means i say one thing you say another and i get to reach a conclusion dave flung away willys socks with distaste and sipped some of his drink ever hear of socrates moose he was a greek philosopher who was condemned to death for corrupting the youth of athens this was before television of course kids today theyve got cable so theyre probably already corrupted right this socrates was obliged to take hemlock thats a kind of poison related to the parsley family of plants as a matter of small interest so be careful how you garnish anyhow when i read about this in a book by plato i got to wondering just how the fuck do you go about obliging someone to take poison of his own volition i mean its not like they strapped him down on a gurney for a lethal injection like they do in the can no he just sat around with a few of his good friends and drank it himself no shit and i asked myself why fugg you groaned willy well now it turns out that those ancient greeks nasty bastards gave you an alternative to letting you poison your own self you know what that was a guy would come along and torture you to death how he did it was like this hed tie you down and give you some kind of drug to help your ass relax amyl nitrate or its ancient equivalent most probably same as those sm gays do those guys do all kinds of shit to each other that i cant figure when the executioner figured you were ready he would stick his whole fucking arm up your ass robert mapplethorpe style and just keep on going until he got a hold of your heart when he did and this was the most exquisite part of the torture he would slowly crush your heart in his hand like it was a fucking sponge or something can you imagine that talk about pains in your chest jesus the real experts could make it last a while like experienced lovers and that that was the alternative to poison i kid you not a fatal fistfuck no wonder old socrates elected to off himself right geezuzz greist precisely another writer youre gonna hear me refer to a lot of literary figures you spend any time with me moose the last five years ive done nothing but read and work out but that part you already know i guess sorry i had to hit you so hard but youre a big guy moose anyway this other writer name of samuel johnson said that the prospect of being hanged helps concentrate a mans mind wonderfully and my guess is that so does torture vugg ovv my eye zayin nuthin azzhole dave drew willys feet toward him moose moose you wanna do something about these feet of yours worst case of athletes foot i ever saw do you dry between your toes you should you know youve got yourself a chronic case of it here i suspect damn difficult to eradicate most of those fungal preparations they dont work but ive got a surefire way of getting rid of the tiny microbe that causes this misunderstood chiropodic condition its really a secret but i dont mind sharing it with someone like you moose dave turned around but before i do is there some secret youd like to share with me kind of a quid pro quo like maybe who was it sent you to see me packing thunder and why talk to me moose and dont tell me youre looking for your velma or ill think youre being cute with me the vugs velma youre not a chandler fan thats too bad moose i think youd enjoy him hes what we call hardboiled a bit like these feet of yours so what do you say willy barizon coughed painfully look mizter you got the wrog guy i dont know nuthin nobody vuggin zent me my eye therez been zum miztake moose youre insulting my intelligence and my intelligence doesnt like that it takes offense at just about anything but mostly it takes offense at the assumption that it isnt there that im as dumb as you are dave started to thread the hotel matchbooks between willy barizons malodorous and clammy toes as if he had been preparing to paint the big mans toenails ugh remind me to wash my hands when im done here what are ya doin its what i was telling you about moose that surefire way of getting rid of athletes foot fact is man youve got to burn it out like cauterizing a wound extreme heat kills infection these are matchbooks moose you ever see a whole matchbook burn its like a roman fucking candle man help screamed moose and started to struggle desperately but dave was ready with a bar towel stuffing it into willy barizons chopshaped mouth moose moose just shut the fuck up will ya you and i are going to have a yossariansized problem here if were not careful catch you remember that i mean you can hardly answer my questions if i gotta keep a towel in that picassodrawn mouth of yours but then i can hardly go ahead and let you scream the fuckin place down either you perceive my dilemma so i tell you what im gonna do part of your problem here i think is your lack of imagination your inability to visualize just how fiercely one of these little matchbooks can burn hence you are unable to conceptualize just how painful this will be for you so im gonna give you a little demonstration in as nice a way as possible and then im gonna take this towel out of your blowhole at the risk of seeming otiose thats the point at which youd better start talkin or im going to be cooking some bacon down here so here goes with the object lesson dave placed an ashtray in front of willy barizons face then he tugged one of the matchbooks from between willys toes unfolded it and lit it with the silver lighter hed bought from the porsche shop that afternoon the cover of the book burned reluctantly for a moment and then extinguished dave snapped the lighter on and lit it again this time the cover caught properly alight and a second later the matches themselves ignited spectacularly in a cloud of acrid blue smoke whooa chuckled dave olympic fucking flame ouch that looks painful to me what do you say willy that look painful to you willy nodded furiously ready for that dialogue now willy kept nodding good boy dave hauled the towel out of willys mouth so who sent you and why it was tony nudelli that surprised him tony why what the hells his beef with me he wanted you to be reminded to keep your mouth shut about whatever it is that you know about dave frowned as he tried to make sense of this information ive spent the last five years in the joint keeping my mouth shut he shook his head it doesnt make sense i swear its true exactly how were you going to remind me i mean were you just going to have a quiet word in my ear or was i supposed to feel the need for silence in some nonessential part of my body i was just to smack you around some thats all maybe break a few fingers nothing serious ive had girlfriends who might dispute that willy its the gods honest truth i swear shut up a minute while i think dave was silent for a moment as he weighed up what willy had told him it was just possible that tony nudelli was indeed sufficiently scared of what dave knew about him to have ordered up the goon he was now sitting on only tony usually took care of things on a more permanent basis than just a few broken fingers and a busted lip dave knew that from personal memory but as he thought about it some more it occurred to him that maybe there was a way he might turn the situation to his advantage a way of demonstrating his loyalty to tony a useful prelude for what was to come no he said slowly i just dont buy your story willy look youve got to believe me why would tony want to grease me i didnt say that i said hurt not grease after five years the one thing tony knows about me is that i can be trusted not to spill my guts to anyone look im just the button you know that i aint the mans psychoanalyst i aint privy to the workings of his mind i owe him a favor thats the way it works you know that he tells me to do somethin i do it and i dont look for no fuckin mission statement i get paid to do what im fuckin told you know what i think i think the russian sent you over here to whack me what russian theres no russian involved here thats what i think i think it was einstein gergiev who set this up isnt that right willy no man now that makes a lot more sense the russian be quite natural for you to be more afraid of him than you are of me even with a bunch of matchbooks stuck between your toes hes a terrifying character that russian i should know i shared a cell with him for four years no youve got to be lying moose dave snapped on the cigarette lighter for extra emphasis desperate now willy struggled underneath dave his neck and ears reddening with the exertion look man i dont know about any fucking russian i never met anyone called einstein whosits face it was tony nudelli i swear sweet mother of jesus i swear its true oooh are you a catholic moose yeah im a catholic tell ya what im gonna do moose dave stood up and went to the bedside drawer where he found a gideon bible im gonna get you to swear an oath on the bible sure anything just so long as you believe me dave sat down on willys back and tucked the gideon bible underneath his large jaw now repeat after me moose as i have hope for the resurrection of the body as i hope for the resurrection of the body and life everlasting in jesus christ and life everlasting in jesus christ what i have said here is the truth so help me god what ive said here is the truth so help me god now kiss the bible with that sucker of yours willy kissed the bible until it was wet with saliva youre not brought up by jesuits i hope said dave only those guys were so tricky they could swear one thing think another kiss a bible and get away with it thanks to the doctrine of equivocation no man no ok i believe you dave stood up again and took another sip of his drink all right im gonna untie you now just remember though ive got that little phoenix arms twentytwo in my pocket you try anything ungrateful moose and ill take some of the pressure off that brain of yours give you an extra fuckin blowhole you clear on that yeah clear dave untied willy and stood back as slowly painfully the big man sat up on the floor willy checked his balls and then pressed the heel of his hand gingerly against his injured eye through his one good eye willy looked across the suite at the man now sitting down on a large creamcolored sofa laid out on the floor in front of delano like the jerry seinfeld american express ad were the results of what looked to have been a fairly major shopping expedition several pairs of shoes piles of shirts sports shirts sweaters and pants and a brand new apple laptop there was nothing cheap on view even the suite with a wraparound balcony and a sea view looked like three or four hundred a night hows your eye dave asked hurts sorry bout that moose take a hand towel from the bathroom if you like and some ice from the refrigerator make yourself a cold compress should keep some of the swelling down thanks man moose fetched the ice he was regretting the passing of his ice business with cousin tommy but for that he wouldnt be sitting there with the risk of losing an eye and maybe he wasnt quite cut out for the tough stuff after all there had to be something easier watching willy fix his cold compress dave felt sorry for the big lunk even though he was sure that willy would have broken his fingers like hed said and without any remorse you can tell tony how disappointed i am about this said dave cruelly he added when you see him if i see him willy said bitterly my fuckin eye i think you blinded me disappointed but not resentful tell him that despite this little misunderstanding were still friends tell him that maybe even future business associates yeah tell tony ive got a business proposition for him chance to make a big score that ought to help reassure him tell him ill be in touch through jimmy figaro willy picked up the magnum and slid it into the clip inside his pants he glanced around for the then remembered that delano had it in his pocket dave guessed what he was looking for took it out and hefted it in his hand ill just hang onto this a while he said first rule of selfdefense have a gun can i leave now willy sounded contrite contrite and concerned id like to get to a hospital sure but arent you forgetting something dave nodded at willys bare feet and the matchbooks between his toes your dogs guy willy started to pick them out i never figured you for no dennis hopper man said willy shaking his head in those clothes you dont look so tough more like a fuckin college boy the apparel does oft proclaim the man said dave but you should have seen me at eight oclock this morning willy pocketed one of the matchbooks souvenir he said i collect them that should be one to remember suggested dave would you really have done that set my toes on fire dave shrugged moose ive been asking myself that same question chapter six special agent kate furey stared out of the window of a thirdfloor conference room in fbi headquarters and stifled a deep yawn as her boss assistant special agent in charge kent bowen began to tell the story it was one of those unpleasant cruel stories that her male colleagues seemed to relish most of them were already grinning since everyone knew that the subject of the story was how bolivar suarez a cousin of the colombian ambassador and one of miamis major cocaine traffickers had met his untimely death the night before last so you wanna see where this asshole lives on delray beach jesus two acres of oceanfront estate and the house is like something out of james bond battleship gray square feet looks like the guggenheim museum in new york but inside its a goddamn palace marble floors mahogany doors and windows art deco fixtures and lights from paris you get the idea florida living in the lap to the tune of million anyway heres the setup asshole liked art in a big fucking way pictures all over he must have kept some of those new york salerooms going singlehanded modern but not shit yknow i mean i know nuthin about art but even i could see that some of these artists had real talent lot of scottish stuff from glasgow which i liked of course asshole probably thought glasgow was a doubleglazing company lot of south american stuff too i guess that he did know frida kahlo diego rivera you name it asshole had it in a frame with a little light on i mean very particular like he couldnt just hammer a fucking nail in the wall these pictures were positioned like he was a fucking surveyor story goes he once beat up his kids nanny when she accidentally brushed against one of these canvases and when i say beat up i mean beat up apparently he used one of those romitron cosh things you know kind of a plastic ball and chain on her fucking hands damn near crippled her no one touches those paintings except asshole himself from headquarters on northwest second avenue it was only a couple of minutes drive east to kates williams island apartment home at least it was her home until the divorce came through howard her husband and a partner with one of miamis smartest law firms had paid almost for the place her own lawyers had told her there was a chance she might get to keep the apartment as part of the settlement but she was thinking that it hardly seemed fair he shouldnt get half besides it wasnt as if she actually wanted to stay there in view of all the secretaries in his office that howard had been balling there when as on this occasion kate found herself working late this information must have got out to someone in one of the other cartels bowen continued with one eye on kate someone who wanted asshole dead take your pick hell theres enough of them anyhow whoever it was they were real clever set it up while asshole was back in bogota the delray place was well guarded on the highway side cameras sensors the whole protection package but light on the ocean side like the stupid schmuck had never heard of boats anyway ccgd seven reports seeing some kind of high performance sports boat anchored a couple of miles up the coast off the municipal beach the night before asshole got hit sam brockman figures they must have put a diver into the water who crawled ashore at the suarez place under cover of darkness there was only the one guard on the beach front the guard says he saw nothing kate kent bowen wanted her attention and approval most of all she was one of the miami bureaus brightest agents not to mention one of its great beauties and he had a thing about her she snapped her attention back to bowen and his interminable story heres the clever part he said guy gets in the house a real pro he selects his picture no idea what it was takes it off the wall and flattens out about grams of c plastic onto the back of the canvas then he tapes a simple tilt detonator onto the inside of the stretcher just a ball bearing inside a test tube two needles a little battery and a blasting cap and thats his bomb beautiful a really neat job he leaves the picture hanging slightly crooked and then skedaddles out of there hes long gone by the time asshole returns from colombia bowen shook his head as if still amazed at the assassins ingenuity as usual the sniffer dogs go in first but they cant get the scent of any explosives because the pictures about five feet up the wall the asshole walks into the room and sees the picture hanging squint as quasimodos dick and being the obsessive he is right away hes over there to straighten it bowen sat back in his chair grinning sadistically to savor the climax of his story the ball bearing rolls along the test tube touches both points of the needles completes the circuit and karaboom blows the guys head clean off his fucking shoulders kate caught bowens eye and smiled thinly as he and the rest of the guys in the room laughed some more at that the crime scenes investigation unit spent fortyfive minutes looking for bolivars head they were beginning to think one of those colombians must have taken it for a fucking souvenir when they found it floating in the goddamn aquarium the blast had carried it right across the room like a basketball bowen pretended to make a basket field goal two points he cackled some more wiped a tear from his eye and thinking of another wisecrack said now thats what i call a really mindblowing picture bowen guffawed loudly and helped himself to a glass of water like hed just told a really funny story on jay leno balding and fiftyish he reminded kate a lot of colonel kilgore in apocalypse now he had the same kind of hardass attitude to the enemy and the same love of his staff as soon as she started to speak she felt like the guy who wouldnt surf at kilgores beach party bolivar suarezs assassination she began hey what has two asses and no head chuckled bowen the assassination of bolivar suarez since his death would seem to leave rocky envigado as miamis undisputed citizen cocaine she persisted it may be that we need look no further than that particular quarter when searching for a perp one way of getting your head round modern art said someone else and bowen found himself trying to keep a straight face in the presence of kate fureys more businesslike demeanor citizen cocaine bowen repeated i like that did you think of it yourself no i think i read it in a british newspaper she explained aware that she could easily have got away with claiming it for herself there were times she knew when she could be too honest even by the standards of the fbi when i was on vacation there last year the one and only time she had been outside the states and the last good time she had enjoyed with howard and yet it had been a vacation only in part the main purpose of her trip to london and paris had been to visit with british and french police forces who were worried about the amount of cocaine now arriving in europe from colombia via florida but after miami it had seemed like a vacation sorry she said i mean when i was visiting with ncis and interpol aha grinned bowen now we learn the truth agent furey you were holidaying at the expense of the american taxpayer kate smiled politely and hoped that they could get on with the meeting in progress its purpose was to share new intelligence about drug traffickers who used south florida as an entrepot for their activities information received from other agencies at home and abroad now that kent bowen had told his story she could table what she had learned and then maybe go home and soak in the tub it had been a long day i had lunch with peter van der velden today and how is dutch van der velden was a detective inspector with hollands bvd on a twoyear attachment as special liaison officer at the netherlands consulate in miami hes fine go somewhere nice dont worry he paid i bet i know where you went that place in coral gables le festival dutch loves that place yes le festival she felt herself coloring a little as she made her reluctant admission is that good this was special agent chris ochao a halfcuban guy with his arm in a sling excellent said bowen best souffles in town he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and added romantic too cant say as i noticed said kate no someone sniggered kate looked bowen squarely in the eye she knew it was generally suspected around the office that she was having an affair with peter van der velden every year all the liaison officers from the various consulates in miami got together and hosted a party at the doubletree hotel in coconut grove it was only two or three months since the last one at which kate had been seen leaving with the dutch policeman after talking with him alone for almost an hour yknow i think theres something i ought to clear up she said smiling coolly a little misunderstanding i knows been going around just for the record i am not fucking peter van der velden nor have i ever fucked peter van der velden nor do i have any intention of fucking or being fucked by peter van der velden moreover our lunch appointment was not made for the purpose of his suggesting that he might get to fuck me but that we might come together in a spirit of cooperation and diplomacy and get to fuck some majorleague drug traffickers and bad guys do i make myself clear she looked from one end of the table to the other nobody said anything for a moment everyone got that said bowen ok kate you made your point what is it that you were going to tell us about peter van der velden before you were interrupted just this she said pleased no one in the room had cottoned onto the occasional relationship she was actually having with the british liaison officer nick hemmings peters sources tell him that theyre expecting a big shipment from rocky envigado and get this its coming up from mallorca same as before meaning bowen was frowning now kate took a deep breath meaning last time we must have missed it yeah well if we missed it so did the spanish police and so did the dutch said ochao we searched that boat from top to bottom there was nothing could be that rocky has discovered a new way of transporting the stuff said bowen a way we dont yet know about maybe hes doing it on the internet suggested another agent seems like thats all thats obsessing people these days i want us to get scientific here said bowen quantico national crime information center the smithsonian back issues of the law enforcement bulletin if you have to with all the resources at our command we ought to be able to come up with some ideas bowen stood up and tried to look inspiring to his people it seemed easy enough until he met kates doubtful stare problem kate it might be that there really was nothing last time that he used that first trip as a way of embarrassing us after that little debacle maybe he thinks now well leave him alone but either way we ought to try and find the boat before we do anything dont you think well sure that goes without saying doesnt it he placed a carefully avuncular hand on kates shoulder take charge of the landing party mister spock i want some answers kate drove home in her white sebring fixed herself a rum punch drank it while running her bath and then fixed herself another before soaking in the hot water the bathroom gave onto the wraparound terrace and she left the blinds up so she could see across the intercoastal waterway to the winking lights of the miami riviera beyond it was a big sunken tub with a jacuzzi and just about her favorite spot in the whole apartment a couple of times after she and howard had taken the place they had shared a tub together but mostly he preferred a shower and if he did take a bath he liked to have it to himself after a while she got used to the idea that he generally took advantage of her extended sessions in the tub to lie in bed and watch the playboy channel on cable he pretended he didnt of course and would switch onto letterman or leno the minute she came back into the bedroom not that she had minded him watching it very much but what really did surprise and irritate her was that he must have believed he could take out a subscription to any new channel let alone playboy and that somehow she wouldnt notice she worked for the fbi for christs sake noticing things was her job naturally she had known that he was having affairs almost as soon as it started happening she had hoped that he might get whatever it was out of his system just as long as none of it got into hers but what finally prompted her to take action was not jealousy nor even her love for howard but like the playboy channel subscription the irritation she experienced at being considered too stupid to see through his lies and evasions she was the bright one not him second in her class in law at the university of florida in gainsville graduating with honors this was the same class in which her future husband had struggled to make the top fifty and still the bastard figured he could outsmart her like she was the dumbest shortorder waitress in oklahoma kate had borrowed some surveillance equipment from the bureau to obtain aural and pictorial evidence of howards infidelity and caught him banging the ladies golf pro from the nearby turnberry isle country club that was bad enough golf was such a stupid game but its the small things that really bother you and she had been even more appalled to discover that howards golfing partner was using the contraceptive gel from kates own bathroom cupboard for their stroke play so with the help of a girlfriend in the bureaus laboratory and following extensive trial and experimentation she had substituted the gel inside a tube of gynogel for an identically clear and similarly scented brand of exercise balm an alcohol and mentholbased deep heat muscle rub that was definitely not recommended for use on sensitive areas especially the two sensitive areas that kate had in mind even now months after the event just the thought of the tape she had made of her husband and his lover screaming through their hottest ever session of lovemaking could still make her laugh out loud whoever said that revenge was a dish best served cold had obviously never listened to two generous servings of overheated genitals somehow kate had never thought of herself as the vengeful wife with her beautiful face her keen appreciation of art literature and music not to mention a strong imagination she had always seen herself as a more romantic type it seemed odd to think about it now but that was the reason she had joined the bureau in the first place and not some sawgrassdull firm of downtown attorneys she had wanted action and excitement even the occasional danger but of late the most hazardous thing she had done had been forgetting the safety catch on her lady smith wesson and for all that she needed a weapon she might as well have been packing a hatpin in the hope of getting a foreign posting like bogota caracas lima or mexico city kate had started to learn spanish meanwhile she stared out to sea and dreamed of adventure chapter seven everyone agreed that al cornaros wife madonna was an extraordinary woman it wasnt that she was beautiful just that everyone thought it extraordinary that al should have married her at all most of the guys who worked for tony nudelli were married to beautyparlor blondes with brassieresized iqs and conde nast educations not so much trophy wives as tin cup ones these were the kind of women who could manipulate an eyebrow pencil with more skill than they could use a pen and for whom oral skills meant giving a good blowjob what made madonna different was her intelligence her sharp tongue her total disregard for selfimage and the size of her tits the tits were genuine you just had to look at the rest of madonna to work that out they hung around her waist like something that had been sculpted there as a dry run for washington and jefferson on mount rushmore a monumental effect that was enhanced by madonnas dislike of brassieres or for that matter any underwear at all and the recent birth of her fourth son al junior al senior loved his wife but it didnt stop him making jokes about her for tony nudellis amusement keeping tony amused was an important part of als job as tonys business manager keeping him amused and taking care of business colonel tom parker with guns and jokes today the business included dave delano but first al wanted to make sure tony was in a more forgiving mood than the day before when al had had to tell him that willy four breakfasts had fucked up and was now laid up in the miami beach community hospital with a serious eye injury courtesy of his planned victim it was not quite ten oclock when al arrived at nudellis luxurious villa in the heart of key biscayne he recognized the red porsche convertible that was parked in the driveway and instinctively made his way to the square foot poolhouse he knew his boss a keen swimmer would be in the sixtyfoot pool under the personal supervision of his coach sindy a former lifeguard from wet nwild in orlando al liked to see sindy not least because she was usually naked and there was always a lot to see he was a nonswimmer himself but it might have been worth getting into the water just to have sindy encourage him to learn in her own special way from time to time she would dive gracefully off the granite deck chase the naked tony underwater like some fabulous dark dolphin and then get underneath him to lick and nibble his penis most people thought nudelli was called naked tony because of his surname but al knew different al knew that it was mostly because of what tony and sindy got up to in the pool sindy told al that she got the idea from reading a book about the roman emperors and in particular the life of tiberius al wasnt much of a reader but that was one book he just had to take a look at and they were every bit as depraved as she had said sindy was tall black and beautiful and merely looking at her gave al a hardon tony called her his angelfish al walked into the poolhouse morning al smiled sindy morning sindy just about the first thing al looked for after he had looked at sindys pubic hair and then her tits was sindys orange juice tony didnt swim a prescribed number of lengths or even a set period but only for as long as it took sindy to finish him off in her mouth if sindy was drinking orange juice it meant that she and tony were done party over sindy toasted al silently with half a glass of juice and then sipped at it teasingly als eyes stayed on her lips and the juice want some she said offering him the glass ah no thanks ah sindy there was no way al was going to put his lips anywhere near that glass after what her mouth had been doing sure its um freshly squeezed yknow what im sayin sure i ah just had breakfast hmm so did i sindy swallowed thoughtfully rather a lot as it happens tony must be taking extra zinc or something giggling at als very obvious discomfort sindy tapped him on the nose with one of her long scarlet fingernails and called out to the weary looking man crawling slowly towards the poolside ok hon im outta here you ok want me to help you out im ok and you helped me out enough already thanks baby ill call you later al watched sindys bare ass all the way back to the changing rooms and shook his head in quiet desperation i should learn to fuckin swim he said you said it mary joe mary joe was what tony always called al whenever the subject of al not swimming came up after mary joe kopechnie the girl who drowned at chappaquiddick when ted kennedy didnt mary joe or sometimes pussy nudelli sank beneath the surface of the water and kicked his way toward the pool steps al had to admit tony looked good for a man of his age his shoulders and chest were broad and he still had all his hair which was a cary grant shade of silver gray nudelli enjoyed the comparison hand me that robe will ya al nudelli said surfacing again and coming up the steps hung too thought al like a horse it looked like sindy had her work cut out for an older guy tony sure had a whole lot going for him al collected a towel robe off the back of a white rattan chair and handed it over nudelli slipped it on as he sat down he jerked his head toward the wet bar fix yourself some breakfast if you want said nudelli putting on his glasses and selecting a large cohibas from the rosewood humidor on the etched glass table theres fruit and coffee all kinds of shit thanks i already had some al started to laugh as he remembered the story he had prepared for tonys amusement no coffee yeah coffee thanks here let me get it al walked over to the wet bar picked the cona jug off the hotplate and poured two mugfuls well i say breakfast he said bringing over the coffee weirdest fucking breakfast i ever ate and that includes the ones in holland nudelli puffed the cigar into service and flicked the match onto the surface of the pool confident that the pool man would scoop it out later on hows that ever since i was a kid i have to have a bowlful of wheaties for breakfast i remember said nudelli when we were in vegas last year you were a real pain in the ass about it the breakfast of champions dont start on that bullshit if theres one thing i hate in the morning its an advertising slogan its like finding a turd in an unflushed toilet bowl so this morning i come down to the kitchen and madonnas in there with the kids and its like yknow fuckin chaos is what it is right and all i want to do is have my bowl of wheaties and then get the fuck out of there before i have a cerebral hemorrhage with all the fuckin noise there is anyway i get the bowl of wheaties and sit down at the table and look around for the cream and there isnt any left in the jug no problem i can see that shes got her hands full what with the new baby nall im not above fetching my own fuckin cream from the icebox trouble is that there isnt any in the icebox either and so i start to cuss whats the problem she says the problem i tell her is that there is no fuckin cream to put on my wheaties im sorry honey she says i guess we must have run out the kids drink it like theyd never heard of cocacola which is good because they need the calcium i can see weve run out i say but what am i going to do you know it screws up my whole day if i dont leave the house with a bowlful of wheaties inside of me you know what she did surprise me shes walking around breastfeeding the baby right jesus ya can go to the zoo if you wanna see that shit the next minute she plucks the tit from the kids gums leans over my fuckin shoulder and squirts a couple of ounces of breast milk all over the wheaties al quickly mimed the action he was describing tony started to laugh what the fuck is this i ask her and she says what the fuck do you think it is asshole its milk i can see its fuckin milk i tell her i just wonder what you think youre doin with your fuckin tits in my breakfast its good enough for your kids but not you is that what youre saying she says tony was laughing hard now and coughing too as his air got mixed with cigar smoke so that he sounded like a small motorcycle engine ticking over he took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose she says how many of the other guys have wives who could do this you should be glad its fresh and it doesnt cost you a fuckin cent the money you give me to keep this house youre lucky you dont get this every morning ya cheap bum tony said jesus christ that madonna i love her shes a piece of work she looks like tugboat annie but i love that fuckin wife of yours al he wiped his streaming eyes on the collar of his bathrobe so what happened next al said what happened next i ate the fuckin wheaties thats what happened both men exploded with laughter with al coming down first i mean it was that or no wheaties right oh jesus sighed tony finally replacing his glasses how could you do that al shrugged uncharacteristically at a loss for something to say well come on al whaddit fuckin taste like als face wrinkled with thought as he tried to recall he said warm of course kind of like the skimmed you get in those little creamer cartons when youre in mcdonalds i prefer the milk that comes out of a cow but al junior seems to like it cant get enough of the stuff that madonna shes something just the thought of the big redhead made him squirm god only knew what she looked like when she was around the house she looked bad enough when she was dressed to come out to dinner al on the other hand al made an effort about the way he dressed it wasnt the effort nudelli would have made but still just now he was wearing an expensivelooking yellow gianni versace shirt that looked like a silk cushion cover some black leather jeans that were made to be worn by someone a lot thinner than al a white snakeskin belt and red cowboy boots not to mention a lot of gold this nthat nudelli thought al cornaro looked like a niggers christmas tree although by miami standards he could pass for welldressed people in florida knew shit from shinola when it came to clothes and al was no exception they went anywhere outside the sunshine state and tony usually made al wear a brooks brothers suit with a proper shirt and tie a suit was business nudelli was an anglophile english shoes english suits he always bought english al said i spoke to jimmy figaro that putz we arranged for him to bring dave delano here at eleven oclock this morning there was a clock on the wall behind tony but he didnt feel like looking around he was a little tired after his swimming lesson times it now al glanced up at the clock tenthirty whaddya think you and he are still friends thats what delano said according to willy wants to reassure you reassurance sounds good to me nudelli nodded thoughtfully sensible guy comin here with jimmy its the smart move it shows he doesnt bear you any malice on account of what happened the guys got balls you have to give him credit for that he proved that when he became willys fuckin ophthalmologist willy must be losing his touch either he lost it or delano learned some when he was in jail could be nudelli said this business proposition of his a big score willy said he goes in the joint a numbers man and figures to come out a majorleague thief is that it hear him out maybe he learned something when he was doing time worked out a play five years is long enough for anyone to get some constructive thinking done suppose i dont like his setup is he holding a gun to my head about this or what suppose i dont help set this thing up is he then going to go to the feds and tell them it was me who popped benny cecchino suppose on that for a while will ya jesus tony you got more suppose in there than stephen fuckin king he kept his mouth shut all these years didnt he done his time like he was told if youd wanted him popped you could have done it five years ago and saved yourself the two hundred grand whats changed i dont understand you wanna know i wanna know ok ill tell you five years ago i didnt know that delano was not the guys real name i thought he was italianamerican like you and me turns out his daddy was russian well you know what my fucking low opinion is of those backward barbarians but worse than that hes a fucking kike to boot what we never done business with the jews before this is miami tony an open city it was the jews who helped to develop this place for business meyer lansky people like that besides as i understand it hes only half jewish his mothers irish never underestimate a jew al even one thats not the whole candlestick take my advice and youll stay alive a lot longer dont get me wrong here im not antisemitic let me tell you almost fifty years ago when i was back in jersey city i met this little jewish broad and fell in love with her best lay of my life and youve seen sindy id have done anything for that little broad including marry her wanted to asked her often enough gave her a ring the whole tiffany deal but it was always the same story she couldnt do it to her parents she said im not asking you to do it to your parents i told her im askin that you do it to me but no she couldnt marry out she said what i said you think my parentsll be blowing up balloons when i tell them i dont wanna marry a catholic you think a christkiller is some kind of honor for them no way but still she wouldnt have me she was in love with me all right but she wouldnt get married to hell with shakespeare to hell with romeo and juliet and that stuff it was like i meant nuthin to her now i ask you al what kind of people can do that ill tell you what kind the jewish kind there is nothing they wont put ahead of being jewish i know what im talking about shakespeare made romeo and juliet italians because he understood what love means to an italian there aint anythin more important than how your heart feels but it would have challenged him as a writer a lot more if juliet had been a jewish princess let me tell you now that would have been a fuckin play thats a play id like to have seen al said i dunno tony delano doesnt want to fuck you he wants to do business with you for a jew theyre the same thing and dont forget the ivans delano shared a cell with one of them redfellas for four years learned to speak pretty good russkie from what i hear you see what im sayin al it wasnt italian he learned to speak it was fucking russkie which means i gotta wonder where hes comin from if hes in bed with these meathead slobs or what i got enough trouble with bums like rocky envigado and those colombian bastards without takin on the ivans as well thats the trouble with this country too many damned immigrants willy four breakfasts seemed to think that delano was more inclined to believe willy was carrying out a contract for the ivans than he was to think you wanted him to take a beating al shrugged doesnt sound like someone whos in bed with the ivans nudelli puffed his cigar thoughtfully there is that he allowed al said hear the guy out after all business is business and personal shouldnt ever get in the way of that right youre right of course nudelli leaned forward and took hold of al by the cheek and then slapped him gently just taking care of business tony nudelli regarded his cigars wet end and nodded thoughtfully al said i didnt know you were from jersey city it was me or some other poor bastard what happened to the jewish broad the one you were in love with how the fuck should i know jimmy figaro drove the big bmw across the rickenbacker causeway just south of where his offices were located the road soared high over biscayne bay and provided figaros uninterested passenger with an unparalleled view of the brickell avenue skyline the first island was virginia key once set aside for miamis black community and a large sewage plant the next island was key biscayne steering the car with one finger now because everything was more laid back on key biscayne figaro came down crandon boulevard heading south toward cape florida before turning west onto harbor drive figaro glanced over at dave and said tonys place is just down the road from where richard nixon used to live tricky dicky yeah that figures you a democrat whats the difference to a bad guy like me havent you ever voted for someone sure i voted for the prisoners representative in homestead choice was between a murderer and a rapist i chose the murderer who won the murderer what about on the outside on the outside it doesnt matter who represents you the murderer or the rapist thats not much of a political philosophy after youve been in prison theres only one political philosophy that matters a damn and thats keeping your ass out of prison the car was now gliding smoothly through an immaculately manicured community fringed with australian pines and coconut palms and one white palace after another like so many wedding cakes figaro changed the subject and said harbor bayfront villas is one of miamis most exclusive addresses tonys villa is right on the bay no kidding figaro slowed and turned down a private road pulling up at a gatehouse where he gave both their names to the guard the guard checked them on a clipboard list and then waved them on through the elevating barrier round here is the last word in european splendor figaro enthused outside of europe you might be right dave grinned you really like it round here dont you jimmy wouldnt anyone nodded figaro i mean wouldnt you just love to live here they pulled up in front of a twostorey open bay villa with full dock and davits dave noted the foot motor yacht that was moored there and then turned his attention to the house with its pantiled roof keystone columns and arches and courtyard with fountain the place looked as if it had been transplanted from a hill in tuscany dave said id sure like to be able to afford to live here if i could then id use the money to live somewhere nice like london or paris miami sucks one mans meat i guess said figaro and miami is a cheeseburger they got out of the car walked up to the front door and were admitted to an atrium foyer with a marble floor and a curving stone staircase one of nudellis bodyguards frisked dave and then a butler walked them upstairs to an opulent mahoganypanelled library where nudelli and al cornaro were seated inside a stockade of green leather chesterfields the two men got up and crossed the aquamarine bokhara rug and dave allowed himself to be embraced by the man whod ordered his fingers broken nudelli said hey al will you take a look at this guy five years in the joint and he looks like he spent the summer in palm springs jesus dave you look great you look like a fuckin movie star youre not looking so bad yourself tony dave said patiently nudelli slapped his own belly hard keepin fit yknow swim every day watch what i eat you want something to eat drink maybe we got everything silver fuckin service were like the frigging admirals club out here no im ok thanks tony jimmy just a coffee miggy nudelli was speaking to the butler couple of coffees they sat down inside the stockade nudelli said five years dave said five years yeah you did good at the time it seemed the thing to do tony dave about that little misunderstanding with willy barizon hey forget about it these things happen its good of you to see it that way dave you know after willys cold call i got to thinking about things from your pov tony and i said to myself i said dave while you were on the inside tony knew where you were and what you were doing its a variant on what machiavelli says about composite principalities tony being on the spot you can detect trouble at the start and deal with it pronto but if youre absent the troubles discerned only when its too fuckin late tony said i heard you got yourself educated is that so machiavelli huh sounds italian from florence that night you was with benny cecchino you mean in the restaurant where you shot him yeah what were you and he talking about dave shrugged and said a business proposition why else would anyone talk to benny did you owe him money no dave grinned i didnt get a chance to your sudden arrival on the scene put paid to that you know benny had a mouth like a v dave said he was nothing to me but from what i heard he had it coming nice of you to say so nudelli looked rueful i had more of a temper then well this was five years ago five years is a long time im sure you of all people dont need reminding of that dave waited for tony nudelli to say something else and when he didnt dave decided to segue along to the purpose of his requested meeting talking of business propositions tony ive got one i think you might be interested in dave unfolded his laptop computer the sweetest idea you ever heard im always interested in sweet ideas isnt that so al always nudelli said before you say another word dave nudelli glanced over at jimmy now drinking his coffee for someone like jimmy information is pressure sometimes the less he has the more freedom and space there is for him he likes to work in a vacuum to know only what he needs to know especially if there are any inherent illegalities so let me ask you does jimmy need to hear this or does he need to take a walk i think maybe he should take a walk agreed dave dave watched figaro leave the library and when he looked back he thought that maybe tony had false teeth and that they must have slipped off his jaw until he realized that it was some kind of little contraption made of steel and plastic and that tony was using it to exercise the muscles in his face noting daves expression nudelli tongued the thing onto the palm of his hand it looked like a tiny crutch nudelli said my facial workout helps restore lost muscle tone and reshapes bags and sags those i got enough of already a percent increase in facial muscle strength in just eight weeks they say all you need is two minutes a day but im doin a little more than that on account of all the fuckin worries ive got my wife she wanted a facelift estimated cost ten thousand dollars instead i bought her one of these little gizmos for seventyfive bucks he chuckled meanly and popped the device back inside his cheeks o ahead he said opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish make your pitch dave glanced at the color screen of his laptop and found the file he was searching for he said chasing drug money is the new lawenforcement specialty banking regulations have been tightened all over the world banking secrecy relaxed even in switzerland used to be that you could fly into zurich with a suitcase full of money and make a deposit no questions asked not any more its gotten so that the swiss have to ask questions these days for a while back there south america and the caribbean were also good places to hide drug dollars al said still are if you know the right people not everyone does new crime isnt connected in the same way as someone like you tony nowadays the best thing you can do is to buy a bank and the gold medal place to buy one of those is in the former soviet union under the aegis of gosbank which is owned by the state and vnesheconombank which is the bank of foreign affairs hundreds of banks have been formed in the last few years to take advantage of new russian enterprise to lend it money to take care of other hard currency deposits there are even tax breaks and building loans to encourage new banks it might be nice to own my own bank said nudelli dave said wait theres more to this scam ok to do it to capitalize your new bank you have to get your cash into russia that can be difficult too especially when the cash is the result of illegal enterprise whats more when its in the quantities required to capitalize a new bank its bulky let me illustrate that with a comparison dyou like basketball tony sure then youll know that ucfs leading scorer at seventeen points a game is harry kennedy now think of a tower of tendollar bills twentyfive inches wide and seventeen inches deep thats as tall as harry kennedy harrys about sixfive i believe thats only million a tower would have to be fourteen feet high and weigh more than pounds just to reach ten million bucks makes it harder to shift than any drug with one advantage being that the dog hasnt yet been born that can sniff out money they got women for that chuckled al my wife can lock onto a new cnote at fifty paces tony nudelli liked that one but the moscow gangs have fixed the transport of the cash too transport your money and help you set up your own bank all for twentyfive cents on the dollar same as if you had to launder it somewhere else they get the cash across the atlantic through the mediterranean and up into the black sea less than eight weeks after the money leaves florida you own your own bank in the russian city of your choice once there you can loan it to business make money on it and then put it through the regular banking system al asked so whats the angle owning a bank would be nice but we dont need no help laundering money im not selling any my angle is this i want to rip off one of these hard currency exports the moscow mob with some help from old kgb guys and some new ones too they operate an undercover dockage out of fort lauderdale just five minutes from the airport the place is square feet with stateoftheart facilities and accommodating motor yachts up to feet long theyve got guys working there who really know the inside of boats put a new interior in your boat in no time except that its not your yacht its theirs one of half a dozen they own and charter and the new interior a new double bed in each stateroom thats literally made of money each one looks and feels like any other bed maybe a little firm but thats hardly surprising given that theres maybe two million bucks tucked away inside the base nudelli flicked the facial flex out of his mouth wiped the saliva from his lips and brandished the flex as if it was a cocktail stick wait a minute he growled you look outta that window there you can see the bitch named after my first wife a hundred foot long shes got a top speed of twentyfour knots and a range of miles a fully equipped cruising resort shes sleek seaworthy and whisper fuckin quiet perfect for island hopping but i wouldnt try to cross the atlantic in her the qe she aint dave shook his head and said you wouldnt have to tony for around you could book the bitch a passage on a custombuilt transatlantic ferry in particular one of the cattugs operated by stranahan yacht transport out of port everglades the hells a cattug when its afloat asked al dave rolled the trackball on his computer selected a picture file from the floppy disk he had made up the day before and turned the machine to face his twoman audience they shifted forward on the chesterfield to take a closer look at the picture on the color screen in front of them was a shot of a foot vessel that contained as many as eighteen luxury motor yachts dave said it has the basic hull form of a ship combined with the wide beam and shallower draft of a barge but it still equals the center of gravity and the buoyancy of both units jesus said al thats incredible i never seen nuthin like that before they really do sail this thing across the atlantic with all these other boats dave nodded nudelli said looks kind of risky to me im speaking as a yacht owner you understand theres the risk of lifting the boat out of the water then theres the risk of having your boat on an unprotected deck during the crossing uhuh the cattug is a semisubmersible kind of like an oceangoing dock you float your boat in at port everglades and then float it out again when you get to sunny mallorca in the western mediterranean during the voyage each vessel is secured to the dock floor tied down with special lines and protected from the worst of the atlantic by those dock walls you see theyre around twenty feet high there are only minimal acceleration forces when the cattugs underway oh and the er insurance premiums for crossing the atlantic are about a quarter less than if you went under your own steam always supposing that you could syt will carry any vessel up to one with a twentyfoot draft and there are no height restrictions nudelli said i guess thats right looks like a schooner in amongst those other boats main mast should be around sixty feet high he leaned back on the chesterfield the leather creaking underneath him like he was already on board a ship at sea i gotta admit it looks impressive but this company stranahan yacht transport they have anything to do with the russkies he returned the facial flex to his mouth and began to stretch his face again nope its a legit company russkies book a passage like any other citizen being alongside the boats of lawabiding citizens they figure on having a certain safety in numbers and of course the coast guard is looking for dope not cash when the cattug gets to palma mallorca they float out and sail on to their final destination under their own steam its a place on the black sea where the moneys finally taken out and then transported by road another quick refit and the yachts ready to come home again thats a lot of trust in a bunch of russkies observed nudelli you say you want to rip one of these transports off whats to stop them ripping off their clients dave said because the first time would also be the last time and because some of these clients dont have much choice in the matter these days there are only a few ways to launder drug money which is what this mostly is being caught with dollars is almost worse than being pinched with cocaine some of the south american cartels are making so much money theyve got nowhere to put it sometimes they end up just burying it in the ground and letting it rot guy in homestead he lost two million that way used to be that you could buy yourself a nice bank in panama or venezuela but then the authorities wised up the group of seven industrial countries set up the financial action task force back in and thats when the bad guy money started going to the former soviet union from what ive heard moscows just like chicago was back in the twenties if youve got the money you can buy just about anything you want bombs missiles armies whole fuckin towns countrys one gigantic garage sale all it takes is dollars you cant buy shit with their own currency beats me how uncle sam manages to get a handle on the us economy with so much american money around i mean whats a government for if not to control the supply of money its no surprise to me our economys a piece of shit the dollars carrying half the world on its green back anyway coming back to your original question tony these guys want to do business with americans with south americans people with dollars help set them up with a bank so that they can start to do business together contra deals that kind of thing cooperation is at the heart of good business nudelli nodded and said so whats your play i need a yacht to book onto the transatlantic tug i need another crewman to help me pull the job halfway across the atlantic thats as far away from european and american navies as you can get we overpower the crews of the tug and the other yachts at night so theyre not expecting trouble we take the money from the russian yachts and transfer it to the boat nearest the stern then we float out and cruise towards a prearranged rendezvous with a tanker well have sailing in the opposite direction on a legitimate voyage something thats coming back here maybe we put the money on the tanker and then scuttle the motor yacht just to throw people off the scent al said whats the haul the russians have started making as many as two or three bookings per transport three yachts six or seven staterooms per yacht at two mill each jesus said al thats over forty million could be agreed dave but i figure a minimum twentyfive theres gonna be a lot of firepower on board to protect a piece of change like that said al once again dave shook his head his eyes narrowing as they caught the sun nudelli turned around then waved at the large expanse of window that framed their view of biscayne bay south miami and coconut grove lay hidden on the other side of the horizon some five miles away to the west it was the best view dave had ever seen of his hometown fix the blind will ya al the suns in daves eyes its ok i like the sun but al was already unfolding louvred shutters across the window tony hates the fuckin sun he explained only guy in key biscayne with an indoor swimming pool after five years in homestead i could use some vitamin d nudelli tongued the flex from his mouth and grimaced he said after five years you wanna be careful of that skin of yours sun aint like it used to be niggers even the fuckin oranges go careful these days cos of this hole those idiots made in the ozone layer even the goddamn fish are getting skin cancer i read that somewhere didnt i al al said it was me who read it to you from the paper and they was australian fish not americans as if it matters what nationality they are lots of ways florida is like australia they dont call us the sunshine state for nuthin take my advice dave get yourself a hat everyone in our line of business used to wear a hat even the lousy cops wore hats you could tell a lot about a guy from the way he wore his hat too and with the sun we got now believe me hats are makin a comeback and i dont mean the little peaks you see the niggers and the spies wearing i mean a proper hat english style sounds like good advice al said before the sunshine interrupted us you were about to tell us what kind of security they got to protect all this dirty money syt allows just a couple of crew per boat any more than that and theyd be drawing attention to themselves three boats means six crew its reasonable to assume theyll be armed of course but with the element of surprise i figure me and another guy could take care of them suppose someone radios for help objected al nudelli grimaced irritably and said suppose he fixes all the fuckin radios at the same time as he fixes all the crews dave said thats about the size of it howdyou find out about this you share a cell with a man for four years a man tells you pretty much everything gergiev that was his name clever guy hes out of st petersburg right and theyre big rivals of the moscow mob anyway he knew about these transports and planned this whole thing we were going to do the job together only the feds had him deported the minute he came out of the joint one big score that was the idea matter of fact i got a letter from him the day of my release he told me that hes trying to get back here and that if i try this without him hell kill me but hes not much help back in russia and i dont figure this job can wait and i think he overrates his chances of ever getting another visa only now ive got nobody to help me set it up and you figured it was this guy who sent willy barizon to see you right gergiev was going to find the right boat and the stake money to get it i was going to captain it supply the maritime knowhow you could say thats what i bring to the deal all my life ive been into boats my father used to work on yachts from time to time ive even owned a couple of smaller ones myself learned to sail learned navigation even got my ticket gergiev might figure im doublecrossing him but thats not true ill take care of him out of my end on this deal which is if i get the right backing someone to stake me for the boat i figure fiftyfifty maybe twelve to fifteen mill each nudelli asked what kind of boat do you need not too big not too small maybe sixty or seventy feet room enough for all that cash and with a good top speed supposing we can be nearest the stern the main thing is it has to look the part like its worth the trouble of mailing it across the ocean yknow i should say a value around mill nudelli said nothing out of my final share of course dave added hoping to sweeten the deal say bucks for the passage which ill also cover myself al said a million boat you propose to abandon or flush down the toilet am i right yes thats right my guess is that the authorities will spend the first few days looking for this yacht or the one we have to steal that is if they come looking at all remember this is illegal cash if anyone does come looking i figure theyll try the azores first working on the principle that this is the nearest land to where we take down the score you seem to have thought it all out said nudelli dave shrugged and said had five years to think it through tony its a sweet scheme i have to admit i got just one major problem with it whats that nudelli nodded and said you its you dave i just dont picture you for no hijacker you ever pop anyone no i cant say that i have nudelli said theres no shame in that but its a fact of life that the first time is always the hardest aint that so al the hardest on a job like you described you wouldnt want to find yourself in a situation where you might hesitate to trigger a guy dave thought for a moment trying to offer some guarantee for his own future ruthlessness pointedly he said by the way hows willys eye that stupid fuck grunted al maybe hell see straight now you halved his viewing options nudelli said i mean how you handled willy that was impressive willys no pushover but these guys on the russian yachts maybe they wont put their hands up so easy maybe they wont be as dumb as willy maybe youll have to take one or two of them down dave said could be al said so thats our problem as the political analysts might say of a candidate its the character question it was a fair question dave hoped that he would never have to kill anyone and felt more or less certain that he could pull off the job with the minimum of violence but that was hardly what a character like tony nudelli wanted to hear he wanted to see a convincing show of coldbloodedness and all dave could think of was harry lime what would harry have told this guy am i ready to take the life of another human being if i have to i think thats a fair question he said with what he hoped was an amused insouciance like harrys dave stood up and walked round to the shutters and staring out of the louvers played a scene he hoped that tony and al were not keen movie fans what can i say except that nobody thinks in terms of human beings these days tony governments dont so why should we they talk of the people and the proletariat and i talk of the mugs its the same thing they have their five year plans and so have i he turned to face them again and smiled laconically the dead are happier dead they dont miss much here poor bastards he thought hed played it nicely light amusing ruthless with a superficial excuse for his own behavior if hed started talking about how tough he was and how much of a killer he could be nudelli just wouldnt have bought it he was too old a hand at killing to buy anything too definite of course dave was no orson welles but then tony nudelli wasnt exactly joseph cotten either tony was right about one thing though dave would have done the speech better if hed been wearing a hat to get properly into character a black homburg just like harrys id like to cut you in you know he said for added effect ive no one left in miami i can really trust chapter eight it was the florida department of law enforcement the detective branch of the state police that had put kate on the trail of the boat rocky envigado was probably planning to use for his next transatlantic shipment of cocaine from its offices in pompano beach the fdle had been keeping two characters juan grijalva and whittaker mclennan under surveillance on suspicion of involvement in an insurance fraud they tracked one of these men to a meeting with an irishman gerard robinson who was staying at the breakers hotel in fort lauderdale checking through a list of robinsons telephone calls the fdle found an isle of man number since the isle of man is a british tax haven the fdle thought they were onto something and so they contacted the national criminal intelligence service in london for assistance ncis told them that the number belonged to keran properties a company in which new scotland yard had a longstanding interest keran was managed by a local firm of accountants pater hall green who were themselves under surveillance following a tipoff that a notorious cannabis smuggler now doing time in a spanish jail was a director of keran ncis also informed the fdle that jeremy pater one of the partners in phg owned a house in the british virgin islands as well as a share in a flourishing yacht management company azimuth marine associates the managing director of azimuth was alonzo avila a photograph of pater avila and a third unidentified man was emailed to the fdle who contacted the fbi computer records department in miami in an attempt to put a name to the face pater avila and azimuth marine were not known to the computer records department but the third man was he was chico diaz rocky envigados most trusted sicario leader as soon as kate was up to speed with the fdles inquiry she went to speak to kent bowen jesus christ kate you wanna run all that by me again yawned the as ac it is a little complicated sir admitted kate complicated it sounds like an episode of soap jesus christ kate well sir azimuth marine is one of the leading companies in the management and marketing of luxury yachts management charter marketing crew placement you name it they have representation in virtually every international yachting port of call from fort lauderdale to hong kong bowen adopted a pained expression kate just the bottom line if you dont mind ive got arteries hardening here kate felt herself coloring with irritation never before had she worked for an asac with a manner as casual as kent bowen just the bottom line was not the way the bureau worked at the fbi academy in quantico the emphasis had been on building up a complete investigative picture an investigation was not a sheet of accounts to be summarized in a simple statement of profit or loss and now this patronizing asshole we think weve found the boat sir you have well why didnt you say so in the first place kate because i assumed youd want to know exactly what makes me believe that weve found it sir the intellectual and reasoning processes this is the fbi kate not mit reasonables the standard we work to here reasonable doubt reasonable suspicion reasonable this nthat exactly and precisely are for some schmuck in a white coat with a slide rule sticking out of his ass in the time it takes to climb from reasonable all the way up to exactly we could lose a collar yes sir so you reckon that this azimuth marine outfit have supplied rocky envigado with a motor yacht is that it yes sir well how do you work that out biting her lip kate said theres an offshore company called san ferman thats registered in grand cayman that weve long suspected is being controlled by rocky about three months ago azimuth sold a boat to this company we were able to trace the boat the britannia to a dry dock right here in miami sir its on the river at thirteenth street the boat is currently under surveillance we have a stakeout at a room in the harbor view hospital from which we have an excellent view of the the harbor right and the dry dock but as yet weve been unable to ascertain if the drugs are already on board bowen nodded thoughtfully and asked kind of work they havin done to the boat anyway well sir since shes been in dock shes had new fuel tanks an extended cockpit rerouted plumbing new airconditioning naiad stabilizers and quite a lot of hull work she smiled thinly and added it would be reasonable to suppose that the modified fuel tanks might be where they plan to hide the cocaine the tanks huh well yes except for one thing you see sir ive done some calculations based on the size of the boat and the engines the britannia is feet long and is equipped with twin detroit engines each developing just over horsepower that would give the boat an effective cruising range of just about miles which wouldnt quite get her as far as the coast of north africa or even the canary islands which are about miles from the coast of florida but with the modified fuel tanks you could stretch her cruising range to about that distance maybe even miles but that would leave you with another dilemma where to put the coke assuming that the purpose of extending her fuel tanks is to yes snapped bowen i take your point she cant make the distance and carry the dope in her tanks bowen picked up a paperweight from his desk top and began to toss it in his hands like a baseball you know ive been giving this matter some considerable thought kate and ive come up with an idea of my own you have kate sounded a little more surprised than she could have wished yeah wanna hear it kate shrugged she hadnt explained the rest of her theory to do with the britannia fuel tanks but at the same time she was aware of how little kent bowen knew about boats and reflected that she really couldnt afford to antagonize him she said sure go ahead well i was thinking good start we know they can compress cocaine color it mix it with cellulose even combine it with glass fiber to create a hard material that can be molded into any shape you like yeees well dyou remember a few years ago the dog kennels kate nodded patiently bowen was referring to a narcotics seizure made by federal agents back in a colombian drug cartel had manufactured fifty dog kennels made from cocaine ground down and treated with chemicals the dog kennels had had a street value of almost half a million dollars suppose rocky envigado braincelled a way to do the same with a boat hull polyurethane glass fiber bowen shrugged as he waited for kate to step in with an exclamation at her asac bosss genius instead she looked puzzled as if she hadnt quite grasped the ingenuity of what he was suggesting well you said yourself they were working on the hull in this dry dock of yours down on thirteenth kate said you know something i would never have thought of that not ever that is an incredible idea impervious to kates sarcasm bowen said it is kind of sneaky isnt it i mean think about that he uttered a little chuckle of appreciation goddamn it kate when you think about it some more it really begins to make sense it does for instance most yachts are white arent they its the perfect disguise for a ton or so of cocaine jesus christ a motor yacht made of pure cocaine now thats what i call a goddamn sports boat kate smiled thinly and wondered how many more weak jokes he might yet wring out of his harebrained theory now if that isnt the last word in custombuilt motor yachts she let him ramble on for a minute or two before deciding to bring him down to reality again she said yes its certainly an interesting possibility albeit a remote one however suppose there was a way to make the transatlantic shipment without using any fuel at all of course youd need enough diesel to cover the secret compartments for the cocaine but taking into account the dimensions of the yacht and the position of the engine room which is aft aft wheres aft nautical term it means in or near the stern of the boat she paused for a second and then added the back of the boat oh aft yeah i know taking that and the construction of the interior bulkheads into account its just light aluminium plate coupled with honeycomb composites well i estimate you could store up to keys of coke and still have as much diesel as the boat was originally designed to hold bowen grinned uncomfortably certain now that he was out of his depth he replaced the paperweight on his desk and said so what are you saying just this maybe this time instead of trying to sail the boat across on its own via bermuda and the azores theyre planning to book the yacht on a transatlantic yacht transport they are kind of oceangoing ferry boats for expensive plastic if you want to get your twentyfourinch beam broward over to the south of france for the cannes film festival for instance youd probably have it ferried across the atlantic it would be perfect cover for someone like rocky envigado his boat rubbing fenders with what passes for high society here in florida bowen said i had no idea that much was true at any rate that you were so knowledgeable about boats kate before howard my husband before he and i separated we used to spend a lot of time together on his sportfisher kate smiled as she recalled the fishing they had done together marlin tuna even the odd shark and the foot knight carver boat they had owned correction he had owned the dice man with bait well fishfreezer and professional tackle center not to mention three large staterooms finished in rare hawaiian koa wood the dice man had been a really luxurious but true tournament fishing platform she missed the boat more than she had realized certainly she missed it more than she missed howard she said thats where hes been living since we split on the boat well im from kansas said bowen reckon thats as far away from one or tother ocean as it is possible to be she said ive never been in kansas its kind of a squarelooking state when you see it on the map a lot like a picture frame youd be hard pressed to recognize its outline if it came up as a question on lets make a deal now florida youre from florida right titusville florida is the most recognizable state outline in the whole union yes it is said kate at least they could agree on something you know what im reminded of when i look at that outline kate kate shook her head a handgun short barrel large grip kind of like that ladysmith you carry every time i see that state outline on a road sign im reminded of why im here and why is that sir to combat crime this is the crime capital of the united states didnt you know that but bowen wasnt waiting for an answer mostly on account of all the scum whove come to settle here from places like cuba haiti and the dominican republic i think thats all a little he said titusville thats up the coast isnt it yes were you always into boats ever since gemini gemini whats that got to do with anything when i was a kid we used to go out on the ocean aboard my daddys boat and watch the launches from the kennedy space center it was best view around for miles yes ive been around boats nearly all my life bowen said well you know boats but i know law enforcement you probably heard i was deputy sheriff of dodge city before i joined the bureau kate nodded wearily of course this was quite a few years ago and dodge was cleaned up before i ever got there he uttered the familiar little chuckle that kate had learned to detest old wyatt earp saw to that one of the reasons i joined the bureau in the first place was to escape from there but not before i learned the job the hard way on the street only place you get to develop a nose for it and right now my nose is telling me that we ought to at least check out this theory of mine about the boat hull bein made of cocaine nall you say you know boats yes sir then i want you to speak to some boatbuilders and see if it can be done i hear what you say about fuel tanks kate but i think youre down a gator hole those boys have got a lot more ingenuity than you give em credit for kate never underestimate your opponent kate smiled back at him as he tapped his temple with a forefinger underestimating her boss was beginning to look almost impossible he said think big thats what they do thats what i do these bastards dont conform to the common order neither do we kate neither do we and when youve seen if it can be done and frankly id be very surprised if it couldnt well then maybe you can organize some kind of covert team to go into that dry dock and take a closer look at that hull im willing to bet youll find some kind of an anomaly anomaly yeah kate restrained herself on the edge of a remark she knew she would later regret she wanted to tell him yeah theres been some kind of an anomaly all right i normally get an asac for a boss with a brain in his fucking head driving home that night through the banyanlined streets of north miami she was tuned to magic an oldies station and there was an early rolling stones song she had always loved and although she had heard the song a thousand times before and knew the words by heart she still found herself thinking of kent bowen and how she was going to prove him wrong as she sang along time was on her side chapter nine in daves suite the telephone rang it was jimmy figaro got a passport youve got it said dave i have i had to surrender it before the trial remember if you say so still valid you think should be yes ok let me get carol to find it and then ill come back to you you know im glad you reminded me i was going to have to call you about it anyway does this mean the job is on i dont know anything about a job oh yeah i remember youre on a need to know basis all i know is what al cornaro told me and that is that you and he are flying down to costa rica costa rica whats in costa rica some pretty good coffee last time they looked maybe you could bring me back some beans what am i jimmy starbucks or something that and a boat al said to say that hes found you a boat great he say what kind of boat the love boat how the hell should i know im a lawyer not herman melville yeah well call me back ishmael about that passport ok san jose the capital of costa rica was a thousand miles south of miami and a two and a half hour flight aboard an american airlines jet that was full of tourists in search of difficult surf and easy sex dave returned to his firstclass seat from the toilet and said this flight its like big wednesday back there big what surfing movie john milius all about the perfect wave al grunted and settled back with his third vodka martini he said you know what that means to me the perfect wave its madonna saying goodbye as she takes the kids on a sixweek vacation with her mother madonnas your wife right right do you mind me asking you a personal question not if you dont mind a slap in the mouth if i think youre out of line why do you stay married to her i mean you make jokes about her all the time al said its a husband thing you wouldnt understand we get along pretty good she and i she asks no questions which means i tell her no lies like going down to costa rica what i do when im down there maybe find a couple of nice little ticas and get myself laid she wont ever ask wont even sniff my fingers when i get home theres an understanding there a modus vivendi know what im sayin sides even if i wanted to get rid of her i wouldnt im a catholic marriage is for keeps like herpes al laughed obscenely and finished his drink dave said nice to know that true romance is not dead true romance now thats what i call a fucking movie al waved his empty glass at the stewardess and laughed some more thats what a lot of the beach bums back there are really after true romance surprising as it might seem local classifieds in cr are full of ads from softheaded americans looking for a cute little tica to settle down with then youve been before cr yeah lots of times and what are you looking for al me ill settle for getting my cock sucked dave looked out of the window sa matter al demanded somethin wrong with that no nothing at all yknow prostitutions legal in cr countrys a regular pussy kmart dave took the new yorker he had bought at the airport out of the seat pocket and started to turn the pages al frowned and said yknow most guys out of homestead be quite interested in gettin theirselves laid you turn fag or somethin while your ass was in there dave said no i did not turn fag while i was in there but people whove got something against fags are generally trying to cover up their own fears that they might be gay themselves well how about it al al shrugged and said youre right i am gay another obscene laugh im a lesbian trapped inside a mans body means im interested in seeing two girls partying with each other before they party with me i think that about covers my sexuality dave laughed and said me im more like one of those softheaded guys you were talking about in the local classifieds the ones looking for true romance i guess that covers it for me your fuckin loss al opened the copy of penthouse he had bought at the airport and began to pick his nose absently he inspected his forefinger and frowned as he caught sight of the blood on it the next second there was more blood dripping in large bulletholesized gouts onto the magazine and his cream polo shirt and pants fuckin nosebleed groaned al he made a futile attempt to stanch the flow using first his own paper napkin coaster and then daves stuffing one up each nostril but it was not until the stewardess arriving with another drink and a napkin had tipped als seat back in the reclining position that the bleeding finally stopped dave looked at the man stretched out beside him and sighed wistfully shit he said my first time out of the states and ive got to travel with jake la motta it was in the taxi on the way into town from juan santamaria airport that dave began to experience his first misgivings about the trip shit he complained something bit me on the leg probably just a mosquito said al a mosquito the idea of taking any medication for the trip hadnt occurred to him until now and al certainly hadnt suggested anything but dave turned to the fodors guide to costa rica he had bought at miami airport just to make sure the health precautions there did nothing to reassure him you dumb bastard he said snapping the book shut whats the problem malaria he complained angrily to al this fucking place is full of it not to mention a whole load of other diseases so al slapped a mosquito flat against his own bloodstained cheek so i havent had any shots al and i dont want to get anemia kidney failure coma and death listen who needs shots most of those drugs dont work anyway i read about it in the paper they just have what they call a placebo effect that means that for all the good they do you might as well swallow green mms they just make you feel better in your mind about bein around diseased spies and bugs and tropical shit whereas on the other hand the drugs that do work do it at the expense of your system just look at what happened to those army motherfuckers after desert storm they took all kinds of drugs and now a lot of them have got some serious fucking medical problems so try and be cool sides we aint gonna be down here long enough to make any of that south of the border medication worthwhile fuck that as soon as i get to the hotel im going to find a drugstore jesus christ i cant believe youre so blase about this shit i mean just one bite from an anophelesll do it man there aint no fleas in the hotel were checking into you can take it from me place is class not fleas anopheles its a mosquito al according to the book the whole countrys lousy with them you read too many books al delved into his flight bag relax will ya naturally i brought something to keep the bugs off just to be on the safe side he handed dave a sweetsmelling tube of cream there you go slap some of that on your chickenshit ass dave read the label with incredulity avon skinsosoft moisturiser this is it thatll do the job i bring some every time i come down here and ive never been bitten yet al i want to repel insects not give them a nice smooth landing on my so fucking soft skin and you better believe that stuffll do it bugs cant stand the stuff what is it they dont like the advertising the brand image dont ask me why but it works right marines comin down to these parts for jungle warfare training have been using the stuff for years better than deet or any of those other insect repellents they reckon and i didnt read that in any fuckin book lambiance was americanowned and comfortable formerly a colonial mansion it was located in the barrio otaya district of san jose daves room furnished with antiques was much bigger and better than he had anticipated his only criticism was that when he opened the french windows onto his balcony he could hear and smell the animals in the simon bolivar zoo a block to the north to that extent it was like a home away from homestead as soon as he was unpacked dave went out and bought some mefloquine in a local pharmacy it made him feel a little more relaxed and later on after a good dinner and an excellent bottle of wine he felt sufficiently well disposed toward both the country and his travelling companion to accompany him to what al insisted was the best bar in san jose key largo with its westernstyle saloon big oval bar and live music was housed in yet another handsome colonial mansion the place was full of gregarious gringos and a seemingly endless supply of dollarhungry ticas many of whom were in their teens al found a table ordered a couple of bottles of guaro and left dave to soak up the atmosphere while he went in search of some female company he returned a couple of minutes later with not one but four of the bestlooking hookers dave had ever seen one of them a blonde with a tight pink cotton sweater and very large breasts sat down next to dave and smiling sweetly told him her name was victoria he felt his eyes climbing up to the halftimbered ceiling as a languorouslooking brunette took hold of his other arm and asked him for a cigarette when daves eyes came down from the ceiling again they were met by als already filled with delight whad i tell ya isnt this place somethin every time i come here its like i died and went to pussy heaven finding the brunette a marlboro dave glanced sideways at the pink sweater and then back at al grinning he said pink i always did like pink he lit the girl whose name was maria and then smoked one himself the other three girls were already helping themselves to glasses of guaro despite daves best intentions he was beginning to enjoy himself al toasted dave with the local firewater and said they all speak pretty good american so i hope you can decipher what im sayin to you now theyre fit for human consumption if you know what i mean forget about the andromeda strain ok what they do is legal down here so they have to get themselves periodically checked out by the local surgeongeneral anyway sall fixed stock is bought and paid for whether you take up your share option or not my friend thats for their benefit as much as yours after all they have to make a living so its your choice sport they dont mind one way or the other al downed the glass of guaro in one as he saw daves grin persist he added you can read em a poem or you can show em your cock its up to you just be friendly thats all dave toasted al and then the two girls sandwiching him me im jay leno man ill sit and be friendly to any of the guests who come on tonights show al chuckled obscenely and said if i dont come on tonights show it wont be for want of the right encouragement it was well after one when al announced that he was taking his two tican friends back to the hotel before he was too drunk to party dave had enjoyed the company of victoria and maria the evening had been relaxed and lighthearted and he had no desire to offend al by an obvious display of priggishness but in life you were either a john or you were not and a long time ago dave had decided he was not so he decided to go with the flow and cut the two girls loose as soon as al had retired to the hotels presidential suite with his two friends which is what he did there were no recriminations no petulant displays of rejection the girls accepted it with as much pleasant good grace as they had accepted als original invitations after theyd left in a cab dave took a long cold shower and tried to persuade himself that he had done the right thing five years of homestead seemed like degradation enough for one lifetime now he wanted to feel good about himself like he was in control of where he was going and what he was doing and to do that you had to be strong to command power over yourself and your desires being a john was way short of that he threw on a bathrobe and went out onto the balcony above the buzz of distant traffic he could hear the roar of a large cat a lion or a tiger caged in the nearby zoo he imagined the poor beast as it paced up and down its small cage and for a moment he was reminded of being back in his cell in homestead hearing the dreadful sound of that immobilized spirit as it gave itself up to its despairing ritual dance to and fro to and fro forever pacing the cell he realized that for the first time since being released he understood what it meant to be free have a good time last night it was a cruel question because al looked like yesterdays shit his normally dark swarthy face was pale and sweaty and his eyes were as mean and puffy as a couple of hot snakes if his head had been left on a pole somewhere in the jungle he could not have looked any worse jesus al you look like a fuckin movie star mocked dave echoing tony nudelli you look like ernest borgnine on his free day al whispered hoarsely where the fucks chico with the fourwheel drive ahead of them was a threehour drive to quepos on the central pacific coast parked out front next to the hotels spanishstyle courtyard their driver was waiting in a range rover al climbed slowly into the back seat let out a profound sigh that was half a groan and closed his bloodshot eyes half an hour into the journey and dave sitting up front alongside chico wished that he had sat in the back with al almost gleefully chico informed him that costa rica had the worlds highest auto fatality rate but hey dont worry he added range rover is very good car for costa rican roads is english car but very tough i think maybe roads in england are as bad as here english drivers too but is no problem in range rover this is car that say get the fuck out of my way hombre highway three from the central highlands of san jose down to the coast was a twolane blacktop with steep drops and sharp bends it was in reasonable condition only as far as carara from there on chico halved his speed to take account of the many potholes some of which would have broken the axle of a lesser vehicle one volcanosized crater bounced everyone off the roof awakening al from his crapulous sleepoff after a moment or two he said weakly gotta get out chico glanced back across his shoulder saw the color of his passengers face and steered hard to the right off the road pulling up close to a steaming stew of swampland al opened the door and forgetting the height of the car half stepped half fell onto the ground chico watched as he staggered toward the edge of the swamp and then laughing lowered the window to call out after him watch out for crocodiles and boas he looked at dave and let his eyes roll for a moment aiee the boas they are worse than the crocs very aggressive but theyre not poisonous maybe so senor dave but they still have teeth such teeth they have you give me a choice between being bitten by a boa and a viper every time i will choose the viper lurching to a halt al leaned forward his hands on his knees and began to throw up dave got out of the car to take a leak and then meandered over to als oneman huddle you all right al was still retching and dave felt his nostrils prickle with disgust as a strong smell of nail polish wafted his way it was the stink of guaro the stuff was coming back up from als gut as neat as if he was pouring it straight from the bottle all right al groaned a bitter laugh im about thirty fucking clicks west of there he said breathlessly and then retched some more dave said someone ought to record that sound a sound effects guy for a movie last night on the hotel room cable channel there was this movie with mel gibson at the end they tear his guts out and burn them in front of his face they could sure have used you in the recording studio al that is one medieval sound could be the start of a whole new career for you thing about throwing up is not to give up on it before youre done otherwise it dont achieve what its supposed to even more retching matter of fuckin stamina he belched retched again and then spat several times dont quit on it before youre through less you have to a last heaving coronary of a gag or you just have to repeat the process panting as if hed sprinted the hundred al straightened up took a deep unsteady breath and grinned horribly dave swallowed uncertainly and said jesus christ al you should puke for america dave knew very little about the boat they had come down to fetch back to miami and every time he asked al told him to wait and see but nearing quepos on a road so thick with dust chico had the headlamps on dave said this is a long way to come for a fucking boat aint you heard broke dont get to pick yeah but look at this place they were driving past a warren of houses built on stilts and connected with a virtual freeway system of planks and corrugated iron sheets kind of a boat are we going to find down here anyway fucking banana boat sampan maybe jesus the dirt road led past the fishing village and through extensive mangrove swamp fucking airboat is what you need down here complained dave and irritably slapped something crawling on his neck told you to use that avon shit me i aint been bitten once the bug that bit you would probably die of alcohol poisoning al shrugged and said feelin better as a matter of fact a nice cold beer would slip down a treat dave caught a glimpse of a crocodile as disturbed by the range rover it slipped into some brackish water the horror he muttered darkly the horror the fuck you talkin about relax will ya were nearly there the road led south along a beachfront drag is quepos grinned chico the town it is nothing to write home about no he turned into a large harbor north of a bridge but here is better here has been a lot of development lots of gringo tourist fishermen december through august snapper amberjack suddenly dave saw why they had come for the bay was bristling with the marlin towers and flybridges of dozens of longrange luxury sportfishing boats some of them worth a million dollars or more he said all right thats more like it wahoo tuna but mainly they come for the marlin and the sailfish whad i tell ya said al is more protected from winds down here than guanacaste coast i think but dont even think of swimming is contaminated not to mention currents and the fucking sharks al laughed and said swimming fuck that so why you come to quepos dave said to pick up a boat for the fishing al added quickly dave looked at al and frowned al shook his head as if he didnt want dave to contradict him most gringos they come here and bring plenty of rods and equipment but you guys ours got stolen at the airport explained al is no problem i can recommend somewhere they will supply all equipment if you want good price too thanks but no we made a booking with an outfit back in san jose charter company called vera cruz somewhere north of the bridge is all i know chico asked the way at a gift shop and they were directed to a small ranchita on stilts over the water in front of the bridge leading into quepos town while al paid off chico dave strolled up the marina relieved to be out of the car and getting some fresh air backed up against a thickly forested hill with a muddy beach in front quepos looked a strange place to find a bay full of luxury yachts a couple of kids were doing wheelies on ancient mountain bikes up and down the harbor in front of a row of shops and restaurants when al glanced in the door of the vera cruz office one of the bicycling kids came and told dave that the vera cruz gringo had gone somewhere for lunch dave gave the kid a fivecolon note and then went to tell al al nodded at the restaurant and said ok lets eat my stomach feels like a basketball net sides there are one or two facts of fuckin life that i want to get straight between us like some dos and fuckin donts till i say when motherfucker savvy since you put the invitation so graciously i dont see how i can very well refuse you al you just stick with that attitude and you and i are going to get along just fine they went inside the restaurant and straightaway ordered a couple of cervezas apiece while they looked at the menu after a few minutes dave decided on the rice and the beans while al elected to have turtle laughing unpleasantly as he made his selection he said jesus i wish my kid petey was here to see me eat this those fuckin ninja turtles hes always playing with they drive me nuts i hate the little green bastards i hate the song i hate the show and i hate the characters leonardo donatello what kind of a world are we buildin for em i ask ya when a kid grows up and thinks that michelangelo is a fuckin turtle instead of a famous historical painter i had no idea you were so interested in art said dave all italians are interested in great painters its part of our heritage soon as i get home im gonna tell him i ate a fuckin turtle but wont that upset him damn right itll upset him listen you aint a parent you wouldnt understand thanks to hollywood theres hardly an animal that hasnt been turned into some cute little cartoon character whales deer rabbits baby elephants crabs n turtles a turtle isnt an animal its a reptile whatever daddy you cant eat bambi hey son just watch me but whats the point of that its a tool for learning thats whats the point when you eat the animal you teach the kid about the real world half the problems kids have today are to do with their fuckin fantasy worlds bite on reality thats what i say food for thought helps em grow up when i was a kid i saw my father kill chickens and turkeys all the time my kids have never seen any kind of food killed not even a fish somethin wrong there i may not be able to kill the animal like my old man but i can sure make a point of eating it when the opportunity arises youre a regular doctor spock yknow that all these animal welfare whackos most of them have been reared on bullshit about little animals with cute personalities two things i want for my sons i want them to know who the real michelangelo was and i dont want them growing up vegetarian vegetarian is for faggots dave said michelangelo was a faggot says who everyone look at the david bullshit ok if michelangelo was a fag would the pope have had him redecorate the ceiling of the sistine chapel i dont think so dave could see that al wasnt about to be persuaded so he just grinned and said lesbian trapped inside a womans body huh now that i can understand pleased to change the subject himself al laughed and said yeah you should have seen the two of them party they licked each other from end to end i love to see that that is such a beautiful sight man i bet michelangelo would have painted that if he could have gotten away with it what about you kind of a time did you have yourself good said dave they were good al waited for details but when none came he frowned and said ok heres the deal wiseguy were down here on a repo fucker who owns the boat ive chartered guy by the name of lou malta malta owes tony a shitload of money what with the vig nall it totals over a million bucks six months ago malta was in fort lauderdale paying his bills and everything was cool is the rule then next thing he floats his ass down here without so much as a fuckin postcard to tony like he disappeared without a trace but hows this for a cofuckingincidence day after you pitch your outline to naked tony the private dick he hired to find maltas dumb ass emails tony with the full longitude and latitude of his exact whereabouts like it was ordained that you should have this boat for your caper now malta doesnt know me from john doe but it would be best if we didnt tell him we just flew in from miami and other eyebrowraising shit like that you keep your mouth shut and help me out here and the boats yours for the long hot summer ahead malta you going to kill him al not unless he makes it necessary only i wont help you kill him believe me blood is not on todays menu not even as a tool for learning al shrugged like i say not unless he obliges me to do it what if i dont help you out then i got a boat with no one to sail it back home and you got no boat to pull your caper not to mention no ticket home dave nursed the cold cerveza in his hand for a moment wondering if he really had a choice what kind of boat is it al took out his wallet unfolded a black and white photocopy and handed it over a real beauty eighty feet twenty beam six draft powered by two horsepower engines shes got a top speed of about thirtyfive knots dave noted the name painted on the stern in the picture the juarista he said vera cruz it figures thats all i know that and the color shes white dave said white is good he chugged some beer down his throat shows the dirt but still its good camouflage itll help us to blend in with all the other boats he smiled and folded up the picture can i keep this be my guest so how dyou wanna play this al you know malta might not be willing to give up his boat without a struggle then theres the paperwork well need proper paperwork to get this boat onto syts next transatlantic voyage paperwork was all taken care of when the boat was still parked in lauderdale collateral for maltas loan from tony tony lent malta the money when none of the banks would touch him however i take your point were a long way from home and malta might figure that gives him some liberties i tell you what were gonna do were gonna get out to sea just like we was a couple of tourists well get away from shore somewhere secluded i hope put down some bait like we really are going fishing and then im gonna give him the forbes fact and comment on how much his ass will be worth if he thinks he can fuck with tonys portfolio kind of like an investment analyst i get it dave finished the first beer and started the second ok ill help you out with this on one condition i thought we already had that no killing this is as well i want you to let me do the talking what the fuck for you dont think i can handle the dialogue on a simple repo i think you can handle it just fine i just worry about all that fact and comment bullshit dave shrugged and lit a cigarette youre much too confrontational this is a repo were talking about not an aa group give me one of those cigarettes al lit up angrily yeah but you gotta understand human psychology al you lip the guy and hell react badly just the same as if you were to put a gun to his head hes lucky im not gonna blow his fucking brains all over the deck but dont you see you talk hard to him maybe you provoke him to do something dumb he does something dumb it almost guarantees a violent outcome to the situation what are you a shrink all of a sudden i saw it a lot in prison the way the guys got mad and the way some of the guards could talk them down we want to do this thing peacefully which is the way i want it then weve got to be subtle oh yeah yeah al was laughing this is the guy who blinded willy barizon in one eye with a fucking fountain pen that was very subtle havent you heard the expression the pen is mightier than the sword well willy wasnt armed with a sword but with two guns id say i was just about as subtle as i could be tell that to willy next time he almost sees you those are my conditions ok ok you do the talking what do i know maybe youre warren fucking christopher or somethin they ate lunch and then went outside on the short walk along to the vera cruz offices al spotted something he wanted to buy for his son petey in the gift shop it was a baby hammerhead shark specimen about a foot long preserved in a jar of formaldehyde dave watched al hand over twenty colons for the curio and asked whats that a tool for learning hell love it petey loves sharks does that mean youre planning to give it to him or eat it on his birthday al smiled thinly that smart mouth of yours its a wonder you lasted out the five chapter ten the juarista was indeed a beauty lou malta explained her construction history inside the enclosed flybridge while they were getting underway shshe was built in san diego he explained in his stuttering drawl the way the hulls constructed means she has a low center of gravity and a deep ventry in the water producing a very comfortable ride for you people whatever the seas like i never knew anyone to get sick on this boat not even from pepes cooking of course weve got the thrusters and stabilizers to simplify handling but its the hull that makes the difference and a reverse sheer below the transom there makes backing down as smooth and ddry as if you were standing on the shshore whered you say you boys were from dave said la la huh which part all over mmmm all over my favorite place he giggled just ask pepe well you picked a pretty good time of year to come after marlin and sailfish januarys usually our best month he gave them a searching north to south look how much sportfishing experience have you boys had anyway enough said al malta shrugged wwell whatever pepe and i we get all levels of experience on this boat just a few weeks ago we were fishing for wahoo with these three types from new york and i swear i found one of them trying to kill the fish with his cellular telephone he giggled again i swear it was the funniest thing i ever saw wasnt it pepe pepe grinned and said yes lou pepe was a beautiful black boy of about thirteen wearing a navy blue tshirt with a white nike swoosh logo and a pair of baggy guess jeans he was down on the cockpit tying off ropes and smiling broadly at malta whenever their eyes met cr had a big gay scene and al and dave could see that pepe was maltas cachero malta himself wearing a pair of sky blue lycra cycling shorts and a white tshirt with garfield the cat on it was a curiouslooking man fortyish rod stewart haircut pink pilsbury doughboy face rimless eyeglasses with blue frames and a large gold earring with a cartouche to match the one hanging around his pudgy neck he looked more hairdresser than fishing skipper pepe will fix you up with some tackle weve got more or less everything youll need although you two are the lightest travellers ive ever seen down here talk about the accidental tourist dont you think so pepe yes lou like i said al growled we got a lot of our gear stolen in san jose cr is a very pretty country said malta but the thing about the country is that its just so impossibly ppretty that it seduces you into a false sense of security there are thieves all over dave said thats true of everywhere well yes but really malta tutted and sighed loudly and shook his head in apparent despair a mans fishing equipment is something sacrosanct isnt it pepe yes lou you boys were insured though yeah we got insurance said al you got insurance malta picked up the slight note of threat that was carried in als remark oh you boysll be safe enough on this boat wont they pepe weve got every creature comfort tv and vcr in every cabin airconditioning weve even got a misting system to keep those rippling muscles of yours cool when youre in the fighting chair it gets pretty hot out there when youve got a big one i even put a little patchouli oil in the mist reservoir just to make the air smell nice i dont know about you but fish isnt my scent of choice and pepes a pretty good little cook despite what i said and i dont just mean he knows how to use the microwave he can cook up pretty much anything you want pepe knows what men like to eat we have plenty of ssupplies you just tell him if theres anything in particular takes your fancy just as long as its fish he giggled again just joking weve got lots of steaks in the freezer and plenty of beer you boys want a beer beerd be good admitted dave but what am i thinking of youll want to see your cabins naturally you each have your own head and bath go on take a look around while i get the beers only pay particular attention to the salon im kinda prouda that designed it myself its ornamented with custommade glass by lallalique al and dave went below the boat was as luxurious as lou malta had promised and with the headroom reaching seven feet in the salon and in the staterooms it had an impressive amount of interior volume dave didnt much care for the taste it was too fussy but it was plain to see that no cost had been spared in fitting her out with every conceivable extra dave said hey al this boats worth a lot more than a mill say not much change out of three and youd have been more accurate so al was more interested in investigating lou maltas sleeping arrangements than his own inspecting the cedarlined drawers and closets he sneered and said its like i thought what is al glanced up at the mirrored ceiling and then spat onto the black silk sheets that covered maltas double bed hes fucking that kid my peteys not much younger than that pepe kid what of it those two girls you were with in key largo last night werent much older than pepe they were maybe fifteen or sixteen at most bullshit but even if they were its different for girls number one girls mature quicker and number two that was straight sex i thought you said you had them going down on each other that was for my benefit not theirs that kind of sex dont count that was just like a couple of actresses playing a gay part for a movie with me being the camera it dont make them queer but this he bent down to pick up a magazine from the cabin floor and dave caught a glimpse of older men having sex with younger boys before al flung it aside in disgust this is something else he looked angrily at dave what dave shrugged i still think this is a lot of boat to repo for the loan of a million yeah well thats the nature of collateral aint you heard were in a recession moneys tight he laughed cruelly and i bet thats a lot more than i can say for that faggots ass id better go and give him the bad news before we get too far offshore said dave you do that sooner those two fags are off this boat the better ill feel theres magazines and videos in that creeps fuckin drawer that would give hannibal lecter a nightmare lou malta wrung his hands and wept what am i going to do dave and malta were sitting at opposite ends of an lshaped sofa in the now stationary boats salon malta was on his second pink gin although it looked large enough to have been a third and a fourth as well get some things together dave told him and the thousand bucks we paid you up front for the charter keep it well turn the boat around and head back towards quepos when we get in sight of the cr coastline you and pepe can take the inflatable and row ashore but this boat its my whole life dave said not any more what youve got to hang onto here is the fact that you still have your whole life you may not have the boat but youre going to live if it was up to the gorilla on deck youd be lipgaffed hoisted for a fuckin picture and then dropped over the side for the sharks malta trembled visibly and emptied his glass jesus christ really really hes a violent man and he works for a violent man tony nudelli ive seen what he can do to people i had no idea that um that tony was so mad with me sure you did lou sure you did i guess i did at that said malta it was a stupid thing to do wasnt it yes it was lou malta got up from the sofa a little unsteadily and walked toward the stairs down to the cabins ill get that bag lou you wont do anything else thats stupid will you like come out of that stateroom with a gun in your hand thats just what the gorilla wants an excuse to kill you and pepe you understand me yes sir good boy dave stood up and followed malta to the top of the stairs he had no idea if al was carrying a gun just because he couldnt have brought one aboard the plane didnt mean he wasnt carrying now san jose looked like the kind of place you could buy one easily no questions asked and someone like al wasnt the type to leave anything to chance no more did he know if lou malta had a gun but if dave had run out on a man like nudelli a man who lent the loan sharks their money then hed make sure he always had a gun around probably two or three so he followed malta downstairs and looked through the door of his stateroom to make sure lou was staring into an empty sports bag as if wondering what to take dave said cmon we havent got all day all right all right im doing my best for you you inhuman bastard doing your best for me dave shook his head and yawned that was the thanks he got for keeping the guy alive malta started to stuff things into the bag wallet passport jewelry a bottle of obsession for men walkman toilet bag cellular phone i think youd better leave the phone said dave oh yeah shure ok well couldnt i just take the operating chip out of it and leave that behind its useless without growing impatient now dave said lou will ya leave the fuckin phone malta shrugged and stared at the contents of his bag almost incredulously for a moment then zippered it up im done he said tearfully and came through the door dave grunted needing to take a leak he said go up on deck and tell pepe youre both leaving ill be there in a minute emerging onto the lanai deck a couple of minutes later dave blinked furiously in the bright pacific sunshine and took a deep breath of the fresh sea air below there was a decadent smell of obsession and something else that he didnt much care to try and put a finger on al was leaning over the rail looking down onto the cockpit from where the serious fishing was done hearing dave he turned around and dave saw that for the second time in thirtysix hours the other mans white polo shirt was covered in blood dave shook his head and said what another fuckin nosebleed the very next second he heard a loud splash like the sound of someone jumping into the water and turned toward the bow of the boat instinctively he said wheres malta he hit me shrugged al and threw a jagged piece of broken glass over the side it was part of the jar containing the baby hammerhead he had bought for petey the dead fish now lay on the teak deck at daves feet it was surrounded by a lot of blood spots like so many shiny red coins al rubbed the back of his sparsely haired head and looked vaguely sheepish dave was frowning now suspecting something was wrong al where the fuck is that faggot mans got a speech impediment said al and jabbed a thumb at the cockpit behind him hes dead lou malta lay in a spreading pool of blood like something they had just hauled up from the depths of the ocean his legs twitching spasmodically as if with one good jerk he might propel himself back into the lifepreserving water the broken jar had crossed through the midline of maltas throat with such force that his neck had been severed from shaving line to spine jesus fucking christ exclaimed dave what happened what could i do he tried to brain me the lousy faggot a monkey wrench lay on the lanai deck a short distance from the baby hammerhead as if confirming als story maltas bag stood inside the doorway of the salon as if he had put it down there before stepping outside with intent but dave was suspicious it was possible that al had left the wrench there himself before stabbing malta with the souvenir and yet that wasnt the most obvious murder weapon dave had ever heard of surely if al had meant to kill malta he would have chosen something a little more wieldy something he hadnt been planning to present to his son lou malta stopped twitching before dave could get to him it was obvious there was nothing to be done dave said so who jumped off the kid i guess pepe must have seen me kill his boyfriend and figured he was next not an unreasonable conclusion dave climbed up to the flybridge to get a better view of the water surrounding the juarista and about fifty yards away saw a small figure swimming strongly in the direction of the mainland sitting down in the cream leather pilots chair dave started the engines and took hold of the helm al yelled up to him what are you doing going after pepe its five miles back to shore against a riptide hell never make it down on the cockpit deck al said nothing instead he started to maneuver lou maltas body over the edge of the transom all the time cursing him for a lousy faggot dave drew the boat close to pepe slowed the engines and then threw the boy a lifebelt on the end of a line but pepe terrified of what he had witnessed back on the boat was too scared to grab it cmon pepe dave called down to him take the line nobodys going to kill you kid i promise treading water for a moment pepe shook his head he said no way man and began to swim away from the boat again dave returned to the pilots chair gave the engines a short burst of gas and then revved back the same way as before coming outside again he spoke to pepe in spanish gently telling him that the other guy hadnt meant to kill lou that it had been an accident and that anyway it was lou who had attacked al in the first place giving al the benefit of the doubt ten minutes passed in this way and still pepe was too scared to take the line throw him the inflatable and lets get the fuck out of here urged al daves eyes caught something else surfacing briefly in the water near pepe it looked like a harmless tarpon he thought around eighty to a hundred pounds in size it was a good one too good silver color big dorsal by the time he realized what it was there were others all of them summoned by the blood from maltas body daves heart missed a beat and he yelled down to the boy look out pepe get out of the water for christs sake grab the fucking line seemingly unaware of the sharks pepe shook his head as if daves angry outburst had merely confirmed what hed suspected all along by the time he understood what dave had been yelling about it was already too late as if sensing that malta would wait the sharks concentrated their attack on the swimming boy dave could only stand and watch horrified as the sharks hit pepe like a gang of playground bullies first one then another and then all at once with an audible snapping of jaws that dave felt in every nervous fiber of his being pepe screamed slapped the water in front of him and gulping air and water disappeared briefly under the foaming confusion of reddening water it was then dave saw what species of shark these were hammerheads bigger deadlier versions of the baby that still lay on the deck dave felt himself shiver at the ferocity of their apparent revenge pepe reappeared only once water and blood bursting from his screaming mouth a hand already missing from his arm he kept shaking his head as if he couldnt quite believe what was happening to him and dave was almost relieved when the boy finally disappeared under the surface of the water al yelled did you see that did you see that he laughed as if callously enjoying the horror of what he was witnessing and with no more sympathy for pepes savage fate than if the boy had been part of some bmovies lengthy body count fuckin jaws man jesus i never thought id see something like that that was totally awesome he shook his head i knew i was right i knew it dont ever get in the fuckin water and then like a man who had witnessed the birth of a child instead of the death of one al lit a large macanudo dave watched the frothing boil of shark water and young blood until he was certain that pepe wouldnt surface again and then cut loose the lifebelt once pure white now bright red slowly he climbed down from the bridge sickened seeing the baby hammerhead he stamped on its tbone head and then flung it angrily into the ocean al was still standing on the lower deck occupying the bloody space where lou maltas body had been the cigar chomped between his teeth jutting out over the sharkinfested water like a warships gun barrel springing down the steps into the cockpit dave snatched the big cigar from als mouth and flung it into the sea after the baby hammerhead what the fuck you dumb ox snarled dave dont you know anything pushing maltas body into the water when you did was like sending the sharks an email jesus christ they must have thought it was thanksgiving al looked around evasively ok im sorry he yelled back at dave it never occurred to me and while were on the subject did you have to kill malta what happened to the deal we made he came at me with the wrench i grabbed the jar smashed it against the side of the boat and let him have it i didnt mean to kill him just to mark him up a bit mark him you damn near sawed his head off yeah well i aint sorry i killed him goddamn pedophile my son peteys not much younger than that kid pepe not any more he isnt thanks to you pepe is dead thanks to you al pepe just got eaten by the fucking sharks thanks to you this boat and lou malta were probably the best it ever got for pepe think about that when you smoke your next premium cigar with slow defiance al pulled another macanudo from the pocket of his bloodstained pants sucked its length as if it was his own forefinger and then lit up he puffed the cigar in daves face and said ok im thinking what the fuck happens now dave met als eye hating him finding the hate returned in spades he shook his head and turned away disgusted at als display of coldbloodedness he said lets get out of here weve got a lot of sailing to do the bridge of the juarista was fully computerized and it took dave less than an hour to familiarize himself with the electronic chart plotter the radar system and the auto pilot but once he had keyed in their course for panama and the canal there was very little else to do except periodically look at the monitor screens with a fuel tank containing nearly gallons a gallon per day freshwater maker and a freezer full of food they were completely selfsufficient for their voyage back to miami it was a twentyfourhour cruise down to panama city and the entrance to the canal and keen to be away from the scene of lou maltas murder dave decided to avoid any ports of call and sail through the night happy to keep out of als murderous way he stayed up on the flybridge snatching the occasional hour or two of sleep on the sofa al himself remained in his stateroom drinking beers watching movies on his vcr and eating several microwave meals before falling asleep around midnight and sleeping until well after lunchtime the next day when they arrived off the coast of panama the journey through the canal itself took a full day and a half and dave decided was probably the most interesting thirtysix hours hed had in five years three sets of locks gatun pedro miguel and miraflores raised ships entering from the pacific side on a kind of liquid stairway to the caribbean side there were no pumps gravity performed all the necessary water transfer summoned by daves calls to come and take a look at one of the modern wonders of the world al finally emerged from his cabin reeking of sweat and beer and wearing a dolphins shirt and a pair of cutoff jeans he nodded without much enthusiasm as dave explained what a feat of engineering the canal was and seemed quite unimpressed by the close proximity of so many larger vessels al said so whats in it for them who the fucking panams thats who the canals controlled by some kind of international body yeah and whats their angle they charge a toll to get through the canal of course you mean like on the florida turnpike dave smiled slowly and said kind of except it costs a little more than a quarter what tolls are based on a ships tonnage what ok they once charged a guy who tried to swim the canal thirty six cents and that was back in so guess how much it is for a boat like this today what is this family challenge how the fuck should i know five ten bucks what dave was enjoying his anticipation of als reaction finally he said it was he smiled as als jaw hit the deck get the fuck out of here it was not i swear a thousand bucks youre putting me on dave handed al the receipt average toll for a big cargo ship is around get the fuck out of here and they pay it theyve no choice but to pay it unless they want to go round cape horn shit man thats what i call a shakedown al looked up uncomfortably at the oil tanker that was moored alongside them in the pedro miguel most expensive fucking drain ive ever been in he said and without another word returned to his stateroom to watch the us militarys channel eight on tv dave suspected that als reaction was mostly based on fear being at the bottom of a fortyfoot screw lock as it filled up with millions of gallons of water felt very claustrophobic he had set a north by northwest course for cancun on mexicos yucatan peninsula a distance of some miles from there he intended to sail north by northeast across the northern coast of cuba it was a course he hoped would keep them close to land in the event that they encountered anything worse than the roughish sea that according to the weather station on the radio now lay ahead of them the boat was fitted with gyrogale quadrafin stabilizers but in an effort to make time and because he also wanted to punish al for what had happened to pepe dave avoided using them altogether he himself was an excellent sailor al he had already surmised was not and by the time the coast of honduras was behind them al was looking as green as a wet dollar bill watching him throw up over the side for the third time in eighteen hours dave grinned sadistically seems like youve thrown up just about everywhere in central america youre one hell of a tourist ill say that much for you al kind of like a tiger the way it marks out its territory with piss only you seem to prefer to use vomit he glanced back at some seagulls now making a meal of what al had just thrown up the gulls seem to like you anyway at least they like what you had for breakfast that smart mouth of yours again al collapsed on the flybridge sofa and closed his eyes biliously smart dave smacked his lips experimentally you mean as in not covered with flecks of vomit yeah i guess it is at that he glanced down at one of the screens in front of him as the auto pilot made a small course correction and simultaneously stored the information in the computers deadreckoning log then taking a deep ostentatiously euphoric breath dave stood up stretched and said hey al doesnt this sea air give you an appetite reckon ill go below and fix myself a big lunch right now i could really murder a big plate of rock oysters al swallowed loudly and said im gonna murder you if you dont shut the fuck up not hungry huh how long groaned al before we get to florida dave checked the bottom of the screen where real time displays of position course track and eta were updated every second well according to hal here be another forty hours or so before you see the historic city of miami again that is if we dont hit any really bad weather which could slow us up some but i cant see it changing very much from what it is now it looks like you and your internal affairs had better get used to this kind of sea al smiled grimly and you motherfucker had better get used to having me around maybe i havent yet told you but im your chaperon for the atlantic caper dave laughed scornfully you ive seen poisoned camels that would make better sailors than you al shook his head as if too ill to think of some insult to hurl back in the younger mans tanned and healthylooking face exasperated he said the fuck dyou want all that money for anyway thats an odd question for you to ask like one hooker accusing another of promiscuity al stood up abruptly and with one hand clamped over his ballooning mouth went outside the bridge and leaned over the side during the minutes he was gone dave did a little philosophical thinking he thought about the heist and he thought about the money but mostly he just thought about where he was on the high seas with nothing in front of him except the prow of the boat and not a bad boat at that it was just about worth the effort of going all the way down to costa rica to fetch it back home maybe it wasnt worth the lives of two people but he could hardly have anticipated anything like what had happened in san jose he was enjoying the voyage an enjoyment made all the sweeter by the knowledge of how much al was hating it al stepped uncertainly through the flybridge doorway wiping his mouth on the sleeve of his football shirt he sat down at the chart table and drank some whiskey in an attempt to settle his stomach dave said been thinking about your question al what fuckin question why i want all that money you were right it was a dumb fucking question you ever read books al books al finished the whiskey in his glass and poured another he was considering the possibility that being drunk he might not notice being seasick i only ever read three books in my whole life three that i remember anyway one was hoyle on gambling the second was the jaguar owners handbook i gotta jaguar supercharged xjr beautiful fuckin car and the third book i read was about the roman caesars on the whole if i want to read a book i generally wait for the movie you should read more al most of the travel ive done in the last five years has been in the pages of books so in answer to your earlier question i want to buy myself a yacht and see some of those places for myself yknow madonna wants to go to europe but i like vegas one book i read was seven pillars of wisdom by lawrence of arabia good movie it was all about how he fell in love with the empty space of the desert right thats what i want to do fall in love with some empty spaces i could introduce you to a cousin of mine best lookin empty space i ever saw the lights are on cept nobodys home but built like a fuckin palace the desert or maybe the wilderness the australian outback the yukon and of course the sea the sea i love al shook his head and grimaced he said i hate the fuckin sea the kind of yacht i want to buy its nothing like this man i want a proper boat with sails cant be too big or else i have to have a large crew two people including myself d be about right gotta picture of the kinda boat im gonna buy right here want to see it dave took a piece of paper out of his pocket unfolded a picture he had torn from an old copy of showboats international and showed it to al he said now thats what i call a boat seventyfive foot ketch clipper bow wineglass stern transom windows scheel layout boat like that costs a lot more than two hundred grand anyway kind of boat to see the world in al looked at the picture and then floated it back to dave all those sails looks like hard work thats the point al its you and the sea the seas a bitch and a bitch whos really out of your league the kind of bitch who even when you take her on you know shes gonna fuck ya around and that youre gonna live to regret it but still you go ahead anyway and persuade yourself that maybe it wont turn out that way but it does turn out that way if anything she behaves worse than you ever imagined was possible shes cold shes hard shes cruel and she doesnt give a flying fuck what happens to you a real ball breaker thats the fuckin sea man dave looked at al appreciatively he smiled and said well what do you know hey al youre a romantic too chapter eleven kent bowen parked his jimmy and walked up a long slope toward the hotel entrance the hyatt regency occupied a prime site in fort lauderdale on the west side of the seventeenth street causeway bridge from its revolving pier top cocktail bar you could see for miles around and bowen had good reason to remember the place with special affection it was in the pier top last st valentines day while drinking delicious margaritas that he had asked zola to marry him on her accepting his proposal they had adjourned to a beach motel on bayside drive where they had taken a room for the night to consummate their love a scot by descent and thus by his own estimation a thrifty hardheaded man bowen had never been the kind to throw money around but that ranked as one of the most perfect evenings of his life he walked in the door of the hotel and made for the elevator pausing only to buy a copy of luxury florida homes in the gift shop there was nothing like seeing how the other half lived on floridas premier real estate to encourage the dreams he had when he bought his weekly lottery ticket not that he would ever throw his wealth around if he did win bowen liked to think of himself using his as yet unfound wealth with discretion enjoyment with anonymity dressed from head to toe in tilley endurables he felt as anonymous as the situation now required mixing unnoticed with the guests who were staying in the hotel bowen rode the elevator up to the floor below the pier top and walked round the hall to the eastfacing suite where the stakeout was located standing in front of the door he glanced one way and then the other before knocking carefully a few seconds passed and then the door opened on the chain kate furey almost laughed most of all it was the hat that got to her hi its me he said as if he had been wearing a santa claus outfit of course it is she said and let him in bowen advanced through the door and glanced around the suite before she ushered him into the bedroom hi there at the window behind an arsenal of highpowered lenses mounted on tripods two boredlooking men grunted back a third wearing headphones and facing a whole sound stage of eavesdropping equipment remained silent unaware that someone had come into the room kate left all three unidentified she knew that bowen wasnt looking for introductions more than likely he had driven up from miami in search of a free lunch nice room he remarked very nice indeed kate shrugged as if she herself didnt much care for it and said actually this is supposed to be a suite a suite jesus kate how much is that costing same as a room i got a rate how come my canthappensoonenoughexhusband acted for the hotel in a personal injury suit i seem to remember it was some dimwitted dork who injured himself in the revolving bar upstairs its really tacky but a great view i guess thats why they go there the airheads kate laughed with undisguised contempt give them something to talk about when they think theyre being romantic you want to take a look at it before you go bowen said stiffly thanks i already did kate giggled i guess they think its pretty soigne but i thought it was like being inside a really cheap sports watch hardly that cheap id have thought bristled bowen damn right said one of the men on the cameras last night i paid ten bucks for the worst goddamn margarita i ever tasted kate looked at bowen theres not much you can see up here when it gets dark she offered by way of an excuse i guess not kate said i could show you some pictures but right now you can see the live action bowen clapped his hands together purposefully then lets take a lookeesee what we can ispy shall we the big lenses were focused on the opposite side of the stranahan river and the portside yacht club where some of the biggest and most expensive boats in fort lauderdale were moored the cameraman who reckoned he knew a good margarita when he tasted one took bowen through the cameras like a salesman in a sharper image store this one the mill gives you a pretty good view of the whole boat and whats happening on the mooring bowen swept off his tilley hat and pressed his eye close to the viewfinder at feet long the britannia was hardly the biggest vessel in the harbor not with trump about and she was dwarfed by the foot triple storey moored alongside but with her large flying bridge and elegant lines she was a gracefullooking boat fun too if the small speedboat wet bikes jetskis and hobiecat she had on board were anything to go by not to mention the naked female occupant of the jacuzzi on the bridge bowen grinned and said ill have me some of that whos the little lady with the bubbles kate sighed wearily and said so far as we can tell her name is gay gilmore garys sister huh sniggered bowen the girl in the jacuzzi rubbed some bubbles over her breasts hey lets do it babe actually shes from new zealand until a few weeks ago she was working illegally as a table dancer at a joint on collins right now she seems to be the britannia captains main squeeze the margarita man said you can see him on the mill here name of nicky vallbona hes the ugly bastard on the aft deck reluctantly bowen changed cameras and found himself looking at a dark man with a pencilthin mustache he said youre right he is an ugly bastard hes clean as far as were concerned said kate what does a babe like her see in a hog like him mused bowen the second cameraman stirred on his chair to put out his cigarette he snorted and said the boat i shouldnt wonder chick seems to like it as much as she likes him comes and goes pretty much as she pleases always in that jacuzzi i believe shes quite popular with the folks looking through the telescope up on the pier top shes becoming a regular tourist attraction bowen moved back to the first camera to take another look at gay gilmore me i prefer the boat next to the britannia said the margarita man that one belongs to sean connery s got a boat here in lauderdale bowens voice betrayed excitement any pictures of the big guy himself the two cameramen exchanged a guilty look and then shook their heads simultaneously no lied one bowen said youre right though it is a nice boat sean connery eh matter of fact my own ancestors were scottish from edinburgh just like him i guess there are lots of other similarities said kate but bowen was too interested in connerys boat and the naked girl on the britannia to be aware of kates sarcasm kate said i checked out your theory sir with palmer johnson yachts right here in fort lauderdale theyre one of the biggest makers of boat hulls in florida the guy i spoke to luis madrid said it was possible that you might get a hull made of compressed cocaine that might look like the real thing when covered with a linear polyurethane coating but that it would hardly perform to the same standard bowen had moved back to the mill lens to get a closer view of gay gilmores naked body she was touching herself all over now almost as if she knew that people were watching the thought occurred to him that maybe she was acting as some kind of distraction to keep people watching what was happening in the jacuzzi and not somewhere else but swinging the camera lens all around it didnt seem that there was much else to see just vallbona talking on the cellular i wonder who nickys talking to on his nokia he murmured right now its his bookmaker said kate bowen looked up for a moment surprised you can really tell that from up here sure weve got a cellmate system said kate we have intercepted one call i think youll find is of particular interest she went over to the man wearing the headphones and tapped him gently on the shoulder the man bearded and stale looking as if in need of air and sunlight lifted the headphones from his appropriately large ears colin this is kent bowen the as ac in charge of this operation could you play him the syt tape we made sure thing kate colin drew his laptop toward him pulled down a menu and chose a file from the list of recordings he had made the cellmate was connected to the laptop via an scsi cable and to a digital tape recorder by means of a parallel interface the cellmate itself looked like a larger cellular telephone with some additional controls syt file coming up said colin and hit the return on his laptop kate said the first voice youll hear the guy with the spanish accent is the shipping agent juan sedeno nicky vallbona is the second voice bowen nodded and pulled up a chair and listened as the tape began to play stranahan yacht transport id like to book my vessel aboard your ship for the march voyage to palma mallorca from port everglades all right sir your own name the name of your vessel and the name of her owner im nicky vallbona and im the captain of the britannia shes owned by azimuth marine associates in the british virgin islands virgin islands can you tell me please what are the dimensions of your own boat length is thirtyfour meters beam is and the draft one point eight any bow pulpit no swimming platform yes its three feet long three feet what about tender storage onboard hmmm march you say yes yes we can accommodate you captain vallbona the cost will be approximately american dollars that figure includes stevedoring on both sides of the atlantic divers assistance all lashing and securing keel blocks and chine supports passage for two crew members and all insurances sounds good do you have our booking form captain yes could you please complete it and fax it back to us as soon as possible no problem ill do it right away thank you for calling goodbye captain goodbye the conversation ended and the tape turned itself off automatically wanna hear it again asked colin bowen said hell no speaks for itself doesnt it obviously the boat isnt seaworthy on account of how the hulls probably made of pure cocaine so theyre doing what i always suspected they would do getting someone else to ferry it across the atlantic for them perfect cover too when you think about it rocky envigados boat rubbing fenders with what passes for high society in these parts listening to bowen claim her theory or at least half of it anyway as his own kate felt her jaw muscles tighten she wanted to remind him to tell him that he was so full of shit he made her sick only he kept talking on and on like some asshole politician on tv in a perfect world she could have reached for the remote and hit the mute button or maybe just forced the remote into his big stupid mouth and battered it down his throat with the heel of her shoe but all she did instead was turn her back on him in an attempt to hide her anger the only question is what we do about it continued bowen whether we choose to pass the matter on to the spanish police or mount some kind of undercover operation of our own he paused and glanced around what do you think kate kate cleared her throat and tried to struggle out of the sea of resentment in which she had suddenly found herself but when she answered him it still came out bitter and sarcastic me what do i think a hollow laugh tumbled out of her mouth what i tell you so you can tell me later is that the kind of whatdoithink you mean sir bowen frowned and said something bothering you kate even when she was being offensive he didnt pick up on it kate shook her head pitying him as she would have pitied a dog left in a car on a hot day only bowen managed to misinterpret that too he said good because you know march is just around the corner theres no time to lose here kate wondered exactly how kent bowen had got to be an asac in the first place and considering the possibility that there existed within the bureau some kind of affirmative action policy on behalf of dumb deputy sheriffs from kansas quietly she said ive got some ideas well i want to hear them she led him through to the sitting room next door waved him toward a big horseshoeshaped sofa and went over to the minibar want something to drink just a diet coke kate came back with two regulars on ice and put them down on a table that was a sheet of round glass atop a corinthian capital it wasnt just the pier top that looked tacky it was the furniture as well but this was true of nearly everywhere in florida you just had to look in the copy of luxury florida homes kent bowen had with him to know that mind if i smoke she said she picked up a pack of doral and lit one without waiting for an answer go right ahead said bowen and winced in response to her first inhalation still holding her cigarette she pushed her dark hair clear of her face and marshalled her thoughts she said ok this is my idea bowen nodded and said you made your point agent furey i did it slipped my mind that you were the one who predicted rocky would use the yacht transport i apologize kate shrugged maybe he wasnt so bad after all forget it she said its not important whats important is that we nail the perps here and in europe right bowen looked doubtful he said cant say i give much of a shit what happens in europe but please dont tell any of those liaison officer friends of yours i said so it would be bad for diplomatic relations i wouldnt dream of telling any of them anything i wasnt supposed to she said aware of how earnest she sounded but wondering if bowen still harbored any suspicions about a relationship with the dutchman she took another lifethreatening drag on her doral and added nevertheless the assistant director has recently gone on record to say that he believes helping the europeans win their war on drugs may be one way of helping us to win ours this was news to bowen he did huh it was in the fbi foreign intelligence coverage folder last month bowen smiled dismissively oh that and in response there was a miami sac memo presley willard wrote to the director just a couple of weeks ago assuring him that miami general investigations would do everything it could to support this initiative bowen who had no knowledge of this memo closed his eyes briefly and said i remember that he swallowed some of his coke and began to crunch on a piece of ice as if it were peanut brittle it was her turn to wince now i take your point kate then as i see it we need to keep the narcotics under surveillance for the duration of the voyage its no good just waving goodbye to the yacht transport when they exit port everglades kate pointed out the window that boat should never leave our sight which means we have to book a boat of our own aboard the same transport crewed by two fbi agents in radio contact with a us navy submarine and when we cross the atlantic the british and the french navies too while were aboard the transport it will give us a chance to get a closer look at rockys boat which so far weve been unable to do moreover we can keep a close eye on things just in case they try to unload the dope while theyre still at sea maybe even transfer it to another boat on the same transport just to put us off the scent bowen who hadnt thought of that swallowed the icy shards and pulled a face this idea of yours it sounds expensive number one where are you going to get a suitable boat and number two whos going to pay the costs of transportation you heard how much it costs ninety thousand dollars i cant see the sac authorizing that level of expenditure kate smiled and said as a matter of fact ive found a boat or rather sam brockmans found me one seems like the coast guard boarded an abandoned boat off key west the other day and found it full of dope eventually of course it will go into government auction but right now its moored in miami and available for a covert operation the coast guard were planning something themselves only it fell through and now theyre offering it to us its ideal for our purposes sir eightyfour feet long twentytwo knot cruising and all stateoftheart facilities im talking about a really luxurious yacht here as for the money well ive an idea where we can get that too bowen said youre going to suggest that latest tranche of gulf stream money arent you operation gulf stream had been another undercover miami bureau op in the early s mounted against one of the biggest moneylaundering machines in florida a miami gold and jewelry business run by one of the larger colombian cartels had laundered millions of dollars through the bank of credit and commerce international shut down by the bank of england in weeks before bccis collapse the jewelry business had withdrawn large sums of cash and placed them in safety deposit boxes throughout the state even now several years afterward boxes full of cash were being discovered by bowens own department the latest just a few days ago in a liberty city bank containing british pounds sterling kate shrugged and said why not its not as if its even been entered in the report yet itll have to be accounted for kate said sure eventually whats a british pound worth these days about a dollar fifty kate pursed her lips and looked thoughtful worth of that versus the european street value of a keys of coke id say that was money well spent and i suppose youre going to tell me that youre the best person to handle this little operation sure why not well for one thing youve never worked undercover before i was a pretty good actress in high school i dont doubt it kate said undercovers just about being a good liar how difficult can that be men do it all the time and for another youre a woman is that an objection or merely an informed guess sir now dont go bristling like a hairbrush kate its just my impression that its mostly men who crew and captain these motor yachts kate took a long drag of her cigarette with eyes narrowed against the smoke and the sexual prejudice since when did the captain of a boat have to be a man women had sailed solo around the world there had been female pirates these days there were even a couple of female admirals in the us navy kent bowen on the other hand didnt look like he could have captained a chair around his own desk as a matter of fact she said acidly it so happens that one of the other vessels booked onto the syt transport this march is captained and crewed entirely by women bowen grinned what are they amazons or something boats owned by jade films jade films the porno people kate made a performance out of looking surprised she said youve heard of them bowen shook his head casually there was something in newsweek about them i think to do with the guys who work in the sex industry i read that article she said it was a good piece but i dont think i remember anything about jade films in there oh come on kate said bowen uncomfortably im not that kind of guy she thought none of them were not until you got a look at the cable company account and then it was just a bit of harmless fun bowen said what takes them across the atlantic anyway the cannes film festival cannes its in spain she said knowing full well that cannes was actually in the south of france i know where it is cannes thats kind of like the oscars isnt it only classier bowen sniggered with jade films in attendance i hardly think so in attendance but not in competition for the palme dor cannes is a marketplace for just about anyone whos involved in the movie industry and that includes people like jade films anyway the point im making here is that this is a foot twin screw diesel yacht captained and crewed entirely by women twin screw huh smirked bowen kate smiled patiently waiting for the ribald punch line she felt certain was coming he said would they be identical twins or just sisters kate kept on smiling as bowen laughed his beavis and butthead laugh trying her damnedest to look amused crushing out her cigarette like she was pinching him hard kate let her eyes drift sideways as if they were slipping off bowens oleaginous personality but only he could ok putting her plan in front of presley willard the miami bureaus special agent in charge be nice she told herself dont piss him off maybe he is an asshole but you dont have to stick the toe of your shoe in there be accommodating this is the dork who could greenlight a free trip across to europe to some real adventure howd you find out about that anyway he asked jade films going on the transport same way we found out about rockys boat weve been intercepting all syts calls i thought we ought to know about some of the other people who are going look sir you yourself said we have to move fast march is just around the corner and theres only so much space left aboard the transport if we leave this too long it will be nothing other than a great idea that might or might not have worked out for us bowen stood up and went over to the sittingroom window to the south of the bridge was port everglades the deepest port in florida formerly known as mabel lakes it had been a shallow marsh in the wide section of the florida east coast canal until president calvin coolidge threw a switch that was supposed to detonate an explosion to open the inlet except that the longdistance switch from washington didnt work and someone had to set off the explosion locally another great idea that didnt work ordinarily bowen was suspicious of good ideas but he had to admit kates idea about getting their own boat aboard the syt transport was a good one out in the harbor bowen could see as many kinds of boat as there were varieties of fish military ships coast guard and police boats island freighters from the caribbean tugs and tankers cruise ships full of holidaymakers wondering if they were going to get mugged in miami sailboats schooners barges and motor yachts everything but a guy floating in a barrel the scent of perfume made him turn around kate was standing a foot or so behind his shoulder and handing him a pair of binoculars he lifted them to his eyes and let her describe the port facilities going anticlockwise youve got passenger and cargo terminals thats where our syt ship departs from then the us customs building gasoline storage tanks this is the biggest gas station in the south did you know that kate was letting him know that she knew the port it was her way of reminding him that she knew boats and that she was ideally qualified for the operation she had outlined those four red and white chimneys you can see them for miles out to sea yachtsmen use them as navigation aids they belong to the florida power and light company coming left of there youve got port administration the world trade center and more cargo terminals coming further back round to us again and thats the naval surface warfare center bowen was thinking she smells as good as she looks it might be fun to go undercover with kate bestlooking girl in the miami bureau the two of them aboard a luxury yacht together he might even get lucky with her hadnt he always suspected that she had a soft spot for him that was why she gave him such a hard time because she was trying to disguise the fact that in reality she was powerfully attracted to him why else would anyone speak to their boss the way she spoke to him and it wouldnt be like theyd actually have to do very much on the boat as she herself had said it was just a question of keeping a close eye on rockys boat and maintaining radio contact with a navy submarine there was even a sub in port what could go wrong kate said im not exactly sure what the sub is called but the aircraft carrier is the uss theodore roosevelt oh yes and up on the point there thats a restaurant owned by burt reynolds burt reynolds really kate grimaced as bowen eagerly tried to get a better focus on the missionstyle building that housed the restaurant he was such a putz such a tourist that it might have been only yesterday hed left kansas burt reynolds he repeated dumbly actually she admitted im not sure if its still owned by him not since he filed for bankruptcy anyway you know back in the seventies he was just about my favorite movie actor kates grimace became even more pronounced jesus that clinched it she was with the one guy in the whole world who enjoyed smokey and the bandit bowen said you know i think i can probably persuade presley that this is a good idea he handed back the binoculars great you said two crew just two any undercover mission is not without its dangers he said pompously but its just possible that we might also have some fun along the way kate swallowed we bowen glanced at his cheap sports watch why dont we go to burts place and discuss it over lunch he said burts place she wondered if bowen hadnt heard what she had said about the bankruptcy its still open isnt it yeah ok if you really want to said kate wondering if there was some kind of opposite for the saying every cloud has a silver lining in bowens jimmy driving toward a dock and the restaurant she managed to buoy herself up with the thought that she might be able to deflect him put him off the whole idea of coming along perhaps she could paint a picture of a transatlantic crossing that was a wave or two higher than gericaults great masterpiece the raft of the medusa a few wellchosen images over lunch that might scare the landlubbing shit out of him by the time they reached burt jacks kate was on an even keel again and paid little or no attention to a news report on the radio about an air traffic controllers strike even if she had listened more carefully she would have had no reason to think the strike would last more than a couple of days nor to suppose that it would have implications for the march voyage of syts semisubmersible vessel the grand duke there was only one thing on her mind now and it was that she somehow had to put kent bowen off a transatlantic voyage without jeopardizing his backing for the whole operation entering the restaurant she got ready to tell her boss a story that would make the storm in the caine mutiny look like another pleasant valley sunday chapter twelve inspired by jimmy figaros purchase of a sculpture for his office tony nudelli bought a bronze for his poolhouse a lifesize marilyn monroe as she had appeared in the seven year itch her white skirts frozen voluminously as she stood over the subway vent nice said al real classy glad you like it said nudelli cost me a fuckin fortune and then some the refinements i had done were almost as much as the original bronze al frowned and then looked a little more closely at marilyn the halterneck dress the big breasts the same look of ecstatic delight on her dippy blonde face she looked exactly the way he remembered her from the movie right down to the red polish on her toenails finally admitting defeat he said ok i give up i cant see no difference exactly what were these refinements you had done nudelli grinned take a look under her dress he suggested youre kidding but al bent down peeked between marilyns legs and let out a loud guffaw the white panties she had been wearing in the movie were gone and what was there instead looked as realistic as if shed been a table dancer flashing her pussy in your face in return for a bill underneath her garter right down to the gash in the pubic hair still laughing al said now thats what i call a conversation piece i thought so shes beautiful tony just beautiful im thinkin of having her up on some kind of table it cant be this one shes too heavy for glass but i want to be able to look at that trim now and then whenever the fancy takes me he lit a cigar and puffed it happily watching al as he squatted down to take another closer look can i touch her pussy be my guest al reached up and pressed the palm of his hand over marilyns private parts laughing like a kid he said i never thought id get to give marilyn monroe some index finger you and bobby kennedy not forgetting jack he sang happy birthday mister president she looks like shes enjoying it al ive always known how to please a woman yknow its all in the wrist action man this feels good who says modern art dont mean nuthin not me you wont hear me complaining for tonys benefit al sniffed his forefinger experimentally each nostril vacuuming along its hairy knuckled length as if it had been the choicest cigar from tonys rosewood humidor he said too bad you couldnt get it made scratch n sniff im workin on it nudelli waved his cohiba at the seat in front of him sit down al weve got some business to discuss i figured this longitude and latitude that delano gave you i had the guys on my boat look it up on their charts seems like its a spot northwest of the azores along the midatlantic shelf anyway i fixed everything just like delano wanted a freighter out of naples is gonna meet you at this nautical position shes the ercolano carrying break bulk cargo loose items like spools of wire lumber steel beams shit thats too large to be containerized but mostly italian marble for the luxury bathrooms and gourmet kitchens of america ill come back to that in a minute the ercolanos agent in naples is a company called agrigento ive done business with them before and theyre percent reliable for our purposes the captains been told to expect to find a vessel in distress at that position and to pick up a passenger and cargo hes going to hide the money in a marble sarcophagus thats on its way to some rich dead guy in savannah al nodded got it also youll note i said passenger not plural but singular meaning your individual ass al tony puffed the cigar and looked momentarily uncertain of something its up to you how you do it pal but i dont want delano comin back here to miami with the money the long and the short and the inbetween of it is that i want him dead i figure youll need him alive only as long as it takes for you to make the rendezvous with the ercolano if i was you id let him have it before you get on the ercolano and then sink the yacht like he planned only with his dead sonofabitch body still on board tony paused and studied als big open face for a moment aware that al had got to know delano reasonably well on the voyage from costa rica he studied the redhot gray end of the cigar for a moment feeling the heat on his cheek and said you gotta problem with any of that al shook his head no problem at all delanos got a smart mouth on the way back from cr he was breakin my balls about this nthat there were a couple of times when i felt like popping him right then and there you know what i told him i told him i was surprised someone didnt grease him while he was still in homestead al shook his head bitterly sgonna get worse too im sure of it what do you mean him fuckin with me like for instance this air traffic controllers strike tony said dont remind me i got to take the train to new york because of those fuckers countrys going to shit unfortunately theres no train to europe it seems as if a lot of boat owners who want to get over the atlantic this spring have decided to beat the strike and travel with their boats so so delano made the booking with syt describing himself as the owner and me as the crew hes gonna be giving me orders all the time breakin my balls like im the hired help tony tried not to laugh he said just remember something al with the smart mouth comes an even smarter brain dont forget hes a jew and jews are clever dont make the same mistake as willy one eye dont underestimate that kike al nodded impatiently yeah yeah and dont let yourself get needled there may be a reason behind it so be cool and turn the other cheek two things you gotta bear in mind if he starts riding you al one when this is all over you get to waste his smart ass and two you get to keep his share of the money that should make your cross easier to bear huh what do you say to that al said yeah youre right thanks tony one more thing watch out that its not you who gets doublecrossed the atlantic is a big place al and recent history teaches us that a lot can go wrong in an ocean youre telling me said al that kid i told you if it does nudelli puffed out a cloud of smoke and watched it hang in the air between them as if considering the size of the threat he wished to convey to the other man the smoke slowly drifted up marilyns white bronze skirt adding an infernal touch to her famous pose hed actually met marilyn once not long before she died when she was hanging around with sam giancana a nice girl a shame what had happened to her only it hadnt been sam whod helped hasten her death he said if it does go wrong you can depend on this that i can be as cruel as any of them fuckin kennedys joe included they were never a close family the way dave looked at it they were never a family at all it was the usual stuff a father who drank that was the russian in him a mother who lit out that was the irish in her and his sister with an unwanted pregnancy and a boyfriend who didnt marry her well that was hardly nicks fault nick rosen would probably have married lisa if someone hadnt cut his throat first by the time dave was twenty hed more or less given up on them all with the occasional exception of lisa not that hed really been much help there either just making it through life on his own had seemed challenge enough without having to shoulder the badly packed luggage of their problems as well but at least hed tried to help her once maybe now after five years it was time to try again maybe that was how he found himself driving over to her dismally suburban twobedroom bungalow off hallandale beach boulevard a couple of weeks after he got back from cr dave got out of the miata carrying his nike sports bag and walked up the path he knocked on the warped wooden door and a big dog started to bark inside the house he waited it wasnt yet midday a stupid time to go visiting she might have been out working except that the drapes were pulled and there was an old and battered red mustang parked on the drive a car that had once been his how could she have let it get that badly rusted he knocked again this time when the dog barked he heard someone curse the animal and after a minute or two the door creaked open and there gathering a thin kimonostyle robe around her overweight naked body stood lisa older than he remembered well of course she was but harder too as if life hadnt been especially kind to her maybe if nick hadnt died it would have been different but the hell with that he told himself he was the one whod spent the last five years behind bars and had she thought to come and visit him to do more than write a couple of badly spelt letters she had not dave my god she said obviously flustered my my youre out hello lisa an impossibly large dog came to the door nudging her behind with a muzzle the size of a shoebox and growling quietly it looked like a dobermann that snacked on chocolate chip steroids she pushed the dog back indoors and said its just my kid brother dave wasnt sure if she was talking to the dog or to someone else in the house he had a glimpse of a dingy interior behind her and his keen eyes took in an ancientlooking tv a grimy motheaten sofa a table with a halfempty bottle of bourbon and next to the bottle looking like recent and incongruous arrivals two new bills he said i wasnt sure if id find you in she shrugged back at him still trying to find a smile when it came it looked uncomfortable well here i am glancing back over her shoulder she added you should have called i was in the general area he lied passing through so i thought id stop say hello see how you were only its a little inconvenient right now dave thought he guessed what he had disturbed new boyfriend lisa smiled thinly and nodded with little more conviction yeah thats good we were a sheepish look filled in the blanks id be embarrassed to let you in my underwear is all over the floor dave grinned and said same old lisa she was looking past him now around the neighborhood hey less of the old lisa will ya im only five years older than you that was right he remembered now she had been just his age now when he went inside homestead dave was about to pick up on that but then let it go he wasnt here to reproach her but to help he said i brought you a present he handed over the bag inside were two parcels each containing of the grand plus interest jimmy figaro had given him actually theres one for mom as well why thank you dave she said and hesitantly brushed his hair with her hand as she touched him his nostrils detected a sweet cloying smell that for some reason made him start thinking of babies it was on her hands a kind of sheen just promise me that youll only open it when youre alone he said sure ok she frowned and laughed at the same time whaddya do rob a bank or something not yet look why dont you come back in about an hour and we can talk im not much of a cook but hey what the hell you never complained when you were a kid and big sis fixed your dinner now he remembered the smell it was baby oil johnsons baby oil only lisa had never had her baby it had been stillborn and what with the two cnotes and the anonymous boyfriend back in the bedroom an unpleasant thought began to strut its way along the sidewalk of daves imagination whaddya say little brother be like the old days it was daves turn to be evasive now id like to lisa really i would but im on a pretty tight schedule there was no need for him to say anything he told himself it wasnt his right to do so whatever family obligation hed had hed fulfilled hadnt he fifty thousand dollars a head was a lot of payback for not much of an upbringing now he just wanted to get the hell away from there forcing a smile that was the equal of the pinched nerve that was lisas own dave backed toward his car he said another time huh sure honey but call first ok she told him like he was some john ill do that he jumped into the open car and started the engine nice car she said are you sure you didnt rob a bank not yet he repeated and waving stiffly drove off trying not to floor the gas pedal and look like he was suddenly desperate to be away from her and at the same time ashamed ashamed for what he felt he was just another john in his sisters life giving her money and then going away again his own sister his own sister kate furey was giving kent bowen a tour of the boat the carrera was moored alongside dozens of other yachts on fort lauderdales intercoastal waterway and a stones throw from rjs landing one of the dockside areas better restaurants bowen had already suggested lunching there but kate had told him they had too much to do getting him up to speed with the lexicon of yachts and their equipment she had already figured out a way around his lack of boating knowledge but she wanted to punish him a little for not being scared off with all her best stories about squalls and seasickness a water taxi slipped by with a couple dressed up to get married they waved and from the sunny skylounge aft deck where he and kate were standing bowen waved back you havent been listening to a word ive said sure i have said bowen unconvinced kate pointed toward the davits above their heads she said ok what are those you mean those things holding up the boat kate made an inhuman noise that sounded like the wrong answer button on a tv game show incorrect that isnt a boat its a tender as in tender is the night but dont get any ideas and the tender is attached to what a crane i guess kate made the noise again she said davits those are davits dammit look sir kent this isnt going to work unless you become a little more familiar with the right names for things you wont thank god have to try and sail this boat but the chances are youll have to talk about her with people from other boats you know like youre proud of her and by the way those shoes youre wearing theyll have to go bowen glanced down at his air nikes whats wrong with them kate shook her head firmly and said theyre not proper boat shoes thats whats wrong with them a real boatman wouldnt be seen dead in those things but we can fix that we can stop off somewhere along las olas on our way down to the port theres bound to be a mans shop or a chandlers somewhere on the boulevard docksiders are best leather uppers flat rubber soles at least you can look the part even if you screw up on the glossary kate walked through a glass doorway and into the salon where a large and extremely comfortable leather couch arranged aft to port faced an enormous tv a smaller sofa and narrow builtin counter with maple wood cabinets lined the starboard side of the salon the arrangement of furnishings prompted kate to ask bowen yet another question she pointed at a circular sixplace dining table that was located forward of where they were now standing am i pointing to port or to starboard bowen thought for a moment impatiently kate started to click her fingers at him he said port cmon its got to come faster than that like the difference between your right and your left he followed her through the salon casting a look of regret in the direction of the inch tv he wished he could fetch himself an icecold corona from the refrigerator and go and watch the playoff game on the tv in his stateroom dragging his fingers across the satinfinished wood he said with just a hint of sarcasm so whats this part of the boat called in that mchales navy glossary of yours the dining room ask a dumb question they climbed a few thickly carpeted steps hey swell kitchen remarked bowen look at this kate made the wronganswer noise again its the galley she said bowen sighed as in slaves right jesus im never going to remember all this shit well it probably wont matter that much i already thought of a way to explain your ignorance you did huh bowen contained his momentary irritation she went on for the purposes of syts insurance cover i was obliged to describe you as the boat owner and me as the captain a lot of owners have decided to travel with their boats because of the air traffic controllers strike it looks as if its going to drag on for a while so under the circumstances it wont seem that unusual you coming along on the voyage i cant see how that helps said bowen why should the owner know any less than the crew kate smiled for a lot of yacht owners a luxury yacht is just a floating den another expensive toy believe me its not uncommon for these guys to know jack shit about their own boats she was enjoying this so its possible your complete and total ignorance wont be noticed ok bowen looked around with a proprietorial air you know i always did kind of fancy owning one of these things i also took the liberty of inviting sam brockman to join our crew and make up the numbers sam brockman bowen couldnt help but look disappointed from the us coast guard kate noted the look on his face and smiled coast guard that was a laugh more like bodyguard just in case bowen was thinking of trying anything when they were at sea well think about it it would have looked odd with just me crewing said kate and after all it is his departments boat at least until it goes up for auction were going to pick him up at the lake mabel station on our way down to syts cargo terminal bowen tried to feel positive about sam brockmans imminent arrival on board im sure its a good idea especially with all his um nautical knowledge but kate hadnt finished that does of course mean that when were in company we ought not to be too familiar with each other ill call you sir as usual everyonell assume youre just another miami plutocrat with more money than sense sir ive no problem with any of that kate bowen was already thinking of a way to exploit his new status as a rich boat owner you know what im going to find a bathroom head sir for a moment bowen couldnt believe his luck i beg your pardon on board ship sir we call the bathroom the head oh the head whatever well thats where im headed anyway he laughed now he had thought of a way then im going to find me a cold beer and like any convincing plutocrat with more money than sense im going to put my feet up for a while and im going to watch the big game on tv we really ought to finish our tour of the boat sir advised kate theres still a lot you should know about the engines the communications system the ships computers bowen shook his head kate the only thing i want to see right now is the chiefs taking the dolphins apart noting kates expression he added im from kansas remember he walked back down the steps let me know when were underway captain ill be in my quarters kate watched him go mouthing a silent asshole at bowens back a second or two later she had the satisfaction of hearing him fall down the circular stair connecting the midship accommodations deck with the formal salon and dining room asshole she said and climbed the portside companionway to the wheelhouse skylounge where she began to get to grips with the carreras computerbased dynamic reporting system she was almost disappointed to discover how easy it would be to sail the boat with its exhaustive online diagnostic testing and troubleshooting the carrera was so well equipped that even bowen could have piloted it and she wished that the part of her mission in which she was actually obliged to sail the boat could have lasted longer than the few minutes it would take to cruise down to port everglades kate started the engines and then went out on deck to pull up fenders she might have asked bowen for help except for the inevitable joke that it would have produced now kate you dont have to worry about fending me off kates lip wrinkled with distaste not any more she said and began to pull on a rope she wished had been knotted around bowens stupid neck chapter thirteen jack jellicoe master of the grand duke stood on the bridge wing and surveyed the scene below him with mounting distaste it was bad enough that he was obliged to transport these expensive toys across the atlantic if theyd bought proper yachts with sails in the first place they might have made the crossing unaided it was bad enough that he had to have contact with their overpaid and underqualified captains most of them didnt know a fart from a focsle it was bad enough to learn that some of the obscenely rich bastards who owned the floating tupperware now being sailed onto his ship would be coming along on the voyage but to be told by his own shipping agent that their owners captains and crews were to be allowed free access to their vessels during the voyage was more than the tall englishman could stomach let me get this straight mister sedeno he said crisply addressing the smaller bespectacled man standing beside him you expect me to sail across the atlantic one of the most hazardous oceans in the world to safely deliver million worth of waterproof caravans and motor homes not to mention their forbes five hundred owners while at the same time permitting these same flatfooted cretins to clamber about my ship in all weathers without any of them falling overboard and drowning themselves come on jack sedeno said wearily thats all bullshit we both know that it wont be particularly hazardous going via the canary islands is not a route in which youll encounter all weathers as you say jellicoe stared off to starboard as if searching the dockside for a better argument well what about the ships insurers what do they have to say about it we are only responsible for each vessel not for the supernumeraries who come aboard them they have made their own personal insurance arrangements jellicoe thought for a moment his long bony jaw quivering as he racked his brain for yet one more objection batteries he said triumphantly ships batteries what about them only this that if they go on board their yachts where will they get their power eh a small grin of satisfaction appeared on his lean bearded face tell me that if you can without running engines their batteries will be flat in no time and id like to see the multimillionaire who can do without his microwave lobster dinner and the tv to watch while hes stuffing it down his neck sedeno shrugged many of them have solar power panels while others need only run their engines in neutral to charge up their batteries this can be organized in rotation so as to minimize any fire risk no this is not a problem jellicoe twitched visibly next thing youll be asking me to organize a game of quoits on deck im the master of a cargo ship not a cruise captain what am i supposed to do with them ive enough to do with the running of this ship without the effort of being nice jack jack surely thats not much of an effort argued sedeno one of the other two officers who were on the bridge laughed out loud and jellicoe looked around angrily like himself they were dressed in the tropical uniform of the british merchant navy white shoes white socks white shorts white shirts with epaulettes and white cap something amusing you twoo he asked his second officer no sir then get on with your work i shall of course expect visual bearings for position before we leave port not the radar range and bearings therell be none of that kind of slackness on this ship dyou hear yes sir and threeo i shall want you to execute a full stowaway search before we sail on every one of those picnic trays called yachts there are seventeen of them sir protested the ships third officer im sure i dont have to remind you three that a stowaway search is normal shipping practice on leaving port i shall want a signature to that effect from every supernumo yacht captain someone looking for me the voice belonged to a tall blonde amazon of a woman dressed in a pink ralph lauren shirt and shorts jellicoe wheeled around fiercely like cats and alcohol women were never allowed on jellicoes bridge she said im rachel dana captain of the jade are you indeed jellicoe caught sedenos eye and stretched his face into a smile rachel pointed to the largest yacht nearest the bridge jellicoe followed the line of her wellmuscled tanned forearm and a long pink fingernail very handsome he allowed isnt she just she was built in to abs al and ams classification jellicoe tried to look impressed although he hadnt the faintest idea of what any of this meant she said normally we run with a crew of about ten but for the purposes of this voyage were down to just three really and how do the urn how do the men find having a woman as ships captain you noticed that huh rachel shook her head there are no male crew on the jade just us girls were an entirely female crew you might call it the owners little conceit like charlies angels outside the pages of homer i never heard of such a thing jellicoe said brusquely well well anyway i thought id better come and introduce myself and i couldnt help but overhear what you were saying just now is there a problem jack said sedeno is there a problem jellicoe said nothing if you still object to all these supernumeraries i can always sign the way bills myself sedeno added did i say i had a problem with them i was merely doing what any responsible captain would do under the circumstances i was voicing all the potential safety concerns supernumeraries eh said rachel thats what you call us passengers right jellicoe found himself both attracted to and irritated by the woman in pink women aboard a merchant ship were always a distraction especially when they were goodlooking women like this one he saw that his officers had already noticed the outline of rachel danas nipples on her cotton polo shirt not to mention the large and thrusting breasts thats right said sedeno you see we cant call you passengers because that would mean wed have to conform to a different set of shipping regulations wed have to do things like have a doctor aboard instead of making do with the ships carpenter he laughed at his own little joke so we call you supernumeraries or supernumos for short his grin widened as he smoothly added a compliment it looks like we got the super part right if youre anything to go by captain dana will you be joining us on the voyage she asked coolly im afraid not business here in fort lauderdale prevents me sedeno extended a hairy hand and said felipe sedeno maam at your service im the shipping agent and this is the ships master captain jellicoe pleased to meet you this is such a fascinating ship you have here captain is it jellicoe advanced to the window of the bridge towing rachel dana in his wake and stared gloomily down at the sculpted almost sensuous flowing shape of the jade its not much more than a glorified car ferry no different from all the other roro freighters that come and go in this port roro merchant shipping term cargo that can be rolled on and rolled off i suppose were rather more floflo if you follow me anyway beautys not our strong suit we leave that kind of thing to our customers mistaking jellicoes baleful gaze as admiration of her ship rachel dana asked him if he would like to see round the jade thank you but some other time he said i have business on deck jellicoe turned to the second officer wheres the chief the second officer pointed outside supervising the cargo loading he said in a whereelsewouldhebe tone jellicoe replaced his cap you have the bridge mister niven ill be on deck yes sir im afraid youll find us much less formal on the jade she said oh were not so very formal you know jellicoe glanced warily in the direction of his two officers as if defying their contradiction well id better be getting along myself announced captain dana and she followed jellicoe out of the bridge and onto the narrow walkway that led along the twentyfoothigh dock wall that was the grand dukes starboard side under the watchful eye of a short balding officer wearing the same tropical gear as jellicoe an assortment of stevedores and yachts crewmen were drawing an foot luxury sportfisher toward the stern of the jade by means of two pairs of headlines that were attached to the sportfishers bows watch that bleedin bow pulpit roared the chief in a broad cockney accent youll have it through her arse dyou hear he averted his eyes as the pulpit stopped a couple of inches short of the jades stern dozy bugger he muttered and then sighed wearily as he saw jellicoe advancing on him with captain dana following on behind the chief said its all right everythings under control no damage done im very glad to hear it said dana id hate to get this voyage started with a lawsuit against your company for negligent cargo handling jellicoe looked around and shook his head already she was confirming his worst fears for the crossing the chief laughed wryly and jerked a grimy thumb at one of the port stevedores might help if some of these dozy buggers could speak english this bloody city gets more like havana every time we dock dont tell us said rachel climbing onto the jades coachroof where a sunpad big enough for half a dozen sunbathers was located tell that bastard castro when she had gone the chief frowned and said whats up with her jellicoe sighed loudly just get on with it bert he said ill be in my cabin all right for some grumbled the chief then scowled at the stevedore standing on the sportfishers deck an orange fender the size of an armchair lying uselessly at his feet hoi you yelled bert are you going to sit on that bloody fender or put it over the side like youre supposed to the man looked up at bert and said in spanish no comprendo mas despacio por favor you what a barechested dave delano came quickly out of the wheelhouse slid down the roof onto the deck and while the stevedore was still debating the purpose of the fender and the meaning of the chiefs words picked it off the deck and lowered it over the starboard side bert waved and said bit more ok thats enough tie it off dave wiped his forehead and said thanks a lot no bother said bert bloody hell whats up your bloody stomach thats whats up dave glanced at his own stomach and said what about it just look at it grinned bert its like a bloody washboard look at mine he jerked his chin down at the large belly straining at the waistband of his white shorts its like having an extra limb wrapped around you in case of an emergency he laughed and slapped his belly hard with the flat of his hand a lot of beer went into that here i spose youve got one of them abdomenizers have you what a country this is for people worrying about their bellies what goes in them and what they look like every time i turn on the tv theres some bastard trying to sell you a flat stomach well i dont spose ill ever have one of those again certainly not like yours mate abdomenizer or not dave grinned i dont have an abdomenizer he said well how dyou do it then i mean get the old sixpack stomach you have to be able to isolate the muscles when you exercise them said dave he might have added that the best way to do that was to isolate the man at the same time like maybe keep him in prison for five years homestead was full of guys with torsos that looked like theyd been drawn in an anatomy class both men looked around as one of the pink ladies from the jade came up on deck and walked off toward the bow of the ship generously hipped she looked even more amazonian than her captain bert grinned wolfishly and said its not bellies with women is it its their bottoms they worry about not that theres anything wrong with her butt but for all i know the buttockizer already exists to give women smaller butts as the amazon finally disappeared dave shook his head and said now why would anyone want to do a thing like that bert laughed yeah he said whod want to do that eh dave and al watched as a diver came up from under the juarista having made sure that she was safely secured to the special support welded to the floating dock floor lashed tightly to the dock wall and carefully fendered against the boats to starboard and to stern it was a snug fit and the boat looked as immovable as if shed been mounted on a trailer and parked on a hard deck naturally you brought scuba gear al said sceptically naturally al frowned surprised at the apparent extent of daves efficiency he said just dont expect me to go down takin a baths the only time i go in the water dave sniffed the air loudly he said not so as youd notice wiseguy i suppose you noticed how boxed in we are here i thought you said we were going to try and be at the back of the boat so as we could make a clean getaway you go where that man and his clipboard tell you a computer figures out all the positions according to the length and breadth of your hull it would have looked kind of odd us going up against the computer dont you think al said nothing dave said coolly its like i told you already when were ready to rumble well just steal the boat thats nearest to the stern of the ship thats what we call the back of the boat you know if youre going to pretend to be a boat captain it would help if you get a handle on the way we talk about this shit the only thing thats going to get a handle on it is your fuckin head wiseguy relax will you al the only things not under control round here is your temper take my word for it were cool i sure hope so tony dont appreciate hearing about the unexpected i gotta tell him anything that happens out of the ordinary dave shook his head forget it al its radio silence from now on like were in a submarine with clark gable and some japs are trying to get a sonar fix to drop a depth charge on our ass you give tony the broadcast news on our progress and i guarantee there are sixteen other boats in this mans navy who will pick it up on their radios the same goes for your cellular phone dave tossed him a quarter you want to tell tony something then i suggest you go ashore now before we set sail and use a pay phone because on this ship its silent running understand al glared at him dave said look ive got this all figured out all the angles are in our control about the only thing that can go wrong here is that youll fuck it up with this tony dont appreciate routine whats got to happen here is that you and i have to get along and trust each other so that when the time comes to make the score were working as a team dave shrugged and if the unexpected does happen well improvise flexibility is the key to our success here steady can go to random at any time from our side you and me al were covered outside of that weve got the sea weve got the weather and weve got other people all of which adds up to quite a lot thats random we have to appreciate that and be ready for it ok ok now why dont you and i do something constructive like maybe take a little stroll around and acquaint ourselves with the layout of this oceangoing marina good idea and try to look a little more user friendly and less like an argument for genetic engineering got our story straight i think so youre some financial hotshot right right and a big motorracing enthusiast so were on our way to monte carlo for the grand prix they got down there after which were heading to cap dantibes in the south of france where youve rented a house for the summer got some business associates from london coming down to join you there maybe take in another couple of races while youre in europe depending on how the business goes ok what kind of financial hot shot asked dave commodities but im supposed to be a little vague about this right right if anyone asks you just say its some kind of metal maybe copper and leave it at that they wont expect you to know any more dave moved toward the gangway and then turned back he said one more thing the coast guard and customs people will board us when were ready to sail so just so as i know whered you stash the alamo they got enough to worry about whats comin into miami without giving much of a fuck whats going out true but id still like to know its in the fishbox under a shitload of ice and you can take it from me improvisation wont ever come into it gunwise we are covered against every eventuality steady random whatever the world may throw at us dave had never told tony or al the names of the boats that would be carrying the money it was understood that this was daves best guarantee of trust between himself and tony and even now as dave and al picked their way along the starboard side of the ship toward the smokestacks in the stern al saw him give no sign which of the boats now loaded and lashed within the high walls of the grand dukes extraordinary hull were carrying cash bound for russia and the purchase of a whole bank ya see em asked al the boats our boats all three just like i said yeah which ones where are they when were at sea ill tell you but not before al laughed bitterly get along and trust each other he said like fuck you wouldnt want me to make those guys feel selfconscious now would you pointing them out like some kind of tourist attraction hey look there are the boats that were going to rip off dave tuttutted and shook his head i bet theyre nervous enough as it is besides these are heavy guys al theyve probably got a fishbox just like ours let em relax think theyre on a summer cruise better for us better for them they turned as a white boat with an angled red racing stripe came alongside the duke it was flying the stars and stripes in contrast to the ships british red ensign customs uhuh said dave coast guard we must be getting ready to leave port dave glanced at his watch it was five oclock in the afternoon and it had taken the best part of a day to float the dukes peculiar cargo on board a couple of seconds later they heard an announcement over the ships tannoy in the unmistakable voice of the chief officer crew to close all hatches and stow all gear al smacked his lips im goin back to the boat to make myself a sandwich want one no thanks ill be along in a few minutes im going to the stern to take a look at our getaway boat see what weve drawn in the lottery but dave had another mission in mind of necessity he had lied to al to reassure him al was enough of a pain in the ass already without alarming him any further but now he wanted to reassure himself that the last information he had received from einstein gergiev had been correct and that the boats were indeed on board the duke he already knew that none of them was on the starboard side so he waited until al was out of sight before walking round to the port side of the ship all the time turning over in his mind the names of the three boats he was looking for like a mantra his heart gave a leap as he spotted the first boat then the second and then the third just like hed been told he could hardly believe it but the three boats carrying the money were in a line along the dukes port wall and like the duke they were all flying the red ensign which meant that they were registered in the british commonwealth somewhere like bermuda antigua gibraltar or the british virgin islands there was a foot raised pilothouse cockpit motor yacht called the beagle a foot burger cruiser called the claudia cardinale and a foot tripledecker custom hatteras called baby doc everything was just as hed been told dave still couldnt get over the last boat even back in miami when hed been given the three names he had thought baby doc was hardly a name to have on a boat you were likely to sail anywhere near haiti after years of dictatorship by the duvalier family papa doc and then his son baby the locals would probably have torched it on the quayside none of the crewmen of the three boats looked particularly russian not that dave had expected them to they did look very tough of that there was no doubt one guy sunbathing on the roof of the beagle was built like a wrestler while a black guy tying off a length of rope aboard the claudia cardinale had arms that were the size of daves legs more than ever dave realized that the success of his plan depended on the element of surprise and not much else halfway across the atlantic he hoped the opposition would be less on its guard than they looked now even with the customs and coast guard around he was pretty sure that one of the guys on the baby doc was carrying a gun underneath his shirt dave didnt much care for the idea of a firefight with these characters guns had never been his thing he preferred to shoot with his mouth go to stations the voice on the tannoy ordered dave thought that was probably a good idea before any of them noticed him watching back at the juarista dave could just about see al through the smoked glass of the galley window he stepped onto the flybridge and found himself almost face to face with a girl on the bridge of the ship to port of him she looked around thirty with shoulderlength brown hair that belonged in an expensive shampoo commercial and eyes that made the sky look as gray as the aircraft carrier moored outside the ports main turning basin stretched out on a big white leather sofa on the back of the bridge she was the kind of woman dave had met many times lying on the bunk in his cell in homestead but had only ever seen in the glossy magazines hi there he said affably expecting shed be too snooty to reply hi she didnt say any more than that but her eyes stayed on him as if they didnt mind what they saw dave looked quickly up and down her boat and then nodded appreciatively she was probably married to some company chief executive old enough to be her father he said nicelooking boat fast too id say she rides as flat as a railroad car said kate the carrera huh he said reading the name on the side of the bridge ill bet youve got the car to match kate smiled ive never liked porsche very much she said i think theyre too clinical if it was up to me id have something british like a jaguar xjs i prefer something a little more luxurious for my money i never could tell you seem pretty comfortable there yourself said kate and ill bet your boats faster than mine looks like it has plenty of range for longdistance fishing expeditions too why dont you come aboard and have a beer and tell me about her she knew cars she knew boats and she was friendly already dave was impressed i sure cant think of a reason not to he said as he climbed onto the carrera he caught a brief glimpse of two men sitting inside the salon watching tv then he stepped up onto the bridge the woman got up from the leather sofa and smiled pleasantly she said kate parmenter using her married name for what she hoped would be the very last time dave shook her hand while noting that there was no ring on the other one that was good the kind of women who married older rich guys usually made sure they got a good rock out of it so maybe she wasnt married after all he said david dulanotov like in the x files no thats david duchovny well pleased to meet you anyway david kate wondered if he was crew mostly the guys who owned boats like the juarista were pink fat and balding like her soontobe exhusband howard the sportiest thing about howard had been his rolex submariner but this guy david with his hard body and easy smile looked too fit to be spending much time behind the kind of desk that made enough money to buy a two maybe three million dollar sportfisher and to meet you kate your boat yeah she said the juarista an unusual name what does it mean the juaristas were mexican revolutionaries explained dave they tried to free their country from the frenchsupported emperor maximilian kate looked sheepish i didnt even know the french had been involved in mexico mexico algeria vietnam every lousy cause she went forward to fetch a couple of cold coronas from the flybridge refrigerator i must say you dont look like someone whod be interested in revolution me dave shrugged well ive got a lot of russian blood but actually im more interested in movies than commies most of what i know about the juaristas comes from a movie called vera cruz gary cooper and burt lancaster thats a little before my time mine too but its still a good movie dave took the bottle she offered and drank some cold beer is that your crew watching tv im the captain not the owner hes one of the guys watching the football game on tv youre not a sports fan oh sure but i can watch a game any time its not every day you set sail on a voyage across the atlantic ocean for a moment dave stared off the port side and then added i feel im about to suffer a sea change into something rich and strange kate smiled is that poetry dave who reckoned becoming something rich was at least a strong possibility supplied the complete quotation and said its shakespeare the tempest kate raised her bottle heres to one not finding us is that at all likely not really not at this time of year but sailing in the tropics you never can tell they fell silent for a minute or two as if immediately comfortable with each other enough just to sit there and watch the grand dukes crew make ready to leave the mooring occasionally kate would glance to the stern of the ship where rocky envigados boat the britannia was now loaded and lashed she was feeling a little more relaxed the britannia had been the very last boat to float into the duke and for an hour or so it had seemed that she and her two colleagues might have found themselves setting sail without the target of their surveillance a tugboat tooted to port lines were thrown off the quayside a klaxon sounded and kate and dave felt a low rumble on the starboard side as bow and stern thrusters began to turn over there were now only two lines connecting them to land and seeing these slacken men on the wharf lifted the eye of each rope clear of the bit and then dropped it into the rainbow streaked water all gone and all clear someone shouted having checked the whereabouts of rockys boat kate watched david out of the corner of her eye as he watched the thrusters push the ship gently away maximum points for quoting shakespeare and he was right there was something rich and strange about a voyage like this one maximum points too for not being interested in football what did a game matter when there was the leaving of america by ship to contemplate she had begun to believe that men like david dulanotov simply didnt exist romantic men who were content to sit in silence instead of trying to talk their way into your pants looking at his big brown eyes fixed on the distant horizon she wondered what other surprises the voyage might have in store for her and how many of them might include this handsome man chapter fourteen some of the crew and yachtowners stayed aboard their own vessels for dinner but mostly they went to the accommodations block in the forehouse curious to see more of the ship and to meet the captain his officers and their crew officers and crewmen on the duke ate separately and in different messrooms in the british merchant navy it had always been done this way now jellicoe gave orders that owners and their captains would be permitted to dine in the officers saloon crewmen however would have to eat with the crew of the duke in the crewmens mess so it was that dave found himself sitting down to dinner with jellicoe those of his officers who were not on watch and a couple of dozen assorted owners and captains including al carnaro kate parmenter and the captain of the jade the handsome rachel dana rachel said captain jellicoe i was wondering whats the purpose of those two brass cannon on your focsle what the hells a focsle grumbled kent bowen its the deck above the forecastle in the bows of the ship explained jellicoe and marked bowen down as a complete idiot in all matters relating to the sea and seafaring turning toward rachel he smiled bleakly as a matter of fact he said theres a bit of a story attached to those cannon you see on our way back from the balearics he nodded toward bowen thats the small group of islands including mallorca that is of course our destination well we had to stop for repairs pretty close to lanzarote another nod to bowen which is of course in the canary islands anyway we were lying at anchor close to some cliffs for the best part of a day while the chief engineer sorted out the engines and the boys started to get rather bored now at the top of these cliffs were two ceremonial cannon and i thought that it would be a pretty good way of keeping them out of mischief if we climbed to the top of the cliffs along the lines of a film i once saw and instead of blowing up these particular guns stole them instead jellicoe was chuckling as he relived this exploit so thats exactly what we did it took most of the day since as you can no doubt imagine they were rather heavy anyway theyre in full working order we fire them once a year to commemorate admiral lord nelsons victory over the french at the battle of trafalgar he nodded toward bowen again famous sea battle during the napoleonic wars october in case you should be wondering fought not so very far north of the canaries as a matter of fact you see the cannon were originally british came off a ship in nelsons squadron that was wrecked in madeira for a while the cannon stayed there until the governor lost them in a card game with the governor of lanzarote something like that anyway so you see we were merely reclaiming naval property england expects eh chief bert ross smiled a wintry smile and helped himself to some more of the execrable white wine that was served aboard the duke how heroic said rachel perhaps you should be in a film yourself captain kate wondered what kind of film rachel dana could have in mind she said captain jellicoe if thats how you keep your men out of mischief id love to see what might happen when you were planning on causing trouble come come captain parmenter it was just high spirits thats all jellicoe looked at dave and said wouldnt you say so sir it sounds a blast dave grinned back at him wondering how jellicoe would react when he and al enacted their own highspirited caper badly he thought jellicoe was the kind of guy whod have called what dave was planning piracy well that was ok by him hed always kind of liked errol flynn and tyrone power when he was holed up somewhere several million dollars better off he might even grow himself a small mustache maybe even wear an earring again when you were worth several million dollars you could wear more or less what you wanted and no one ever complained a blast jellicoe said yes i suppose it was kate smiled at dave a few too many beers is as wild as it gets on the carrera dave smiled back same here he said although he was thinking that what had happened to lou malta and his boy pepe would count as pretty wild al who had wisely stayed silent throughout dinner leaned toward daves shoulder and murmured that her that the babe you were talking to earlier yes it is cute very cute the question is does she have a goodlooking friend dave looked at al and shook his head no al the question is do i after dinner dave asked the chief officer bert ross which of his officers was the radio officer radio officer ross sounded surprised yeah only ive got a fistmike thats cutting out on me although this was true dave knew pretty much how to fix it his real purpose was to find out where the ships radio was the first part of his plan when eventually it kicked in would involve immobilizing the dukes vhf weve got an electrical officer said ross radio officers went out with flared trousers were all satellite and microchip these days fax telex digital selective calling you name it most of the lads on this ship think morse code is the capital of russia he laughed and glanced at his watch as it happens jock our electrical officer hell be on the blower now gettin the soccer results from england come on ill take you there myself thanks thatd be great no problem what you want to do anyway have a chat with your personal trainer or something ross led the way out of the officers saloon after that dinner youll probably need a couple of hours in the gym it was kind of heavy admitted dave thinking how much the food had reminded him of the chow back in homestead what we dont eat we use as ballast they went along to a cabin close to the bridge where a thin undernourishedlooking man with the reddest hair dave had ever seen that wasnt on a dog was seated in front of a series of teakmounted transceivers and loudspeakers in his hand was a digital telephone handset and on the table next to him was a sheet of paper covered with team names and scores this is jock the redhaired man looked up and nodded hes scottish so dont expect to understand a bleedin word he says jock replaced the handset on the cradle and sat back on his plastic office chair howd the arsenal do jock lost threenil bastards ross sighed and looked away in disgust jock this is mister dulanotov one of our supernumos hes got a problem with his vhf dave answered a few rudimentary questions about the vhf system aboard the juarista while at the same time he considered what would be the best way of taking out the ships radio the sailor in him recoiled from the idea of simply putting a bullet in the radio and leaving a hundred people stranded on the ocean with no means of communication but he could see no obvious alternative at least that was how it seemed until backing out of rosss way he caught and tore the pocket of his chinos on the heavy steel door sorry about that said ross but dave was more interested in the discovery that there was a key in the door than in any apology all he would have to do was steal the key and then hide it somewhere jock leaned forward in his chair frowning with puzzlement as through the loudspeaker came a sound like a fax machine in transmission he said odd there it is again what is asked ross that sound one of the supernumos must be broadcasting a signal using a digital scrambler so so its a little unusual thats all what channel asked dave curious jock hit the squelch button on the transceiver to try and filter out the background atmospheric noise he shook his head and said it seems to be between frequencies ross shrugged and said whoever it is is probably trying to have a private business conversation thats all there are a lot of nosey bastards around these days you never know whos listening to your blower i was reading about it in the paper industrial espionage is on the increase thats true said jock in an accent as thick as porridge but digitals sophisticated he looked accusingly at dave even for some megarich supernumo normally its only the military and the intelligence community who get to play with these kinds of toys are you sure its coming from the duke asked dave positive look at that signal strength were right on top of it and whats more vhf has a very short range fifty miles max if someones broadcasting then its to someone else whos quite close can you get a fix on it asked dave not with this kit jock picked up a halfsmoked cigarette and puffed it back into life there is another possibility if the signals not actually coming from the ship he took a drag stubbed out the cigarette in a saucer and started to roll another ross said well dont make us change our underwear for it jock licked his cigarette paper and said its possible just possible mind that were over a submarine he put the cigarette in his mouth and scraped a match alight those bastards play all sorts of stupid games if it is a sub hes probably using us as the subject of an exercise right now he could be going through the motions of firing a torpedo at us dave said thats a comforting thought as we prepare to go to bed ross said yeah and to think that its to help us all sleep soundly in our beds that they do these bloody stupid things aboard the carrera kate finished her conversation with the first officer of the uss galveston the class attack submarine that was she had just been informed feet below the twin hulls of the duke she felt a lot better knowing they had company even though it would only last as far as the sargasso sea after that there would be several hundred miles across the cape verde basin before they picked up their french nuclear sub escort at another underwater landmark great meteor tablemount she and sam brockman were seated behind the drawn shades and closed doors of the wheelhouse skylounge brockman was keeping one eye on the electronic chart more out of habit than of necessity a tall man too tall to be really comfortable on the yacht at six feet five his steelgray hair was forever brushing along the carreras suedecovered ceilings brockman had the air of someone whod seen it all before kate liked him finding confidence in his steady demeanor admiring his attention to duty but most of all enjoying the fact that he shared her own low opinion of kent bowen kate said where is his excellency asleep in his stateroom he and the beer got well acquainted during the game on tv and then there was the wine he had at dinner i guess hes drunk as much as hes breathed today looks like he intends to play the part of lazy fat cat to the whiskers kate not so much under cover as under the influence it amazes me that hes managed to keep such a tight rein on his mouth so far i should never have suggested it kate said youre right sam hes acting like hes donald trump this owner thing really has gone to his head its not just his head did you see the way he was coming onto the captain of the jade sam grinned i wonder why oh come on sam not you too those are tits in her polo shirt not golden apples cant say as i noticed her tits but i love that womans ass sam sea air does strange things to people he explained therell be all kinds of shit before this voyage is out you just see if im wrong i hope so i could use some action miami bureaus been a little dull of late bo wen sees to that dullest as ac i ever worked for dont you worry about a thing you did right believe me hes playing the dumb schmuck owner to perfection i should know i worked for plenty during college vacations i used to crew yachts one particular asshole i worked for heir to a sanitary napkin fortune he owned this classic threemasted schooner two hundred feet long built in a real beauty his private plane flew him down to meet the yacht at tierra del fuego in argentina this was after us radioing him to say that the weather was real quiet we picked him up and he spent fortyeight hours on board going round cape horn just so that he could boast to his yacht club pals back in manhattan that hed actually done it two days later we dropped him off the coast of chile and he flew home asshole as soon as he got back to wall street he put the yacht up for sale sam shook his head with disgust yes i think he and kent bowen would have gotten along real well its kind of you to say so sam he stretched his long arms and yawned bowens right about one thing though that early night im bushed mind if i turn in you go ahead im going to stay up a while and enjoy the night air its not every day you set sail on a voyage across the atlantic ocean sam smiled politely and rose to his feet he had no great love for the ocean fort lauderdale was one of the busiest stations in the service theyd performed over a thousand boardings the previous year and sam never worked less than a seventyhour week the coast guard motto was semper paratus always ready and boy did they mean it sam had never married hed never found the time let alone the right girl the kind of girl who would put up with a rival like the sea kate he liked but already he knew her for what she was someone like himself someone prepared to put her job ahead of any relationship and there was no future in that for either of them so he said goodnight and went down to his stateroom kate went to the back of the bridge and stared out to sea the ship was making good speed at almost seventeen knots although she would hardly have noticed but for the low noise and dull vibration of the engines the sea itself looked as calm as if theyd been sailing in one of lauderdales intercoastal waterways the moon was full as big as a soccer ball and there was only a light warm breeze as they cruised through the night kate lit a doral and meandered barefoot around the deck in the moonlight you might have believed all of the boats on the ship were made of cocaine they were so white a poet at least might have appreciated kent bowens halfbaked theory and it was easy to think of all their passengers as supernatural voyagers from some greek myth or maybe flying dutchmen set to sail the seas forever someone cleared his throat and turning towards the carreras starboard side she found herself facing the moonlit captain of the juarista he said lovely evening isnt it kate put out the cigarette she never felt she looked her best when she was smoking you could ask me aboard again if you wanted to you want a beer he seemed to take this as a yes for the next moment he was leaping athletically from his bridge to hers oh she said a little nervous of him here you are well well well its a marvellous night for a moondance to kates surprise dave put his arm around her waist picked up her slightly reluctant right hand in his left and began to dance with her all the while quietly singing his favorite van morrison song smiling when their eyes met and without a trace of shyness as if he serenaded a girl like this every night at the end of the song when she thought he would surely kiss her he released her hand and stepped back kate let out her breath and said that was nice she was a little shocked to hear herself add i could listen to that all night she turned away so that he couldnt see her grimace with embarrassment ill get you mat beer no he said really im ok i dont need a beer he smiled i was thinking how about you go to the movies with me tonight the third mans playing at the juarista its a little movie theater somewhere off the bahamas i know it she said its right by the carrera afterwards we could check out a cocktail bar i know nearby the barman there makes these really excellent margaritas kate frowned wondering why she should suddenly be reminded of the pier top at the hyatt in fort lauderdale dave went on then if youve still got the energy we could go dancing im not much of a dancer admitted kate didnt howard always say so ive seen a book of random numbers with more rhythm than you have kate he had told her sure you are he said you know all the moves i think thats you youre describing oh you mean moves like in chess she nodded as in a gambit mister gary kasparov she said could be he allowed only a gambit involves some kind of sacrifice so what have you got to lose dave said i had the naive idea of simply expressing my feelings as they occurred will that do sure but maybe wed better skip the movie we might disturb the other patrons ok but how about that margarita if you think itll help with that naive idea of yours just the one though and remember this one im driving home and two i like to lick the salt off my own lips dave helped her to cross to his boat and while kate cast her eye over the salon he stepped downstairs to make sure that al was fast asleep the first decent girl hed met in five years the last thing he needed was al sticking his nose in behind the polished cedarwood door the tv was still on but al was snoring loudly dave went back up to the salon to fix the drinks als asleep said dave he wont disturb us tell me about al dave said i guess you could say that als pretty much the guy next door that is if you happen to live next to a zoo or a pig farm but hes useful to have around yknow kate laughed she was looking at the mockglass aquarium by lalique that surrounded the sofa and thinking that the boats interior was a lot less obviously masculine than she had imagined quite apart from the glass there were the scattercushions on the sofa she had never known a man to possess cushions aboard a sportfisher nice interior she pronounced politely its ok he allowed a little fussy im not sure that the glass works so im thinking of a refit in the winter he handed kate her margarita something more practical perhaps she sipped her drink mmmm just right thats the way i like them a perfectionist that would certainly explain why im attracted to you flatterys my favorite compliment id have thought you were used to it by now not really my exhusband was a little stingy with his good opinions he made up for it with his bad ones though the ex part sounds good hes well out of my life she lied short on compliments but hed always take his hat off to a pretty woman only trouble was it never stopped at just his hat philanderer huh like his name was phil and er he came from er philadelphia dave grinned who writes your dialogue he said i love the way you talk little guy with a battered remington upstairs in my head looks a bit like william holden william holden he used to be big he is still big declared kate with mock solemnity its his arteries that got small she was pleased that he liked the way she talked howard had never cared for kates wit she was always too quick for him and he had hated that sometimes she was too quick even for herself saying things funny things she would later regret if her mouth had been a gun shed have been the sundance kid but in her own opinion it wasnt that howard had lacked wit or intelligence merely that he took himself too seriously its good that you and i share a sense of humor she had once told him the only trouble is that ive got per cent of it there was certainly nothing wrong with davids sense of humor kate was pretty keen on the way he talked too she said youre not so badly off yourself after all youve got van morrison on your case i always liked van the man where are you from van dave smiled and looked away for a moment it doesnt matter he said what matters most is where youre going and how you get there uhhuh so youre from miami kate said dave laughed people are always coy about being from miami she explained youre right he said its like saying you were born in a kmart youve lost most of your accent she observed ever since hed started learning russian dave had been trying to improve the way he spoke english too to use conjunctions and prepositions except when he spoke to al it hardly seemed to matter the way he spoke to al dave said i didnt lose it i wiped it off my shoe selfimprover huh isnt everyone what about you where are you from or are you coy too kate said me and coy never got along that well him and his sister meek i never liked them so you dont believe that the meek shall inherit the earth if they do itll be because they had a good lawyer actually im from the space coast it sounds better than saying im from titusville doesnt it if miamis a kmart then i dont know what that makes tville she considered the matter for a moment and then said a local church thrift shop probably no the only good thing about tville was the view of the rocket assembly building twenty miles away i kind of grew up with the space program when i was a kid i wanted to be an astronaut to be the first american woman on the moon she shrugged smiling brightly and now i crew luxury yachts she finished her drink and licked her lips a logical career move dave said do you want some more i made a whole pitcher in case you changed your mind about having just the one a man who knows female psychology she handed him her glass shall we add that to your list of accomplishments dave took the glasses salted the rims and then refilled them to the brim whos counting he said she waited until dave sat down again looked him straight in his big brown eyes and answered him with a frankness she found almost exhilarating i am then she raised her glass before he could get too close wanting to control this for as long as possible well thats how i come to be the captain of a yacht how do you come to be an owner i mean this is a pretty expensive boat i guess i know what i like said dave with what he hoped sounded like evasive modesty and then if i can i go and get it do you go after everything you like no not everything but its the way id pick out a woman you make it sound like choosing a necktie choosing a necktie is a serious business said dave it can be hanging around your neck for up to twelve hours a day twelve hours a day sounds like youre in something thats high pressure exactly what do you do for a living exactly dave grinned a bit of this a bit of that that sounds like a really nice job which of them pays better generally that thats what i thought i work in the south east financial center on biscayne boulevard sure the tallest building in florida it has to be for all the stories i have to tell my clients so youre a practiced liar is that what youre telling me not practiced perfect kate smiled you must be doing all right dave looked noncommittal kate said i mean weve already established that this isnt exactly the sloop john b a boat like this must cost the best part of three million thats a lot of tall stories even for someone in the financial center he put down his glass and said what would you do if you had three million dollars is this indecent proposal i said three million well naturally thered be some change dave slid along the sofa and put his arm around her shoulders he said where are we on the kings gambit and then he kissed her you could tell a lot about a man by the way he kissed you thought kate sometimes you could tell what hed had for dinner but mostly you could tell right away if you wanted to go to bed with him kate knew pretty much as soon as he pressed his mouth to hers that she wanted to have it pressed to other parts of her body as well when eventually he drew back to look for her reaction she said i think it has probably been accepted only the white queen is badly placed here she ought to move if shes to avoid mate kate put her margarita down on the coffee table slid a hand around the back of his neck and pulled his mouth back to hers as if she was already addicted to its narcotic effect dreamily she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the acute intoxication of his lips which were still necked with crystalline salt from his glass the last man who had kissed her had been nick hemmings the british liaison officer a nice guy but not much of a kisser and before that howard of course who kissed like a clam but this this was a real schedule ii buzz high abuse potential the kind of an ounce kiss that felt like she was vacuuming it up through her dilating nostrils and finding it seconds later tingling in her toes mmmm she said deliciously and brushed his warm cheek and hot ear with her glowing lips you could cut that feeling with a credit card have you ever felt really wide awake and all you wanted to do was go straight to bed ive never done anything straight said kate revelling in the new role she was creating for herself barbara stanwyck lauren bacall bette davis she pushed dave gently away if i had id have become an astronaut still as rocket rides go this has been quite fast enough just look at me breathless she sat up and collected her nearempty glass off the table running low on fuel and oxygen i think id better get back to the mother ship dave picked up a cushion and placed it on his lap he said thats probably a good idea he finished his margarita waiting for kate to show some more obvious signs of wanting to leave like standing up when she stayed put on the sofa he helped himself to one of her cigarettes while he thought of appropriate lines of poetry there was some andrew marvell that fitted the situation very well only hed relied on other peoples words too much already it was time to be himself or as much of himself as he could ever reveal to her given what he was planning so he said simply you know for a ships captain youre a pretty nice girl its not a condition of the job that you have to look like charles laughton and walk around the deck carrying a ropes end al makes charles laughton look like cary grant its probably just as well he does suggested kate think how embarrassed youd both be if this was him sitting here now the obscenity of that picture made dave laugh out loud he said it would make it easier to say goodnight you know david for a millionaire you give up real easy and i thought i was demonstrating an admirable restraint your admirable restraint is nice dont get me wrong it makes a very welcome change but how shall i put it ok as butlers go theres too much english and not enough of rhett quite obviously im in two minds about what to do here now maybe i just need a little financial center salesmanship frankly my dear i dont feel up to bullshitting you what it boils down to is that i like your stock too much to sell it short id rather force the price up than down when i buy into something its not because im after a quick killing but because i believe in the company you should only sell when youre sure of that yourself a deals only a good deal if both parties think so i love it when you talk that way said kate it makes me feel like bell atlantic she kissed him and stood up ill be waiting for your offer rhett youll know where to find me you just look out to sea in the morning and then turn around want me to walk you home thats ok i brought my sealegs with me so i noticed as a matter of fact ive been noticing them all evening they look good on you like ones called cyd and the others called charisse they make a pretty good duo and contrary to whatever impression i may have given you dave theyre seldom seen apart i didnt doubt it said dave escorting her toward the stern of the yacht you know kate this wasnt isnt just a casual flirtation i meant a lot of what i said thats not something that happens to me very often believe me and if i told you i already had the same feeling she stopped his mouth with another kiss and then added weve got ten days to find out if this means anything more important than just human biology dave frowned momentarily at a loss he said ten days kate said thats how long weve got on this floating tin of sardines until we get to mallorca isnt it oh sure said dave whose mental clock was only set for a fiveday voyage kate said youll let me know if you plan to get off early wont you david only id hate to wake up in the morning and find youd checked out dave forced a smile where can i go theres only the moon and stars you know the nights magic van the man you said so yourself remember chapter fifteen kinda late when you came back on board last night wasnt it kate kent she protested you sound just like my father besides im surprised you noticed after the amount of alcohol you put away yesterday they were in the galley bowen seated behind the lshaped dinette kate standing behind the inlaid fauxgranite counter pouring boiling water on top of some folgers crystals down the portside companionway nearby they could hear the sound of sam brockman singing in his shower bowen said well heres the thing what with the playoff on tv and the luxury of this boat and setting out on this voyage and because i was in your attractive company kate and because there really wasnt much else to do yesterday except relax i guess i did drink a little more than i should have done but you certainly wouldnt have noticed it affecting my ability to do the job i wouldnt have seen that no she admitted adding under her breath mostly i try not to notice you and your abilities at all whats that kate shook her head so whats your problem with my timekeeping sir i was just wondering what it was that kept you up so late kate saw no point in denying where she had been very little had actually happened unless you counted a small trip before maybe falling head over heels in love certainly nothing had happened in the bed department she shrugged and said the guy on the next boat invited me over for a drink thats all he makes a pretty good margarita im interested to hear it margaritas my favorite cocktail and would this be the same guy who came over here for a drink yesterday afternoon the same guy bowen looked thoughtful something wrong with that asked kate hes certainly a goodlooking fellow he remarked bowen started grinning at kate in a way she found offensive like he was some jealous sugardaddy or something meaning he said with apparent innocence meaning hes a goodlooking guy kate placed a cup of coffee on the table in front of him and then retired behind the galley counter just in case she felt tempted to tip the hot coffee into his lap she watched him take a sip and almost wished that the coffee was poisoned like bowens mind at the very least she wanted to take the brim of his stupid tilley hat and tug it down hard over his eyes and ears just to see if it would make any difference to the way he conducted himself bowen said since he and i are to be neighbors i guess youd better tell me his name kate sipped her coffee and stared out of the fullwidth windshield her mind wandering although the time was not quite ten oclock it was already a hot day the tropic of cancer was only a hundred miles to the south confident of her figure she wanted to wear a bikini for daves benefit but the idea of wearing anything more revealing than a nuns habit around bowen filled her with disgust she was hoping to go up on the coachroof sunpad and catch some rays while listening in to the bug that had been planted aboard the britannia during loading by one of the port everglade stevedores the trouble was a single device had not proven to be enough and kate was going to have to place another on rockys boat herself she was still undecided about her costume for the day bowen kept on grinning through kates obdurate silence he does have a name doesnt he the captain of the juarista his name is david dulanotov and hes not the captain hes the owner kate said quickly almost immediately she regretted her alacrity telling bowen anything was as good as telling him too much for it was plain he was jealous the owner eh same as me bowen allowed the grin to become his irritating chuckle i should have known as soon as i saw him i felt he and i had something in common he drank some more coffee peer recognizing peer you know the kind of thing and you know boats so tell me kate how much do you think a boat like the juarista would cost kate was uncertain if she should leave him in impotent ignorance or tell him and make him feel small finally she couldnt resist rubbing his nose up against daves obvious wealth she said i dont know maybe three million dollars three million bucks jesus he must be worth a bundle its hardly the biggest boat on the ship kent rockys boat has twenty or thirty feet on davids david bowen smiled you know how long it would take me to get that kind of money together maybe fifty years dont tell me tell your congressman and if thats what he spends on a goddamn boat can you imagine what kind of house he lives in kate found she could imagine all kinds of things about david dulanotov and most of them involved her being naked what are you a real estate agent i mean you dont spend more on the boat than you do on the house it stands to reason the guys house has got to be three or four times as much as his boat its got to be a seven or eight million dollar place hes got imagine that jesus kate sighed and looked into her coffee cup whats he do for a living young fellow like that rob banks smuggle cocaine i see theres nothing wrong with your imagination as far as i know he works in the financial center on biscayne boulevard commodities or something thats as good as robbing a bank better those guys are harder to catch when they get up to something fraud insider dealing shit like that what are you the securities and exchange commission kent you havent the first idea what youre talking about you dont even know the guy i know the type insisted bowen maybe better than you think maybe better than you exasperated kate tossed the rest of her coffee into the sink its not every day we rub shoulders with multimillionaires kate its natural we should feel curious about these people that we should be dazzled by them and their wealth is that a personal observation what is this i just want you to be careful thats all weve got a job to do here dont get distracted by anything dont get your head turned by anyone by this guy for instance you know what this is this is connected to something else said kate which is that you feel uncomfortable on a personal level with me talking to other men i think youre jealous me jealous thats ridiculous i dont think so i just dont want you to get hurt i dont want you to screw things up for yourself or for this whole operation kate smiled bitterly and i suppose the way you were conducting yourself with the captain of the jade last night somehow evades the category of foolish does it look kate im a little older thats something we can agree on anyway better not push your luck and try wiser ok i know where to draw the line dont you mean spin a line you were coming onto rachel dana like you owned kansas now wait a minute no you wait a goddamn minute youre trying to make me feel guilty to wrongfoot me about this well you can save your shoes i dont feel guilty for anybody and dont lecture me about keeping my mind on the job sir keeping my mind on the job cost me a husband did you ever lose a marriage because of your work it has its depressing moments one of the things that gets you through to the other side is the idea that your job means something that its important that doing it makes a difference so dont lecture me about my job you can leave that job to my husbands divorce lawyer sir kate walked swiftly out of the galley a minute or so later bowen saw her going along the high side of the ship and stopping to speak to the owner of the juarista bowen finished his coffee and then went up to the flybridge he sat down in one of the pilots chairs switched on the digital scrambler and picked up the radio handset this is turkey in the hay calling turkey in the straw this is turkey in the hay calling turkey in the straw are you receiving me over there followed a short pause filled with the noise of static and then bowen heard the voice of the uss galvestons duty radio man turkey in the hay this is turkey in the straw receiving you are you secure over turkey in the hay all secure i want you to relay a message back to fbi headquarters in washington have the records division run a check on a david dulanotov thats dulanotov also other permutations of that name spelling was never my forte in addition id like to have them check on a boat called the juarista thats juarista originally registered in san diego california everything and anything oh yeah one more thing all of this information is to be given up by you only on my specific request me asac kent bowen it is to be withheld unless specifically asked for got that over turkey in the hay this is turkey in the straw we copy over this is turkey in the hay over and out bowen turned off the radio and leaned back in the fine leather chair he was quite impressed that kate could make sense of all these computer screens several times hed watched her run various troubleshooting sequences thats what shed called them anyway and still he had no idea what shed been doing maybe she did know a lot about boats but he knew about investigation and all things forensic being inquisitive finding out about people knowing exactly who you were dealing with all of that helped keep you ahead in the game bowen believed that most rich people usually had something to hide along the lines of the old saying that behind every great fortune was a great crime it would be interesting to see what david dulanotovs secret was and what kates reaction would be when eventually he got to tell her all about it the boat at the stern of the ship the one were going to steal and use as our getaway its called the britannia dave told al they were sitting on the double bed in als stateroom with no windows or portholes it was the most secure place on the juarista and since al had never bothered to change his sheets since costa rica it was also the most malodorous its not as fast as this boat but looking at her id say she can do twentyfive knots no problem shes got twin bow thrusters so there wont be any difficulty maneuvering her out to sea powers not going to be a problem either ive been watching them shes got more solar panels than a fuckin space station and the captain who incidentally looks just like gilbert roland he keeps the engines turned over the only outstanding question i have about her is how much fuel she has on board al frowned who the fuck is gilbert roland played a lot of mexicans in movies dave shook his head as als face remained a blank it doesnt matter and what about the money what about it what i mean motherfucker is that you dont know how much fuel there is on this other boat so maybe you dont really have a fuckin clue about how much money there is either thats a complete non sequitur said dave your painintheass conclusion does not follow from the premises you stated believe me its there if you were jesus christ and you swore on the holes in your hands and the wound in your side the money was there id still say what makes you so fuckin sure ye of little faith will you forget about the money the moneys where its supposed to be which is more than i can say of your attitude why cant you be more like one of those other disciples al not having seen and yet believed just be cool about the fuckin money dave shook his head weary of als doubt changing the subject he said did you find somewhere to lock everyone up al said sullenly i think so i went right over the accommodation block and the best area seems to be on the lower deck theres an engineers workshop and end storeroom alongside the engine room apart from some tools and shit place is more or less empty doors good too solid steel outside bolt if we left the tools they could probably hammer their way out in a few hours by that time well be long gone right with the wind al bent down and drew a baseball kit bag toward him still wetlooking and smelling bad after several days in the fishbox he said me and you scarlett its about time we got to meet our partners in crime all of them combat veterans and the first to do the boogie is the ninemill heckler koch m submachine gun weighs no more than a newborn baby and its just as fuckin loud fires thirty rounds effective range around meters he handed over the weapon and showed dave how to eject the magazine its slung on a length of rubber tube seal style in case we have to take a bath with it fitted with waterproof laser sights takes a ninevolt battery for up to thirty hours of continuous play youd have to be stevie wonder not to hit the target with this mother guaranteed accuracy or your money back al reached into the bag and came up with a pistol next to do the boogie is the heckler koch fortyfive acp special operations handgun brand loyaltys a big thing with me in case you hadnt noticed i always eat the same fuckin breakfast cereal and i always use the same gun two most important things in your day are a good start that means a good breakfast and a good gun theres enough uncertainty in the world already without trusting new shit that you havent used before pretty good weltanschauung said dave ignoring him al said and with this pistol believe me you got the whole world in your hands this is the big john cannon of handguns detachable sound suppresser cos were gonna be working at night and we dont want to wake folks up before were ready laser aiming module like before matter of fact same as they used on the f fighters in desert storm you could hit baghdad with this artillery fires eight shots guaranteed take down but theres a heavy recoil so well wear these weightlifters gloves not because we wanna look like a couple of sm faggots but because they let you keep a tight grip the last weapon out of the bag was a shotgun last but by no means least to boogie on down is your pump action twelvegauge shotgun mossberg model cut back to eighteen inches same as my dick ive taken off the magazine plug and replaced the front bead looks pretty mean doesnt it al chuckled well thisll sweep the fuckin hall for ya and no mistake youll only have to fire this mother once and your problems are solved when were outside and on the boats i recommend you stick to the submachine gun and your pistol dealing with the ships crew the shotgun will be the most effective friendly persuasion al worked the slide and pulled the trigger on the empty chamber not for nothing is this called a riot gun and with these three weapons we are loaded with fuckin opportunities but in case we have to play anyone with a similar hand to our own well be wearing kevlar tested at the aberdeen proving grounds by the us government edgewood arsenal this body armor will stop the acp and the ninemill but maybe not the twelve at close range this is what you want to be wearing when you attend your next local meeting of the branch davidians the truth hurts but not if youre wearing kevin costner next to the folded white torso of the body armor al laid a walkietalkie he said and of course our communications devices in case love tries to tear us apart al waved his hand at the guns and equipment that were now spread on the bed like christmas presents at the risk of sounding like gunny sergeant highway get to know this shit become familiar with it could be itll save your life more importantly you might save mine oh yeah one more thing what i call the alias smith and jones factor dave nodded and said starring pete duel and ben murphy all the trains and banks they robbed they never shot anyone bullshit nobody gives up a fuckin payroll without someone gettin shot remember that someone gets in your way and you gotta grease the fucker then youd better fuckin do it or it could be your ass thats down you wanna be very popular with everyone but the railroads and the banks then youd better try standup comedy instead of robbery you wanna take down a score like this one then youd better be ready to drop some fuckin brass and lots of it you understand its survival of the fittest capisce dave grinned back at him he said all that testosterone al you wanna hear yourself like a goddamn pitbull terrier survival of the fittest that was charles darwins theory it was an explanation of natural selection and evolution and shit like that when he said survival of the fittest he didnt mean those who were prepared to be the baddest motherfuckers would survive fittest doesnt mean bad al it doesnt mean anything except what it says most likely to survive fact is that old darwin thought that being predisposed toward cooperation might well be adaptive and would thus be selected for the way i look at it al thats what were after a little cooperation we wave our guns and make some noise sure but lets do this cleverly in a social way a certain amount of aggression may well be called for sure it may confer some benefits but it also has its costs most animals have got builtin codes for conflict that set limits to the violence they do to each other a lot of it is just bluff threat displays nshit like that to hear you al you sound like you actually want to kill somebody and what youve got to understand is that if we use our brains we probably wont have to use our guns your alias smith and jones example is all wrong man the point was not that they were too yellow or too dumb to shoot anyone but that they planned their robberies with sufficient thought and style and then kept their cool so as they didnt need to shoot people al laughed scornfully and you believe that al its your example not mine the questions kind of academic on account of how it wasnt meant to be true in the first place sure it was true insisted al it was history said so right at the beginning of the show hannibal hayes and kid curry the two most wanted outlaws in the history of the west sure it was true the only part that wasnt true was the part how they never shot anyone they just did that to make sure they picked up the family audience al it was a fictional scenario based only very loosely on two historical characters dave checked himself from saying more what did he know what did he care what the fuck did it matter he was debating a point with someone whose idea of an effective argument was a bigger handgun than the next guy al said you know your trouble you read way too much every time you open your mouth some other guys thoughts come out like you were a vents dummy or something he lifted the empty automatic pointed it at daves reflection in the large mirror behind his bed and pulled the trigger harmlessly he said ive said it before and ill say it again it beats me how you did all that time dave said whatever i did al i did for you and for your boss try and remember that sometime al winked unpleasantly hey its always on my mind dave carried his gear back to his own stateroom put it in the drawer underneath his bed and then stretched out the five years hed done in homestead were of little consequence to al but dave knew the experience would be on his own mind for the rest of his natural he thought about the time and then he thought about the man tony nudelli had shot and the ramifications that had ensued for dave and daves fuckedup family there was no way naked tony was going to get away with what had happened he had some payback coming but mostly he thought about kate and what had happened the night before already she was on his mind in a way hed hardly have thought possible on the strength of one days acquaintance first thing that morning his thoughts had been about her its the girls who resist that you most want to kiss he could not recall feeling this way about a girl in years and it seemed unthinkable that in four or five days time he might sail off into the sunrise and simply never see her again what made it even more awkward was the certainty that she felt the same way about him with the only difference being that she wasnt expecting him to turn thief and take off with millions of dollars of drug money there could be no question of not going through with the caper even if hed had second thoughts there was still al to consider but maybe there was a third possibility how much did the captain of a small yacht make anyway thirty forty thousand dollars a year what was that next to some real money she talked like shed be willing at least to entertain the proposition if there was one thing dave liked it was a goodlooking girl with lip of course the timing would be critical he could hardly tell her what he was going to do before he had done it suppose she objected and then gave the game away no he wasnt quite sure how but he would have to check her out and make sure of her in some other way up front he would have to devise a fictional scenario or pose in order to test her after a while dave went up on deck and looked toward the carrera there were signs that someone had been sunbathing on the roof but kate was nowhere in sight al was up on the side of the duke talking to the jades captain and grinning wolfishly seeing dave he shouted down hey boss we just got ourselves invited to a cocktail party thats nice said dave climbing up onto the wall alongside them thanks a lot captain dana she said eight oclock everyones invited and please its rachel with so many captains around this ship is starting to look a little top heavy dave saw al glance surreptitiously at rachels tits als thoughts were an open book to dave certainly where they concerned the topheavy rachel dana dave said dana thats a good name for the captain of an american boat any relation as a matter of fact he was a distant ancestor of mine confirmed rachel al bit his lip and said who a famous writer dave said teasing him rh dana al rolled his eyes and was about to make another disparaging comment about books when it suddenly dawned on him that dave was supposed to be his boss and this dana guy was a writer who was related to rachel he wrote one of the best books ever about the sea said dave two years before the mast but you wouldnt be interested al not being much of a reader nall says who i have a copy in my cabin if youd like to borrow it said rachel id love to read it insisted al maybe when youve finished reading it you can tell rachel what you think said dave give her your literary critique yeah sure why not rachel smiled pleasantly and ushering al onto the jade said well then lets go and get it shall we later that same day dave walked round to the port side of the ship to check on his three target vessels up on the roof of baby doc one of the crewmen with more tattoos than a maori hells angel had the bell cover off the tracvision antenna and was attaching a wire to the satellite dish afternoon said dave so i was led to believe said the guy not even looking round you got a problem there maybe i can help the guy looked around slowly with a whothefuckareyoutobeofferingmeadvice expression on his smug tough face after a moment or two he finished chewing the inside of his lip and said were not getting a tv signal dave smiled to himself marking the guy down as someone with little experience of boats he said too far away from the satellite the guy sounded incredulous hell no said dave from the coast that thing only works up to the mile limit after that its just white noise and space the final frontier no kidding no kidding leastways until you get to europe but their tvs shit so dont hold your breath shit said the guy what are we gonna do gotta vcr yeah but no tapes not a problem dave pointed toward the bow of the duke see that big boat up front the footer thats the jade shes owned by jade films theyve got plenty of videos for loan that is if you like porno does sinatra like spaghetti well then youre in luck theyve got a video library like a triple x on times square dave was only reporting what al had said after collecting rachels copy of two years before the mast his eyes had been out on stalks as a matter of fact theyre having a cocktail party tonight at eight open invitation surprised you havent heard about it oh we havent been very sociable so far some chick came around earlier but we were all still in bed had a few drinks ourselves last night he grinned ruefully more than a few the guy turned a little friendlier hey you wanna drink sure why not then step aboard my friend step aboard the baby doc this was better than dave could have hoped for he leaped onto the rooftop alongside the tattooed guy and followed him down to the deck he said baby doc what was this the duvalier family yacht or something nope guy who owns her runs some kind of fertility clinic in geneva makes a shitload of money out of women who cant have any babies and other gynecological odds and ends i dont think hed ever heard of the duvalier family or the tonton macoutes fact is i dont think he even knew that haiti existed not until he started to sail it around the caribbean the guy laughed and handed dave a cold bud found out soon enough then of course hes planning to refurbish her in europe gonna rename her at the same time i think if hes got any sense dumb fucker dave grinned and looked around the shabby interior wondering how much money might be concealed inside the worn leather furniture two big sofas and two matching easy chairs the rest of the lounge looked suitably clinical like a rest room for the guys on er theyd worked the story well enough and certainly picked the right boat the guy who told dave his name was keach hadnt exaggerated a complete refurbishment was what the baby doc needed and ripping out the interior furnishings would cause no great expense dave took his beer and dropped onto the sofa hoping he might witness some discomfort under his ass or on reachs face the sofa felt firm enough maybe too firm at that more like an office chair than a comfortable sofa the stitching on the old leather looked a little too pristine like it was new as if someone had stitched something up inside the leather money meanwhile reachs face with its puffy eyes like hed maybe taken a few punches in his time and lugubrious mouth stayed cool dave recognized the look it was the same longrange armorpiercing fullmetaljacket stare you developed when you were in the joint the dontmesswithmyshitorillfuckingkillyou kind of look so reach was an excon just like himself dave wondered if the guy maybe got the same smell off him cmon keach said coolly lets go outside you can point out your own boat dave stayed on the baby doc for another fifteen minutes meeting one of the other crewmen a heavyset black guy wearing a buzz haircut in a keith haring design and the kind of granite face that looked like hed had it custommade on easter island catching sight of his own reflection in the two watchtower gunbarrels of the blacks sunglasses dave thought that he himself looked like a fairly regular guy hardly the kind of guy who had a gun for all seasons underneath his bed he looked like just the kind of guy that kate might take on taking on these guys aboard the baby doc looked like a rather more difficult proposition on his way back to the juarista dave found his progress along the narrow gangway impeded by a solitary figure staring out to sea as dave excused himself squeezing past the guy he realized that he knew the face hey he said arent you calgary stanford the movie actor yes i am stanfords tone was sad almost as if being calgary stanford was a little too much to bear or maybe it was the role he was reported to be planning calgary stanford was the same movie actor who had attended the execution of benford halls on the day that dave had been released from homestead dave was familiar with stories in premiere about the methodical prep work some movie actors did to get into character on the whole he thought it was right that they should have to do some work maybe even endure some hardship in return for the money they got paid but he drew the line at attending a guys execution and wondered if before the voyage was out there might not be some way of getting even with the actor on the executed mans behalf dave said the cruel sea huh when stanford looked blank dave explained it was a book i think i saw the movie british movie right dave nodded wondering if guys in prison were the only people who read books any more as a matter of fact i thought you must be watching out for the hurricane what hurricane you havent heard theres one coming up from the west this was true it had been on the radio just after midday it was a long way behind them but dave wanted to spook the actor some jesus christ actually no said dave its called louisa but jesusd be a pretty good name for a hurricane when you think about it hurricane jesus or hurricane holy shit or hurricane holy mother of god ive known some mean bitches in my time good for spending your money and giving out grief but none of them could trash a place up the way a real storm can the way a rock group can hurricane led zeppelin thats a better name for a hurricane or hurricane keith moon boy ill bet thats a hurricane that could do some real damage not just the tv or the rollsroyce that ends up in the swimming pool but the whole damn hotel they say what category this louisa is asked stanford a three i think dave sniffed the air there was a definite smell of marijuana coming off the actors breath the guy was a little stoned probably came up on deck to clear his head thats not the top category said the actor in his laidback la drawl but its still dangerous did you know that in one day a hurricane can release as much energy as atomic bombs what size of abomb do you mean asked dave hiroshima or something bigger calgary stanford thought for a moment blinked hard and then said i dont know but either way its a lot of dead people he started to laugh you seem to know a lot about them observed dave hurricanes i mean did a movie about a hurricane once piece of shit you wouldnt have seen it but thats the kind of trivia you tend to collect when youre getting into a role he paused and looked out to sea again ive never been in a real hurricane sounds like a blast he laughed again i have said dave it was pretty scary where was that it had been when he was in homestead even behind several feet of reinforced concrete dave had thought that the place would blow down unfortunately it hadnt but for days afterward the inmates were clearing up the damage just miami he said wheres this one right now over cuba and heading northwest maybe itll blow itself out by the time it reaches us or maybe the ship will outrun it stanford snorted and said now if it was my boat that might be a possibility he pointed to the sharplooking flybridge motor yacht that occupied the space immediately in front of the britannia thats her there the comanche british built predator three k engines thats forty knots but she still sleeps eight nicelooking boat dave admitted but this ship this ship couldnt outrun orson welles he was kind of quick on his toes in the third man dave argued running through all those sewers in vienna stanford blinked blearily and snorted again not quick enough as i recall besides from what ive read about that movie welles didnt like being down in those sewers and most of those shots were covered by a body double noting the look of disappointment that momentarily clouded daves face stanford added its a very mendacious business the movies nothing is ever what it seems and nobody is ever who theyre supposed to be dave dismissed his small shattered illusion and said then to that extent i guess the movie business is just like life chapter sixteen dave met jock the dukes electrical officer and niven the second officer on their way out of the bridge wing i was going to come and check the handset on your radio wasnt i admitted jock hey no problem said dave fixed it myself but what about this hurricane is it going to catch us up do you think were on our way down to the radio room to get the latest weather report said niven youre welcome to join us sir if youre interested thanks id like to dave followed the two men along the corridor to the radio room as jock waited for a detailed weather map to be printed out on the fax machine niven said i wouldnt worry about the storm if i were you sir its my job to lay off courses and to take account of any hazards to navigation that includes storms if hurricane louisa looks like its getting too close well simply alter course and try to get out of her way nivens comment sent up a small distress signal in daves head about the rendezvous by how much do you think we would have to alter course he asked that all depends sir said niven storm force nine said jock reading the map he tore the fax off the machine and handed it to niven heading northwest toward the north atlantic plateau straight for us id better give this to the captain said niven on his way out of the radio room he called back provided louisa stays on course we should be able to sidestep her without much of a problem dave nodded although he was not much reassured by this latest news the second officers right sir said jock well probably just go a bit further south thats all might put us slightly behind schedule only you wouldnt want to be on this ship in a storm sir because of the high profile see the dukes like a floating multistorey car park whats more theres not much in the way of freeboard freeboard in the tropical zone you expect the best weather so you load more cargo with a consequent reduction in freeboard explained jock increased freeboard increases the safety of the ship in bad weather and vice versa plus were working on the summer loadline that also decreases our freeboard jock grinned and began to roll a cigarette ach dont worry yourself if we do have a problem we can always radio that submarine you really think its there jock lit his cigarette flicked a switch on the radio to change channels and dave heard the sound that he had heard before jock said there it is broadcasting right now dave remembered keach screwing around with his tracvision antenna and wondered if the signal could have anything to do with the baby doc wait a minute he said before you said you thought a sub was only a possibility that it might be one of the boats on this ship that was broadcasting aye sir that was the first possibility the sub was the second and now that i think about it theres a third as well whats that one of the boats on this ship is broadcasting to the submarine jock sucked on the cigarette with slow precision and half swallowed his inhalation of smoke you really do think its there dont you dave repeated dumbly im no sonar man said jock but there was something there on the echo sounder last time i looked its not very accurate mind all it does is give you the depth of clear water underneath the hull but anyone could see there should have been more water than there was on the sounder of course for all i know it could have been a reef or even a friendly whale but you dont really think that do you jock no sir i think its a sub what about the captain what does he think granny jock laughed all he cares about is his garden and that woman on the jade fancies his chance by all accounts he doesnt give a shit about any submarine jock flicked ash across the radio table quite exciting when you think about it a spy aboard the duke but why said dave why would anyone want to spy on this ship ah well thats the question isnt it sir why indeed jack jellicoe was sunbathing in his garden this consisted of several terracotta pots filled with lobelia and scented geraniums which were arranged around one of the bow engine towers on top of the bridge lying on his sunlounger with a coolbox of readymixed pink gins by his side and a novel by pd james the captain was in his element but he knew as soon as he saw his second officer approaching that something must be amiss niven was a competent officer and would never have disturbed him unless it was something important whats up he barked niven handed over the fax weather map sir i thought you ought to see it straight away thank you twoo jellicoe scrutinized the map carefully niven said hurricane louisa sir following us thought id better lay in a new course ive marked it up on the fax sir i see jellicoe said sourly the only problem with this new course is that it takes us straight along the tropic of cancer yes sir i thought if we stayed south the storm would pass by well north of us heading toward the azores and where do you propose that we should sail north to ourselves when we want to head toward gib and the med which is after all where we are ultimately bound well sir just north of the canary islands just north of the canaries eh jellicoe smiled bitterly and then pointed to the two brass cannon that were pointed out to sea what about those how do you mean sir in case youd forgotten we stole those from the island of lanzarote which if memory serves is one of the smaller canary islands thus placing me and my ship in rather bad odor with the local governments chief budgerigar you see my point yes sir jellicoe took another look at the map we cant possibly go anywhere near there no sir heres what well do two ive seen this kind of thing before the storm will have largely blown itself out by the time it gets to us take my word for it no well stick to our original course however just to be on the safe side tell the chief engineer to give us maximum revs well try to put some distance between ourselves and louisa itll probably get a bit rough but nothing we cant handle you know two contrary to popular opinion the best place you can be during a storm is at sea when hurricane bertha struck the american coast us navy officers ordered their ships to sea to save them from being thrown against the harbor walls that should tell you something what about the ladies on the jade sir what about them tonights their cocktail party sir oh that jellicoe took another look at the weather map and shook his head should be all over by the time the sea starts to get up you know they might not be used to this kind of thing sir i mean its going to get pretty rough oh i dont think you need worry about captain dana and her crew im sure theyve encountered a bit of squally weather in their time yes sir but a boat like that theyll be fitted with stabilizers wont they theyre not much good to them while theyre aboard the duke sir the only stabilizer on this ship is the cooks coffee thatll be all mister niven better tell the boys to go to blues its going to get cooler and tell the helmsman its steady as she goes aye sir niven started to walk away shaking his head steady as she goes fat bloody chance of that something to add mister niven no sir then get on with it jellicoe watched his second officer retreat calmly he folded away his sunlounger then collected up his coolbox his novel and the weather map heading back to his own cabin he was chuckling happily it looked very like the supernumos were going to get a real taste of the atlantic after all kate had walked down to the stern of the ship to take a closer look at the britannia and her crew and to see if she could plant another listening device on the hull the captain nicky vallbona the other crewman a guy named webb garwood and vallbonas girlfriend gay gilmore were nowhere to be seen kate strolled up and down the dock wall alongside the britannia a couple of times affecting a greater interest in the dukes engine towers and open stern but there was nothing to see except a lot of seagulls picking over the garbage floating in the dukes wake the britannia looked as shipshape as any other boat on the transport and that included the camera kate looked both ways and then knelt down to tie the lace of her boat shoe the listening device was no bigger than an earplug and it was a simple matter to lean across and stick the bug to the boats coachroof she was already walking away when a mans voice behind her brought her to a halt talk to me said the man dont just stand there i mean have you given any thought to having kids for instance half expecting to see howard standing on the dock wall behind her kate glanced around there was no one in sight your biological clock said the voice well its hardly slowing down is it honey i mean you leave it until youre in your thirties and it becomes a lot harder to conceive doesnt it kate realized that the voice was coming from an open window near the bow of the britannia who needed bugs when you had open windows not that there was anything about this conversation that was of particular interest to the fbi it could easily have been howard how often had kate heard him utter these same remarks whats it to you answered a womans voice the accent was new zealand this was gay gilmore and nicky vallbona talking whats it to me honey i kind of thought that was one of the reasons why we were going to get married to have kids is that right well you can think again mate the only biological clock ive got is the one that tells me when its time to have another fuck and its got nothing to do with having kids its just that i like fucking a lot more than i do the idea of having kids what about maternal instinct what about it every womans got some like hell they have kate stayed where she was fascinated it was like hearing actors reading dialogue she might have written for them scenes from a marriage or something of the kind so far she liked the actress playing herself listen nick ive got other plans ok if ive got a maternal instinct then its fulfilled by you licking my nipples and me remembering my mums birthday kate almost applauded she would have to remember that line motherhood is definitely not for me ive got enough problems just looking after myself nicky moaned i just dont understand a woman who doesnt want to have children there was a short silence during which kate thought about what she had in common with gay at least their choice to remain childless she wondered how much gay knew about the drugs that were hidden in the boats fuel tanks she hoped nothing at all kate was already feeling sympathetic toward her enough to want to help her out when the time came to make the bust it would be a shame if gay had to go to prison nicky vallbonas reaction on the other hand had been just like howards unreasonable and selfish gay said nicky you havent really thought about this you and i were not the kind of people to be bringing up children it wouldnt be right when we get to europe when this is all over well have lots of money why dont we just do what we do best enjoy ourselves have a good time just the two of us no worries yeah ok i guess youre right at that honey shit im not even sure why i mentioned it but im chilled you wont hear another word about this i promise kate walked sadly away sad that her own husband couldnt have been as accommodating on the issue of children as a drug smuggler and sad to hear that gay probably did know what she was involved in not having children would be a lot easier for gay when she was in prison sometimes the job was difficult in ways you could never foresee like discovering that dope smugglers could have the same conversations about ordinary human things as any lawabiding person kent bowen had just come off the radio and received the information he had requested some of it anyway when the man himself came knocking at the sliding glass door of the carreras skylounge dave said hi there hope im not disturbing you hell no said bowen keen to meet dave and get another look at the guy now that he knew a little more about who and what he was come on in maybe he did work at the financial center in miami they were still checking that out but of greater interest was the revelation that before coming into the ownership of an offshore company in grand cayman island david dulanotovs boat had been owned by a wiseguy by the name of lou malta a smalltime racketeer and former associate of naked tony nudelli one of the biggest hoods in miami it didnt prove that dave himself was a mobster but it was enough to be going on with bowen promised himself that before the voyage was out he would know everything there was to know about david dulanotov he was going to be right about this guy dulanotov was a crook you have a beautiful boat said dave whats her displacement come again the tonnage forty forty tons really id have said she looks nearer sixty myself youre probably right grinned bowen im just the owner if you want full specifications youd have to ask kate she knows everything there is to know about this boat me i just enjoy having her saying that gave him an idea maybe he could put this guy off in his own way by just dropping a broad hint that she was already spoken for in the form of a joke the kind a real owner would have made he winked at dave and the boat dave smiled thinly while bowen got off on his own joke somehow he couldnt see kate fucking this guy is kate around let me go and fetch her he said happy to leave the skylounge before dulanotov asked him any more questions about the boat that he couldnt answer even bowen thought you could play the dumb owner too far i think shes down in her room help yourself to a drink if you want one dave sat down in one of the black leather wheelhouse pilot chairs smoothing his hand over the black lacquer tops on the maple units right away he noticed that the touch control handset for the radio was still warm as was the transceivers slimline diecast aluminium casing it was only a few minutes since he had been in the radio room with jock since they had both heard the sound of another digitally scrambled broadcast from one of the boats on board the ship dave had no way of telling if the carreras radio was fitted with a scrambler all radios looked a little unusual after youd been out of circulation for five years but there could be no doubt someone had been broadcasting from the radio on this boat and if not to a submarine then to what all of which begged the question who was kent bowen and more importantly for dave who was kate parmenter hi there dave turned around and frowned kate looked like shed been crying are you ok he asked i had something in my eye she explained im fine but i must look like i just sat through gone with the wind kind of dave grinned is your boss coming back up i dont know he comes and goes yknow realizing dave probably wanted to be private with her she said tell you what ive a mind to go and see those ceremonial cannon the ones that captain jellicoe stole from whoever it was shall we go and take a look they crossed over onto the juarista and then climbed up onto the dukes dock wall coming along the starboard side of the jade dave said the reason i stopped by was to find out if you were going to the party tonight only if you are she said not that kent would let us miss it ever since he found out what kind of films they make his tongues been hanging out the man has a libido thats as big as his boat except he probably thinks a libido is something the french wash their feet in dave laughed and led the way up the gangway to the accommodations block are you and he jesus no whatever gave you that idea as a matter of fact he did what youre kidding just a remark he made nothing specific but he seemed to imply there was something going on between you that bastard the only thing thats ever been going on between us is me putting up with all his bullshit what does he do anyway you mean when hes not being an asshole kate had given some thought to kent bowens cover story bowen had wanted to claim he was something glamorous like a film executive or even a writer but kate had managed to persuade him that it should only be something he actually knew about maybe she could also persuade him to throw himself overboard and save her the trouble of doing it he owns a string of shops selling security and countersurveillance merchandise you know the kind of thing bugs that look like electrical plugs and little safes that are inside a dummy can of coke paranoid shit for paranoid times kate paused to light a cigarette and then followed dave all the way forward to the bow of the boat the sunlounger was still there but the coolbox and jellicoe were gone he wants to open a chain of spy stores across europe she lied smoothly tech direct thats what the shops in the states are called anyway theres this big trade fair for all kinds of electronic gadgetry in barcelona in two or three weeks time kind of every man his own james bond thats where were headed after we get to mallorca dave nodded asking himself if any of this might help explain why kent bowen had been using a digital scrambler on his radio meanwhile kate thought it was time she changed the subject what about you she asked what takes you to europe the monaco grand prix dave lied with equal facility i like to watch motor racing after that were sailing to cap dantibes ive rented a house there for the summer by yourself some friendsll probably drop by from england a gentle breeze stirred kates hair and dave found himself reaching to touch it her hair felt like silk against his hand there was her perfume to think about too after homestead all women smelt good to dave but kate smelt especially good like something rich and luxurious he said you should come by yourself that is if you can get away from q miss moneypenny i wonder how many other girls youve invited down there youre the first said dave in loves affairs im a sweet beginner that i dont believe i feed on hopes uncertain dinner kate checked herself realizing he was reciting something again for me the object on lifes chart is mysterious and enticing something to think hard about suspecting that wonders will accumulate and so im sure a kindred spirit will be joined to me by fate she could hardly help but feel impressed whos that she asked van morrison again dave shook his head it sounds better in russian no its pushkin freely rendered kate smiled and said i wasnt offering to pay but its nice did pushkin find his kindred spirit yes but it wasnt a happy ending what happened someone shot him guy called danthes no gun law can stop a madman she shrugged if as you said i can get away from q id love to come visit cap dantibes huh i guess its very chic down there like valentino thats the part that worries me alone in a foreign country without even a native guide anything could happen last night it almost did kate smiled and said last night oh that wasnt anything at all that was just sex today it feels more like a subject on oprah a whole show how the two of us met or some stuff like that dont worry said dave i feel the same way dantibes danthes dont worry youre a regular red light you know that van anyone would think youre trying to send me some kind of signal hailing on all frequencies lieutenant uhura go ahead captain it sounds kind of stupid but im falling in love with you maybe it wasnt exactly love at first sight if thats what it was id have said so yesterday but it runs a pretty close second photofinish id say kate stroked daves cheek with the back of her hand besides its having second sight that counts ask any fortune teller you know something van you remind me of my lawyer dave laughed your lawyer hows that you remind me to call him and find out whats holding up my divorce do you think you and i would make a good team could be he paused for a second as he deliberated the best way of checking her out it was one thing for her to say she loved him after all she thought he was a regular guy or as regular as you could be when you also happened to be a millionaire it would be quite another thing for her to say that she was willing to hook up with a thief and not just any thief a very uncommon thief together you and i we could make some real money yeah wouldnt you like to make some real money that all depends on what id have to do to get it i dont see the two of us winning a mixed doubles at forest hills what if i told you i was about to play a game of cards with four aces in my hand id ask if this hand was on the table or up your sleeve dave was silent uhoh said kate sounds like theres a racket involved after all i dont know van id say monte carlos a pretty neat place to go with four aces what if i said it was five aces theyve got names for people like that van numbers too and you have to watch your ass when youre taking a shower she grinned uncertainly this is a joke isnt it youre not a gambler are you i was speaking metaphorically said dave oh i see a metaphor im glad here was me thinking maybe id met a cheat but there are risks involved and high stakes for big rewards kate kept on smiling she felt if she stopped she might find it hard to start it up again the conversation had gone in a completely unexpected direction for a moment there shed thought they were going to declare undying love and talk about getting married but now she didnt know what to think she said next thing youll be telling me youre really some kind of highclass jewel thief now living quietly in a hilltop villa on the cote dazur like cary grant in to catch a thief come on dave what is this dave considered the suggestion carefully for a second or two why not being a highclass jewel thief would do very nicely for the kind of litmus test he had in mind after all if she was prepared to take on a cat burglar then she ought to be prepared to take on a pirate or whatever you wanted to call a guy who took down a score on board a ship im perfectly serious kate still trying to keep her good humor kates smile became a little strained she said to be quite frank with you ive never seen myself in any of grace kellys roles for one thing im a much better driver for another well for another does that film have a happy ending or not i cant remember and wasnt cary grant a reformed jewel thief trying to clear his name she stopped exasperated good humor disappearing now jesus david you dont do this kind of thing to a girl youve just fallen in love with you know when people get married and they say for richer for poorer for better for worse theres nothing about for right and for wrong now she was feeling anxious like shed won the lottery and couldnt find her ticket its not supposed to happen like this look maybe you got the wrong idea about me that rita hayworth gilda thing last night it was just an act im just a smalltown girl from tville remember what happened to the girl from the space coast houston weve got a problem i think the rocket just blew up on the launch pad dave kissed her again as if to reassure her then he said are you sure about that no she said weakly and kissed him back but ive got a feeling im not going to land on the moon my guidance systems have gone haywire you just need some time to get them realigned thats all you can still complete your mission if you say so kate smiled wryly listen to me dave can we talk sensibly for a moment this isnt a movie this is real whats real someone once said that we wouldnt know how to fall in love if we hadnt read about it first well its kind of the same with movies maybe even more so sometimes when i look back on my life all that i can remember are the good movies and favorite tv shows most of the best times ive had have been in movie theaters i think thats true of people everywhere kate some of our most extraordinary experiences are in the movies not watching them you understand because if its a good movie its like youre part of it now thats what i call virtual reality not some motorcycle helmet you have to stick on your head to see the hand in front of your face dave shrugged so whats real i dont know what i am sure about is that things are only as ordinary as you want them to be if you want your life to feel as exciting as a movie then thats the way youve got to live it kate laughed and kissed him quickly ok she said what have been your most extraordinary experiences dave thought for a second then he said walking into town with the wild bunch easy riding a motorcycle alongside captain america running north by northwest from that cropdusting airplane being seduced by mrs robinson escaping through viennas sewer system showing a clean pair of heels to a tenton rollerball in an inca temple riding a chariot against messala in the circus at antioch destroying the death star with my last missile playing chess with death kissing hedy lamarr kissing grace kelly kissing you youre right you have had an interesting life its like i told you kate everyone has movie moments they remember and this can be one of them if you want it to be you could be right said kate but like you also said i need some more time to think about how im going to play this particular scene dont take too long about it urged dave in a few days we start shooting chapter seventeen guests arriving on board the jade entered an atrium incorporating a lifesize sculpture featuring a naked girl being penetrated from each end by two wellendowed men the sculpture which was also the logo of jade films was executed in considerable anatomical detail this and the organic staircase surrounding it provided the yachts focal point greeted by rachel dana and her crew in the spectacular reception area in front of this atrium the guests were each handed a glass of cristal and told that movies were on continuous show in the special theater that was to be found at the top of the curving mahogany staircase as soon as al saw the sculpture he felt sure this was a party he was going to enjoy a wolfish grin spreading on his blunt features he said to dave will you take a look at that fuckin artwork boy i sure wish tony was here to see this hes a real art lover buys quite a bit of sculpture himself hed love to have that in his collection sounds as if tonys a regular solomon guggenheim said dave i bet hes got norman rockwells dali prints tretchikopfs everything he knows what he likes yknow when it comes to buying art nearly everyone has the same problem said dave others arriving at the party looked at the sculpture and seemed less certain of enjoying themselves among them kate and captain jellicoe its by evelyn bywater explained rachel an english artist dont you mean proctologist said kate her work is very well known throughout europe and the far east shes is something of an institution in japan is that institution as in mental institution said kate and left jellicoes side to go and talk to sam brockman jesus whats wrong with her said rachel youd think shed never seen a naked human body before what about you captain do you like our work of art well he swallowed i know nothing about art we see very little of that kind of thing in the merchant navy but i do have some rather nice prints in my cabin old schooners tea clippers and british warships but nothing like that no indeed jellicoe frowned what sort of films does your company make anyway theres one showing upstairs if youre interested seems hardly sociable to clear off upstairs jellicoe said stiffly television killing the art of good conversation and all that sort of thing ive only just got here rachel took his arm in hers and said come with me i think youll find it interesting most people seem to think our films are actually an aid to conversation kind of a therapeutic thing yknow its not like television at all and you wouldnt have seen any of our films on tv i can guarantee it were much more videooriented she led jellicoe up to the viewing theater under the envious eyes of kent bowen its ok kate told him shes taking him up to the viewing theater not her bedroom theyre screening movies up there jade movies i thought that would interest you sam brockman raised his eyebrows and said what are they showing bowen laughed coarsely its not reruns of the brady bunch you can be sure of that jade films are in the hardcore porno market said kate is that so brockman sounded genuinely surprised you know ive never seen a real porno movie bowen glanced at kate teetering on the edge of ridiculing the coast guard lieutenant before suddenly realizing that this could work as a strategy to circumvent kates contempt he said you know something sam neither have i what do you say we go and take a look for ourselves kate fixed bowen with a gimlet eye while she could easily believe sam she found bowens show of innocence harder to swallow yeah come on kate said brockman chill out it might be a blast maybe shes already seen one offered bowen i have not kate was sufficiently well informed about what went on in real hardcore porno to know that howards subscription to the playboy channel hardly qualified as the real thing what do you take me for itll be an experience urged brockman kate thought poor sam was looking more and more like some horny highschool kid his glasses were a tad foggy and by now it was obvious that he really hadnt ever seen a porno movie and badly wanted to remedy this omission an experience kate snorted an experience is generally what you learn to call an error in judgment brockman raised his glass of champagne then heres to errors in judgment he said things would be dullsville arizona without a few of them which so far has been my own lifes story sam brockman theyll say exemplary career no mistakes but the ceo of bromide incorporated kate smiled sympathetically she had much the same opinion of her own life with howard parmenter being her only major aberration filing for divorce had been the most interesting thing that had happened to her in ages that and setting up her undercover operation aboard the duke seeing dave coming toward her she suddenly perceived an extra dimension to what sam was talking about life was about taking risks and not always calculated risks either maybe even a risk like dave sure making a mistake was always unfortunate but not to have the opportunity of making a mistake was a catastrophe ok she said why not attagirl said brockman you only live once thats been the prevailing theory said kate and indicated the staircase you guys go on ahead ill catch you up she watched them go up the stairs and then turned to face dave hi hi for a moment neither of them spoke then kate said ive been thinking about what you said come to any decisions i havent ruled anything out the seas a pretty good place to float an idea he said its all to do with the freshwater allowance to kates keen perception dave looked and sounded just a little distracted dont tell me you have to pay duty on water as well fresh water has a lower density than sea water he explained things float deeper in fresh water theres an fmark on the ships plimsoll line difference between s and f is known as the freshwater allowance you and i are nearer s than f im surprised you didnt know that you being a boat captain kate lit a cigarette whats this the master mariners certificate maybe youd like to put me through my paces see if i can fit new impellers in the dark that kind of thing when dave made no reply she smiled and said dont tell me youve never heard of impellers dave looked ready to admit defeat its like a propeller she said mischievously oh yeah i think i know only spelt different more im than pro matter of fact thats really only as far as the similarity goes she smiled triumphantly if the impeller packs up so does your fuel pump and so does your diesel so its important to be able to get it out and fit a new one even at sea in the dark in a storm can be kind of tricky if you dont know how she blew some smoke across his shoulder and watched the grin spread on his face dave jerked his head toward the top of the stairs what were you guys talking about theyd just finished persuading me to go and take a look at the hardcore action thats where al is said dave hes a real movie fan sees everything thats whats on show said kate everything you want to take a look sure kate was a little disappointed she had hoped hed be the type to shake his head at the very idea of watching porno instead here he was taking her by the elbow and steering her toward the movie theater upstairs he could at least have pretended to disapprove for a minute or two anyway she was swiftly coming to the conclusion that all men were probably interested in this kind of shit she said beats me why more guys just dont become gynecologists relaxation becomes harder to find when a mans hobby becomes his work said dave is that an observation based on personal experience that and a lot of wishful thinking youre no gay bachelor ill say that much for you van she felt his hand in the small of her back as they mounted the stairs near the top he stopped and took a step down again suddenly i need to visit the head he admitted i thought that was after youd seen the movie you go on in ill be there in one minute he said one minute in a movie like this you could miss the whole story as long as its got a happy end i dont mind kate started upstairs again happy endings are what this craps all about lots of them in slippery closeup dave thought he had about ten minutes before kate started to get suspicious he left the jade from her stern climbing straight onto the juarista and then onto the carrera a minute after leaving kate at the party he was down the circular stair mat connected the carreras salon and dining room with the midship accommodations deck the master suite was the full width of the boat and featured a sitting area a large walkin closet and a generous bathroom with a jacuzzi dave guessed this was the cabin occupied by kent bowen lying on the floor of the closet were some garishly colored sports shirts he thought he had seen bowen wearing and there was no mistaking the sweet antiseptic smell of brut aftershave that always signalled bowens presence quickly dave opened some of the drawers and almost immediately found what he was looking for a mediumframe magnum in a propak undercover shoulder holster and a wallet containing business cards dave thumbed one out and read it quickly the embossed gold roundel in the top lefthand corner of the card was easily recognizable it identified the department of justice just as surely as the printed information alongside kent bowen was an assistant special agent in charge at miamis fbi hq on second avenue jesus christ he exclaimed dave replaced the card closed the drawer carefully and then went next door to search kates stateroom this was tidier than bowens the bed was made with cushions scattered across the silk brocade spread clothes were neatly hung in the closet but there was nothing in the builtin drawers to interest dave apart from some very sexy underwear just the facts maam he muttered and closing the drawer he backed out of the closet his heel struck something hard underneath the spread guessing that there was probably a linen drawer under the bed just like the one in his own stateroom dave dropped to his knees threw back the spread and grabbed hold of the drawer handle hauling it open he found everything he would have expected to find in a linen drawer he had to reach right to the back to put his hand on the familiar shape hed been half expecting the next second he was looking at a smith wesson airweight holstered in a nice leather vega although the guns shrouded hammer made it about perfect for a handbag attached to the holsters strap was an id wallet containing an fbi badge and card identifying kate not as kate parmenter but as kate furey special agent she looked younger in the photograph and her hair was different but there was no mistaking that launchathousandships face dave nodded with bitter satisfaction he didnt know whether to whoop or to wail a fed he mumbled shes a goddamn lousy fed the only question was what she and bowen and the other guy who was probably a fed too were doing on the duke there was no way they could know about daves score unless it was the money they were onto fucking feds he dived back into the drawer in search of something that might tell him what this was all about but found nothing he shut the drawer and went into the head his eyes noted the brand of her perfume for future reference a small bottle of murine eyedrops some suntan lotion and an impressive array of mouthwash dental floss toothpicks and plaquedisclosing tablets that helped explain kates ford model smile the drawers were empty but in a closet under the basin he found a teac reeltoreel tape machine the kind of tape that wasnt meant to play handels water music when you were lying in the tub dave knew it was set up to record from some kind of listening device but planted where on whose boat twisting a knob he rewound the tape for a couple of seconds the least he could do in the time available was verify that the feds werent interested in him or in the russkie money the tape began to play he was listening to the voices of a man and a woman the man was american but the woman sounded as if she was from australia the accent would help to narrow it down not that it really mattered none of the russian boats had any female supernumos and these two werent saying anything interesting just some shit about this and that dave switched the tape off and started to grin the feds were watching someone elses boat someone dave didnt even know about everything was fine his five year plan could go ahead more or less as scheduled submarine permitting and seeing those fbi shields and id cards had given him an idea for about ten minutes kate was too shocked to notice daves prolonged absence her imagination was abruptly ordered somewhere else as not the smallest aspect of human anatomy escaped the attention of the camera every mucous tract subcutaneous fold and sebaceous follicle but what was most surprising to her was not the explicit intimacy of what was depicted but that there should be any women who were still willing to have unprotected anal intercourse just where had these women been for the last ten virally preoccupied years did they imagine that just because they were doing it in a movie they would be protected by the special effects department almost as fascinating to kate as what was happening on the screen were the faces of the audience bowen grinning like an ape sam brockman cleaning his glasses every few minutes and making a silent whistling noise from time to time rachel dana watching jellicoe and enjoying his thunderstruck demeanor two of the targets from the britannia nicky vallbona and webb garwood laughing loudly and cracking the most tasteless jokes kate wondered if bowen had even registered that they were there shed heard men howard was one such claim that porno was boring but somehow shed never quite believed it bowen looked anything but bored even in the halfdarkness of the jades viewing theater she could see a light sheen of sweat glistening on his upper lip which he wiped periodically with the back of his hand but after a while she realized she really was bored it wasnt so much the lack of story she found tedious as the monotonous serial continuity as if what was being enacted was a precise ritual the girl always sucked the man before he licked her then always he penetrated her vagina as a prelude to sodomy before finally he came all over her face as if by this final act of degradation the reality of what was happening was there revealed to kate this last act in the ritual pointed up the lie of porno no man had ever come in her face and if it ever did happen woe betide the guy who thought he could get away with that shit she would hardly have been disposed to treat his load as if it had been the choicest beluga dave sat down beside her and said arent you grossed out yet where have you been she demanded i got detained did you know calgary stanford is on this ship the movie actor ive just been talking to him whats he like kind of ordinary really dave glanced around the little theater and caught sight of al and then one of the guys from the baby doc als face was something by goya grotesque kate was shaking her head she said people just do not behave like this even in movies they dont go around fucking each other like rabbits its just not feasible dave looked sideways at her and said feasible you sound like youve got the latest nielsen figures on this one kate he looked back up at the screen and then grimaced anyway these arent movies not the ones i go to hey im the one whos supposed to say that cmon she said lets get out of here before the next money shot while ive still got an appetite going downstairs dave said why dont you come back to my boat and let me make you a sandwich sounds good besides i need a little air the breathings getting kind of noticeable in there like a locker room in winter now i know what its like to sit in a car with a hosepipe attached to the exhaust i guess thats why its called a blue movie kate watched dave make the sandwiches he did it carefully and with a touch of panache as if he enjoyed cooking and preparing food in some ways he was quite the new man in others he was reassuringly like all the old ones she liked the way he wasnt always speaking as if he was used to his own company and didnt mind it selfcontained she thought you can be quiet if you want van she said i dont mind i like a bit of dolby in my men the thing that cuts down on noise yknow like an electronic blue pencil i bet youre the kind to let a girl talk herself into bed could be dave returned to the sofa with a plate of neatly cut sandwiches kate waited until he had picked one up and was teeing up his first mouthful she said take me to bed van right now no more hardboiled from now on im ziplipped dave looked at her and then back at his sandwich which stayed about an inch away from his mouth he said you mean right now before i think about it some more and change my mind kate had no intention of changing her mind maybe she did have one or two reservations about what he had told her her best guess was that he had fed her this story in order to find out if it was him or his money she was really interested in she would probably have done the same thing herself she understood about money even if she was not much interested in it herself for howard money had been the major motivation of nearly everything he did he was driven by money as if it turned up at the start of every day with a peaked cap and a mobile phone for kate it was merely the means to an end and right now it had little or no relevance to what she wanted most which was to go to bed with dave but she enjoyed making him choose between having a sandwich and having her she leaned toward him and nuzzled his ear with the tip of her nose where im taking you now she said the cookings wonderful painstakingly prepared and the service is excellent so dont even think about eating anything else not if you ever want to be welcome back to this restaurant dave put down his sandwich he was hungry but there were some things better done on an empty stomach did you sleep ok dave stretched on his kingsized bed and rolled toward her weird he said i dreamed i had alzheimers disease only trouble is ive forgotten what happened kate glanced at her watch still joking at six oclock in the morning i see dave grinned and rolled on top of her can you think of anything else to do i could make you breakfast she offered i feel kind of guilty about making you sacrifice that sandwich ive forgotten about that too breakfast sounds good though i could eat a horse as he slipped out of bed kate said i already did dave grinned again you havent forgotten about my proposition have you he asked what proposition is that lover you know living with the famous phantom in the south of france oh yeah that the pink panther thing no i hadnt forgotten about it im like an elephant i never forget a name or a face dave nodded a good memory for names and faces was probably a job requirement for a fed and this is some kind of test right like the three caskets in the merchant of venice gold silver and lead kate searched daves face for some sign that he recognized she knew what he was up to all that glisters is not gold so which is it to be she rolled across the crumpled sheets toward him and sat up with you i dont know if i said i chose lead youd probably shoot me kate wagged her finger at him come on dave im not interested in the money dave flinched what money your money the dulanotov family fortune oh that he lit a cigarette maybe i didnt make myself clear but its like i told you the moneys based on crime theres no family fortune im a thief kate i steal for a living like old cary grant she shrugged ok if you say so well then i havent ruled out becoming grace not yet like hell she hasnt thought dave and went to take a shower kate frowned he really was serious about this test of his couldnt he see she wasnt remotely interested in his money as soon as she heard the water running kate started to search the room it wasnt that she shared kent bowens suspicions of him that was just stupid jealousy but dave volunteered so little about himself and she wanted to know more than the crumbs she had gleaned from the few questions he had honored with straight answers she didnt think for a moment he was a thief how many thieves knew shakespeare and pushkin but there was something he wasnt telling her of that she was sure something that she needed to find out at the fbi training academy she had learned to recognize when someone was hiding something for a brief period in her early career she had entertained notions of joining the behavioral science unit but after the silence of the lambs came along it seemed that everyone wanted to be jack crawford or clarice starling and she had ended up in general investigations and narcotics now looking over the room she had no idea what she was searching for the large number of books only seemed to underline what she already knew that dave was widely read most of the clothes in his closet were predictably new and came from expensive shops as she had expected there was no cash lying around nor any travellers cheques credit cards not even a drivers license most infuriating of all she could not find daves passport the explanation was inside daves walkin closet a combination wall safe just what any selfrespecting millionaire would have had you didnt stay rich by leaving money lying around kate came out of the closet and sat on the edge of the bed if only she had taken the safecracking course instead of psychology absently she stared at daves bookshelf it was like a reading list for a summer school many of the titles were classics tolstoy turgenev dostoevsky nabokov even a few published movie scripts a nod to post modernism some philosophy too wittgenstein kierkegaard gilbert ryle and george steiner but the more she stared at the books the more it started to seem that for all its apparent inclusiveness there was something missing like a piece from a cutlery set yes that was it and not just one piece maybe one whole item like a set of fish knives gradually she perceived what it was there were no books on business not one and this struck her as curious millionaires were interested in money werent they especially if they worked in miamis financial center howard had been forever reading books about making money beating the dow one up on wall street the midas touch the three minute manager he must have bought that one just around the time he was reading the two minute lover kate picked out daves wellthumbed paperback edition of crime and punishment she hadnt read the novel since shed been in law school when it really had seemed like one of those books that might change your life or at the very least the way you thought about criminals idly she was turning back the cover when something caught her eye something was printed there on the inside cover in bright blue ink something was stamped on it she stared at it incredulously as if she had been admiring some clever bookplate reading the words printed inside the simple roundel with more care than if they had been a visa on the passport for which she had been searching but this was something much more revealing she whispered the words out loud as if she needed to hear them spoken in order to absorb what was implied property of the miami correctional center at homestead could it be that dave really was a thief and not just a thief but an excon hearing his shower end she closed the book and returned it quickly to the shelf then slipping into the spare dressing gown she left the stateroom and went up to the galley maybe she could rustle up a relaxed loving and laidback sort of face along with some breakfast in the galley kate put on the kettle to boil and started to fry some ham and eggs all the while considering the evidence that was before her the new clothes the bookshelf more typical of some jailhouse autodidact than a millionaire and the five aces cary grantstyle proposition he had made her there seemed to be no other conclusion that she could form dave really was a thief and a convicted one too she realized that he had been perfectly serious as indeed he had said he was al summoned upstairs to the galley by the smell of fresh coffee and frying sausage and ham brought home to her this wasnt a cary grant movie al was luca brazzi tony montana and jimmy conway all squeezed into the one shortbarrelled pumpaction shotgun right down to the rifle sight the hardwood stock attitude and the blue metal jaw time is it he growled just after six she said perky as an airline stewardess responding to a firstclass passenger you got all sorts going first class these days six oclock jesus what are we doing abandoning ship or something six oclock you want some breakfast al sighed uncomfortably and stooped to look out of the galley window checking on the weather he sniffed loudly like he was hunched over a couple of lines of coke and said i cant make up my mind if its better to eat so that i got something to throw up or if its better not to eat so that i dont throw up at all kate smiled sweetly trying to overcome her nerves who were these guys and what were they doing on the ship was it possible they had anything to do with rocky envigado al she said have you heard the expression the cook could use a hug this particular cook only requires a yes please or a no thankyou the ultimate destination of this food im cooking be it toilet bowl or ocean is of absolutely no account to me al grunted biliously uncertainly he eyed the breakfast kate was cooking rubbing his bare belly for he was only wearing shorts he said maybe ill just have some wheaties have you got a hangover or something naw im feeling sick in anticipation of feeling sick on account of the weather al poured out a bowlful of cereal then some milk and began to shovel the stuff into his mouth the weather what about it you dont notice it huh he remarked with milk dribbling down his unshaven chin must be another good sailor like the boss kate glanced out the window what with making love and her shock discovery about dave she had hardly noticed the swell underneath the ship outside the sky was gray and threatening and a stiff breeze was whipping the flag on the stern of the jade in front of them it looked as if the storm was catching up to them after all me i aint much of a sailor confessed al i get sick looking at a glass of salt water it does look kind of rough kate admitted coming into the galley dave said are you talking about al or the weather al sneered dumped his empty bowl in the sink and reached for the coffee jug kate stepped fastidiously out of his way as from a large and smelly dog noticing her flinch from als bare torso dave said couldnt you put a shirt or something on al its like having a giant coconut rolling around in here al slurped some coffee and said some women like hairy men dave said dian fossey and fay wray dont happen to be sailing with us let me tell you about this gorilla thing said al hairy guys have got more intelligence than smooth as shit ones like yourself boss now thats a fact it was in the herald scientists have done a survey and proved it smart guys have hairy chests lotta doctors lotta college professors not many lawyers no cops lotta writers and the really smart guys have hairy backs to match say anything about hairy brains in that survey al laughed dave he looked at kate who smiled back at him faintly well thats a new one on me it certainly puts a different spin on the story of samson i suppose its not the guys relationship with god she screws when she cuts his hair but his iq you can laugh all you like said al marching out of the galley but thats a fact kate cleared her throat nervously and kept on trying to get her smile right even when dave smiled apologetically now that she saw him again he did look like he might be a highclass jewel thief he probably relied on al to drive his getaway car or to provide muscle when it was required when al had gone dave shook his head al he said simply some guy huh i told you he was an animal i think thats the first time ive seen the two of you together she said thats easy to explain folding her up in his arms dave inspected the breakfast that al had declined were like jekyll and hyde mmmm that looks good and which one of you is mister hyde well he is of course didnt you notice the hair on the backs of his hands the guys like a goddamn doormat kate pulled away and started to serve dave his breakfast something the matter he asked you still cool about last night everythings fine she said and anxious to reassure him she added you know what she said if you were mister hyde id be missus seek that sounds promising he wondered if there was anything at all in her show of prevarication was she just trying to amuse herself during an otherwise uneventful undercover surveillance or was there genuinely something more there it seemed impossible to find out until the heist itself was out of the way he sat down at the dinette table and began to eat what was put in front of him he said im sure id rather share a divided consciousness with you than with al think about it a fiftyfifty partnership straight down the middle kate said straight youve hardly been that his mouth full of food dave stretched his eyebrows back at her what i mean to say she explained hurriedly is that youve not exactly told me very much about what you do i cant just leave kents employment without knowing a little more about you about what you do about where you live i told you said dave i steal rocks same as old john robie in to catch a thief the cat actually i dont bother with a handle or a white monogrammed glove theres no point in making it easy for the police to nail me for a lot of other scores in the unlikely eventuality that i get caught naturally i only steal from those who can afford it matter of fact i thought there might be some nice stones on this ship until i discovered the owners seldom travel with their boats that was before the air traffic controllers heard about my predicament and decided to try and help out its over said kate the strike it was on the radio yesterday afternoon is that so well this trip has been very disappointing at least from a professional pov no jewels no cash not even a small picasso makes you wonder what people are spending their money on these days security and porno i guess theres not much of a margin in that for someone like me kate he sighed i hope things are better on the cote dazure youre really serious about this im always serious about partnership kate after last night you should know that but for another reason too i already have a partner theres al to consider kate felt herself recovering some of her poise replacing al well its very flattering she said but you know business could sound more promising you could try selling me the terms of our agreement whats in it for me what can i do that kind of thing ive told you thats not my style besides you know the terms yesterday i heard you say them yourself for richer for poorer for better for worse fiftyfifty kate with all my worldly goods i thee endow what do you say youre really asking me to marry you dave forked some ham into his mouth and nodded kate smiled but i dont even know you people who dont know each other get married every day i know i read it in the paper she sat down opposite him flabbergasted would he be half as keen to marry her if he knew she was a fed when does your divorce come through he asked couple of months get married then he was enjoying her predicament he sensed that she loved him as much as he loved her perhaps she even wanted to marry him and but for her being a special agent working undercover she might have agreed at the same time he was thinking how good it had been last night and how comfortable he felt with her now how reluctant he would be to leave her time was running out fast in eighteen hours he and al were going to do the job after that he might never see her again the truth was that he meant what he said if keeping her had been merely a matter of marrying her he would have done it right away about the only card he had left to play was that he knew what she was a fed but he would only play that one when the time came to leave when she knew more or less everything but not before you like going fast dont you van im going to the monaco grand prix remember i thought it was the financial guy who was going not john robie grand prix is good for cat burglars makes a lot of noise people dont hear much during and after a formula one motor race and monte carlo is always monte carlo therere always a lot of stones around its like tiffanys with a roulette wheel and a nice beach dave straightened his knife and fork and reached across the table to curl a length of kates hair around in his fingers she hadnt had a shower yet and she still smelt great shouldnt be too much of a problem for a girl from the space coast the kind of girl who wears allure how did you know i wore that i recognize it its my favorite perfume at least it is now kate cupped his hand to her cheek and sighed wistfully howard didnt know one brand of perfume from cigar smoke it was just her luck to find a guy who had fallen in love with her at first sight when she was pretending to be someone else a guy who knew poetry a guy who was not a selfish lover a guy who knew perfume a guy who was a thief and an excon it was just another of the curved balls life was wont to pitch at you she stood up i still need some more time she said glancing automatically at her watch and id better be getting back kent gets a little funny about this kind of thing dave was hardly surprised by this information in his experience the feds could get funny about all kinds of things chapter eighteen dave was reading a book when he heard a footfall on the cockpit deck it was the ships electrical officer jock no longer wearing white he was wrapped in a thick woollen navy blue sweater and navy blue pants come tae look at your boat check your ropes are all holding up and are they for now but if the storm catches up wi us we could all have some problems right now were just ahead of it making good time were going like a racing dogs cock but were still on course oh aye on course right enough but if this keeps up well be arriving well ahead of schedule dave frowned being early for the rendezvous might be every bit as disastrous for the heist as being late how much ahead cant say for sure soon as the weather improves well get a better idea by the way hows your handset dave said nothing distracted by the latest information it looked like they were going to spend more time aboard the getaway boat than he had figured from now on he would need to keep a close eye on their position with the aid of the boats gps receiver about the same size as a cellular telephone the gps could accurately tell you where you were in what direction you were heading and how fast you were going every time you turned on the receiver it worked out its location by tracking the signals broadcast by satellites in the gps constellation until it had enough information to determine its own relative position jock repeated his question oh still working ok thanks you want a beer why not might as well be wet inside as well as out dave glanced out of the window rain lashed the roof of the juarista and even behind the walls of the duke the boats deck felt more like a surfboard he handed jock a corona right he said its like moby dick out there a wee bit tricky walking along the ships walls jock admitted but not half as bad as we thought the skipper was right it should blow itself out soon enough jock drained half the beer from the bottle hearing a loud retching noise from the bowels of daves boat he glanced at the stairwell he grinned slightly and said someones uncle dick are they dave frowned momentarily as his ears and understanding tried to penetrate the scotsmans speech finally it dawned on him yeah its al hes not a good sailor he seemed unconcerned although he was growing worried by the thought that he might end up tackling the score on his own the only possible benefit of the bad weather was that the crews of the russkie boats might be feeling as sick as al but youre all right said jock im fine dave said you wouldnt happen to have something i could give him would you ive tried kwells and other shit like that but they dont seem to help jock finished his beer and pulled a face that stuffs for kids he said what other shit have you tried antihistamine didnt work either just made him sleep for a bit when was his last dose of that hours ago well if its me i take hyoscine blocks the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system stuffs commonly used as a preanesthetic to prevent reflex vagal stimulation of the heart theres nothing sympathetic about als nervous system said dave im not even sure hes got a heart he lit a cigarette what are you some kind of doctor as well on this ship aye my father was a veterinary surgeon i learned a lot from him he shrugged bastards on this ship are all animals anyway so it makes no bloody difference he took one of the cigarettes dave had offered him and lit it quickly does your pal suffer from glaucoma at all dave had no idea but he shook his head anyway sensing that jock was about to prescribe something useful the hyoscine perhaps aye well ive got some scopoderm its good stuff not available over the counter he pinched the cigarette from the corner of his mouth and inhaled through clenched teeth expensive though if you know what i mean dave thought he did and grinned back at him i think so jock looked apologetic youre the one with the flash boat not me im just trying to make ends meet how much fifty bucks enough to see you through the bad weather done jock took a small packet from his pocket you had it with you quite a few people are feeling like shit today laughed jock business is good thats a nice little racket said dave handing over the five hamiltons you make it any way you can sure do agreed dave these are tablets and plasters jock explained giving dave the packet give him one tablet now and stick a plaster to his arm hell have difficulty in passing water maybe blur his vision a bit and itll stop him sweating altogether i cant wait said dave how soon does this shit kick in right away an hour should see him on his feet again then one of the plasters and one of the pills every six hours just dont mix the stuff with any alcohol right thanks for the beer pleasure doing business with you doc jock walked precipitously toward the stern oh yeah i meant to tell you that sub i reckon its gone no ones been broadcasting in a while and theres nothing on the echosounder must have got bored and pissed off must have done agreed dave its that kind of voyage said jock i cant think why i ever imagined going to sea would be more interesting than becoming a vet nothing ever bloody well happens on this boat no i guess not al was lying on the floor one arm wrapped around the toilet bowl as if it was his best friend dave knelt down wrapped one of als anacondasized arms around his own neck and dragged him into the stateroom one thing i like about you al you know your proper station in life its been a pleasure sailing with you you know a guy out of the can like me its been a great comfort to have been around someone lower than myself fuck you groaned al dave dropped him onto the bed and finding a towel he began to dry als arms carefully the doc was just by to give you something said dave to be completely honest with you hes really a vet but i knew you wouldnt hold that against him you being a fuckin gorilla nall dave unwrapped the supply of scopoderm and taped a plaster to the inside of each chunky forearm normally the guy only treats domestic animals but i persuaded him to make an exception in your case i told him to pretend you were a domestic ass and yknow something he didnt seem to have any problem with that dave placed one of jocks tablets on als lolling beige sock of a tongue and then closed his jaw before reaching for the glass of water on the bedside table the glass was in his hand and then almost on the floor as he realized with disgust that the water covered a set of dental plates jesus what the fuck is this dave laughed and then lifted als slack lip on the edge of his finger grinning his own teeth shining perfectly dave peered into als pukey mouth he said man theres not one tooth in the whole fucking bowling ball dave kept on looking fascinated and feeling like the bitch in king lear come to gloat over some old guys empty eye sockets until als big hairy paw swept daves hand away fuck you ok you gotta sit up now and swallow this bitter little pill al make you feel better its a seasickness pill so be a good fellow and just swallow the goddamn thing stuff cost me fifty bucks al sat up swallowed the pill and taking the glass out of daves hand drained it of the water covering his dentures you bastard he whispered and collapsed back onto the bed yeah i know all my patients say the same thing my manners more dockside than bedside dave wiped als forehead with the towel takes a little while for the scopoderm to kick in the dopes attached to your arms as well just in case your stomachs paying less attention than your brain just one note of precaution no booze while youre tripping on this stuff that means no booze until were off this ship right you and i have got a job to do dave glanced at his watch in less than twelve hours you want some character motivation then think about that for a while this time tomorrow you and i are going to be multimillionaires so said sam brockman were on our own now excepting when theres a nato exercise the navy generally stays this side of the atlantic it makes things less complicated for the asw people asw antisubmarine warfare he told kate frenchll pick us up in a few hours just west of the azores he sighed shit what just that i almost wish something would happen seems kind of a shame to hand the collar over to interpol kate agreed without much enthusiasm for her there was more than enough happening already more than she had bargained for anyway since breakfast she had stayed on the carrera grateful that the bad weather gave her the excuse not to go up on deck and see dave perhaps it was as well the sub had gone it meant that there was no temptation to get a message relayed back to fbi hq and check on daves criminal record assuming dulanotov was his real name a very greenlooking kent bowen came up to the galley and stood breathing heavily over the sink for a moment before fetching a glass and taking some water from the faucet how are you feeling kent sam asked the asac like dog shit kate gave bowen a look as if to say dog shit was what he was she hadnt yet worked out a way of paying him back for implying to dave that he was fucking her but she was working on it the dramamine not effective said sam thats the top of the news said bowen i take any more of that stuff and ill fall asleep im nearly out on my feet as it is you know nothing much is happening right now said kate turkey in the straw has signed off there doesnt seem much point in staying awake if youre feeling lousy why not go to bed bowen smiled weakly why not go to bed is that your personal motto or something kate bit her lip whats that supposed to mean she said evenly i think you know what im talking about agent furey god you sound just like my mother i doubt that i doubt that very much clearly your mother can never have offered you anything in the way of moral guidance kate felt her cheeks color then she laughed scornfully listen to bob guccione what would you know about moral guidance persisting bowen said if she had im assuming its the dramamine thats making you sound like an asshole kent if she had youd have returned to this boat last night did you come up here especially to insult me you dont deny it then deny what that you slept with that guy actually we didnt really sleep at all we were too busy fucking i was right then but what i did or did not do last night is really none of your goddamn business if it affects the integrity of this operation it is and youd know all about that watching porno all evening bowen leaned forward and retched into the sink you make a lot more sense with your head in a toilet bowl she sneered bowen straightened and wiped his mouth with a paper towel it was not all evening it was a couple of hours kate said sam maybe three so dont lecture me on integrity said kate sam said never seen that kind of thing before probably wont ever see it again last night i reckon i saw everything it was possible to see there was one particular female he glanced awkwardly at kate well ill just say this that now i know what it really means to have your head screwed on he laughed anyway i dont see that any of us have affected the integrity of this operation nothing happened last night thats anyones business but his or her own now why dont we just leave it at that huh kent that kind of adolescent behavior may be ok in the coast guard hiccuped bowen but agent fureys illicit sexual activities are not in the best traditions of the fbi who do you think you are demanded kate j edgar hoover illicit sexual activities my ass bowen grinned through a wave of nausea that drained the last shade of color from his face he said well i know who i am yeah thats right i know who i am the secret files of kent bowen but can you say the same about your sexual partner answer me that if you can exactly what do you know about mister david dulanotov this is bullshit said kate but the truth was that she had spent the whole morning asking herself the same question bowen took a deep breath and said i am a pillar of strength in a city of weak men and women and i will maintain the law but mister david dulanotov is something else he is not a righteous man the rancorous eye and the finger of scorn are pointed against him he exhaled unsteadily pillar of shit more like what are you talking about ill tell you ive done a little checking on mister david dulanotov and it turns out that the boat he owns is registered in grand cayman theres no law against that the previous owner was a guy by the name of lou malta formerly an associate of tony nudelli even you must have heard of tony nudelli kate stayed silent naked tony nudelli i say formerly an associate because lou malta is listed with the miami police department as a missing person no one has seen him in months kate shrugged and said i dont see what that proves nothing except maybe that this lou malta guy has been murdered all we ask of someone when they sell us something is that they possess a proper title to the goods not that they are a proper person sright kent agreed sam brockman guy who sold me my first car was one of the biggest crooks in florida keep out of this said bowen be careful sam said kate or the crazy son of a bitchll open a file on you too bowen said i havent been able to find out about the other guy the knuckles he has for company but i wouldnt be at all surprised if he was some kind of mobster too you sound like youve already established a prima facie case against david said kate what ive heard so far is about as circumstantial as the time on your cheap watch boy when you throw up its not just last nights dinner is it its a lot of other bile and rat shit as well in case youve forgotten kent its dogs that are interested in puke not the da hed laugh you out of his office with what youve told me so far i never said i had anything other than bowen stopped gulped biliously before covering his mouth and then waiting for another wave of nausea to subside after a moment or two he added other than a strong suspicion that he was not a proper person for an agent to become associated with then he belched most intelligent sound youve made all morning kent said kate standing up im going outside the air in here is getting kind of sour agent furey i havent finished yet said bowen and threw up into the sink it sure doesnt look like it said kate squeezing out from behind the table almost as soon as bowen had straightened again a large fly landed on his puke buzzing loudly well what do you know kent said kate on her way out of the galley door looks like one of your friends just dropped by kate spent the rest of the afternoon alone in her stateroom avoiding everyone dave included she heard him come aboard just after six but when sam came down to tell her she told him to say she was sick and that shed catch him tomorrow she was hardly to know that the next time she saw dave hed have a gun in his hand by dinnertime with the squall still blowing hard and the sea as rough as ever dave returned to als cabin with an omelette he had cooked for him a piece of lemon pie and a cup of strong black coffee your inflight meal he said coming in the door how are you feeling al sat up on the bed and yawned cheesily he returned the dental plates to his mouth and said better thanks that stuff really works i think youd better eat something dave laid the tray on the bed its you who needs to be ready to rumble not your stomach with all that weve got to do youre going to need some energy al nodded then wolfed down the omelette hungrily how about a beer he asked uhuh said dave see those two bandaids on your arms health warnings they say the surgeongeneral has determined you remain dry until were aboard the ercolano because of the medication after that its champagne for the rest of your life i dont like champagne said al attacking the pie it gives me gas thats the whole idea yeah sure its the gas that lets you get loaded quickly al looked as if he hadnt ever considered this possibility and spooned the rest of the pie into his mouth dave wondered if al had ever heard of indigestion thanks for the meal predate it no problem my stomach was as empty as a fuckin campaign promise al burped happily and then drained his coffee cup fuckin weather huh reckon its going to slow us up any dave said if it keeps up like this its certainly not going to make things any easier how come you dont ever get seasick mind over matter i guess i dont mind and it dont matter dave lit a cigarette and grinned besides i figure thirty forty million bucksll cure just about anything that ails me shit man i may never get sick again al grinned back there were times when he quite liked the younger man times like this one he promised himself that when the time came to kill dave hed make it quick a bullet in the back of the head the guy wouldnt know a thing it seemed the least that he could do chapter nineteen jimmy figaro believed in history but what was the use of it if you didnt learn from it you didnt know about it you were doomed to repeat its mistakes and one thing figaro could not afford was a mistake not with his client list with some of these guys you fucked up just once and that was it then it was you that was history one of historys lessons was to do with being the bearer of bad news a cop he once knew in orlando got woken in the middle of the night by another cop on his doorstep telling the guy he had some bad news for him as it happened the bad news was just that the guy had been ordered to take charge of an accident investigation in which a lot of kids had drowned and the cop was going to have to look at the kids bodies but the guy was so annoyed with the other cop when he found out it wasnt really bad news for him at all and that none of his own family were dead or anything that he pulled a gun and shot the cop on the doorstep dead there were a lot of permutations on the dontshootthemessenger theme nobody liked the guy who brought bad news and that nobody could turn nasty when he was someone like tony nudelli it was ironic how figaros own bad tidings were tied up with the very same thing that had taught him to be extra careful of nudelli and his quick temper in the first place which was benny cecchino benny cecchino had been a made man a loan shark who had borrowed from tony at half a percent per week to put out on the street at whatever vig he liked one percent or a hundred percent tony didnt care who got charged or how much just as long as he got his a week from cecchino cecchino had lent to an individual called nicky rosen who promptly disappeared three weeks later cecchino had been driving up collins and thought he saw rosen in another car by the time cecchino realized that the guy was someone else he had smashed his mercedes into the lookalike and put him in hospital an honest mistake except that the lookalike turned out to be tony nudellis own brotherinlaw it was just bad luck and nudelli might have excused this but for the fact that cecchino had gone around the beach talking about it like it was the funniest thing that had ever happened like he didnt give a shit whose brotherinlaw it was and the minute nudelli heard about that he took a gun drove down to the restaurant where cecchino was usually to be found which was a mobowned place and took care of the insult himself and not just any gun either but an awesome little derringersized twelvegauge pistol firing one single capiscum round that was capable of crippling a grizzly bear it was like having a shotgun in the palm of your hand a makesure killers gun that left most of cecchinos head in his lap after that happened it wasnt just jimmy figaro who gave naked tony extra respect it was everyone david delano included as figaro parked his bmw on nudellis drive he reflected that it was curious the way history was always rewriting itself how years after you thought the chapter was closed new facts came along to alter your perception of something you thought you knew very well already it was figaros client tommy rizzoli tommy of the ice trucks and the mango trees now cleared of all racketeering charges who had supplied the original crumb of information that caused figaro to go and check out a few things himself what he discovered was that on the night dave delano saw naked tony walk into that restaurant and shoot benny cecchino dave had been there to make a deal with cecchino on behalf of nicky rosen the guy who had disappeared with cecchinos four grand rosen it turned out had been engaged to be married to daves sister lisa and dave was trying to make sure that the same thing didnt happen to his future brotherinlaw as had happened to naked tonys the lookalike guy except that the twelvegauge capiscum had put an end to the negotiations no one ever found benny cecchinos corpse but it wasnt long before the word got out that nudelli was involved and that dave delano had been the last man to talk to cecchino before he got himself killed the state tried and failed to put together a case against naked tony which was when the feds already trying to make a rico case against nudelli subpoenaed dave to give evidence before a grand jury just a few weeks after daves fiveyear sentence for contempt naked tony had taken over benny cecchinos vig list three months later nicky rosen was found dead in a boatyard at dinner key someone had sawed his head half off with a broken bottle it wasnt that jimmy figaro thought that dave was planning to doublecross nudelli or anything he had no idea what business he and dave were involved in merely that dave and al cornaro were somewhere out of town and doing it actually he didnt think the news was so bad but with the paranoid way nudelli had greeted the news of daves release from prison figaro couldnt see his client treating this latest revelation with equanimity so he had made sure to bring some really good news as well with a face like a rock nudelli listened to figaro explain the whole story and then stretched the cheeks across the bones with his fingers while he gave the matter some thought finally he said and whats the silver lining you want to sew into this fucking cloud of shit you brought me jimmy just this smiled figaro shifting excitedly on the leather sofa this was the moment he had been looking forward to the court of appeal affirmed the lower courts decision throwing out the challenge to the public portion of our new hotels financing it means the city properly created a redevelopment district to finance its share of the project thats good news jimmy isnt it great figaro smiled he had worked it well he thought so the builders can start when nudelli asked him just as soon as you give them the down payment tony nudelli remained silent theres no problem about the money is there twentyfive million in cash thats a lot of green but without it the moneys on its way be here any day now soon as al gets back to miami so dont worry about a thing now when do you think we can open the hotel by early then i think this calls for a bottle of champagne nudelli pushed a button on his library desk to summon miggy his butler i cant tell you how happy this makes me jimmy im glad and im relieved to be honest i was a little worried how youd take the other thing about dave delano i appreciate your concern jimmy maybe now youll understand me a little better huh i had a nose about that kid remember he pointed a finger at figaro you thought i was being paranoid jimmy figaro started to disagree but nudelli wasnt about to be contradicted on this point dont fuckin argue its true but nudelli was laughing as he said it still wagging the finger at figaro i seen it in your eyes you were thinkin it even if you werent saying it well i got an instinct for these things maybe this is why i am where i am not by havin no college education or no rich daddy or by marrying some classy broad some hope i got to be where i am by trusting to my fuckin instincts yknow just like i knew we could get past this redevelopment district bullshit nudellis finger tapped the side of his nose and then the side of his temples he chuckled as he said its a basic instinct like sharon stones pussy you see it only once for a second but its always there waiting to go into action figaro grinned back at him and shook his head in apparent wonder i have to admit tony you were right all along this was all nudelli wanted from jimmy figaro the acknowledgment so what happens now asked figaro about delano how do you mean i had the impression that some sort of business relationship had been concluded nudelli looked up at the grandfather clock against the wall of his study twenty thousand dollars worth of timekeeping it was english a george ii walnut eightday long case the height of a basketball player the same height as the pile of cash he expected al to bring back from the atlantic score concluded yeah tony nudelli laughed in just a few hours thats what its gonna be concluded chapter twenty dave was out of breath a walk to the accommodations block along the narrow side of the ship at night and in a high sea could do that for you several times he and al had to stand still and hang on to the guiderail until the swell passed and they could move again usually the journey took five minutes this time it took more than twenty and when finally they reached their objective they were both soaked to the skin for a moment there passed through his head the thought what the fuck am i doing here then he got it together again and left the question unanswered in case al should take offense both of them realizing the size of the task they had taken on they parted silently for fear of giving expression to the doubts that each man now felt dave headed toward the radio room and al made his way down below to secure the engine room outside the radio room dave pressed his ear to the door listening long and carefully making sure there was no one about like raskolnikov ready to bash the old womans head in not that he was planning to kill anyone least of all jock but although it was after twelve someone was in there he could hear the sound of a machine in use if jock was inside dave hoped the scotsman wouldnt be foolish enough to try to resist then glancing at his breitling he realized that he could wait no longer they were working to a pretty tight synchronization the storm had made sure of that there would be no time for mistakes dave had only a minute or two to lock up the radio room and then capture the bridge before al went into action down below he opened the door to darkness and a small green light like the single eye of some nocturnal animal the radio room was empty and he saw that the noise was coming from the fax machine spewing a long roll of paper onto the floor turning on his flashlight to check on what info was being sent through in case it affected the rendezvous dave saw that it was only the midweek soccer results from england and arsenal whoever they were had lost again dave locked the door from the outside slipped the key into the pocket of the hunters vest he wore over his bulletproof vest and went along to the bridge the watch had changed just around midnight when the third officer was relieved by the second officer niven normally this was the quietest of all the watches lasting until am when niven would be relieved by the chief but the weather had given the watch crew plenty to do keeping an eye on the ships collision and avoidance program this involved taking the radar range and bearings with the ships arpa to get the vector of ships that might be in the area the duke was doing revs niven had just heard the helmsman say port one and acknowledged the computers one degree of helm adjustment to their course when he found himself staring into the silenced barrel of daves submachine gun the red light emanating from the laser aiming module underneath the gun barrel confirmed that the bearer meant business dave hoped that the men standing on the unsteady floor of the bridge would hear what he had to say above the beating of his heart be dead or order dead slow ahead niven did not hesitate realizing that it was only in films that anyone ever thought to question a man holding a gun on you straightaway he picked up the engine room telephone and gave daves order and waited until it had been confirmed by the second engineer still holding the phone he said dead slow ahead it is set the gyro for automatic steering ordered dave its already set you can check it yourself if you like dave grinned why would you lie niven swallowed hard dave jerked his gun toward the bridge window any crew astern not in this weather dave took the phone from nivens trembling hand and waved him back he said let me speak to the man with the gun there was a short pause and then he heard als voice engine room secure bridge secure said dave were on our way down he tossed the receiver back to niven who in his fear fumbled and then dropped it onto the bridge floor sorry said niven retrieving the receiver slowly and replacing it on the wall cradle just be cool and youll be ok dave advised from here on its an attitude thing having one could be unhealthy follow me like moses good boy said dave ok lets go below excuse me but what about the helm asked niven were on automatic said dave the computer will watch the arpa yeah but all the same in this weather its as well to keep an eye on things dave didnt have time to argue silently he waved the gun toward the bridge wing and the stairwell that led below deck the two men gave the gun and then dave a wary attentive look and went through the door a few minutes later they and the man who had been down in the engine room were meekly stepping into the workshop dave watched al shove the engineer roughly inside with the barrel of his shotgun and then bolt the door behind him he give you any trouble dave asked him hes alive isnt he al said ominously dont be such a fuckin hard ass smith and jones ok al shrugged and it was then dave noticed that he was wearing a crucifix on one of the gold chains around his neck al wore a lot of gold but this was the first time dave had seen him wearing a crucifix grabbing it in his halfgloved hand he said whats this whats it fucking look like asshole al tugged the little crucifix out of daves fingers and tucked it behind the hard sternum of his bulletproof vest you really believe god is going to look out for you with a shotgun in your hand laughed dave who are you billy fucking graham what the fuck do you care what i believe i think a man ought to be selfreliant thats all i dont like the idea that there are any second chances in life makes people careless the only one whos watching your ass round here is me al not god try and remember that you just watch out for your own shit and leave me to mine i can handle the discordant notes in my setup im cool to the contraries inherent in my situation know what im sayin so why dont you get your nose out of my fuckin conscience and lets go and kick some ass with three men locked up that left fourteen others to be accounted for all the officer and crew quarters were on the same deck most of the men were asleep a few were drunk either way they offered dave and al no resistance with the exception of jellicoe he was the last to be hauled roughly from his bed at gunpoint seeing the rest of his men standing meekly in the corridor under daves armed guard seemed to bring out in him something of his countrys proud tradition of resistance you know what this is dont you he said stiffly shut the fuck up its bloody piracy thats what it is jellicoe persisted its an offense against the law of nations thats what it is well mark my words outside the normal jurisdiction of a state im the law round here and i can tell you bastards you wont get away with this regardless of your nationality or domicile you can be sure that i will pursue you arrest you try you and punish you as i am so empowered to do under international al jabbed the shortened barrel of his shotgun under jellicoes nose and racked the slide silencing him with immediate effect then wearing an expression of intense irritation al looked at dave as if he held him personally responsible and said ok im cool to this smith and jones shit but if he gives me any more of the admiral halsey im gonna pump one up each fucking nostril do as the bastard says sir said one of jellicoes crew for christs sake or youll get us all killed al turned his malevolent gaze back to jellicoe and said you hear that you fuckin fag its good advice one more crack out of you and youre gonna be huntin red october so help me god understand before he locked the workshop door dave took jock aside sorry about this jock look there are some tools and things on the floor thatll help you escape only i wouldnt start until around six its likely to make al nervous if he hears you guys banging away and when hes nervous he gets trigger happy know what i mean the ships going dead ahead slow on autopilot so youve nothing to worry about there one more thing youll find some people handcuffed on the carrera the keys to their handcuffs as well as the key to the radio room are in the safe on my boat its a fourdigit combination the first number is keyed in already for you guys you just have to work your way through the other possibilities shouldnt take you more than a couple of hours i know ive already tried it myself understand aye i think so jock frowned whats this all about anyway its like you said yourself jock you make it any way you can clearing the accommodations block and locking up the crew was the easiest part of the plan but scrambling from one yacht to another and moving owners and crews off their vessels and along the dock wall in darkness had always looked more problematic now in a high sea it looked impossible as dave and al had discovered on their own trip to the block it would have been only too easy for someone to have fallen from the ships dock wall and into the sea where they would certainly have drowned but dave was nothing if not flexible in the way he approached his plan and stumbling across those fbi shields and ids had given him an idea how a lot of crucial time and effort might now be saved and as soon as the ships officers and crew were safely out of the way dave told al about the change in plan al he said quietly ive got a present for you now i dont want you getting alarmed when you see what it is ok because normally you would be right under normal circumstances you would look at what im about to give you and feel very uncomfortable and i wouldnt blame you one bit but with anything creative if its any fuckin good theres usually a certain amount of improvisation involved like good jazz yknow or jimi hendrix improvisation als frown deepened what the fuck is this what are you talking about improvisation do i look like lee fucking strasberg or something were taking down a score here not some fucking directors notes they were standing on the empty bridge staring down at a vague outline of the captive flotilla of yachts apart from the two lights on the ships stern everything was dark dave nodded and said thats good al lee strasberg is good a much better example than jimi hendrix because there is going to be some acting involved did you ever see yourself as an actor al i hate fucking actors thats good too see if you can hang onto that because the best way of manifesting your contempt for actors would be to demonstrate just how easy acting is get to the point motherfucker ok heres your part dave unfolded kent bowens fbi identification wallet and handed it over he hoped that in the halflight of the bridge al wouldnt recognize bowen from his photograph your name is kent bowen and youre an assistant special agent in charge with the fbi al scrutinized the card where the fuck did you get this shit never mind that now that and the other one in my pocket are going to save you and me a lot of legwork he glanced at his watch the change in plan was now looking essential dangerous and timeconsuming legwork he added just look down at those boats and think about this that its a lot of fuckin boats to be gettin on and off of in the pitch dark and in this fucking weather right this fbi thing is just a way of streamlining this particular phase of the operation you dig less effort for the same return was ok with al i guess so dave took back bowens fbi wallet and tucked one half inside the strap of als vest so that the badge was hanging out in the front there you go he said you look just like al pacino right now heres the setup you and i are going to board these boats posing as a couple of feds well tell them that weve been keeping one particular boat on this ship under surveillance because its smuggling drugs only now weve got to move in and make the arrest before they transfer the stuff onto another ship so were asking everyone to stay in their cabins in case theres any shooting and to be real quiet think you can handle that al glanced at the badge he was wearing he shook his head and said jesus this feels weird i can handle this shit yeah acting nothing to it if arnie schwarzenegger can do it then anyone can im jack webb no fucking problem when i was a kid i watched dragnet all the time now youre talking said dave who am i supposed to be again asked al and before dave could distract him he had the wallet out of his vest and was scrutinizing bowens id id better get into character here your names bowen said dave hoping to distract al worried about how he might react to the presence of three real feds on board the duke and youre what the feds call an asac sack of shit more like muttered al yknow this is pretty good id with these fuckin creds i could yeah yeah cmon al lets get moving wait a minute al frowned wait just a fuckin minute i recognize this joker this is the guy on that broads boat that broad youve been al theres really no time to explain it is isnt it thats where ive seen this character and this id this is cocacola this is the real thing none of this is relevant the hell it isnt show me your id these really are going to make things easier for us al if only youll let them hand it over asshole dave could see there was no point in arguing he handed al kates id and watched the big mans ugly face wince with horror jesus shes a fed too you fucked a fed didnt ya i dont believe it you fucked a fed what the hell were you thinking of didnt it make you feel nervous or nothing i didnt know she was a fed when i fucked her lied dave i was snooping around her pantie drawer and thats when i found her wallet what about the other guy the tall guy with the glasses is he a fed as well no hes with the coast guard did you fuck him too or is it just feds youve got a thing for al shook his head in wonder jesus christ i cant believe this doesnt it make you feel nervous it makes me feel like running for mommys tit relax will you everythings cool theyre no threat to us believe me for one thing theyre working under cover keeping jellicoe under surveillance they suspect him of smuggling drugs or guns or some shit like that its nothing to do with us nothing you understand and for another thing i took their guns at the same time as i took their ids and threw them over the side just in case dave thought the story about jellicoe was better for als peace of mind than saying he really had no idea who was under surveillance or why except that it certainly wasnt the two of them they had guns well of course they had guns theyre fbi not fucking baywatch i still dont like it you dont have to like it al all you gotta do is act for chrissakes and what about them the feds what are you going to do about them al threw kates id back at him chill out ill handle them romantic goodbyes is that it something like that i gotta hand it to you pal fucking a fed thats quite a pelt for any guy to have on his bedpost but for someone like you an excon straight out of the federal joint wait till i tell tony he aint gonna believe it you dave delano mister sang freud thats french explained al means you got composure like there was ice running in your veins kate lay on the gently rocking bed in her stateroom drifting in and out of sleep the prints and photo fits of vague thoughts piled up in her head but she couldnt concentrate on any one of them what was she going to do she could hardly ignore dave for the remainder of the voyage suppose he was involved with the mob was that better or worse than being a jewel thief was there anything he had said that she thought she could actually believe yes he loved her even wanted to marry her that much she did believe and not because she wanted to but because she just knew that it was the truth in which case since she felt the same way about him did anything else really matter what was being in the bureau and staying on in florida really worth compared with what she felt for him and hadnt she wanted something like this something out of the ordinary what did it really matter that she didnt know him as dave had said people who didnt know each other fell in love and got married every day were their marriages any less successful than anyone elses she and howard for instance theyd known each other for three years before getting married and look how that had turned out it was not so much sleep that she awoke from more like returning from oblivion as if something had disturbed her something other than the storm still lashing at the porthole window as if someone had come into her cabin kate rolled across the bed toward the lamp and found a hand pressed over her mouth before she could reach for the switch its me dave dont scream the next second he took his hand away and replaced it with his mouth for a minute or two she gave herself up to his kiss pushing all her doubts to the back of her mind he was here with her now and that was all that counted putting her arms around him she tried to draw him down on top of her wanting him to make love to her regardless of what she now knew about him she whispered jesus dave youre all wet is there something the matter with the ship no well im still glad you came kate i have to talk to you ive been avoiding you im sorry i guess youve swept me off my feet i didnt know how to respond what are you wearing here let me turn the light on but dave held her still and sensing that he didnt want the light she began to think that something might be wrong he said i want you to know i meant everything i said about loving you about wanting to marry you i know you did i know and cant we talk about this after weve made love he sighed and moved away from her in the darkness id like to really i would but you see im getting off the boat tonight getting off dave what are you talking about whats happening listen carefully two things kate reached across and turned on the light at a glance her eyes took in the bulletproof vest the automatic the submachine gun the night sights and the walkietalkie he looked like some kind of navy commando or maybe something worse jesus dave shrugged apologetically and said well thats the first thing what the hells going on here dave started to answer but she silenced him as quickly her mouth narrowing with disapproval she said no dont tell me i think i can guess this is a hijack isnt it dave said sure you dont want to change your mind and come along with me kate laughed with contempt only the contempt wasnt for him it was for herself to have been proved wrong about this man the man she loved and by kent bowen of all people he would never let her forget it the bastard she heard herself say me on the lam with a drug hijacker i dont think so thats too bad said dave so he had been right about there being drugs somewhere on board the ship thats what she thought he was planning to steal because i meant every word yeah you said that she smiled bitterly you said a lot of things that dont mean a thing now and me i really fell for that millionaire routine didnt i then the gentlemen jewelthief bullshit you had me dangling on a string and how so im a liar admitted dave everyone in this world is pretending to be something theyre not he paused hoping she might volunteer something about her own deception she said no worse dont fool yourself dave if thats your real name youre just another cheap recidivist from homestead kate smiled at the look of surprise on daves face yes i know all about that dave tried to figure how she made him an excon she was still uncertain of his real name but could somehow connect him with homestead you want to be more careful whose books you steal so that was it there must have been something in one of his books a bookplate or something he should have been more careful dave realized he had underestimated her i guess you think youve figured out all the angles kate slipped slowly off the bed and onto the floor well im not going to wish you luck your kind isnt interested in leaving things to luck you want a sure thing but there is something id like to give you in the way of a keepsake something to remember me by when youre doing time again dave watched her coolly lift the bedspread admiring the way she was handling herself him armed to the teeth and her dressed only in pyjamas still going for it undeterred thinking she still had a chance to nail him reluctant to admit defeat there was no doubt about it he had picked a really special one kate furey was one hell of a woman slowly she pulled out the bed drawer and said a little souvenir of our love so youll always know exactly what you missed when you lost my good opinion of you dave smiling kate reached into the drawer all the way to the back where she kept her identity card and the ladysmith the way he was sitting there legs akimbo arms folded smiling slightly like the score was already in the bag the last thing he was expecting was a weaponstrained federal agent coming out of that drawer with a gun pointed at his balls dave watched her search become more urgent and the sly little smile she had been wearing quickly disappear looks like youve missed something yourself he said and taking her id out of the pocket of his huntsmans vest he flipped it open over his forefinger is this what youre looking for agent furey kate lunged for her wallet uhuhuh he said and returned it to his pocket this and the gun that was with it what would you have done if you had found it would you really have shot me kate sat back and folded her arms calmly well never know will we agent furey i prefer that name it suits you a lot better than parmenter agent furey sounds like something the army might have used in vietnam a defoliant maybe you certainly shook the leaves off my tree i dont mind telling you theyre all over the grass parmenter is my married name that part true about you and he getting divorced yes is he fbi too no hes an attorney dave nodded when did you find out she asked oh i could ask you the same question but im afraid were out of time dave reached into his vest then tossed a pair of a handcuffs onto the floor just on the one wrist please if you dont mind and if i refuse to comply do you think you can shoot me nope i couldnt even point a gun at the contents of your closet but i wouldnt mind betting i could give that boss of yours kent bowen a good crack on the ear that makes two of us and al well al is capable of just about anything where a fed is concerned i figured kate snapped the cuff on one wrist much as she disliked kent bowen she really hadnt the stomach to see any harm come to him just in case you were wondering bowen and the other fellow are safely handcuffed in the luxury of their own staterooms kate held up the wrist wearing the cuff can you get me the earrings to match dave pointed inside the head in there please she got up and went through he told her to sit down on the floor and to open the closet underneath the sink where the reeltoreel tape machine was hidden nice stereo said dave by the way who was it that you guys were really after what you expect me to finger the dope for you is that it kate assumed he was being flippant that this was just another way of taunting her you we were after you and your friend al he said no you werent i already listened to your tape then why are you asking me youre right it doesnt matter now reach around the waste pipe and manacle the other wrist when she had done it he dangled the keys and said ill put these in my safe i assume you know where that is my guess is you already tried to open it when you searched my room the key to the radio rooms there as well its a fourdigit combination the first numbers keyed in it takes about two hours to work your way through the remaining possibilities the ships crew are all locked up in the workshop but it shouldnt take them more than a few hours to break out ive told them youre here so you shouldnt have long to wait of course well be gone by then he took out a roll of surgical tape just in case she started hollering and putting the crews on the russkie boats on alert im sorry about this he said really i am you have the most attractive mouth save it for the judge asshole anything i can get you first a glass of water perhaps how about a glass of water and a goodbye kiss easy still apologizing dave fetched her some water from the faucet and helped her to drink she swallowed most of it but as he moved closer to kiss her she squirted a jet of water right back in his face laughing she said there you go theres your kiss a big wet one youll always remember me by dave picked up a towel and wiped his face trying to smile he said in the next life youd better come back as a fountain you should thank me you may never feel this clean again when he had finished taping her mouth he asked her if she could breathe all right she nodded sullenly sure you wont change your mind come with me we could be good together she shook her head ok if you should ever change your mind kate looked the other way then keep an eye on the tuesday editions of the miami herald classified section lost and found look out for lost at sea siberian husky answers to the name of rodya itll say no reward just to stop any cowboys from telephoning therell be an answering service you can leave a message if you want dave paused and let out a long sigh i hope you do kate kept her head averted a second or two later she heard the door close behind him chapter twentyone what took you growled al or did you feel impelled to fuck that fed bitch again for old times sake you wouldnt understand dave told him the way it turned out was something rather more poetic than just a straight fuck al laughed nothings more poetic than a straight fuck shit for brains except maybe one that deviates up her ass or something all those books in prison must have turned your dick to jello al wiped his sweating forehead and bare arms with a bar towel he had taken from the last boat hed been on you were right about one thing though im glad to hear it this fbi shit works better than a gun you just tell people what to do snap your fingers like mary fuckin poppins and they do it its better than a gun and no questions asked dave said its like i was telling you alias smith and jones theres no need to shoot anyone if youre wearing that badge on your chest tell that to david koresh one thing though you do uncover a lot of bad shit when you just walk in on people uninvited that bitch on the jade for instance rachel dana what about her bitch was in bed with one of the girls in her crew pair of them as naked as the day they hatched i didnt know whether to flash my dick or my badge lesbians the pair of them i swear they were both attached to the same fuckin dildo like they was on a lifesupport system they were on the dukes port stern stack looking back up toward the bow of the ship al threw the towel into the pitching sea with disgust and lit a cigar id forgotten about your homophobia said dave he shrugged hey whatever floats your boat im not homophobic al insisted but i just cant figure that dildo shit i mean if youre a dyke it means pussys your thing if you want eight inches of length inside you you might as well choose the real thing right stead of some plastic dick looks like it belongs in a toy store i mean how do you figure it doctor ruth im not said dave what did they say after you interrupted them they were kind of pissed at me but i told them i didnt care what they got up to or what got up them they could fuck a cat with a broken back for all i cared just as long as they stayed on their boat less they wanted to get their heads blown off that was cute said dave ok how many boats have we got left to visit apart from our three russians just the one al pointed at the britannia that one the getaway from it all boat good work youve been busy like i said this fbi thing works like beetlejuice take a breather ill handle the britannia be my guest hey did you know calgary stanford is on this ship the movie actor he was hitting a pipe when i caught up with him lousy doper takes all sorts to make a world al least thats what it says in the bible doesnt it dave started to walk down the stairs toward the stern of the britannia how the fuck should i know well youre the catholic arent you aint you heard catholic church dont like people reading the bible they used to grease you for it in the moonlight the sea looked like something animate like the scaly skin of some enormous reptile perhaps even the one he was feeling like he thought hed given kate a choice to come with him or to stay on the boat but really hed given her no choice at all and she wouldnt have been the girl he loved if shed agreed to come with him he knew that and it didnt make him feel any better about himself dave stepped onto the deck of the britannia still unaware of the special cargo that was concealed inside the yachts enlarged fuel tanks he was set to impress those on board with his impeccable credentials with all that he and al still had left to do hed forgotten that kate furey and her fed friends had been keeping someone else under surveillance there was no way he could know that the britannias crew might feel a little less sanguine than most about being boarded by the fbi his heart was still in bed with kate his mind was already boarding the first russian boat where he expected to encounter the real resistance not to mention the money the britannia looked quiet enough although the owners taste left something to be desired flashing his maglite around the lounge dave liked the furniture well enough but the art on the oakpanelled walls was the worst kind of kitsch the kind of bland stuff you bought with both eyes on the rooms color scheme he went downstairs when he had real money he was going to buy some real art paintings not interior decoration below deck in the three ensuite staterooms all was quiet dave opened the first door to find a twinbedded cabin there were clothes all over the place but the beds were empty he opened the second door to find a sophisticated art deco room more to his taste and a double bed with a naked man and woman staring at him blearily through the hard flashlight hed aimed at them there was no window or porthole in the cabin so dave closed the door quietly behind him and turned on the light who the fuck are you what the hells going on the guy was demanding us federal bureau of investigation sir said dave waving kates badge im sorry to break in on you people in the middle of the night like this but if you could just keep your voices down ill explain what this is all about the woman slapped the sheet around her with both hands and shook her head bitterly i dont believe it i just dont believe it oh jesus well thats just fucking great she said shit shit shit dave said take it easy will you look were about to make an arrest on another boat some drug smugglers but before we do were trying to warn all the passengers to stay put in their cabins if you do hear shooting then you should lie down on the floor until you hear from us that its all clear just in case its only a precaution i dont think theres any need to worry oh christ said nicky vallbona you stupid bastard said gay gilmore punching him hard on the shoulder me what the fuck did i do i told you they were onto us didnt i back in lauderdale i said they were watching us but no you wouldnt listen not you you knew better mister professional arsehole did you hear what i said asked dave you couldnt believe that i would have spotted something you didnt well if you think im going to prison for a prick like you nicky you can forget it im not ill tell them everything ive got the rest of my life to live and im not doing it inside jail will you please keep your voices down fuck off snarled gay what difference does it make if youre going to arrest us then arrest us but dont expect us to be happy about it mate or is being arrested normally some kind of party tell me mister gman id like to know how im supposed to react to this shit arrested dave frowned suddenly it dawned on him hers was one of the voices on kates tape this was the boat with the drugs no wonder they were so unnerved by his presence now if he could only get her to shut up for a second then he might be able to explain we did some coke earlier on explained vallbona shes still a little high not any more lover im on a fucking downer now thanks to you will you shut up snapped dave shut up just for a minute look this is not a bust youre not being arrested you said to lie down on the floor gay insisted then do it for christs sake dave jerked his silenced at the floor he was going to have to get rough with them anyway when the time came to steal their boat maybe now was as good a time as any i dont have time for all this bullshit suddenly the door behind him opened banging against daves head he heard someone in the corridor outside say what the fucks going on it was all the opportunity the two in bed needed each reached for a handgun the big automatic in daves hand seemed to take charge of what happened next and with the lasersight it was as easy as taking a photograph with some idiots idiotproof camera in a split second his entire world was reduced to a red circle with a central dot floating inside it and dave had fired several times more before the door behind him banged hard open again knocking him onto the bloodspattered bed dave slipped to the floor pursued by this new assailant whose hand gripped the fist holding daves gun as tightly as the other held his windpipe dave punched the man hard underneath the chin but with no result and the two struggled to their feet only to crash through the door of the ensuite head for a second the grip on his windpipe released and dave could smell the cordite in the air from when he had fired the shots he might have shot his attacker too if the barrel of his gun had been shorter they collapsed over the edge of the empty bath daves wrist caught on the shower door and the gun clattered into the bath underneath him dave lunged at the man with the top of his head butting him hard in the mouth then fell back against the tiled wall he reached down below him for the gun but by the time he had the grip in his hand the man had hauled the nylon clothes line out of the wallmounted spindle and had wound a good length of it around daves neck this time the grip was tighter and dave kicked out in front of him his boot smashing the glass in the shower door the guy was strangling him twisting one way and then the other like a dog on a short lead dave tried to elbow the guy in the stomach but his own vest and the machine gun got in the way another minute and it would all be over another sixty seconds and he would be dead already he could feel the edges of his world becoming dark and hazy as if the void was closing in upon him the head door slammed open and something spat twice into the air jolting the man behind him like a bolt of electricity the pressure on the line around his neck slackened and hot steamy liquid trickled down the back of daves neck it was another second or two before he realized that it was blood from the dying man who groaned as al lifted dave clear of his attacker then al stood back levelled the silencer and fired another shot into the guys throat just to make sure al looked anxiously at his coughing partner and asked you ok trembling dave took a deep and unrestricted breath holding his nylonburned neck he stuck his throbbing head under the cold shower hardly paying attention to the blood still running out of the dead mans bullet wounds and washing down the plug when dave finally answered al his own voice sounded as if hed smoked a couple of cartons of cigarettes i think so thanks hed have strangled me for sure dont mention it kind of fuckin actor are you anyway i mean there are no oscars for what happened down here not even a lousy emmy goddamned bedroom it looks like the wild bunch through there al lit a cigarette for dave here thisll help you get your breath what did happen in there as a matter of small academic interest dave pulled a towel over his head and sighed damned if i know its like i said then the alias smith and jones factor its bullshit people carry guns people get shot stands to reason they gave me no choice i had to shoot them it was them or me no doubt about it i guess there was something about your manner they objected to me i can relate to that your small talk can be like fleas sometimes it itches like fuck the sight of that badge drove em to it perhaps who the fuck knows but its lucky for you i came down here or youd be john brown man they thought we were pinching them they thought it was a real bust thats why they went for their guns but al hardly cared to listen he was already heading back through the stateroom where the two bodies lay grotesquely twisted on the bloodstained bed on his way upstairs he said the fuck difference does it make now theyre dead aint they for them it was a real bust deads the biggest bust there is coming upstairs into the moonlight dave took a deep breath of the cool night air the britannia looked so pure and white that it was hard to connect it with the bloody scene in the master stateroom below it was a couple of minutes before he realized what else had happened the storms died away he said thats what i came down to tell you said al happened just like that i guess thats something still want to do this the hard way asked al meaning no killing more than ever youre being a mite particular arent you these guys aint gonna be any more cooperative than the three we just greased al its my understanding that youre a professional killer but me im a rank amateur like i said before i didnt want to be a killer and now that ive killed two people the first two people i ever killed i want to be a killer even less what i did back there makes me feel sick to my stomach hey dont let it spoil your evening that was selfdefense them or you just like you said its intention that counts even the law knows that much a real fed would have blown them away just the same as you did so being dead is their fault not yours they were fuckin stupid had to be stupid to think they could pull a gun on a man carrying your kind of heat one of them was a girl al that much i noticed nicelooking broad too good tits but a nicelookin broad with good tits and a handgun makes all the fuckin difference in the world and the next one too if it comes to that al shrugged i still reckon we should grease these fuckers thats why weve got the silencers on the ends of our dicks tell you what al ill make you a deal if we can avoid any more bloodshed you can have half my share al thought about this for a moment since he was planning to murder dave the minute he saw the ercolano sailing toward the rendezvous point and since naked tony had already promised al daves share anyway the deal didnt sound so good but he had little choice but to agree or else risk daves suspicion he was a nice guy for a dead man ok you gotta deal half your share and no more human tragedies we stick to shooting only in selfdefense right sighed al but dont go soft on me dave remember im supposed to be the one with the conscience not you im the catholic round here you youre an atheist you dont believe in shit al tripped and fell upon the explanation for the lack of any resistance they met on the baby doc almost as soon as they had set foot inside the smelly lounge the boats shabby interior was littered with empty vodka bottles and on top of the dining table was what looked to have been a serious game of monopoly not least because it had been played with real money there were loose piles of dollars all over the place and in daves eyes it was easy to see what must have happened first a hell of a lot of drinking although few if any of the three crews were actually russian it was as if the idea of russianness had exercised such a powerful effect on the crewmen that they had felt an obligation to live up to the harddrinking reputation enjoyed by their employers second the idea of playing the ultimate game of monopoly with some of the real cash that was being smuggled to russia and third a lot more hard drinking one of the crewmen lay insensible on the lounge sofa and another had passed out on the floor of one of the heads a third they found dead drunk in the wheelhouse curled up like a baby in the cockpit chair the rest of the three crews were sleeping it off in the baby docs staterooms most of them so drunk that even after dave and al had tied them up with plastic ties they stayed asleep or unconscious will you look at these drunken bastards laughed al when he had tied up the last man in his stateroom be a while before they even know weve been and gone jesus thats some fuckin monopoly game they got upstairs must be a couple of hundred thousand dollars on that game board he stood up checked the knot then kicked the man in the small of the back the man grunted and rolled quietly away how manys that dave was checking the three crews off against the ships own list of supernumeraries he nodded and said thats all of them bet you wish you hadnt made that deal now al said harshly this was a piece of sponge cake he picked up a halfempty bottle of vodka unscrewed the top and took a short pull from the neck wasnt it dave said nothing and it was then al noticed the clasp knife in the younger mans hand als gun lay on the coffee table several feet away he swallowed nervously because of the deal he had made and the ease with which their objective had apparently been achieved maybe he had pushed him too far he held out the bottle for dave to drink want some dave thought he probably needed a drink since killing the two in bed his stomach had felt like hed eaten something disagreeable maybe some vodka would fix it he took the bottle gulped a mouthful and handed the bottle back then rolling the man he had tied roughly off the bed he turned the mattress on top of him and plunged the knife deep into the seam of the divan underneath he tore away the cover to reveal a sixfoot square of something faintly green under a thick polythene sheet the knife flashed again and the two men stared down at an enormous pallet of cash wrapped in smaller pillowsized bundles didnt i tell you grinned dave you were right didnt i fucking tell you how much do you reckon is there dave picked up one of the bundles slit the edge of the polythene with his knife and thumbed through a corner of used notes hard to say exactly its mixed bills hundreds fifties and twenties nothing smaller i dont know maybe a couple of million therere five staterooms on this boat breathed al do you know how much that is five times two im sure you can work it out if you try al but the sight of so much cash had made al impervious to daves sarcasm and instead of cursing him he said that deal we made forget it the last thing al wanted now was to have dave mad at him being mad at him might make dave a little harder to kill when the time came you keep your share youve earned it didnt i tell you dave repeated now there was a note of triumph in his voice al said ill get the bags you find the rest of the money a few minutes later al came back carrying a flatpacked bulkpurchase of nike sports bags bent across each shoulder dave had already ripped apart the four other divans as well as the threepiece leather suite in the baby docs lounge laughing like a crazy man al stuffed one of the heavyduty nylon bags with parcels of cash then another will you look at all this dough dave zipped up two bags full hooked a strap over each shoulder and stood up being rich couldnt have looked or felt more unwieldy he was glad of the gloves and the flakjacket for the bags weighed close to fifty pounds apiece al was already staggering upstairs puffing under the weight of the two bags he was carrying he said jesus this is like going to the airport with madonna and the kids now you know what people mean when they talk about the burden of wealth i sure hope i live to spend it all this exertion my hearts beating like thumpers foot make up your mind to be an unfit rich motherfucker instead of one of those healthylooking kids always asking for change i can deal with that breathing hard both men came up on deck and dumped the bags gratefully al said oh man this is hard work got a problem with that shit yeah i got my modus vivendi down man i didnt ever figure to be no fuckin hotel porter kinda tired myself admitted dave time is it theres two more boatloads of money to think about youve got a lot more bags to carry upstairs before your ass can sit down in the front lobby i know that i was just askin the time i thought you might be pleased to help me out you being the proud owner of the rolls fucking royce of watches be dawn soon do i look like a fuckin vampire if i want that kind of shit ill wait for a cock to crow numbers thats what i like to hear tick fucking tock on account of my citified ass and urbane fucking ways what are you stephen hawking or something its nearly am what difference does it make ill tell you if were behind schedule first thing i do when i get back to miami im going to buy you a watch al that way youll know when its time to shut your mouth now lets move before some of these supernumos on their boats start to get curious about whats happening ive killed enough people for one evening that shit still bothering you oddly enough yes it is chill out like i said before it was you or them an accident that doesnt sound like an accident sure it does an unforeseen contingency thats all that happened you want to find your cloudy ass a silver lining damn quick pal i dont want you goin leonard cohen on me lift your eyes to the good news with which your situation is replete first that you are now one rich motherfucker and second it could have been them feds you greased the real ones think how lower than snakeshit youd be feeling now if it was that fed bitch youd terminated instead of the other one chapter twentytwo at quantico kate had learned that the secret of escaping from handcuffs as perfected by the likes of houdini was a simple one you had the keys when keys or picks were not required you needed a springloaded cuff and a sharp tap in the right place but mostly houdini had a key up his ass or a tiny pick inserted in the thick skin on the soles of his feet even with a pick kate did not think she could have worked all the levers inside the tiny keyhole that was the kind of skill for which you needed years of practice besides she was particularly careful of her feet she kept a piece of lava on the side of her bathtub at home and regularly visited a chiropodist health and fitness were important to her she did yoga to help her relax and keep her body supple and periodically she was a vegetarian howard had said that it made her too thin but then his idea of what a woman ought to look like was anna nicole smith it wasnt as if kate was flatchested or anything just feminine finely boned not some fantasy fuck built by goodyear once howard had said that finely boned was just another way of saying scrawny this was not long after she had confronted him with the evidence of his adultery why had he needed to have other women didnt he find her attractive was there something wrong with the way she looked it was her own fault for asking she was slim graceful willowy rangy even the only time kate felt scrawny was when howard looking for a quick fuck tried to squeeze into the shower cabinet alongside her the hell with him the fat bastard slim and slender was what she was but not so slim that the cuffs were about to be squeezed off like a tight bangle once when she was a kid back in tville she had got her head stuck between some railings and her mother had called the fire department for half an hour her older brother had teased her that they would have to cut through the railings with an oxyacetylene torch which might also burn through her neck but in the event they had simply covered her head with thick industrial soapliquid and slid her out and now sitting on the floor of the head staring at the wastepipe under the basin she thought she might try something similar in the closet were several bottles of shampoo and shower gel that kate was able to pick up with her feet and then place in her manacled hands it wasnt long before her hands and wrists were covered in a thick oleaginous green treacle of mixed soaps kates hands werent much wider than her wrists at least not when the metacarpal bones of the thumb and little finger were squeezed together and dave had been too ashamed of himself to have made the cuffs uncomfortably tight on her wrists behind the surgical tape stretched across her mouth kate cursed him and determined to ignore the pain began to pull at the glutinous cuffs as if her life depended upon it dave threw the last bag of money onto the deck of the britannia and returned to the juarista to fetch the scuba equipment back on board the chosen getaway boat he stripped and climbed into a wetsuit under als grim and increasingly bleary gaze al shook his head and shivering said rather you than me with that lloyd bridges shit he looked circumspectly over the side of the boat and then spat into the water water dont look so clean dave thought of saying something about the bottle of vodka in als hairy paw and a possible reaction with the two scopoderm plasters he was still wearing on his forearms but thought better of it als job was finished from here on in more or less everything was down to dave what does that shit mean anyway scuba i never did know means selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus dave explained its an acronym he hauled what looked like a lifevest made of black rubber over his head attached to the front of the rubber were some tubes a mouthpiece and a green cylinder about the size of a household fire extinguisher al frowned he said thats it thats your tank i got a bigger tank than that on my fuckin soda siphon dave nodded this is a draeger closed circuit system he said a rebreather it catches the exhaled breath producing no bubbles its comfortable and very light he passed the straps under his crotch and then around his waist pure oxygen no mixture makes it ideal for shallow work and its very small as you can see al looked over the side once again he said how deep is it down there anyway dave was watching the sky the sun was coming up now they were running a little behind schedule but he was glad of that he hadnt particularly cared for the idea of making this dive in the water of the dukes floating harbor in darkness he said bout twenty feet and tested the supply from the mouthpiece he hoped twenty feet was right oxygen was toxic at anything below thirtythree feet well said al and took another drink rather you than me thats all i can say dave spat into his face mask and rubbed the spittle around the glass he laughed and said al im gonna take a wild guess here you cant swim can you lots of people cant swim sure and lots of people drown every year al grinned back not if they dont ever go swimming you ask me its mostly people who can swim and who go swimming who get their asses drowned let me ask you a question which of the two of us is more likely to get himself drowned at this particular moment in time you or me youve got a point absolutamente on account of youre the dumb motherfucker who knows how to swim and how to use a selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus right comforting thought admitted dave and collected up his searchlight and his knife qed shrugged al dave grinned qed yeah thats another of them acronomes means the kind of shit that speaks for itself i know what it means said dave retiring to the stern of the boat and climbing onto the ladder i just wondered if you knew what the letters stood for sure i do i may not read books but i aint exactly ignorant stands for quite easily done just like the way even motherfuckers who know what the fuck theyre doin in the water and think maybe theyre james bond or something can get their landdwelling selves as drowned as the lost city of atlantis you hear what im saying be careful down there your ass gets in a puddle of trouble dont expect me to jump in and help you out and dont expect no pamela anderson either only baywatch round these parts is that fuckin clam on your wrist dave looked at his watch if i drown its yours yeah like im goin to come and get it that thing waterproof of course its a real tachymeter you said it guy tackiest lookin timepiece i ever saw al laughed naw you keep it i got enough shit already still smiling dave slipped into the water it was a lot colder than he had expected and he was glad for the wetsuit he paused for a moment glancing up at the high walls of the ship and the crowd of vessels around him it wasnt just the daylight he was glad of it was the calmer sea too going into the dukes floating dock during that storm would have been a lot more dangerous he switched on the flashlight adjusted the mask on his face secured the mouthpiece between his teeth and then dropped beneath the oily surface as dave swam down underneath the barnacled hull of the boat a feeling of being enclosed threatened momentarily to give way to panic it was like being back in homestead again back in his cell soaked in the cold sweat of his worst nightmare drowning in the unfathomable depths of his fiveyear prison sentence steeling himself dave kicked out toward the underwater support welded to the dukes dock floor to which the britannia was securely lashed he had only to cut through the ropes for the boat to float free from the plinth but for als ignorance of navigation and the workings of a modern motor yacht this was the stage in the plan when dave would have been most nervous of being doublecrossed by his partner for once the underwater line was cut al had only to let go the port lines mooring the britannia fast to the dukes dock walls for the ship to float free a quick burst of reverse engines and the boat would be out in the atlantic on her own als lack of maritime knowledge had never seemed so reassuring as it did now because the stern of the duke was open to the ocean there were fish swimming in the dock water these were mostly mullet and grunt and he paid them little or no attention as he swam strongly underneath the yachts hull and caught hold of her screw the rope itself was a thick one and he used his diving knifes serrated edge to cut it even so it was several minutes before the rope was finally severed and he was able to untie the end attached to the screw so that it wouldnt foul the propeller when they were underway meanwhile the end tied to the floor support sank down in the water startling a small school of mullet mistaking the rope for some kind of predator an eel perhaps the fish turned back on themselves and swam straight past dave missing his face by inches almost as if they intended to use him as cover he was still marvelling at their speed and beauty and congratulating himself on the ease with which he had completed his task when he saw the real reason for the sudden departure of the mullet not the rope at all but the streamlined silverblue shape of a great barracuda the fright of seeing it made him drop his flashlight swift and powerful with two wellseparated dorsal fins a jutting lower jaw and a large mouth with lots of sharp teeth the sixfoot barracuda was a fearsome fish and dave knew its aggressive reputation well enough to be extremely wary of it barracudas were responsible for more attacks on florida swimmers than sharks and while they didnt ever eat people they were quite capable of inflicting the severest injuries instinctively dave started to swim gently away toward the bow of the britannia and curious the big fish followed barracudas were reportedly attracted to shiny objects and dave could not decide if the blade in his hand was a source of help or the cause of his continuing danger he swam on his back not wanting to take his eyes off the creature in case it decided to attack it wasnt that he thought the fish might kill him but the razorsharp teeth of some barracuda were impregnated with a toxic substance that could poison you the last thing dave needed in the middle of the atlantic was a badly infected bite he swam deeper so as not to hit his head on the hulls or rudders of other boats and the barracuda swam slowly after him sometimes disappearing in the dark shadow of one boat only to reappear in a brilliant flash of silver as it entered the sunlit water again it was dave reflected as coolly as he was able like being followed by a vicious and slightly cowardly dog that was only waiting the right opportunity such as when his back was turned to make an attack and no matter how powerfully dave kicked his way through the water the barracuda maintained the same ten feet between them with an effortless flick of its stealthshaped tail dave risked a glance at his watch valuable minutes from an already tight schedule were ticking by and finding that he had already swum the entire length of the duke and was now right under the bows of the jade at the front of the floating dock he sensed that he would have to do something soon or his small supply of oxygen would give out swimming into a pool of sunlight dave glanced up and saw the jades bow ladder touching the water about ten feet above his head paddling into a more vertical position he saw the sun catch his wristwatch and at the same time the barracuda turn fractionally toward the small burst of reflected light there was only thing for it reluctantly dave unbuckled the watch and transferred it to the hand still holding the knife for a second or two he let the sun play on the collection of shiny metal in his hand only when he was quite sure that the barracuda was watching the two bright objects did he let them go as they sank toward the floor of the dock the barracuda flicked its tail and cruised down after them the creatures mantrap jaws opened and closed on the fishscale silver of the watchs metal bracelet dave hardly hesitated he kicked hard for the undulating surface and the ladder above his head even as he reached and then caught the ladder he felt the great barracuda come up after him adrenalin shot through his heart and shoulder muscles launching him up the ladder with such speed that he almost thought it was someone elses arm hauling him out of the water inches under the bottom step of the ladder and the heel of daves bare foot the barracuda arced through the oily surface then disappeared into the shallow blue water below dave plucked the rebreather mouthpiece away and gulped a deep unsteady breath of the open morning air holy shit he gasped that was close now the fish was gone so was the strength in his arms and it was a minute or two before he managed to climb up onto the jades deck standing there he took another deep breath and tried to gather himself the next instant he heard a gunshot and something zipped over his head ricocheting off the dukes forward bulkhead he threw himself flat onto the deck incredulous at this latest turn of lethal events jesus what now lying there he tried to determine the direction the shot had come from who could have fired it had he and al overlooked someone among the crew or the supernumos someone with a gun or had kate simply escaped and armed herself with a gun he hadnt known about he raised his head a few inches to see if he could spot the gunman then ducked again as another shot clanged into the radio mast above him why didnt al do something about it unless this was the doublecross he had feared he had to find out he crawled toward the rail of the boat and shouted hey al its me dave who the fuck is doing the shooting there was a brief and dave thought ominous silence then al said is that you dave of course its me you idiot who the hell do you think it is what the fuck are you doing down there i thought you was some nosey parker not staying indoors like he was supposed to dave jumped to his feet angrily tearing off his rebreather he started up and along the wall of the ship you could have killed me you dumb fucker dave waited until he was back on board the britannia before saying anything else al had put the gun in the galley out of the way so as not to irritate dave any further otherwise he was unapologetic the fuck i was supposed to know that was you i told you not to drink on top of that medication didnt i jesus you could have shot me you go over the side of this boat and you surface at the other end of the fucking ship what am i a fucking telepath do i look like mister spock naturally i assumed this would be the boat youd want to get back on bein how its the one you got off of and how its supposed to be our getaway vehicle carrying millions of dollars in cash al pointed to the sports bags stuffed with money that now filled the boats lounge and covered the deck as if dave needed reminding he said my drinking aint got nuthin to do with the way your sense of direction is so completely all over the place with how you end up swimming from one end of this fuckin marina to the other al frowned and then nodded at daves wrist hey your watch is gone and theres blood on your leg dave glanced down at his bleeding calf he must have got scratched when he hauled himself up the ladder and out of harms sabretoothed way the fuck happened down there anyway asked al dave shook his head as if he couldnt quite believe what had happened himself he started to throw off the headlines securing the britannia to the dukes port wall fucking jaws is what happened there was a goddamn barracuda down there at least six seven feet long al looked impressed as big as my dick huh thats some fuckin fish fish that was a prehistoric monster it was just teeth and fins scared the shit out of me im lucky to be here with two arms and two legs he threw off the springlines and then looked at his empty wrist it ate my watch can you believe that aint no accounting for taste a watch you can buy seven of those when you get home one for every day of the week yeah thats right i can cant i dave waved al toward the sternlines cast off at the stern there will ya and lets get outta here before something else happens told you that swimming was dangerous chuckled al that bitch in jaws the one who goes skinnydipping at the start of the movie everyone knows her ass is heading for the sharks dinner plate man as soon as i saw that fuckin film i knew youd never get my dick in salt water what we saw in costa rica just put that in triplicate the seas a bad neighborhood its like overtown at night and youre some dumb tourist drivin along in a big white rental with sucker written on the rear window sticker radio on splashin around makin a lot of noise havin a good time not a care in the world but just askin to get his ass chewed up by some nigger with a knife sharks barracudas same as kate could hardly believe it when yelping with pain and her wrist as raw as a bad case of sunburn she finally extracted her hand from the cuff tearing off the tape that covered her mouth she quickly drank a glass of water then used the lavatory she was just about to go up on deck when she heard the gunshots the sound brought a bitter little smile to her sticky lips they were still on board and if they were still on board there was a chance that she could stop them stop him she didnt much care about the other guy or even the drugs it was dave she was after now she crawled upstairs and along to the wheelhouse only to find the radio handset gone collecting her binoculars from the control console she knelt down by the window and searched the ship for some sign of dave or his partner straight away she picked him out walking quickly along the port wall toward the stern of the ship he was wearing a wetsuit and he looked pissed as if something hadnt quite gone according to plan then she saw him climb on board the britannia and start arguing with al bastard she murmured think you can screw me and my operation and get away with it it was bad enough she decided to be a drug smuggler but to steal someone elses drugs was beneath contempt probably they had arranged some midatlantic rendezvous a large cargo vessel well she could do something about that if there was one radio working on the whole ship she could call the french navy submarine but the sub was probably already close to the planned underwater rendezvous with the duke with any luck it would see what was happening and move in to intercept the britannia the very least she might do would be to slow the britannia down but without guns how was it to be done maybe she could ram daves boat perhaps even sink him and probably sink herself at the same time sinking dave might have been less hazardous if there had been a boat with some sort of gun like the millimetre rapid fire guns aboard one of the coast guard patrol boats that sam brockman commanded not that he was any help to her now nor kent bowen there was simply no time to crack the remainder of the combination to the safe on board the juarista and get the handcuff keys to release the two of them bowen would probably be more of a hindrance anyway the more she thought about it the more she decided it was better bowen stayed out of her way things couldnt get any worse for her future with the bureau than they already were finding the crew and releasing them looked like a better bet kate crept up on deck mounted the dock wall and ran along to the accommodations block behind her she heard a sound that made her think she might have a little more time than she had expected the britannia seemed to be having trouble starting up its engines they had just backfired and then died the noise reminded her of jellicoes two trophy cannons and suddenly she thought she saw a way of getting back into the game hadnt the captain boasted of firing those cannons once a year to commemorate nelsons birthday jellicoes eccentricity might provide her with just the edge she needed to stop dave now if she could only release him and his crew in time why wont she start demanded al dave winced damned if i know he turned the ignition key again listening carefully to the sound it made and then glanced at the fuel gauge but for the needle registering full tanks he might have said they were out of gas exasperated dave shook his head and tried again nothing maybe a stray bullet hit something suggested al fortyfive caliber goes straight through people must have ended up somewhere maybe im going below to take a look well hurry it up the engine room was in the stern of the boat separated from the fullwidth master suite where the two bodies lay by a wellinsulated watertight bulkhead mercifully dave did not have to go through the stateroom to get in there just climb down a narrow stairwell and open a set of double doors once inside the engine room he knelt by one of the boats two detroit diesel engines a cursory examination of the fuel line entering the engine revealed that it wasnt receiving any fuel at all dave opened the tank and shone a flashlight inside it was full of diesel there must be some kind of blockage in the fuel line he said as al appeared in the doorway he checked the fuel line to the second engine and frowned still they cant both be blocked fuel pump must have packed up shit al punched the bulkhead wall hard shit for a moment dave was haunted by the recollection of something kate had said at the party something about the impellers if they packed up so did the pump and so did the diesel except that there were two engines two fuel pumps and two sets of impellers what were the odds on both impellers packing up at the same time two of everything except fuel tanks there was only one fuel tank the problem had to be in there i guess wed better get ourselves another boat said al and here was me thinking i was through fetching and carrying for the rest of my fuckin life wait a minute said dave ive got an idea he went back up on deck returning moments later with a boat hook its a long shot he explained inserting the end of the pole into the tank and stirring it around but it could be immediately golden diesel filled both clear plastic fuel lines dave grinned son of a bitch what theres something stashed in the tanks i can feel it on the end of this pole something soft and squishy not hard like the bottom of the tank it feels like some kind of a rag or maybe a bag suddenly it dawned on him what it was he could feel on the end of the boat hook of course these tanks must be full of narcotics that was why they were so nervous al this was the boat the feds were watching i thought you said they were watching captain jellicoe he must be in it too dave said improvising more than likely one of the bags broke free during the storm and blocked the fuel outlet look youd better stay below deck with the hook in case it happens again if the engine cuts out just stir it around in there but not too hard if the bag bursts the engine will get a hit of whatever shit it is coke probably and thatll be the whole engine odd there aint no adrenalin shot to remedy that kind of trip ok said al now can we get the fuck out of here were on our way kate had never been down to the dukes engine room but she figured this was the best place to look for the workshop telling her where he had locked up the crew dave had saved her some time if as hed said the crew would be able to break out in only a couple of hours then he might not have been all that careful about stopping someone from releasing them even before she reached the bottom of the stairwell she heard someone hammering on a door it had to be the ships crew presenting herself outside the workshop door she picked up a spanner hammered back then yelled captain jellicoe fbi im going to try and break you out of there she listened at the door for a second and heard jellicoes voice when he had finished speaking she threw away the spanner and laughing looked at the top and bottom of the steel door the door was only bolted back in the britannias wheelhouse dave turned the ignition immediately both engines roared into life he started up the bow thruster and a minute or two later they were bobbing around in the grand dukes wake he waited another few seconds to let the boat get slowly clear of the ship before engaging engines and steering them to the dukes starboard side then he set the course coordinates into the computer and began to radio his position on the agreed frequency it was easier having al off the bridge not having to explain every single thing he was doing when they would reach the rendezvous point and shit like that as the engines picked up revs and the britannia started to make speed dave glanced across at the duke thinking of the carrera with kate still aboard and bitterly regretting the way he had been obliged to leave her so he was a little surprised to see her standing on the foredeck of the ship alongside captain jellicoe and a couple of his officers and men but he was even more surprised when he saw a cloud of smoke appear in front of one of jellicoes brass cannons and heard a loud explosion followed by the whistling roar of an overhead projectile al came rushing up from the engine room as the cannonball landed harmlessly out to sea he gasped did you see that crazy motherfucker thinks hes the crimson fucking pirate spinning the wheel in his hands dave turned the boat hard to starboard and opened the throttle to full revs trying to put some distance between the boat and the ships cannon i think he sees himself more in some kind of law enforcement role he yelled the cannon fired again this time the shot came close enough to send a cloud of spray over the bow of the boat jesus christ said al that one almost hit us to his surprise dave found himself laughing whats so funny demanded al they missed didnt they one of those lead turds hits us you wont see any fuckin comedy in our situation in case youd forgotten paper money aint waterproof chill out al this isnt the nimitz shooting at your richasfuckingcroesus ass this is horatio lord nelson gunning for you this is history man last people those guns fired at worked for napoleon but al was looking anything but chilled ill fix those fuckers he snarled and climbing across some bags of money he retrieved his submachine gun racked and aimed it at the figures standing on the bow of the ship there was no time for dave to say anything the last thing he wanted was anyone else killed least of all kate not that al would have been in the mood to listen all dave could do was spin the wheel hard to port and then hard back to starboard sending al reeling off balance from one side of the aft deck to the other his ninemill firing harmlessly into the air above them when al finally picked himself off the deck the duke was well out of range and the third cannon shot was sinking hopelessly short of the britannias wide and creamy wake what the fuck did you want to do that for evasive action a zigzag i was going to shoot that son of a bitch english faggot now why would someone with all your obvious advantages want to do a thing like that man as wealthy as you are guns are no longer a solution from now on you want to make your point you better get out your wallet not a gun and remember its thickness that counts al grinned as it began to dawn on him that he was now possessed of an enormous fortune shit youre right im rich arent i hell maybe ill let my hair and fingernails grow real long and store my shit in little bottles like that other multimillionaire guy the one who invented jane russells tits howard hughes right al you can do all kinds of shit now youre rich but right now i need you back down below ready to stir that fuel you hear the engine miss any revs then make with the teaspoon sure thing how long before we make it to the pickup dave glanced down at the console and pressed the mark button on the computers gps on the screen the waypoint and the interface with the chart plotter appeared and above this information an electronic map the computer had already set up a range ring to give an indication of how close they were to their next waypoint weve got some cruising to do said dave storm blew us well ahead of where we were supposed to be be about fifty minutes to an hour before we make the rendezvous point great said al and went back inside there was just enough time for him to have a crap and a beer before he came back up to murder dave when the third and last cannonball had been fired and jellicoe had finished swearing kate said they ought to go and see how jock was getting on with the combination to the safe aboard the juarista they found bert ross keying in combinations watched by jock ive just calculated how long this is going to take said jock the first number was nine it takes about ten seconds to try each combination starting with then and so on that means if we end up checking every one of the combinations it will take us two hours and fortysix minutes kate punched the palm of her hand shit we need that radio room key she said grimly always supposing it is in there said jellicoe always supposing that nine is the first of the four numbers on this bloody safe it could be just a way of wasting our time it could be he threw the key over the side i dont think so said kate i know this guy and i dont think he would do that youll just have to accept my word on that may i suggest you persevere with this safe so what do we do in the meantime asked jock theres only one thing we can do and thats get after them fifteen knots is our maximum speed said jellicoe theyre doing a lot more than that no sir i meant we should take one of the other boats in the middle of the atlantic they did without a radio well the fact is were not alone explained kate theres a french submarine somewhere in the area they were supposed to rendezvous with us around now and there are two guys from the fbi and the united states coast guard handcuffed in the head on my boat as soon as you find the keys they can radio a message to the sub there are special frequencies and code words to use fbi stuff meanwhile the duke can hold this position until we find our way back again supposing we do catch up with them argued jellicoe what then theyre well armed as i see it they have two choices explained kate they can make for the azores and risk being found by local lawenforcement agencies or they can sail to a prearranged meeting point with another larger vessel my guess is thats what theyll do transfer the cocaine on board hide it among whatever cargo the other ship is carrying and then sink the yacht theyre on now to cover their tracks if we can get into visual range when that happens we can at least establish the identity of the other ship and have it boarded by the sub later on jellicoe nodded right you are bert nah he shook his head and sighing looked up from the safe yes jack i want you to hand over the safecracking to jock aye sir jock knelt down in the juaristas closet and began to key in the next combination of numbers he said tell frank to get his diving gear right away and meet us at the stern of the ship whatever boat is nearest the open sea i want her unlashed in five minutes as soon as youve got the keys out of the safe you can sort out these other fellows from the fbi and then get them on the radio aye aye sir kate had already left the juarista and climbed up onto the starboard wall of the duke the britannia carrying dave and the drugs was already yards to starboard and disappearing fast she turned looking for jellicoe come on she yelled the bastards getting away chapter twentythree would you mind telling me exactly what the fuck is going on here did the ship hit an iceberg are we the only survivors i hope so because ive got this thing about people driving my boat which is partly to do with the small fact that it cost the best part of a million bucks but mostly its to do with the fact that to handle not one not two but three three man diesel engines each delivering revs and three arneson surface drives you generally have to know precisely what the fuck youre doing kate turned around in the cockpit chair and seeing a redeyed calgary stanford standing there smiled her most disarming smile coolly she said nice boat guy then checking back at the controls she glanced at the rev counter and saw that they were doing over twenty revs as it was the movie actors boat was virtually in flight sitting next to her at the helm position jack jellicoe nodded his nervous agreement smiling thinly as the boat surged forward he said yes shes a real thoroughbred i should think this boat is capable of near competition speeds am i right stanford dropped heavily down in the second copilot seat and said knock it off and just give me the story to date kate started to tell him about the britannia being used to smuggle cocaine and how she and her fbi colleagues had been working undercover cut to the chase will you insisted the actor this is it guy kate told him the fbi has requisitioned your boat and were now in hot pursuit of the bad guys no shit the real cops nrobbers thing the real thing so where the hell are they jellicoe scanning the horizon with his battered binoculars said theres no sign of them yet but were pretty sure theyre on this general bearing stanford gave kate an up and down look of appraisal ill say one thing for you mrs j edgar hoover you sure know how to handle a boat thank you mind if we have some sounds your boat your rules said kate stanford flicked a switch on the control panel that turned on the cd player he grinned and said rock music for a boat chase dont you think the next second a pair of giant speakers behind the helm position kicked in with a guns nroses track theyll probably hear us before we can see them winced jellicoe yeah sorry its not wagner if you know what i mean captain willard not really admitted jellicoe and the names jellicoe actually film reference drawled stanford shaking his head scares the hell out of the gooks n shit like that still not with you im afraid forget it captain willard stanford looked at kate you know i was kind of blasted last night i have a vague recollection of a nocturnal visit by someone carrying heat was that you guys or was i outta my mind that was one of the bad guys said kate they visited all the boats and took away the radio handsets to prevent anyone from calling the navy which disposes of my next question said stanford he looked back at jellicoe and asked hows it comin there willard any sign of mister christian and those other mutineers no like the music music jellicoe snorted guns n roses how do you like them not much on the subject of guns said stanford am i going to need to be packin a piece or what do you mean to tell me youve got a gun asked kate hindsight is always twentytwenty said stanford the hollywood community is full of nervous people and prey to others who make them that way being a movie star has some significant biohazards stalkers shit like that my own life has been threatened on any number of occasions so yes maam i am licenced to carry firearms fact is theres a gunsafe on this boat if youre short of a weapon i can probably fix you both up highway patrolman glock smith wesson sigma all chambered for cartridges with gravitas you dig easy andy im not but when youre on my boat mi arma de fuego su arma de fuego kate nodded enthusiastically she said a gun would be nice how about you captain willard no thanks please yourself said stanford getting up carefully from the copilots seat the speed of the boat made the deck difficult to stand on but clearly stanford was used to it jellicoe said nothing as the actor went below to fetch the handguns he was still sweeping the bright blue horizon for some sign of the britannia from time to time he would glance down at the openscan radar screen it was a similar system to the arpa on board the duke except that the screen had two displays the radar image of the general vicinity and the adjacent chart display instant confirmation of their position and any hazards that might be in the area something on the small screen caught his experienced eye and he touched the instruments zoom button to take a closer look there he said excitedly on the screen something to the northwest of us less than five miles away al came out of the head feeling like shit he had a headache and a bad case of diarrhea and he felt as tired as if hed missed a whole nights sleep so tired that it took him a couple of minutes to remember that he really had lost a whole nights sleep theyd been up all night taking down the score then there was the medication and the alcohol tearing the two scopoderm plasters off his arm he threw them irritably onto the stateroom floor and then sat down on the edge of the bed paying no more attention to the two dead bodies next to him than he had to the guy in the bath while hed been taking a crap they didnt bother him dead was dead he never connected bodies with people who had lived and breathed but he did wish that he had paid more attention to what dave had told him about mixing alcohol with the seasickness medication not that he had drunk all that much no more than a few mouthfuls of vodka a couple of beers that was just refreshment but it did seem to have taken its toll on his state of being trying to get his shit together al took a deep breath through his nose hed killed lots of people before people he knew well too fact was it was nearly always people he knew well the nature of the business he was in demanded it you came on to a guy youd done business with like he was your best friend and then blew his fucking brains out only usually al had a little more enthusiasm for the job on account of how he normally felt more like he had some adrenalin coursing through his system adrenalin was good for wet work it kept you sharp and on your toes right now he felt as blunt as a door handle in a padded cell gray and sweaty like it was him who was heading for a viking funeral instead of the younger guy up on deck al looked around for inspiration and saw a jade block and a razor blade on the dead girls bedside table it had been quite a few years since hed had a blow of snow enjoyable but expensive and madonna was too money oriented to let him turn lots of cash into a handful of dust for snorting up his nose besides naked tony wouldnt have liked it he distrusted people who used dope regularly but as a now and then thing it was ok and right now it looked just what he needed to be on top of the hit parade to give it his best shot one hit to make another that was politics he leaned across the girls body casually inspecting her nakedness and stroking her titties as he reached for her bedside drawer leaving aside the hole in her head and the blood all over her face she was a nicelooking girl still warm too but for his lethal agenda he might have been tempted to fuck her before she cooled off for good the drawer was a regular dessert service tray shotgun spoons goldcapped safety razors gold straws all the paraphernalia of the regular user like it was premier cru bordeaux even the glass storage bottle containing her supply of coke was wearing a little gold jacket damn right babe al told her as he tapped a generous measure onto her jade chopping block its a luxury not a lifestyle when al had finished chopping the coke he separated the powder into two neat mounds took the gold straw and snorted one of the piles into his flaring nostrils his head jerked up from the rush and a big grin spread on his face now thats what i call vitamin c he chuckled and swept the second mound of coke off the jade block with the razor and into the dead girls navel taking the gold straw he pressed his face close to her belly and snorted out her navel licking it clean for good measure already he felt invigorated he said this is good leaf ever since dave had found the stash al had been wondering if there was a way of getting it out of there and loading the stuff onto the ercolano at the same time as they transferred all the money tony might like a windfall like that it seemed a hell of a waste just to sink the boat with all that dope on board if it was anything like the stuff tingling through his nose deepsixing the motherlode would be nothing short of a fucking tragedy al licked the dead girls belly again and feeling the boat begin to slow he stepped out of the main stateroom and shouted up the stairwell we there i reckon this is about the spot shouted dave snorting happily al scratched his nose and went up to the galley where he had left his weapons on the counter he took the automatic and unscrewed the laser aiming module he wouldnt need it not at the range he was contemplating the silencer he had already dumped when firing at what he had assumed was the nosey parker noise was good when you were trying to persuade someone to stay the fuck out of your way ejecting the magazine he thumbed a few more rounds inside until it was full again and then smacked it back up the handgrip one round would be all he would need but al was too much of a pro to leave anything to chance any opportunity you got to reload you took it you could never tell what might happen when you had to grease someone the unexpected it was always a factor especially when it was a guy you knew well a guy you quite liked even drugs had helped al to change his mind about blowing dave away without a word that no longer seemed such a good idea he was going to have to talk to dave apologize tell him that it was nothing personal that it was just naked tonys fucking paranoia and what could he al do about it except do what the fuck he was told or end up in a similarly terminated condition after all he and dave had been through together apologizing seemed to be the least he could do for the guy that and a quick and painless headshot back of the cranium probably ss style whatever you thought about their lack of personal morality those nazis had known how to off people with a pistol german efficiency the ultimate killing machine bmw with bullets the britannias original owner had been a keen diver and the boat was fitted with an apelco fishfinder as well as giving the screen viewer the best possible picture of where fish were to be found the apelco was also equipped with a dualfrequency transducer which scanning forward and downward could give advance warning of shoals holes in the seabed or even wrecks to be explored from the pilots chair on the bridge dave kept one eye on the apelco and one eye on al through the skylight window of the galley there could be only one reason for al reloading his gun he meant to use it on him this was the moment dave had been half expecting now that dave had served his useful purpose it was time for als doublecross dave throttled right back so that the engines were just ticking over picked up the mossberg shotgun from the control console and positioned himself immediately over the stairwell that led up from the galley to the bridge al came creeping up the stairs gun at the ready and called out can you see the ship yet dave pumped a cartridge into the barrel by way of reply and took aim he said just the back of your head al recognizing the distinctive sound of a shotgun being readied for business al became as still as the boat itself throw the gun out of there as far as you can and better make sure it hits the sea or ill get upset what the fuck is this about said al you tell me you gone nuts the gun al or ill part your hair with buckshot ive killed two people today already i dont suppose one morell make much difference to my immortal soul but it sure as hell will to yours ok ok i dont need it any more anyway you said it al threw the gun it sailed through the air and plopped into the ocean behind the boat with a scarcely audible splash come upstairs real slow hands on your head dave told him and backed up to the pilots chair al did what he was told but at the very next minute just as he reached the top of the stairs the boat began to rock violently as if the sea had been stirred by some sudden typhoon or maelstrom dave collapsed back into the chair and glancing down at apelco saw the outline of something large on the screen he knew by the speed of its ascent that this was no shoal of fish or some marine leviathan he recognized the electronic signature of a submarine when he saw one but by then the sub was already surfacing less than fifty yards from the britannias bows and al was scrambling across the deck toward him knife at the ready a murderous expression swiped across his big ugly face dave turned toward al the shotgun pointed squarely at his barrellike body he could have shot him could have blown his head clean off al knew that but he was gambling on daves lack of guts as he saw it for any more killing he hardly expected that at the last second dave would take hold of the gun barrel and swing the mossberg round like a baseball bat against his head the stock struck als skull with a loud thwack like someone knocking once and loudly on a wooden door and al collapsed onto the deck at daves feet most men would have been knocked insensible al merely lay there groaning for a minute time enough for dave to snatch away his knife and throw it over the side backing further away as al sat slowly up he rubbed his head furiously focusing on the shotgun and then on the conning tower now looming over them well theres no need to take this so personally get us out of here for chrissakes he complained whoever they are they dont mean to ask for directions we can still make a run for it where do you suggest we go anywhere but here dave turned off the engines what are you nuts demanded al this little misunderstanding you and i just had it dont mean that we have to go jail for it come on will ya they cant chase a motor yacht like this dave shook his head and said you cant outrun a submarine al quite apart from the twoinch gun on the conning tower they have these things called torpedoes wed be a sitting duck a figure now appeared on the submarines conning tower and speaking english in a thick foreign accent addressed them through a loudhailer britannia prepare to be boarded prepare to be boarded other figures appeared on the hull and within a minute an inflatable carrying several sailors was bobbing its way across the short stretch of water that separated the boat from the sub dave threw the shotgun into the sea just in case al was tempted to grab it and try something stupid it was then that he saw another boat racing toward them checking through the binoculars he saw that it was a some kind of performance yacht right away he guessed it must have come from the duke kate he said wearily thats all i need now weve got him she crowed it looks like ross must have got into the radio room after all yelled jellicoe kate said either that or the french decided to go after them on their own account calgary stanford turned down the volume of the boats cd and said i did a movie about a sub once i was the intuitive sonarman following a hunch course i was just a bit player back then or maybe they tried to radio us themselves and when they got no answer they figured something was wrong kate continued stanford wasnt listening and it wasnt a real sub at all he said just something they mocked up on the lot at paramount the silent service eh remarked jellicoe never fancied being in subs myself banged up for all that length of time a bit like being in prison id have thought thats exactly where those two shitheads are headed said kate and throttled back the predators engines a sub will seem like the plaza hotel by comparison with where theyre going with twenty million dollars worth of coke on board theyll be lucky to get away with twenty years a million bucks a year jellicoe and stanford exchanged a whatabitch kind of glance dont fuck with the fbi whistled stanford ill try and remember that maam absolutely fucking right snarled kate but even as she said it she knew she was trying hard to convince herself that she wanted to see dave locked away for the better part of his adult life whatever he had done she loved him and what was more she wanted to believe that he loved her but all that was too late now there was nothing she could do except her duty with captain jellicoe on the scene not to mention the french navy she could hardly walk away from this her feelings in the matter were of little account here dave was going back to prison and that was where her duty lay even so she half hoped that the captain of the french boat whose men were already boarding the britannia would dispute her jurisdiction and lock dave and al in his submarines brig or whatever it was they called their lockup more work for the das office when it came to getting them extradited but a lot easier for her kate steered stanfords boat alongside the britannia and jellicoe threw a line to one of the subs sailors while stanford put out fenders to protect his paintwork out of the corner of her eye she could see dave standing beside al on the aft deck watching her but she did not look back at him you guys wait here she told jellicoe and stanford and trying not to look triumphant she climbed aboard the britannia curtly declining the helping hand that was offered to her by one of the sailors dave and al were covered by a sailor with a machine pistol and in the absence of her fbi identity card and badge kate had brought stanfords glock automatic to help establish her authority from what she had heard of frenchmen they were notoriously sexist she figured it would be a lot harder for them to patronize a woman with a gun in her hand she looked around for someone who seemed like he was in charge then in her halting french and still avoiding daves twinkling eye she identified herself and requested to speak to the officer in charge to her surprise and annoyance one of the sailors laughed a swarthy handsome man with a thick mustache and wearing a blue boilersuit he said please there is no need for you to try to speak french i speak excellent english agent furey did you say you were called kate nodded and tried to control her irritation the french even when you tried to speak their language they treated you with contempt it made you wonder why people bothered to learn it in the first place i lived in new york for many years explained the man with the flourishing mustache a dirty city but also interesting and you are sir i am captain lieutenant eugene luzhin the executive officer on board he said smoothly and took a packet of cigarettes out of the breast pocket of his boilersuit do you mind if i smoke only it is forbidden when were on board the missile boat and most of us are now desperate to get some fresh nicotine into our lungs its been a week or two since we last surfaced he did not wait for an answer and nodded to his men who took out their own cigarettes and began to light up even the man with the machine pistol luzhin did not offer kate a cigarette for which she was glad diplomacy might have meant she would have had to take it and french cigarettes were too strong for her these were as pungent as any she had ever encountered it was small wonder that frenchmen sounded so gravelly and sexy captain luzhin she said captain lieutenant he said the captain is still on the missile boat captain lieutenant she said acknowledging his grinning correction was he still amused by her attempt to speak french im sorry sir but is there something funny here something im missing he exhaled a cloud of smoke as blue as a car exhaust and shrugged in that gallic way they had is that a yes or a no she asked its just that i am not accustomed to a beautiful woman pointing a gun at me said the captain lieutenant im sorry said kate glancing awkwardly at the glock and wondering where to put it thats all right as a matter of fact i was rather enjoying it puffing stylishly with one eye closed against his smoke he added it is like humphrey bogart in the film casablanca when this beautiful woman he snapped his fingers as he tried to remember the name of the actress who had played use it was dave who supplied the answer ingrid bergman he said catching kates eye at last he added in a good imitation of bogart go ahead and shoot youll be doing me a favor kate blushed with anger and pushed the glock under the waistband of her shorts now then she said brusquely addressing herself to the captain lieutenant these two men are wanted in the united states for piracy and drug smuggling hidden on this boat are kilos of cocaine with a street value of twenty million dollars the captain lieutenant whistled even as she was making her explanation kate was wondering what could be in all the bulky black sports bags that were piled inside the boat but before we do anything else i think we have to resolve the question of jurisdiction a difficult matter admitted the captain lieutenant i believe the grand duke is a britishregistered ship and this boat we are standing on the britannia it is registered in the british virgin islands at least that is what is painted on her stern thats true said kate but both these men are american citizens and as such they should be tried for their crimes by an american court dave said you send me back to the states and ill be facing a long prison sentence like i said before go ahead and shoot youll be doing me a favor is this another joke she asked him angrily no its no joke then why in hell are you grinning dave shrugged and looked for his missing watch were a long way from american jurisdiction said the captain lieutenant may i remind you that these are international waters kate hardly wanted the two men as her prisoners but there was something in luzhins manner that made her want to win this particular argument she said nevertheless i insist that these two men be handed over to my custody theyll be held on board the duke until we arrive in mallorca whereupon theyll be immediately extradited back to the united states immediately the captain lieutenant laughed again i hardly think so these things take time dave said youd really do that to me kate after all that happened between us nothing happened between us and just keep your mouth shut unless you want to spend the rest of the voyage in handcuffs kate be fair i can hardly stay silent about it now can i after all its my ass thats maybe going back to jail you should have thought of that before you pulled this little stunt and thats your last word on the subject last word period she added below her breath but just loud enough for dave to hear how i could have ever fallen for a crummy narcotics thief ill never know this was never about narcotics dave told her still smiling as if he didnt have a care in the world sright said al we was after cash money on them other boats you keep out of this snapped kate once again dave looked for his missing watch then he leaned toward the captain lieutenant and coolly lifting the executive officers forearm read the time on his watch like they were old buddies not that the frenchman seemed to mind at all then dave said something to luzhin that kate didnt quite hear or perhaps didnt understand i regret i cannot accede to your request luzhin told kate but i tell you what he nodded at al you can have him the ugly one and well take the other one with us thats fair isnt it like the judgment of solomon yes half each as it were he nodded at one of his sailors straightaway the man threw away his cigarette stepped into the cockpit and restarted the britannias engines thats the craziest idea i ever heard said kate if this is the way the french navy does things this time she caught the look that passed between dave and the captain lieutenant and thought she could smell a rat as if dave had cut some private deal of his own maybe even bribed the guy wait a minute she said whats going on here you french who said anything about the french shrugged the captain lieutenant and flicked his cigarette across kates shoulder into the water not me well if youre not the french navy then whose damn navy are you mister instinctively she started to reach for the glock under her waistband but the captain lieutenant smiled and caught her wrist in his own strong hand still smiling politely he said pazhalsta and took her gun away chapter twentyfour the britannia nudged its way toward the sub gently towing calgary stanfords boat alongside from the control station on top of the conning tower another officer shouted down to a sailor standing on the foredeck of the sub the sailor opened a deck hatch and tossed a line to the britannia as soon as they were tied off to the sub the sailors aboard the yacht began to throw the nike sports bags to the man standing on the foredeck who dropped them quickly through the hatch when kate turned to look for jellicoe and stanford she saw that another sailor had boarded the comanche and disarmed the two men by then it was clear that dave was in league with the men from the sub he paid close attention to the loading of the bags and from time to time would make some obviously goodhumored remark to the other sailors in russian dammit youre russian kate told the captain lieutenant yes russian he said grinning back at her so its true what they say the fbi finds out everything in the end when the last bag had been dropped down the subs open deck hatch another man came up on deck and greeted dave as if he was his oldest friend then he climbed down the short jacobs ladder that had been hung over the side of the submarines black hull and clambered up onto the britannia kate noted that even al looked surprised when the man from the sub embraced dave fondly they looked like they were two characters from tolstoy she thought she could not understand a word of what was said but it was clear that al had no knowledge of what was happening just as clearly he was angry gritting his teeth al moved to take a swing at dave and then remembered the machine pistol still pointed at the small of his back you doublecrossing bastard he said we aint anywhere near the ercolanos position are we you set this up with the russkies from the very beginning now youre getting it said dave this time al hardly cared about the machine pistol he was strong but not very quick and certainly not as quick as dave who neatly sidestepped the blow then brought his left hand into als side around the bulletproof vest he was still wearing and just over the kidney al doubled over with pain leaving dave a clear shot at his blue jaw which sent him sprawling onto the deck at kates feet dave shook his hand painfully looking down at his former partner he said theres an old russian saying that says roughly translated youre fucked pal einstein gergiev kissed dave on the cheek once more and clapped him warmly on the shoulder kak pazhitaye ti said dave grinning widely pazdrav lya yem the two men spoke in russian unlike english it is a language in which there are two forms of address formal and informal speaking to the captain lieutenant or any of his men dave had used the more formal vi but now speaking to gergiev he used only the informal ti the proper form of address for someone you know very well such as a man with whom you had shared a prison cell for four years daves accent was nearly faultless weve done it he was saying you mean youve done it dave all i had to do was persuade the northern fleet commander to lend me a submarine is that all laughed dave youre right thats not very much just the loan of a sub he was very glad to do it things were a lot worse than even i had imagined the navy in murmansk owes the local electricity company almost four million dollars in unpaid bills last week they cut off the power supply to three nuclear submarine bases im no nuclear physicist dave but even i can see that the consequences of what these guys at the electricity stations are doing could be disastrous the prospect of someone providing the navy with several million dollars of cash in return for preventing nuclear disaster was an offer he could hardly refuse its really that bad for sure there are dozens of retired submarines awaiting decommissioning and quite a few of them are leaking like sieves they need a constant supply of electricity just to keep the pumps going so that the subs dont sink its hard enough to decommission an old reactor on land let alone at the bottom of the white sea gergiev laughed loudly under the circumstances i was able to cut us a very generous deal a very generous deal whats the percentage you wont believe it einstein there must be forty million dollars in those bags that much eh at least so whats the cut they settled for percent thirty percent thats only twelve million dave looked delighted its three times what they owe kolenergo thats the power authority gergiev shrugged the russian navys desperate for hard currency frankly the commander would probably have settled for percent but well i was feeling patriotic and its not just the navy either just a few weeks ago kolenergo cut the power supply for two whole days to the central command of the strategic rocket forces at plesetsk dave this is the place that controls our icbms they even cut the power to an air traffic control center when the prime ministers plane was in the air gergiev laughed twelve million believe me theyll think its a bargain after all they had nothing to lose and everything to gain leaves us maybe twentyeight million dollars breathed dave thats fourteen million each any trouble plenty but its a long story gergiev was older than dave he wore a leninstyle beard and mustache and like the captain lieutenant he was wearing a grimy blue boilersuit he looked more of an intellectual a university professor or a medical man than someone connected to one of st petersburgs biggest mafia gangs he nodded and said youre right you can tell me about it later when were on our way back to russia wed better be going the northern fleet sonar surveillance system reports another submarine in the area probably the french one kate was expecting said dave shes the doll right shes the mother of all dolls a real matrushka my friend one woman inside another there was me making love to her and it turned out she was fbi all along not that i ever accepted her at face value you know me einstein i dont believe in anything then well make a real russian of you yet grinned gergiev what was she doing on the ship were they onto us do you think not for a minute like i said its a long story this boat were on as bad luck would have it the fbi had been keeping it under surveillance hard currency isnt the only thing being smuggled across the atlantic the fuel tanks of this boat are full of cocaine she thinks thats what we came after gergiev looked thoughtful a pity he said after a moment what i was thinking its a pity we dont have more time theres a big market for cocaine in russia these days please dont tell me how much there is down there not just cocaine there are three bodies too i told you we had some trouble in that case ill feel a lot happier when weve sunk this boat gergiev glanced over at al who was now restrained by two burly russian sailors was the killing down to him only partly dave shook his head and said i think he likes shooting people ten minutes ago he was planning to shoot me so what are you going to do with him that all depends on whether kates still disposed to be the scrupulous federal agent i was hoping i might be able to persuade her to come along with us gergiev looked doubtful there are plenty of women in russia dave with the exception of our politicians wives most of them are very beautiful a little corrupt maybe but that shouldnt worry you this ones special einstein any objections gergiev looked at kate at a glance he saw what kind of a woman she was beautiful sure but strong too and proud he had seen women like kate before party women when there was still a party kgb women when there was still a kgb they might wear a little makeup and dress in an attractive feminine way and some of them might also affect an interest in romance but they were always a lot tougher than the men whenever there was a spy scandal and an agent went over from one side to the other it was always a man who betrayed his country never a woman and certainly never a woman like kate it was the same in marriage too always the husband who was the traitor never the wife women knew the meaning of loyalty men just knew how to spell it so gergiev knew her answer would be no even if dave hoped it might be something different gergiev said objections no of course not bring her along im sure the missile boats crew will be delighted to have an attractive woman on board thanks einstein ill talk to her talk all you like but dave gergiev tapped his watch meaningfully dont say too much reluctantly kate allowed dave to lead her into the galley where he returned her fbi identity card and badge and quickly reiterated that he wasnt interested in the drugs aboard the yacht then he explained about the money he said its drug money tony nudelli thinks the money is colombian but actually it belongs to some people in new jersey some friends of tony as it happens italian friends they are not going to be pleased when they find out that tony was behind this thats my present to tony he thinks hes picking up some easy cartel money on its way to eastern europe for laundering instead hes going to make some new and powerful enemies kate looked unimpressed she said you ask me its your personality that needs the laundering maybe youd care to take my list youre in enough hot water already do you poke fun at all men or just the ones you know dont flatter yourself i dont know you at all youre just some guy i once slept with most of the time i had my eyes closed remember dave smiled uncomfortably you can sell yourself that story if you want kate who knows maybe you can write the report and say that there was a lone gunman and no guys standing on the grassy knoll maybe you can even produce a magic bullet but ive seen the zapruder film of what happened between you and me kate it wasnt like you described at all kate shrugged dismissively its not just the warren commission who can cover up and when it comes to what happened between us im earl warren and richard nixon and oliver north all rolled into one in my head this cine films already been edited the scissors have been out crucial scenes have been cut cut dyou hear snip away kate said dave but which of us is the more dishonest i steal money you lie to yourself not just any lie mind but the worst kind of lie this is the kind of lie that might stop you being happy exchange an honest life for a crooked one thats not even worth ten cents on the dollar ill say one thing for you van youre full of surprises i always thought your kind placed no value on sentiment dave sighed well i had to try any law against that kate none that i heard of kate shook her head and quickly wiped a tear from her eye you know when i met you i thought you were the perfect man youre confusing me with that other guy in the bible the guy youre thinking of got himself nailed you knew shakespeare and pushkin when youre in prison you make all kinds of new friends it wasnt meant to end like this you just remember you said that kate when youre back home in miami i know i will and where will you be murmansk st petersburg riga sounds cold they wear a lot of fur in russia dont you like fur kate youd look good in mink to tell the truth i sort of hate to think of all those mink going to so much bother it wont be for very long i intend to travel with all the enemies youve made youll need to maybe even come back to the states when its safe make sure you let me know in advance so i can book you a cell in a nice jail kate shook her head dont even think of it dave i see so much as a homesick dog in the miami heralds classified and ill track you down like your name was doctor richard kimball ill be looking out for you dont bother you wont see me coming that ive seen already kate felt herself blush again but this time it was not with anger dave smiled and said did you know blushing is considered to be evidence of a moral sensibility what would you know about that nothing much i just know ill always remember that night we spent together when im old and gray itll keep me occupied just thinking about it i hear cons have all kinds of ways of getting through a long sentence but if i were you id think of a canary i believe they can be quite affectionate dave looked around for inspiration and saw einstein gergiev tapping his watch sadly he looked back at kate her face as implacable as ever the one tear that had encouraged him had quickly dried the blush on her smooth cheek had cooled there seemed to be no way of getting past her sharp tongue he could see that shed steeled herself to say some of the things she was saying none of it came from the heart he was certain of that anyway but it was as if she had engaged the services of a smart attorney like jimmy figaro and the smart attorney was chambered in her mouth there was no getting past him desperate now he said didnt you ever want to take a ride in a submarine he took her by the wrist cmon kate take a dive with me she retrieved her wrist from his hand me sorry captain nemo but i get claustrophobic taking a shower no way would you ever get me down in one of those cigar tubes she went on glibly so you see even if i wanted to come with you i couldnt id be climbing up the walls in less than twenty minutes then i guess id better be going its what ive been telling you she said sombrely you should never have done this you know you should never have stolen all this money maybe you can convince yourself its just drug money and that it doesnt matter one thief stealing from another and shit like that but when you need guns to do it then youre just as evil as the way the money was made thats what counts nobody can build his happiness on anothers pain next time you look in a mirror just see if im not right evil he laughed if you ever change your mind well its you i want to see kate not the police i dont look in mirrors very much kind of got out of the habit while i was in prison they dont have them in case you use the glass to make a point on yourself but the sun now thats something i do look at a lot what i say is why look for another light when theres one we already have good and evil dont be so melodramatic you know even the sun the brightest thing in the solar system has some black in it take a look at a picture of it sometime and see if im not right when you do youll realize that those black spots are the suns most obvious feature and you know something else those spots they affect everything more than wed ever suspected until quite recently nobody knows what causes them probably nobody ever will but the next time you look at the sun just ask yourself if im really as black a villain as you say so long kate its been fun dave turned to walk out of the galley and then remembered about al he said by the way you can take al with you when you leave our partnership is dissolved no honor among thieves just dont turn your back on him kate waved the handcuffs she had brought with her from the carrera her own fbi set not the pair she was still wearing on one wrist she said i was saving these for you how did you do that anyway asked dave how did you get out of those cuffs kate smiled same way i got rid of my husband i escaped they came out of the galley and stepped back onto the aft deck where al was still held between the two russian sailors seeing dave again he said hey dave youre not planning to leave me here when youre back in miami al i dont advise you try a career reading peoples minds there isnt any plan not any more after all weve been through ill always think fondly of you al right up until the moment when you were planning to kill me kate walked back to al and quickly snapped the cuffs on his wrists turning to look at her al said i hope youre as tough as you think you are girlie because im gonna enjoy tellin people your sordid little story kate flashed dave a narroweyed look he was still in earshot she said thats what it is all right a sordid little story itll make a change from all the other sordid stories we get in my line of work bitch you know something mister ive gained a special understanding of the criminal mind its my considered opinion that mostly and this includes you sport youre all criminal and not much mind when kate and al were back aboard calgary stanfords boat and they had let go the line attached to the britannia dave climbed onto the hull of the submarine as soon as the last sailor had left the boat he took his own submachine gun and emptied the clip at the britannia just along the waterline as the boat started to sink the rest of the sailors climbed down the deck hatch until only dave and gergiev were left standing on the foredeck zhalost sighed gergiev he patted the wallet in his breast pocket and added uminya balit zdyes hmmm i said its a pity repeated gergiev in english it give me a pain right here in my wallet all that cocaine when dave answered his eyes were not on the yacht sinking into the sea with the cocaine and the three dead bodies but on the one already cruising slowly away the one with the real fortune aboard youll get over it said dave and waved to kate she did not wave back given enough time you can get over anything the end
