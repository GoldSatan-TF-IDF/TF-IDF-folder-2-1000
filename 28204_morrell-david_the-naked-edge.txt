david morrell the naked edge telltales the sniper had a partner that was a given to do the job properly which meant not only making the hit but also escaping the shooter needed eyes in the back of his head all the time he sighted through the scope on his remington rifle which he loved more than anything else in the world he needed the freedom to concentrate only on the job at hand an area of a few inches yards away and that meant he needed a spotter to concentrate on the objects around him whether a threat was approaching from the side whether a cloud was about to cast a shadow whether something or someone was about to obscure the target he needed a partner he could depend on who shared his instincts who knew what he was thinking a lot of marriages werent as close they hiked in from the neighboring valley taking the most remote route through the roughest terrain so they wouldnt be noticed aerial photographs aligned with topographical maps showed the slopes that had the best cover while still providing a line of fire toward the target moving cautiously along the treecapped ridges they rejected two vantage points chose the third sank behind boulders opened their backpacks and assembled their equipment telltales in cavanaughs former line of work noticing them had kept him alive runnersandgunners tended to have identifying characteristics baseball caps covering their militarystyle short hair for example the cropped hair wasnt a macho fetish rather it was a hygienic necessity because they couldnt predict where theyd be assigned possibly a desert possibly a swamp contrary to the famous speech in lawrence of arabia about how clean the desert is sand could be almost as insectinfested as a swamp making long hair a likely nest similarly runnersandgunners never wore loafers but instead had thicksoled laceup shoes that could serve as weapons and wouldnt fall off in a fight they liked fanny packs and loosefitting casual clothes that gave them numerous places to hide weapons they needed a thick belt to support the weight of a hidden pistol and ammunition magazines they had an inconspicuous black metal clip over the outside of a pants pocket the clip was attached to a folding knife that could be easily drawn and flicked open with the press of a thumb against a stud on the back of the blade they were fond of safari vests the kind with numerous pockets ideal for hiding weapons for the same reason they liked pants that had extra pockets at the outside of the knees but attention to detail was itself a telltale most people stumbled through life in a state of profound inattention that noted handgun expert jeff cooper called condition white in contrast cavanaugh maintained a state of persistent alertness known as condition yellow it was second nature to him whenever he left or entered a new space a vehicle or a building for instance he always paused and scanned his new environment assessing whether it presented threats he was a connoisseur of mismatched details if something didnt fit an expected pattern internal alarms sounded but it takes one to know one and in a society of minimal consciousness someone with condition yellow attention is so uncommon that he or she becomes a mismatched detail in the present case the two men spotted cavanaugh about the same time he spotted them this was at an isolated gas stationconvenience store twenty miles from cavanaughs ranch the place had a logcabin style that was popular in wyomings jackson hole valley as hed driven north from doing errands in jackson the names of the town and the valley were often confused hed noticed that the fuel gauge on his taurus was below halfway in the remote area where he lived he never allowed it to get any lower so he steered from route and headed along the sagebrushflanked road toward the pumps it took him only a moment to notice the two men watching him they stood across from him in front of the convenience store they were in their late twenties not tall not short not thin not heavy both wore baseball caps they had hiking boots camping pants sturdy belts safari vests fanny packs and knife clips overlapping their pants pockets in glorious aspenyellow october in the camping paradise of wyomings grand teton national park none of those potentially suspicious details was unusual no mismatch except for the alertness in their eyes stronglooking without being conspicuously muscled the two men gave cavanaugh a thorough onceover his cowboy boots his jeans thick belt and unbuttoned shirt hanging loose over a blue tshirt they checked to see if he had the contour of a knife in a pants pocket he didnt but he did have a sheathed fixedblade under his shirt on his left side next to a spare ammunition magazine on his right side also concealed by his shirt was his sig sauer pistol chosen because that nine millimeters compact design made it an effective concealedcarry weapon cavanaugh avoided eye contact when he walked past the men and entered the convenience store he paid for the gas and returned to the pump every motion became a study in casualness he put the nozzle into his cars fuel tank he squeezed the lever and pretended to enjoy the autumn suns warmth he glanced behind him toward the breathtakingly close tetons the towering peaks of which would soon be covered with snow in the old days the tallest of the coneshaped mountains made winterbound femalestarved trappers think of a womans breasts hence the ranges name which derived from the french word for teets after an appropriate time admiring the mountains cavanaugh glanced over toward the convenience store now the two men stood next to a dark van the side door was open one of them leaned in rearranging camping equipment the other man looked over at cavanaugh and then away could be offduty cops on vacation cavanaugh thought then he saw another set of condition yellow eyes this time from a young man late s camping shoes loose pants thick belt safari vest knife clip fanny pack baseball cap watching from next to a dark ford explorer not to be obvious the man broke eye contact and walked over to a trashcan depositing the wrapper from a candy bar to the left a similarlooking man glanced away from cavanaugh opened a cooler in the back of his suv took out a soft drink opened it sipped and glanced again toward cavanaugh without being obvious cavanaugh noticed six other attentive men walking from cabins opposite the convenience store or maybe this is a rendezvous area for a team of protectors he wondered jackson hole attracted an unusual amount of celebrities financiers and politicians a former vice president of the united states had a home in the valley this could be a security team checking the route along which a powerful client would be traveling or maybe these guys are what a security team would be watching for none of my business it hasnt been for five months as a few cars came and went cavanaugh finished putting fuel in the tank driving back to route continuing north through the sagebrushdotted valley ignoring the snake river on his left he glanced toward his rearview mirror no one followed even in wyoming where suvs and pickup trucks were king cavanaughs taurus was so commonplace that it didnt stand out the ubiquitous model was a habit from his former life on protective assignments a taurus tended to be invisible especially if the client was extremely wealthy with adversaries who couldnt imagine their target in anything except a luxury automobile plus unlike an suv the taurus wouldnt roll if cavanaugh needed to perform a degree turn or any other emergency tactic his version of the vehicle which he had driven when hed worked for global protective services was slightly longer than the standard design and had the powerful engine that the ford taurus racing team used its windows were bulletresistant concealed along its interior were dense ceramic plates that protected against highvelocity rifles in the unlikely event that a bullet passed through the fuel tanks armor the container had a rubber liner that sealed bullet holes preventing fuel from leaking to accommodate the extra weight the suspension was reinforced which allowed the vehicle to use wyomings rough back roads its tires were reinforced also and as a further precaution cavanaugh borrowed an idea from the secret service arranging for the center of each rim to have a strong plastic disc a kind of tire within a tire upon which the vehicle could ride if the outside tire became nonfunctional there were additional modifications such as highintensity fog lamps in the rear that could be used to blind pursuing drivers he reached an intersection called moran junction a turn to the west would have taken him north toward yellowstone national park instead he headed east past grassy fields on which elk grazed eventually coming to isolated buffalo valley road after several curves he disappeared among lodgepole pines within which a security camera watched a sturdy metal gate opened when he pressed a security code on a remote control pizza hut he said into a walkietalkie after a moment a female voice responded plenty of pepperoni all they had was ham its not a pizza if it doesnt have pepperoni the allclear exchange having been completed cavanaugh drove through pressed the remote control and closed the gate past another security camera in the trees he emerged into a grassy canyon flanked by wooded bluffs his rearview mirror showing the magnificent teton mountains in the distance behind him the spotter heard the taurus before he saw it a sentry had radioed him that it was coming he thought he was prepared emotionally even so his pulse increased until he felt pressure in his veins not because of what would soon happen instead because of what had happened as he and the sniper sank lower on the ridge he had a sudden painful memory of two boys wading in a stream filled with goldfish another memory equally painful followed an old man pounding a hammer onto an anvil sparks flying from a strip of glowing metal peering between boulders watching the car emerge from the pines the sniper murmured i can do it as soon as he gets out of the car not until i tell you but theres a schedule the spotter insisted the backup team needs to be in place ready to cut the phone line to the house that way nobody can call the police otherwise with only a couple of roads out of the valley the authorities could seal us off the survivors could still use a cell phone this areas too remote for one youre sure the sniper asked i drove by and experimented trying to phone restaurants in town the calls wouldnt go through later i confirmed it by asking the phone company the canyon walls prevent transmissions from reaching here or going out the shooter gazed longingly at the car as it crossed the canyon so when will the backup team be ready the spotter touched his left ear securing the bud of a radio receiver theyre saying ten minutes staring toward the canyon floor he concentrated on the figure in the drivers seat even at a distance the solidlooking shoulders and chest were all too familiar impossible to be mistaken the intelligent brow and handsome jaw had always been attractive to women although amazingly the target had a talent for minimizing his appearance when he was on duty dimming the glow in his hazel eyes lowering his shoulders making himself almost invisible he still wore his sandy hair in a professional neutral cut its been close to three years the spotter thought how the hell are you doing good buddy a painful combination of anger and affection seized him hed dead but he doesnt know it the sniper said ten minutes sure i can wait that long this is what it feels like feels like to be god driving across the pasture cavanaugh smiled at the halfdozen horses grazing near a stream a mare galloped toward him she was a fiveyearold quarter horse named after her color chestnut as she ran parallel to the moving car cavanaugh lowered his window guess what i have he nodded toward a paper bag next to him the horse kept thundering next to him cavanaugh pulled out a big red apple want it now or later chestnut snapped at it hey where are your manners cavanaugh tossed the apple over chestnuts head and watched her veer toward where it landed in the grass the five other horses one of them a colt realized what was happening and galloped in cavanaughs direction i suppose i need to be fair he dumped the bag of apples onto the grass and drove on beyond the pasture was a threestory lodge made of logs it had a wide welcoming porch ten years earlier while working in the area his client a political columnist threatened by a stalker cavanaugh had heard about a dude ranch for sale investigating while offduty he was so impressed by the peaceful feel of the canyon that he did one of the few impulsive things in his life and bought it it was expensive for the down payment he needed to hand over every dollar hed saved as a protective agent and to accept two highpaying extremely dangerous assignments thereafter most of his income went toward the mortgage but he never regretted his decision between jobs sometimes convalescing from injuries he came back to his magical hundred acres which had the equally magical name of home as cavanaugh drove toward the lodge he saw jamie standing on the porch attaching a walkietalkie to her belt smiling she stepped out into the sun which glinted off her brunette ponytail she was five feet ten her jeans emphasizing her figure her cowboy boots lifting her heels making her legs seem to stretch up forever toward her hips her face had the narrow chin and high cheekbones of classical beauty but her green eyes a mixture of amusement and intelligence were what most captivated him he parked in front of the lodge and got out of the car that pizza hut thing made me hungry i dont suppose you actually did bring a pizza jamie said nope bummer something better a philadelphia steak sandwich she asked how can you be so thin and think so much about food because thats all i do is think about it you feed the horses but you never feed me come on fess up you brought kentucky fried chicken right sorry double bummer even better than kfc cavanaugh leaned into the car and picked up a small case indented with the words heckler amp koch awww jamie said youre right it is better than kfc you really know the way to a womans heart i just love it when you bring me a gun but not just any gun dont keep me in suspense what makes this one so special its called the p my yes that certainly sounds special their boot steps echoing they crossed the porch and entered the lodge a spacious communal room as the realestate brochure described it had a wide staircase a huge stone fireplace a battered upright piano a long table where lodgers had eaten during the duderanch days and several ceiling light fixtures in the shape of wagon wheels do you remember the first rule of choosing a handgun cavanaugh asked the gun has to fit the hand right if the grips too large your finger cant reach the trigger without stretching the gun twists to the side and ruins your aim reaching the kitchen cavanaugh looked at a row of monitors under a cupboard linked to security cameras the screens showed various areas of the property satisfied that everything appeared normal he turned toward where mrs patterson rolled a pie crust a sixtyyearold widow whose children and grandchildren lived in jackson she had worked for the dude ranch and agreed to stay what kind of pie are you making jamie asked pumpkin maybe ill skip dinner tonight and just eat the pie cavanaugh shook his head in amazement at jamies appetite he opened a cupboard took out a box of ninemillimeter ammunition and an equipment bag then headed toward the back door its going to be loud for a while mrs patterson the grayhaired woman set down her rolling pin pulled a kleenex from her apron tore it in two and wadded the halves into her ears the screen door banged shut as cavanaugh and jamie walked toward a shooting area next to a barn feeling the intense sunlight they stopped at a weathered wooden table and faced metal targets twentyfive yards away a mound behind them each target had the outline of a human head and torso cavanaugh opened the case took out the pistol and showed jamie that there wasnt a magazine in it then he locked back the slide to reveal that there wasnt a round in the firing chamber cold gun cold gun she agreed he set the pistol and the gear bag on the table then he opened the box of ammunition with practiced efficiency he and jamie loaded ten rounds into three magazines it always amazes me that you dont break your fingernails cavanaugh said thats how little attention you pay hanging around with you id dont have any fingernails so tell me about the p even goldilocks would like it cavanaugh showed jamie three polymer strips labeled s l or xl a strip on the back of the weapons grip was labeled m youre telling me you can size the grip to fit the hand try it although the pistol was still cold cavanaugh approved of the way jamie pointed it down range as if it were loaded not quite comfortable she said slightly too big for my hand then well reduce the grip cavanaugh pulled a hammer and a punch from the equipment bag with a few taps he removed a pin from the strip he took it off and attached the one marked s now try it perfect jamie said cavanaugh was fascinated by the problem of hands fitting grips because his own hand was small in comparison to his sixfoot frame prior to his delta force training hed been obligated to use the armys standard sidearm berettas fifteenround nine millimeter for a magazine to hold that many rounds it needed to have two columns of ammunition the result was a grip too large for him hed managed to compensate and control his aim but like someone forced to wear tight shoes for a long time he was now obsessed with proper size and comfort put some rounds through it he suggested ladies first gosh jamie shoved a magazine into the grip and pressed a lever on the side a similar lever was on the opposite side making the weapon ambidextrous another rarity the slide which had been locked back rammed home chambering a round i need my fashion accessories she told him they put on their protective glasses and ear guards then approached the targets stopping ten yards away a standard shooting distance most gunfights occurred within half that space jamie raised the pistol both arms straight out both hands solidly on the grip both thumbs pointed along the side as a further way of aligning the barrel with the target cavanaugh considered the freedom with which she lifted her arms no evident discomfort no stiffness to indicate her bullet wound five months earlier she pulled the trigger hidden among the trees on the ridge the spotter frowned toward the back of the lodge the target and the woman were out of sight behind a barn interesting that i want to objectify him by calling him the target instead of using his name doesnt seem a day older kept in shape picked a damned goodlooking wife you son of a bitch the spotter unclipped a polished ebony knife from his pocket thumbing the blade open and closing it target practice he said in response to the gunshots a handgun the sniper commented yes sounds like a nine millimeter must be a metal target hear the bullets hitting it accurate shooter oh hes definitely an accurate shooter the spotter said thats why were up here and not down there the sniper counted nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen large magazine sixteen seventeen eighteen hell of a large magazine you know any handguns that hold that many rounds no the spotter said after ten a slight pause hard to notice thats when the magazine got changed damned fast magazine change twentytwo twentythree after twenty another slight pause yeah a superfast magazine change the sniper agreed well im here to blast his eye out at sevenhundred yards not have a gunfight with him amid the shots echoing across the canyon they heard an approaching rumble ear guards muffle sounds but dont eliminate them cavanaugh listened to the rhythmic thunder and peered toward the southern rim of the canyon from behind which a helicopter appeared its dragonfly shape getting larger silhouetted against the cobalt sky jamie lowered the pistol and glanced at her watch hes early yeah cavanaugh took off his ear guards a half hour i was hoping he wouldnt come at all you still dont know what he wants only that he said its important but i can guess he plans to offer me a job as the helicopter roared closer cavanaugh was able to read the name stenciled in red across the side global protective services memories rushed through him the clients hed protected some wealthy and powerful others ordinary people whom hed persuaded gps to help all sharing the common denominator that they were prey the protective agents hed worked with all of them linked by their hatred of predators and their devotion to being guardians even at the cost of their lives jamie said something but the growing din of the chopper prevented him from hearing her or perhaps it was the memories what he asked are you going to take the job preoccupied cavanaugh reached under his loose denim shirt and removed his knife from its sheath on the left side of his belt a rugged utility knife useful for work around the ranch it was a gift from his friend gil hibben commemorating gils induction into the knifemakers hall of fame it had the balance for what cavanaugh did next releasing the emotions that memories of his dead friends had caused he drew back his arm and hurled the blade toward a post fifteen feet away expertly judging the number of flips the knife had to make it struck solidly the force of his throw and his emotions embedding it no he said i wont take the job i think you should the chopper was nearer louder ignoring it cavanaugh turned toward jamie five months ago you nearly died i still have nightmares about it you didnt force me to go along i made a choice it wasnt your fault i was shot im never going to put you at risk again but a lot of people need help somebody else will have to give it to them the helicopter hovered over a section of grass between the barn and the lodge wed better not be rude and keep him waiting cavanaugh said in other words youre changing the subject cavanaugh shrugged he retrieved his knife then followed her to the weathered table where they put their eyeandear protection into the equipment bag jamie dropped the magazine from the pistol and caught it in the air impressed cavanaugh reloaded it not looking where the helicopter landed the roar of its engine diminishing now we are being rude jamie said do you suppose its a clue that i dont want to talk to him early the sniper said yeah the spotter kept opening his knife and closing it complicates things i told you i could have done it when he got out of the car now now well just have to wait a little longer the spotter readjusted the radio bud in his ear listening harder the backup team isnt in position to cut the phone line yet two men got out of the chopper getting crowded the sniper said the first man who climbed down from the helicopter was fortythree but his permanently pensive expression created wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and mouth making him look older his dark hair was as immaculately cared for as his handmade shoes and his customtailored suit his broad shoulders and proud chest gave him a further imposing look he carried a leather briefcase that shone with polish his contact lenses had a similar sheen the intelligence in his eyes magnified by them what his smile lacked in warmth was offset by the brilliance of his perfectly capped teeth william cavanaugh shook hands with him the mans last name was faraday a ruthless corporate attorney he didnt just defeat his opponents clients but also destroyed them in the process acquiring numerous enemies cavanaugh had once saved his life when a disgraced executive hired someone to try to kill him in gratitude william did much of global protective services legal work in exchange for ready access to worldclass protectors you remember jamie cavanaugh said i do william shook her hand theyd met when he prepared their wills have you recovered from your injury yes thanks for asking william nodded as if not accustomed to displaying soft human emotions or being complimented for it angelo cavanaugh said to the choppers pilot its been too long since puerto vallarta the husky man replied and that stock market analyst we protected remember how he was afraid angry investors were waiting for him behind every corner hell one of them was cavanaugh shook his hand warmly how are the llamas you were raising they were sissies they never bred youre sure you had male and female you think i cant tell the difference they spent more time spitting than trying to fornicate right in my eye one of them spat right here angelo used a middle finger to point at his eye cavanaugh couldnt help laughing then they jumped the fence by the time i found them theyd been run over by a cement truck if id been smart id have eaten them instead of trying to breed them they taste good i have no idea but now i raise ostriches those you can eat plus they lay eggs the size of basketballs true i exaggerate only slightly cavanaugh laughed again hombre i missed you he led them toward the lodge in the kitchen he scanned the monitors again saw that everything was normal and introduced mrs patterson as she spooned pumpkin mix into the pie crust want something to eat or drink he asked his guests thank you no william answered we have business to discuss then i need to get to denver whats in denver a vietnamese businessman with a problem ah knowing williams reluctance to confide cavanaugh knew that the vietnamese businessman might actually be a japanese baseball player i hoped youd stay for a while both of you are welcome youll never forget the color of the sunset behind the tetons another time the office looked the same as when the property had been a dude ranch next to an old desk a wall of photographs showed children fishing swimming riding horses and pitching their tents in the meadow next to the lodge another wall had shelves with slots for mail and messages everything retained the vague smell of pipe smoke from long ago on occasion cavanaugh was tempted to clear everything out but then he remembered the two men in their thirties whod arrived a couple of years earlier they drove winnebagos they had beer paunches their wives looked bored and their kids kept shoving each other the men asked cavanaugh if it was all right for them to show their families what the childrens camp had been like theyd spent the happiest summers of their lives here they said they couldnt get over that everything was the same their happiest summers cavanaugh had found it sad that they knew their lives hadnt gotten any better now william sat in a dark leather chair and opened his briefcase while cavanaugh and jamie watched from wooden chairs across from him i came all this way because you might as well know right away that i dont want a job a job you think i came here to offer you a job didnt you the word job doesnt quite describe it william looked amused im offering you everything what are you talking about lock stock and barrel as i believe they say out here youre not making sense youve got it all my friend all of what global protective services cavanaugh was certain he hadnt heard correctly then his heart lurched and he took a long breath duncan gave it to you in his will william said again cavanaugh was overwhelmed by memories tall and wiry with a mustache duncan had been cavanaughs delta force instructor after leaving the military duncan had founded an international security agency that flourished thanks to the quality of the personnel duncan hired all of them from specialoperations units around the world many of them having been duncans students when duncan had been killed on an assignment there were global protective services branches in new york london rome and hong kong with another planned for tokyo his will cavanaugh subdued the anger he suddenly felt youre telling me about this five months after he died there were reasons what reasons jesus we could have talked about this at duncans funeral we could have no william said we couldnt have cavanaugh noticed jamie looking at him with concern im sorry he told william i didnt mean to sound like i was criticizing you of course not anyway youre in mourning youre allowed one of the reasons you didnt hear about this until now is that it was difficult to verify duncans death so that the probate process could begin verify his then cavanaugh understood the bullets had mutilated duncans face so completely that his teeth couldnt be used to establish his identity what the bullets hadnt accomplished a fire had god help him there were indications of healed broken ribs and a similarly healed broken collarbone occupational injuries cavanaugh felt sympathetic twinges in his own healed bones unfortunately there werent any recent xrays of those areas of his body so i still couldnt prove the remains were his finally i went to the pentagon and asked to see duncans medical file the army was as protective of him in death as if hed continued to be a delta force instructor it took a phone call from a former client a ranking member of the current administration before the file was released to me my concern was that the injuries occurred after duncan left the military in which case the xray films would have been valueless but in fact the broken ribs and collarbone were visible i was able to make my case you said one of the reasons i didnt hear about this until now another is that duncan was a better protector than he was a corporate executive without consulting me he made a number of business decisions that brought the continuing existence of global protective services into doubt there almost werent any assets for anyone to inherit fortunately ive been able to disentangle those problems but still another reason that i didnt pay you this visit until now is william held up a sheet of paper duncan willed global protective services to a man named aaron stoddard as jamie gave cavanaugh another look of concern he sat straighter his back hardening the problem is nobody at gps ever heard of a man with that name duncan didnt have any surviving family so it wasnt possible to seek that avenue of help you could have asked me cavanaugh said you made clear you didnt want to be contacted but what would you have answered if i had come to you and asked if you knew aaron stoddard would you have told me or would you have remained determined to separate yourself from your former life cavanaugh didnt reply in the end the pentagon complied with another of my requests aaron stoddard it turns out once belonged to delta force also in fact he was one of duncans students then duncan hired him for global protective services but by then for security reasons aaron stoddard was using another name your name conscious of his heartbeat cavanaugh leaned back he needed a few moments before he could respond back then my mother was still alive my stepfather my halfsister my friends when i joined gps i realized that one of the weaknesses in the system was that predators might target a protective agent as much as a client they could grab a protectors family and friends and try to use them as leverage to get the protector to betray the client i decided that i couldnt put my family and friends at risk i needed to look out for their safety just as i did a clients and the easiest way to do that was to assume a false name and identity that would keep predators from discovering my background well you certainly succeeded i believed cavanaugh was your true name ive never heard you supply a first one so i was surprised that in gpss personnel files you list a first name of james which i never use when im working establishing a mystique as a protective agent with only one name do you agree that im aaron stoddard yes he looked over at jamie to whom hed long ago confided the truth about his identity now that im no longer a protector it doesnt matter if anybody knows who i really am my mothers dead now my stepfather has a heart condition hell probably be gone soon also my halfsister is the only relative i need to worry about and you of course he told jamie ill never stop protecting you what i meant was william said do you agree to abide by duncans wishes and accept ownership of global protective services william did anybody ever tell you youve got a pushy manner my second and third wives but i tried not to take it personally really im sorry you came all this way you wont accept i made a promise and im keeping it from now on jamies all i care about duncan didnt indicate a second choice gps isnt a publicly traded company theres no board of directors no one except duncans heir can make decisions if your refusal is absolute ultimately the company will need to be dissolved im afraid theres nothing i can do about that cavanaugh said perhaps you should take a couple of days to consider the implications no cavanaugh insisted can we speak privately jamie interrupted cavanaugh looked at her outside she told him behind boulders on the ridge the spotter studied the lodge through binoculars that were shielded to keep the sun from reflecting off their lenses they could be inside for hours the sniper said the backup teams in position now the moment youre sure youve got the target in your sights ill tell them to cut the telephone line the timing has to be right if we do it sooner than we need to he might try to use the phone wonder why it doesnt work and realize hes being set up in that case tell them to get ready the sniper peered through his scope the targets on the back porch jamie closed the screen door after she and cavanaugh stepped outside i want you to own global protective services but i promised you i was out of the business im freeing you from that promise beta get ready to cut the phone line the spotter said into the radio on your signal a voice replied stand by the spotter turned toward his partner can you get the shot the man lay on his stomach his left hand gripping the rifles stock his left forearm resting on his knapsack his right hand clutched the rifles grip his finger at the trigger the boltaction remington was one of the most accurate sniper rifles a favorite of the us military as well as lawenforcement swat teams it accurately delivered a bullet up to yards the sights had oneminuteofangle accuracy the trigger was adjusted to a gentle twopound pull the powerful scope had a holographic sight with a red dot that indicated exactly where the bullet would strike the target the stateoftheart sound suppressor prevented the sniper from disclosing his position and drawing return fire but precise equipment was only one element of accurate longdistance shooting training experience steadiness the ability to craft handmade ammunition and adjust sights based on conclusions about distance temperature altitude and wind the zen control of breathing temperature blood pressure and heart rate the focus of a lifetime into one steady confident pull on the triggerthe accumulation of all these and more were what made a great shooter i said can you make the shot receiving no answer the spotter peered through his binoculars and inhaled with annoyance when he saw the problem damn it the womans in the way sometimes you dont listen to yourself jamie said thats because i dont enjoy onesided conversations angelo was talking about his llamas and his ostriches and he made you laugh so hard you said you missed him just a figure of speech hey we arent going to start shopping for furniture or anything you do miss him you miss all the agents you used to work with you miss global protective services and how can you be sure ive never said anything about that sometimes i see a faraway look in your eyes as if your minds somewhere else doing things in places a lot more exciting than here no you do have that look jamies hands were on her hips her back to the sunbright pasture and the aspencovered eastern slope of the canyon it reminds me of tigers and lions in cages in zoos the look in their eyes the controlled frustration its like they know there has to be a better way but they also know theres nothing they can do about it well this is your chance to do something about it theres no place else id rather be and no other person id rather be with you gave up a huge portion of your life for me jamie said but look at what i got in return cavanaugh gestured toward the stream flowing through the pasture sunlight glinting off it the horses leaning down to drink you still wear a gun and a knife the worlds a dangerous neighborhood you still drive an armored taurus a sturdy dependable car the faraway look you see in my eyes isnt longing its nervous relief that i dont live that way anymore its amazement that i ever did i dont understand risking my life for people i didnt know and often didnt like i used to say i had my professional standards i wouldnt protect child molesters or drug traffickers anyone whos an obvious monster but what about the monsters who arent as obvious that stock analyst angelo and i protected he was in bed with the companies he was supposed to be making judgments about he let greed mean more to him than the trust investors put in him a lot of people counted on him for the security of their pensions and all he had was contempt for them i hated that man part of me was delighted when a ruined investor tried to attack him oh angelo and i made sure the analyst wasnt injured but he sure was scared and i was glad to see him scared but that was wrong a protector needs to be absolutely committed to his client he needs to be willing if necessary to die for that client jamies eyes reacted now that im away from it all cavanaugh told her i realize how many of my clients werent worth risking my life for they were special only because they were rich or powerful or uncommonly attractive what made them unique poisoned them not all of them jamie said you told me some clients were remarkable saints you called a few of them for a moment cavanaugh did long for his former life there was one politician i thought could have made a difference unfortunately his party chose somebody who looked good on tv there was a billionaire who told me all my life ive been taking money out of the system now im putting it back he had exciting plans for ways to use his money to improve education but then he got cancer and died and his heirs fought over his estate there was an entertainer who spent significant portions of his time performing benefit concerts for childrens hospitals whats the downside to that story actually there isnt one the entertainer still performs benefit concerts and the childrens hospitals keep getting money whod want to hurt a man like that he has several obsessed fans plus he had a manager who was furious because the entertainer fired the guy after discovering how much money was being skimmed from the hospital fund in mexico city where the entertainer was performing one of his concerts kidnappers tried to grab him for a tenmillion dollar ransom youre right the world is a dangerous neighborhood jamie took a deep breath but maybe youre being given an uncommon opportunity to make things better maybe you could be the equivalent of that billionaire you mentioned i dont understand maybe you could change the way global protective services does business take from the rich give to the poor by which i mean hold your nose and protect people you dislike so the company can afford to protect people who deserve to be alive cavanaugh studied her it would mean the end of all this he gestured toward the canyon he tried not to look at the helicopter and all it symbolized we could come back whenever we wanted we you dont think id let you go by yourself maybe youre the one whos feeling restless not for somebody else believe me lover but maybe happiness isnt enough maybe human beings need to be useful she isnt moving the spotter stared through his binoculars at where the woman stood on the porch her back to him i can see his head behind her bullshit all i see are his hands gesturing to one side of her or the other his head no way from this angle the porch roof interferes im telling you i see about an inch or so of his head a guaranteed kill no what about shooting through her remember the jfk assassination the sniper asked how the hell old do you think i am one bullet boomeranged all over the place in several impossible directions hitting kennedy and governor connally yeah the magic slipsliding bulletif somebodys dumb enough to believe oswald was the only shooter what im saying is i can hit her square in the neck on an angle that i think will go down and out the soft tissue and into his chest but that bullet might just as easily hit the top of her spine and shatter or change angle blast along a rib and slam into the post beside her so you cant guarantee a kill not even if the bullet does go through her neck and into his chest but hed be down and youve got other ammunition in that rifle how fast can you chamber a fresh round a lot faster than that dick oswald wait shes stepping out of the way ive got a shot thisll be just like that time in rome beta the spotter said into the radio cut the phone line in the office william pressed buttons on his cell phone waited but didnt get a response impatient he stood left the office and crossed the communal room to enter the kitchen mrs patterson was removing the pie from the oven angelo watched her smells like thanksgiving angelo said the phone rang william who disliked pumpkin pie glanced around at the stainless steel appliances in the otherwise rustic kitchen get your business done mrs patterson asked theyre discussing it william turned his attention to the security monitors on the counter next to him the phone rang a second time mrs patterson went to the wall next to the refrigerator and lifted the phone off its mount hello hi tina hows little brians cold ive been worried itll turn into hello tina problem angelo asked the line went dead are these men supposed to be on the property william inquired what men angelo turned the ones on this television monitor three shots made cavanaugh flinch from behind him from the opposite end of the porch from the kitchen was all he had time to think as his startle reflex engaged even the most seasoned operators accustomed to bullets being fired near them couldnt control that reflex he grabbed jamie and lunged sideways seeking the only available cover the lodges wall simultaneously he felt something snap past him and wallop onto the porchs floor tearing up splinters two shooters one in the kitchen one on the ridge he kept lunging holding jamie tightly turning so his back led the way as they crashed through the screen that covered his office window the window was raised his head grazed past the wooden frame he fell holding jamie banging onto the floor cavanaugh angelo yelled then william and mrs patterson also shouted his name he heard footsteps rushing toward the office but all he cared about was jamie are you all right she didnt answer jamie im okay got the wind knocked out of me cavanaugh rolled from under her scanning her body looking for blood what happened she wanted to know angelo and the others charged into the office cavanaugh he drew his pistol from under his shirt the kitchen who shot i did three bullets into the wall angelos pistol was in his hand men on the grounds the phone lines been cut i didnt know how else to warn you in time the eastern slope sniper cavanaugh said i didnt hear any shots from up there he must be using a sound suppressor william i hope you know how to handle a gun not even in my worst nightmares youre about to learn you dumb bastard after all your bragging you missed the spotter said hey it wasnt my fault how was i to know somebodyd start shooting down there how was i to know the target would quit making excuses how are you going to fix this wait for another shot now that he knows hes a target you think hes just going to waltz outside and show himself the spotter demanded to get to the car maybe or the helicopter hell hes got to do something he knows hes stuck he cant phone for help sooner or later hes got food water he can stay there for days but we didnt come prepared for a damned siege so you make mistakes too huh and youre one of them do this right with a sigh of impatience the shooter reached into his backpack and selected a box of ammunition he worked the remingtons bolt and ejected the two remaining rounds from the rifle then he inserted four rounds from the fresh box of ammunition each cartridge had a red tip tracers incendiaries i brought them in case this turned out to be a night shoot for the same reason i also brought an infrared scope if he tries to leave when its dark ill get him but it wont be dark for another four hours doesnt matter the shooter steadied his aim toward a large white tank beside a shed about fifty yards from the lodge ill get the target out of the lodge if i shoot one of these babies into that propane tank hell the explosion will probably level the place no dont the spotter was appalled whats the matter the neighbors in the other valleys are used to hearing shots on this property but an explosion would attract every police officer and emergency crew from here to jackson yeah theres that i suppose okay ive got another way the shooter switched his aim toward the lodge tell beta the targetll be outside in fifteen minutes heart pounding cavanaugh raced across the communal room and tugged open a door next to the battered upright piano he pulled out an ar the semiautomatic civilian version of the m he gave it to angelo along with a loaded thirtyround magazine watch the front got it wait take this cavanaugh grabbed a walkietalkie off a shelf and tossed it to him as angelo hurried toward the front windows cavanaugh took out another ar ill watch the east and try to locate the sniper mrs patterson get down in the basement no tell me how to help stay out of sight im not going to hide fear made her voice tremble theres a revolver in a kitchen drawer you taught me how to use it stay behind cover cavanaugh yelled as she ran toward the kitchen keep your walkietalkie close jamie ill take the back she said with no ars remaining cavanaugh gave her a ruger mini a streamlined semiautomatic rifle favored by ranchers he stared into her eyes praying she wouldnt be killed you can count on me she said he touched her hand i know he felt his throat tighten as she grabbed a box of ammunition and hurried away william come with me cavanaugh tugged the attorney back into the office the good news is the log walls of this building are so thick we dont need to worry about bullets coming through youre implying that in most houses bullets can come through walls dear god whats the bad news the windows are the only target the sniper now has hell focus on them then how are we supposed to look out there and see if anybodys attacking stay to the side keep your face from the opening peer out at an angle cavanaugh spoke those words into his walkietalkie mrs patterson did you hear that her voice was staticky yes angelo see anything nada his voice came from the walkietalkie jamie clear mrs patterson nothing what about the security monitors all i see are bushes and trees maybe its finished breathing loudly william crouched near cavanaugh against a wall in the office the sniper that fired at you now that he missed maybe hes gone cavanaugh inched toward the undamaged eastern window the one behind his desk trying to get a glimpse of where the shooter might be hiding on the aspencovered ridge he eased closer to the window its screen bulged inward something snapped through the room and struck the leather chair that william had earlier sat in the glowing object plowed through the chair and hit the wall smoke rose cavanaugh yelled into the walkietalkie the shooters using incendiaries crawling in a direction that didnt make him a target through the window he reached a closet tugged at its door and took out a fire extinguisher as flames writhed from the chair and the wall he aimed the nozzle and pulled the trigger a pungent cloud spewed toward the fire smothering it still nothing angelos voice crackled from the walkietalkie same here mrs pattersons voice said nobody jamies voice reported hes definitely using a suppressor cavanaugh told them i cant place where the shots are coming from with a snap as from a whip another tracer tore through the screen this one shattering a lamp more smoke rose flames wavered cavanaugh pressed the extinguishers trigger another cloud of retardant gushing over the fire william coughed from the assault to his throat and lungs mrs patterson cavanaugh said into the walkietalkie theres a fire extinguisher in the kitchen get it ready on the ridge the sniper worked the bolt on his rifle chambering another round clever the spotter said peering through binoculars at the haze in a groundlevel room down there im just getting started check the attic window on this side the sniper shifted his aim toward the top of the building with practiced ease he pulled the trigger and absorbed the recoil as the rifles sound suppressor made a noise similar to a fist hitting a pillow keeping his eye on the powerful scope he saw a hole appear in the attic window keep handing me ammunition still incendiaries the spotter asked what else when you were a kid didnt you like to play with fire no i just tortured animals tortured thats a joke right of course man sometimes you worry me the shooter squeezed off another round then quickly reloaded in an amazingly smooth fast series he pumped incendiary bullets through every window on the eastern side of the lodges second level as the haze from the fire retardant settled cavanaugh said hes concentrating on this window i cant take the chance of looking out lets go he tugged william toward the door entering the communal room he saw jamie crouched next to a screen door at the back a log wall protecting her as she scanned the meadow and the ridge to the north he noticed that she now wore her pistol in a holster on her right hip even if the horses cant hear the shots they sense whats going on jamie said hed better not hurt them cavanaugh heard them whinnying in alarm then he realized that hurting the horses was exactly the right tactic for the shooter to use wound but not kill make the horses scream in pain make cavanaughs rage get the better of him force him to do something foolish no he strained to channel his adrenaline to make his body do what was necessary to shut out every thought and emotion that didnt contribute to survival come on william cavanaugh passed the long table and reached the staircase im going to try to get a shot from an upper window he told angelo who was braced next to the front screen door staring toward the pine trees to the south we know the shooters got friends william saw them on the monitor angelo said why dont they make a move what are they waiting for cavanaugh paused on the stairway from above he heard faint thumps a muffled crackle as if somebody were crumpling newspapers william run back to the office and get the fire extinguisher but what if he keeps shooting into that room he wont then get the extinguisher from the kitchen but how do you know he wont shoot into the office cavanaugh heard several more thumps above him the crackle became louder smoke appeared at the head of the stairs because hes shooting through the upstairs windows now cavanaugh charged up get the extinguishers the bedrooms are on fire sweating he heard the horses galloping out of control past the front of the house they snorted in terror he raced to the top of the stairs and saw smoke drifting from the four bedrooms along the eastern side of the house a frenzied sound on the staircase came from william charging onto the landing with two fire extinguishers the attorneys perfect shoes suit teeth and hair looked absurd amid the chaos well each take a bedroom cavanaugh set down his rifle and grabbed one of the extinguishers to the right debris burst from a wall at the end of the corridor a tracer bullet had come through a bedrooms window hit the inside wall which was of ordinary construction unlike the log exterior and rammed through into the corridor bringing wood and plaster with it striking a farther wall another bullet burst through a closer wall jesus well be hit william said get down cavanaugh warned as they sprawled on the floor a bullet slammed through the wall above them plaster and splinters spraying them somethings burning me william said cavanaugh saw an ember on the back of williams neck another in his hair smoke starting to dance he flicked them off as a bullet hit the bedroom to their left sending debris through the wall into the corridor hes moving his aim back and forth along the side of the building cavanaugh said whack another bullet erupted through the wall above them the smoke thickened the moment a bullet burst through a wall to the right cavanaugh scrambled to his feet hurry before his shots come back in this direction as william took the bedroom on the left cavanaugh ducked into the one in front of him choking from the smoke he pushed the trigger on the extinguisher with a hiss the retardants haze surrounded the fire he saw the flames weaken and kept squeezing the extinguishers trigger he heard a bullet wallop into the farthest bedroom on the right continuing to spray the retardant he heard the next bullet hit the bedroom immediately to the right he released the trigger shouted to the bedroom on the left william get down and dove to the floor a tracer cracked through the air above his head william im down im down came the reply as an incendiary hit the bedroom on the left cavanaugh tensed waiting for more bullets to march back and forth along the building but what had been a steady sequence faltered one second became two then three the pause lengthening four five maybe hes out of ammunition william said or else he hopes well get careless cavanaugh sprayed retardant against the wall then coughed so hard that he needed to get away from the smoke he staggered into the corridor where he was stunned to see william his hair mussed his face smudged his suit rumpled spraying retardant into the bedroom on the left what are you staring at william wanted to know dont you realize attorneys feel at home in hell cavanaugh started to grin but the impulse faded as he glanced up toward the ceiling and noticed smoke seeping from it no whats wrong william aimed his fire extinguisher the attics on fire he raced to a trap door in the ceiling reached for a short rope dangling from it and pulled as stairs unfolded he lurched back from flames that blocked the entrance to the attic coughing he and william sprayed retardant for a moment through a gap in the haze he saw the flames retreating yelling he started up the steps aiming the extinguisher the flames kept retreating he climbed higher straining to ignore the heat as he spewed retardant abruptly the extinguisher quit hissing with a curse he threw the empty tank at the flames and turned to william give me yours its empty no cavanaughs smokeseared throat felt as if it would burst the flames regrouped roaring they advanced now the situation was reversedwilliam was tugging at him pushed by the growing heat from the attic cavanaugh took an angry step downward we cant stay william tugged him harder cavanaugh reached the landing and stared desperately at the fires in the bedrooms amid the din of the flames william said something about other fire extinguishers we dont have enough youre going to need this need this you set it down through raw eyes cavanaugh blinked at the rifle william handed him yes he vowed im going to need this in the pines to the south a man wearing a baseball cap gazed through shielded binoculars toward the smoke and flames spreading from the lodges upper windows cooking nicely alpha he said into a microphone on his shirt collar wont be long now beta is your team in place the spotters voice asked on every side they know theyre to stay within cover affirmative no need to advance when the targetll do us the favor of leaving his cover in the confusion it might be hard to distinguish him from the people with him though dont even try do them all repeat alpha all kill them all the spotters voice commanded across the meadow on the eastern part of the roof the parched wooden shingles of the lodge exploded into flames cavanaughs face was streaked with soot and sweat as he and william hurried down the staircase angelo remained by the front door peering out no sign of them cavanaugh pulled his walkietalkie from his belt jamie mrs patterson the staticky voices quickly responded that they didnt see anyone what about the security monitors theyre not working now mrs pattersons voice reported what angelo flicked a light switch on the wall nothing happened the electricity had been cut the fires spreading too quickly cavanaugh said well soon need to leave but theyll pick us off william objected the basement can we hide down there no the fire would suck out the oxygen wed suffocate or the building would collapse and crush us the helicopter too far cavanaugh said hey im doing my best william complained if you dont like my ideas come up with one of your own at the back of the hall jamie heard parts of what they said her voice came from the walkietalkie the cars closer its armored there william said what do you think of that idea smoke came down the staircase the fire crackling on the upper level if we stay here much longer cavanaugh decided well need to soak our hair and clothes and breathe through wet towels mrs patterson heard in the kitchen from the walkietalkie she said without electricity the pump for the well wont work we cant get water from the taps william moaned mrs pattersons sixtyyearold voice continued unsteadily from the walkietalkie the toilet tanks the only place therell be water is in the toilets where are they william asked one off the kitchen cavanaugh explained another next to my office angelo ill watch the front go with him bring me a vest from the munitions closet when you come back braced behind the log wall next to the front door cavanaugh saw the taurus parked in front of the lodge the passenger side was toward him it was only twenty feet away if he kept low angelo returned with a soaked towel wrapped around his neck water dripped onto his clothes heres the vest i assumed you wanted body armor not kevlar cavanaugh understood kevlar fibers were designed to block pistol bullets but were useless against highpowered rifles only the metal plates of true body armor could stop the latter he took the vest from angelo and hefted it in despair so much weight while youre standing here thinking youre cooking angelo said what turning cavanaugh discovered that hed been too preoccupied to realize that the fire was starting down the stairs flames licked the ceiling the heat became overwhelming no time jamie he said into the walkietalkie mrs patterson get to the front were leaving william take my rifle i dont want it he had a wet towel around his neck his oncebeautifully tailored suit a drenched mess for gods sake do what i tell you i need my hands free cavanaugh strapped on the bulky vest theres a round in the chamber all you need to do is point and pull the trigger just dont shoot any of us he yanked his car keys from his pocket and pressed a button on the remote control unlocking the doors when he pressed another button the engine started he took a deep breath so hot it warned him that he couldnt wait any longer a flaming chunk of wood crashed onto the stairs go he told himself burdened by the heavy vest he banged the screen door open leapt off the porch and kept running the moment he landed he focused all his attention on the passenger door something snapped past him as he pulled the latch the moment he yanked the door open a bullet whacked it the doors armor preventing the projectile from going through another bullet struck his vest pounding an area between his shoulder blades knocking him forward gasping he didnt allow himself to think of anything except lunging into the vehicle and sprawling across the seat as bullets struck the open door fragments spun toward his eyes averting his face he rammed the gearshift into reverse and stomped the accelerator the vest squeezed him his back hurt tires ripping up earth he sped backward until he was away from the lodge with sharp rapping sounds bullets hit the front rear and drivers side of the car they cracked against the reinforced windows on those three sides straining to ignore them he shifted into forward swung the steering wheel toward the lodge and sped so close to the porch that he almost hit the front steps he stopped on an angle so that the rear of the car was closer to the porch than the front was providing cover just as the open front passenger door did awkward in the vest straining to catch his breath he leaned into the back seat fumbled for the latch and thrust the porchside rear passenger door open come on he yelled when he saw the flames looming inside he realized that he didnt need to shout encouragement the door burst open jamie and mrs patterson rushing out while angelo shoved william the soaked towels draped over their heads were steaming the group pounded across the porch jamie shoving mrs patterson into the front passenger seat angelo thrusting william into the back scrambling in after him screaming my arm mierda next to mrs patterson in the front jamie slammed the front door shut angelo did the same with the back how bad are you hit cavanaugh shouted to angelo speeding away from the lodge he needed to raise his voicethe bullets striking the car sounded like hail grazed me i can still use the arm hijo de puta the bleeding jamie yanked open the glove compartment grabbed a roll of duct tape and threw it back to angelo the gunfighters friend angelo gave william his rifle then unclipped a folding knife from a pants pocket thumbed it open and cut off the sleeve on his left arm cavanaugh got a glimpse of him wrapping duct tape around the wound as the taurus rushed across the meadow bullets pelting the vehicle seat belts he warned fumbling to secure his the bulletresistant windows developed stars while the reinforced glass could withstand widely spaced bullets it could be shattered if several struck the same spot cavanaugh flinched as more stars developed in them then he worried about something else tensing his hands on the steering wheel he felt his right front tire shudder from a bullets impact a tire with a bullet hole could support a car for perhaps five miles before the tire completely deflated but repeated bullet impacts were another matter these tires are reinforced though cavanaugh fought to assure himself its fine its okay itll still do its work the gunmen in the trees didnt have soundsuppressed rifles to cavanaughs left the horses galloped insanely the din of the shots overwhelming somebodyll hear and call the police william said the nearest neighbors are a couple of miles away they hear us shooting all the time cavanaugh pressed the accelerator throwing up dust its a private canyon the ridges muffle the shots nobody pays attention but theyll see the smoke and call the authorities william said itll take time before the smoke rises above the canyon then itll take more time before emergency crews arrive couldnt you lie to me just once the horses reached the trees to the left and veered in panic dont you dare hurt them cavanaugh silently warned the gunmen in the trees out of control the horses galloped toward the taurus now more bullets starring the windshield cavanaugh aimed toward a gap in the trees the lane that would take him to the road the horses threatened to cut in front of him making him afraid hed hit them blood spraying a horse flipped its momentum twisting it over and over in a fury cavanaugh veered around it then urged the taurus into the gap between the trees now the gunmen at the eastern and western sides of the canyon couldnt see the car only the shooters in the woods to the south could be a threat the left front tire felt mushy the same as the one on the right but the lane was only a quarter mile long well soon reach the road cavanaugh hoped rounding a thickly treed curve he pressed the button that would open the gate only to realize that the button was uselessthe electricity wires had been cut his thoughts were shattered by the sight of a van parked sideways blocking the lane the trees were dense on each side giving him no room to veer around it hed be forced to ram it striking the van where it had the least weightat the fender behind the rear axle the mass of the tauruss armor would give it enough force to shift the van and allow the taurus to squeeze past but the moment cavanaugh flicked a switch to deactivate the tauruss air bags he noticed how low the van was something in it was enormously heavy ill never be able to force it aside as a man stepped from behind the van and fired toward the tauruss windshield beads of glass flew inside the car cavanaugh stomped the brake pedal and skidded to a stop his passengers jerking forward despite their seat belts he yanked the gearshift into reverse and sped swiftly backward along the lane a bullet whacked through the front windshield everybody down cavanaugh sped backward around the curve he reached an area where the lane widened took his foot off the accelerator and simultaneously twisted the steering wheel a quarter turn the taurus spun a hundred and eighty degrees grazed a tree trunk and now faced ahead immediately cavanaugh shoved the gearshift into forward and pressed the accelerator the rear wheels threw dirt toward the pursuing gunman who fired at the tauruss rear tires the dust ruining his aim but cavanaugh knew that it wouldnt be long before the rear tires had bullet punctures also already the deflating front tires made his steering hard to control the stress from the degree turn had worsened their damage as he sped from the trees and into the meadow he felt the front wheels settle onto the plastic ring that hed attached to the center of each rim a tire within a tire without the cushion of the normal front tires the taurus jounced and slammed over holes in the lane were all going to die william exclaimed wrong cavanaugh stared ahead through the shattered windshield and saw that the entire lodge was aflame the dense smoke didnt rise instead a breeze kept it low carrying it in cavanaughs direction and as he approached it he shouted to william hand me the rifle i gave you reaching back taking it he told jamie switch places with mrs patterson get ready to drive he steered to the left of the burning lodge and sped into the smoke which was so thick that he couldnt see ahead of him jamie crawled over mrs patterson squeezing next to him angelo check your watch cavanaugh yelled tell jamie when its ninety seconds from now what do you want me to do jamie asked drive forward until angelo tells you its time then drive back this way until you reach the smoke why what are you going to when you come back stop just before you get to the smoke ill step out of it on your side be careful you dont shoot me cavanaugh floored the brakes the solid inner tires digging violently into the ground as the car stopped he took a deep breath shoved the door open and lunged out into the smoke hearing the door bang shut behind him and the car speed forward he ran to the left in the direction that the breeze took the smoke despite holding his breath he had a desperate urge to cough the smoke stinging his eyes his nostrils and throat felt irritated the air lightened the smoke getting thinner he saw an opening sunlight revealed the stream where it wound through the canyon he rolled down its bank feeling the impact of his armored vest against his ribs at the smokefree bottom of the streambed he took a deep breath feeling cool sweet air fill his lungs rising to a crouch he hurried along the stream until the smoke was behind him then he crept up to the rim peering carefully across the meadow he scanned the pines and aspens the smoke behind him prevented the silhouette of his head from showing as he aimed toward the trees he remembered the condition yellow operators hed seen at the gas station where hed stopped on the way home why im not in the game any longer why am i suddenly a target this much he did know if this was the same group there were ten of them hed taken a count while he stood at the pump plus there was the sniper on the eastern ridge and no doubt a spotter for the sniper twelve behind him the burning lodge roared and crackled inside it something heavy collapsed rumbling like an explosion twelve he repeated to himself well lets see if we can lower the odds hearing the taurus speed toward the northern part of the canyon cavanaugh estimated that the car would have emerged from the smoke by now the men in the woods on this side of the valley would chase it with the taurus gaining distance from them theyll choose the easy route and run through the grass next to the trees and here they come he thought as he squinted to the south toward the gunman whod been in the lane the man raced into view sprinting next to the trees pursuing the taurus cavanaugh sighted along the ar squeezed the trigger and blew a hole in the mans throat the man fell as if someone had yanked a rope attached to his ankles switching aim cavanaugh scanned the trees saw a gunman racing along it and blew part of his head off a third gunman racing farther along sensed that something wasnt right and paused to look back even at a distance the fear on the mans face was evident as he saw his downed teammates and charged for the cover of the trees but not in time cavanaughs bullet shattered the back of his head the man became a rag doll whose lifeless legs folded his momentum pitching him forward farther along a fourth man definitely realized something was wrong as cavanaugh switched aim the man darted into the trees cavanaugh fired toward his retreating figure seeing him lurch into a pine bough blood spraying the green needles the mans arms flying up as if in surrender his hair seeming to part as a second shot caused more blood to spray and suddenly he was falling cavanaugh switched his aim yet again but no targets presented themselves they realize whats happening he thought theyve taken cover now theyll he rolled to the bottom of the stream a moment before bullets tore up dirt above him four i got four of them out of twelve he heard the sound of the tauruss engine change as jamie turned the car and started back retreating farther along the stream he took a deep breath before he reached the smoke then he climbed up letting the smoke envelope him keeping his eyes closed he approached the sound of the returning taurus his nostrils and throat felt burned the drone of the taurus became louder he stumbled faster come on jamie then he heard the car stop ahead of him opening his eyes which immediately began to weep he stooped and emerged from the smoke coughing he saw the car only partially visible through the bulletstarred side window jamies strained face reacted with relief when he opened the rear door and climbed in only to realize that the window across from him had a hole in it the smell of blood permeated the cars interior angelo was slumped forward unmoving william was covered with gore he stared straight ahead catatonic two windows are shattered jamie said pressed low in the front seat the others cant take much more desperate cavanaugh strained to decide what to do to the south the lane through the trees was blocked to the west most of the shooters were dead but that still left shooters to the east and north plus the sniper on the eastern ridge back up get a little farther from the smoke he told jamie immediately the car was in motion cavanaugh pulled william down as bullets hit the nolonger protective window chunks of glass flying with a clear view of the burning lodge cavanaugh told jamie stop she did were getting out she didnt hesitate cavanaugh dragged william from the back seat jamie and mrs patterson joined him scurrying down into the streambed i shot four of them on this side cavanaugh told jamie pointing to the west i think theres only one more shooter over there if we can get into the woods we can take him then were home free the expression home struck him with bitter force as he thought about the burning lodge but well be shot if we show ourselves and try to run to the woods jamie said unless we have a distraction behind him another car window burst apart glass flying too many bullets having struck it what kind of distraction give me a gun william said his catatonia broken what give me a gun bastards sons of bitches give me a gun ill shoot them until their whore mothers wont recognize them hold that thought william glad to have you back with us cavanaugh squirmed to the top of the bank and risked showing himself to what he assumed was now only one gunman on the western side of the canyon but he didnt face the west instead he peered toward the burning lodge he studied a shed behind the building a large white propane tank was next to it but a nonincendiary bullet wouldnt detonate it jamie what cover your ears make sure william and mrs patterson cover theirs he sighted his rifle toward the burning lodge toward the fiery back porch toward a barbecue grill on the porch the grill had a small white propane tank when he shot a hole in it the flames caused the gas in the tank to explode the porch heaving its roof flying burning chunks arced toward the shed immediately cavanaugh swung his aim toward the huge white tank behind the lodge shot a hole into it and tumbled down the slope pressing his hands to his ears but nothing happened i didnt time it right all i did was blow a hole in the tank now the gas is escaping but if the fire doesnt reach it the ground shook even with his hands over his ears the roar of the explosion stunned him a shockwave jolted him knocking him even closer to the ground as the canyon walls captured the roar and thrust it back in a massive echo cavanaugh yelled now run to the trees he grabbed william and thrust him up the side of the streambed jamie and mrs patterson ran next to him chunks of smoking metal and burning wood thudding around them faster cavanaugh yelled ignoring something hot that fell on his left arm any moment he expected a bullet to knock him flat but more chunks of metal and burning wood kept falling and he kept charging and at once yet another explosion shook the canyon its shockwave so powerful that it threw cavanaugh and william onto their chests jamie cavanaughs ears rang mrs patterson were okay what was that i think it was the helicopter cavanaugh tugged william to his feet and pushed him urging him to run cavanaughs body armor made him feel suffocated another hot object struck him this time on his neck but all he cared about was the forest looming before him as he and william burst through undergrowth into the trees he yanked william down with him and waited tensely for jamie and mrs patterson to crash through bushes and dive behind trees landing next to him only then did bullets from the opposite side of the canyon wallop into the woods too late cavanaugh thought in triumph the shots faltered ending they know the explosions can probably be heard all the way to jackson cavanaugh said the smokes above the canyon now police and emergency crews will be coming the shooters need to get out of here he let thirty seconds elapse and decided it was safe to peer between trees what he saw made him inhale sharply the exploding propane tank had indeed caused the helicopter to explode the combined force had flattened the lodge burning timbers were everywhere igniting the grass you prick the spotter yelled you swore you could do this how was i to know the target would with a look of contempt the spotter drew a handgun and shot his companion four times in the face then he took out his knife and cut off the snipers fingertips thats what i know he said the act wasnt impulsive it wasnt motivated by anger the truth was hed been ready to kill the man whether the attack was successful or not the sniper had exemplary professional habits before an assignment firstrate preparation but afterward he drank and talked too much his usefulness had come to an end in fact the execution was the only thing about this assignment that felt good abort he shouted into his walkietalkie abort abort abort part two the gospel according to fairbairn those last four shots are too lowpitched to be from a rifle jamie said puzzled cavanaugh nodded sounds like they came from the ridge where the sniper was but were too far away for anybody to expect to hit us with a pistol from there it doesnt make sense jamie studied their surroundings we need better cover right for all we know theres still at least one shooter on this side of the canyon keep down he told william and mrs patterson move back deeper into the woods they found a depression circled by trees and squirmed into it mrs patterson face this way jamie said watching the elderly woman take her small ladysmith revolver from her apron aim toward the trees william you face this way cavanaugh unholstered his pistol and gave it to the attorney keep it pointed away from us dont pull the trigger unless i tell you cavanaugh and jamie sank low every quadrant occupied when i get out of this emotion made williams voice thick im going to take shooting lessons karate lessons every damned lesson i can find i wont feel helpless like this again ill be glad to teach you cavanaugh said trying to distract william from his fear especially about fairbairn fairbairn whos he but heres your first lesson stop talking we need to be quiet so we can listen if someones sneaking up on us oh williams face turned red with embarrassment yes they waited and watched the forest cavanaughs need to protect helped distract him from his rage he wanted to get his hands on whoever had ordered the attack to slam that persons head against a rock until bone cracked and no fantasies about revenge were a liability anger got in the way of clear thinking concentrate on keeping everybody alive a minute passed cavanaughs ears continued to ring because of the explosions and the shots hed fired he worked to filter out that sound to listen beyond it trying to detect any noise in the forest ten minutes fifteen sweat oozed from under his body armor his back hurt from the force of the bullet that the armor had stopped as he aimed toward the trees his heart thumped against the ground there a branch snapped deep in the trees cavanaugh steadied his rifle in that direction another branch snapped and now cavanaughs finger slid onto the trigger he relaxed as an elk poked its head from the underbrush its antlers blending with the dead branches of a tree behind it maybe this is going to be all right he thought the elk wouldnt be wandering in this direction if somebody with a rifle is out there creeping toward us then another elk appeared and cavanaugh became more hopeful at once the animals bolted their hind legs kicking as they crashed through the forest somebody is out there cavanaugh again touched the trigger but then he realized what had spooked the elk not somebody creeping among the trees a noise far away but getting louder a highpitched cluster of sirens the police and the emergency crews were finally coming cavanaugh studied the forest one more time and murmured to the group i think were going to make it whatever pressure you put on me i can take william said what i went to harvard law school nothings more brutal than that im holding you to your promise to teach me and while youre at it who the hell is fairbairn when this is over ill tell you taking refuge in his protectors role cavanaugh distracted william from present fears by projecting him into the future they stayed within the forest moving southward along the edge of the smoldering meadow you think the sniper might still be on that ridge william kept glancing in that direction he might have risked staying in case we get careless when help arrives its better if we dont step into the open when the sirens stopped cavanaugh turned toward the silence through a gap in the trees he saw scattered burning timbers all that remained of the lodge to subdue another burst of fury he focused on movement within the smoke relieved to see that five of his horses had survived they gathered nervously near the one that had been killed sickened he shifted his gaze toward the countless bullet holes in his car its windows starred some of them shattered thinking of angelos body inside it he felt his fury intensify immediately the horses bolted as a highway patrol car dark chassis white roof flashers on emerged from the lane even at a distance cavanaugh detected the shock on the face of the uniformed driver when he saw the damage then a forestservice fire truck emerged and its occupants looked stunned also they managed to move the van that was blocking the lane cavanaugh thought a further idea struck him or maybe some of the gunmen drove it away with jamie watching the trees behind them he led william and mrs patterson around the southern curve of the forest and only then stepped into the lane the trees still shielding them from a sniper at almost the same time a highway patrol car came around a curve the driver slamming on his breaks at the sight of them set down your weapons jamie warned william and mrs patterson as she and cavanaugh put down their own let him see your hands are empty cavanaugh emphasized the state trooper a captain had his fingers on his holstered pistol as he got out of the car but then he gave cavanaugh a closer look aaron cavanaugh had used his legal name when hed bought his property if an enemy who knew him only as cavanaugh had hoped to track him down by searching through land records the effort would have been useless nice to see you garth the trooper looked surprised my god with all that soot and dirt on you i didnt recognize you we had a little trouble so i hear on the radio the first officer to get here told me your place looks like a war zone garth had a solid build from weight lifting he was tall with strong cheekbones and a dark mustache he spent so much time outdoors that his face had the grain of weathered wood his tan emphasized by the green of his uniform and troopers hat like any expert police officer his eyes were constantly alert even off duty when he cavanaugh and jamie sometimes ate dinner together in jackson those eyes were very alert now jamie is that blood on your shoulder yes but it isnt mine cavanaugh thought angrily of the blood spatters inside the taurus after angelo was shot lillian garth frowned at mrs patterson youre wavering come over to the car and sit down with an unsteady hand she pushed gray hair from her face dirt streaked her apron thanks garth its been a long afternoon youll find four dead men in the western edge of the meadow cavanaugh said dead how shot who pulled the trigger at this point cavanaugh would normally have requested a lawyer to make sure that he didnt say something that became misinterpreted but he had one of the best attorneys in the country standing next to him i did cavanaugh said youll find a fifth body in my car or whats left of my car one of the other guys pulled that trigger mrs pattersons late husband ben had been a wyoming state trooper who died in a shootout with a gang trying to hijack a truck filled with pharmaceuticals known as lillian to every officer assigned to teton county she was interviewed first then escorted back to the waiting room at the highwaypatrol barracks ten miles south of jackson i phoned your soninlaw to let him know you can leave now garth said hell soon be here to drive you to your daughters place your familys eager to see you ill wait with you in the front hallway jamie told her william was the next person taken to the interview room twenty minutes later he came back the satisfied look on his face indicating that while he might not know anything about guns he knew how to conduct himself with law officers now that he was in lawyer mode again his torn filthy suit somehow looked dignified jamie went next cavanaugh had taught her to answer police questions directly but never to provide more than what was asked and never to attempt to deceive then it was cavanaughs turn the room had harsh lights plain walls two chairs and a small desk focusing on minutiae helped keep his emotions in check want some coffee garth pointed toward a carafe and some styrofoam cups on the desk a tape recorder was there also i could use the caffeine cavanaugh said pouring a cup his watch showed that it was half past ten but now that his adrenaline had dissipated he felt as if it were four in the morning ready garth asked when you are the stench of smoke radiated from cavanaughs jeans and shirt his neck and arm hurt his back felt bruised where the bullet had struck his armor but at least his legs and chest felt lighter relieved of the heavy vest garth pressed buttons on the recorder this is captain garth braddock the interview is with aaron stoddard he gave the place time and date tell me what happened while waiting cavanaugh had taken the opportunity to get his narrative in order only after concluding his description did he allow his emotions to show i havent the faintest fucking idea whats going on we found your sniper cavanaugh leaned forward is he answering questions its a hard to get answers from a corpse somebody shot him four times in the face cavanaugh took a moment to adjust to that finally saying that explains the four pistol shots we heard fragmentationtype ammunition mutilated his features enough that even people who knew him would have trouble identifying him his teeth were so damaged that comparing them to dental records will be useless the question is who did that to him cavanaugh thought about it the only available candidate is someone on the assault team but that doesnt make sense did he have id no did you send his fingerprints to the fbi couldnt the tips of his fingers were cut off cavanaugh took a longer time to adjust to that the four men you killed garth said was forced to kill their fingerprints got a really quick response those men were fresh out of prison within the past six weeks six weeks i cant imagine how they came to be together they served time in four different penitentiaries pennsylvania alabama colorado oregon garth slid a sheet of paper across the table recognize any of these names cavanaugh studied them hoping but finally had to say no he grasped at a thought four different prisons they must have known each other before they went to those prisons not according to their criminal records theres no indication they ever crossed paths before but they did have one thing in common armed robbery gang shootings rape these were really violent guys before everything started i think i saw them and the rest of their friends at the moose junction gas station cavanaugh said they didnt handle themselves like street criminals they werent wired and jittery and unfocused these guys had stillness and control they looked like operators but their records indicate they were street criminals so how all of a sudden did they get to be operators you called them unusual word i dont often hear it that car of yours when i got a close look at what was left of it i found bulletresistant windows armor plating tires within tires tell me again what you used to do for a living i was in the security business the bodyguards i see around here cavanaugh hated the word are usually hired by entertainers and sports stars on vacation mostly for show in a quiet community like this to remind us how important they are but you never fit the profile of the thugs some of those celebrities use for bodyguards im an unassuming guy obviously you dont like being called a bodyguard no answer are you holding back anything i need to know cavanaugh hesitated yes i was whats called a protector i worked for an international security firm called global protective services i used the professional alias of cavanaugh professional alias i saved the lives of people who show up on cnn and the front pages of the washington post and wall street journal these are the kind of people who need the reassurance of knowing they can absolutely trust me with sensitive information that nobodyll come around later and persuade me to answer questions about them you mean like the police asking questions my former clients will stonewall you its been tried and theyll never trust me again again i got the impression youd retired my retirement just ended is that another way of saying you intend to run your own investigation if a former client decided that he or she cant let me live with certain information i have ways to find out youre not a law enforcement officer keep that in mind i will im serious i wouldnt want to see you in front of two grand juries cavanaugh garth tested the sound of the name the idea was to keep my private life and my professional life separate looks like it didnt work a state trooper came over when garth escorted cavanaugh from the interview room did you find any of them garth asked the trooper looked at garth as if to suggest that they speak in private its okay you can talk in front of him in the background jamie and william listened to the troopers reply no sign of the shooters they were dressed as campers cavanaugh said which makes them fairly invisible around here garth pointed out even so how do you suppose they got out of the area near your property so fast when you drove me from the ranch i noticed that the van that had blocked the lane was gone did any of your team move it the trooper shook his head no some of the shooters probably drove it away the tires were low from weight in the back but even so they could have driven it as for the rest im guessing a couple of cars picked them up as they emerged from the trees using twoway radios they could have easily coordinated it so they didnt show themselves if there were police cars or emergency vehicles in sight plus you didnt know what you were dealing with and didnt start searching until thirty minutes after the explosion plenty of time to get away they could have been in jackson by then another trooper entered the room a lot of reporters and a tv crew in the parking lot swell garth said we cant assume theyre all legitimate cavanaugh warned that hit team isnt going to fade away theyll watch the building theyll try to follow us when we leave spend the night here theres nothing id rather do but in the morning well still have the same problem not to mention theyll be organized by then no the best time to leave is when they least expect it as soon as possible how and where will you go what will you use for transportation i already made the arrangements jamie said in the harshly illuminated parking lot dozens of reporters straightened as the barracks door opened the lights from within silhouetted garth who stepped from the building and walked toward them the weather had shifted cold enough to bring frost from his mouth garth had no idea how the media had gotten word of the attack so quickly if one of his officers was responsible he swore to find out who it was and give him the worst duties imaginable since jackson didnt have a tv station or a large newspaper most of the men and women converging on him must have come from idaho falls a driveable miles away or from casper laramie and cheyenne much farther awayto get here this soon the reporters would have needed to charter planes then it occurred to garth that the person who alerted the media might have been somebody on the hit team get as many reporters and tv cameras here as possible in the ensuing chaos the gunmen could blend any of the supposed news people shouting questions at him could be a killer is it true that six men were shot ranch thirty miles north of explosion destroyed sniper helicopter okay all right garth gestured for quiet if all of you talk at once i cant hear your questions the television lights glared at him hurting his eyes i have a brief statement at fourthirty this afternoon suddenly the front door to the barracks banged open as garth turned he saw a trooper hurrying toward him a concerned look on his face whats the matter garth asked cameras flashed as the trooper motioned garth away from the reporters and spoke in urgent hushed tones garth spun toward the reporters thisll have to wait theres been a captain a trooper yelled from the front door a siren wailed in the fencedoff parking area behind the barracks roof lights flashing a highway patrol car rounded the building and skirted the reporters an officer was silhouetted in the front seat as the car reached the main road and sped north toward jackson disappearing around a curve in this sparsely populated section of the valley moments later a second patrol car followed lights flashing siren wailing some of the reporters raced for their cars or possibly they arent reporters garth thought others stayed demanding to know what was going on tell us what happened this afternoon are these incidents connected headlights blazing a state police van hurried past reached the road and followed the three civilian cars that chased the cruisers opening and closing his knife the man whod shot the sniper watched from a road on a bluff across from the police barracks he was forty years old tall and lean with an etched face his powerful forearms resulted from years of pounding a hammer onto an anvil forging blades he used various names currently his devotion to knives had prompted him to choose the alias of bowie sitting in his car he used a nightvision magnifier that wasnt affected by the stark contrasts of light and darkness in the parking lot a quarter mile from him while he listened to the sirens he studied the sequence of vehicles speeding away the first cruiser the second cruiser the three civilian cars then the police van damned smart bowie thought he spoke into a twoway radio its a shell game the targets in one of the police vehicles the question is which a voice from one of the pursuing civilian cars said i vote for the van or maybe the targets still in the barracks bowie replied maybe those police vehicles are decoys we dont have enough personnel to follow everybody wait the voice blurted ahead of us one of the police cars is pulling to the side of the road for gods sake dont stop bowie ordered but we need to act like real reporters real reporters would stop thats what they want you to do youd be caught between the cruiser that stopped and the van behind you meanwhile the first cruiser would get away that must be where the targets hiding okay the voice said five seconds later i didnt stop in my rearview mirror i see the other carsthe reporters who left with ustheyre stopping shit the cruiser ahead of us its stopping drive past it its turning sideways its blocking the road cavanaugh crouched out of sight in the police cars back seat feeling the state trooper expertly skid the cruiser sideways to block the road cavanaugh braced himself and reminded the driver leave room for them to drive around there was always the chance that actual reporters were in the pursuing car on a hunch the reporters might have decided to ignore the patrol car that stopped and to follow the one in the lead if so with the road blocked the driver of the pursuing car would now stop and demand to know what was going on but members of the assault team would want to get away hurrying from the cruiser cavanaugh and the policeman took cover behind the engine the only place in an unarmored vehicle that would stop a bullet the pursuing car took advantage of the space the patrolman had left and veered toward the shoulder passing the cruisers back fender throwing up dust as it sped farther down the road cavanaugh aimed a powerful flashlight centering the beam on the license plate got it he shouted the numbers and letters to the trooper who repeated them into a radio microphone attached to his collar the second cruiser arrived and jamie hurried from her hiding place in the back seat meanwhile cavanaughs driver chased the escaping car his siren wailing a moment later the van arrived william got out it worked jamie told cavanaugh not just yet as the other cruiser joined the chase cavanaugh walked along the road in the direction from which hed come the trooper whod driven the van followed him accompanied by jamie and william cavanaugh turned left toward a dark lane that led into a gravel pit he aimed the flashlight and saw a shadowy pickup truck parked between mounds of earth in case thered been a gunfight the occupants would have been out of the line of fire even so theyd obeyed instructions and taken cover behind the trucks engine mrs patterson kyle as cavanaugh shone the light keeping it away from eye level he saw two people rise from behind the truck more excitement mrs patterson said i dont know how my husband ever put up with it but something in her voice suggested that some aspects of the excitement were enjoyable that she now understood why her husband had liked being a police officer the man next to herstout bearded with wooly hairwas mrs pattersons soninlaw one of the best horse trainers in the valley good directions jamie thanks when kyle had picked up mrs patterson at the barracks jamie had explained what needed to be done you wont be safe with your family shed told mrs patterson the people who attacked us know you matter to us they might try to grab you and use you against us plus your family wont be safe if somebody on the assault team follows you to them jamie told you i need a favor cavanaugh asked kyle the loan of my truck sure anything to keep lillian safe count on it cavanaugh said this officer will make sure no ones following his police van when he drives you home kyle gave cavanaugh the keys to the truck where are you taking lillian cant tell you in case a couple of guys with guns come around and ask you anybody who triesll be dodging slugs from a deer rifle no matter what i wouldnt tell kyle emphasized cavanaugh thought but what if they put a gun to your daughters face in the distance the pursuing sirens echoed the cops must have radioed ahead the voice blurted from the twoway radio sirens shrieked in the background were in jackson theyve got two police cars parked sideways blocking the street the other police cars are still chasing us saddened the man who called himself bowie shook his head he had spent the past month with the team he spoke to he had shared meals with them slept in the same room and gotten to know all the pathetic painful outrages that had been done to them throughout their lives social conservatives would argue that those outrages were nothing more than excuses these men used to justify their outrageous acts there was truth to that viewpoint bowie thought no matter how damaged people were they needed to accept responsibility for their actions they needed to exert control over themselves without discipline chaos reigned he had learned that lesson with great difficulty im going to do a oneeighty the voice yelled leaning closer to the radio receiver bowie heard tires squealing theyre blocking us that way too the voice yelled yes chaos needs to be eliminated bowie thought melancholy he reached for a transmitter next to him he pressed its on button and saw a red light appear when he pressed another button a green light appeared in the distance a sound like thunder rumbled through the night speeding toward the car the state trooper stared beyond it toward the flashing lights of the jackson police cars that blocked a main street through the small town almost got them he thought one thing theyre not is reporters suddenly the quarry ahead executed a degree turn with equal abruptness the trooper pressed his brake pedal enough to give him traction but not lock the brakes he swerved so that his patrol car blocked the left side of the almost deserted street the cruiser following him performed an equivalent maneuver blocking the right side of the street he scrambled outside drew his glock and took a position behind the engine area aiming toward the vehicle that sped toward him his fellow officer did the same if the car tried to ram them they would flee toward the protection of the storefronts on each side if the car stopped and its occupants decided to try shooting their way to freedom the troopers would teach them the error of their ways the car sped closer veering to the right hoping to slip between the cruiser and the sidewalk it exploded the shockwave hurling the trooper backward slamming him onto the street the flash seared his vision the ringing in his head was agony as his mind spun he felt pressure in his chest air being sucked from his lungs wet why does my face feel wet he pawed his cheeks blood my god im bleeding chunks of metal crashed around him something soft and wet fell on him beyond the ringing in his ears he heard the other trooper screaming then he realized he was the one who was screaming as the pickup truck worked its way up a slope cavanaugh heard the blast from the direction of town using only parking lights so that the truck would be difficult to follow jamie drove mrs patterson and william sitting next to her with no more space in the cabin cavanaugh sat in the trucks uncovered back he felt the explosion as much as he heard it in the murky distance a fireball illuminated the night showing him that the explosion came from the direction of town the trucks back window slid open my god what caused that jamie asked through the opening cavanaugh was reminded of what garth had said when hed arrived at the ruin of cavanaughs homelooks like a war zone this is beginning to feel like bosnia did he sensed jamie thinking as the truck jounced along a deep rut you never told me you were there its not something anybody who was there wants to remember one thing you could count onjust when things got quiet somebodyd start shooting again or blow something up the lane got bumpier sending vibrations that jostled cavanaugh in the back of the truck from the direction of town he heard sirens a lot of them through another break in the trees he saw that the flames silhouetted the hills close to town how much farther william asked uneasy five minutes the faraway sirens persisted whos fairbairn william prompted nervously cavanaugh studied the slope theyd been climbing he didnt see any headlights following them fairbairn invented the basis for some of those lessons you swore you were going to take in the back of the truck he turned to look inside the faint dashboard lights revealed that the attorneys face was stark with fear maybe its time for a bedtime story cavanaugh thought fairbairn was a police officer in shanghai he said through the open rear window in the early nineteen hundreds when shanghai was the most dangerous city in the world william raised his head and looked at him with interest youre sure you want to hear about this cavanaugh asked for gods sake would i ask if i didnt if he doesnt i do mrs patterson said one night while fairbairn was patrolling a particularly rough district someone attacked him he woke up in a hospital and vowed hed never be caught offguard again so when he saw an advertisement for somebody named professor okada master of jujutsu and bonesettingi love the bonesetting parthe decided to take lessons eventually he became an expert in several oriental martial arts and adapted those systems into a few simple deadly movements that anyone could learn in a couple of hours hours william asked shanghais violence gave fairbairn plenty of chances to test his methods he created the first swat team he also invented the shooting house a series of rooms with various obstacles and popup targets of bad guys aiming weapons sometimes the popups show a woman carrying an infant or a bad guy holding a hostage the point is as you proceed through a maze anticipating a threat around every corner you cant start shooting every time theres movement instant decisions need to be made control has to be maintained anybody whos ever gone through a shooting house fairbairn called it a mystery house the british sas calls it a killing house knows how tense and draining the experience can be in the darkness the truck leveled off in what seemed to be a meadow and william asked in nineteen thirtynine at the start of the second world war fairbairn went back to england and joined the war office there he taught what he called gutterfighting to the british commandos after that he went to america and taught the oss which eventually became the cia he and his colleague eric sykes invented the fairbairnsykes dagger that the british commandos used his students went on to teach other students those students spread the gospel according to fairbairn until his closequartercombat tactics became pretty much universal in any unit that truly knows what its doing not only are fairbairns tactics easy to learn but they stick with you in the nineteen nineties the cia tested his theories on some behindthelines world war two agents those eightyyearolds hadnt forgotten any of what fairbairn taught them the system was so simple and logical it came back to them automatically and proved that you didnt need to be young and strong to protect yourself the truck stopped we made it jamie said see cavanaugh told william that five minutes didnt take long wary he climbed down from the truck assessing the murky outline of a cabin jamie heres the key garth gave me while the rest of you get settled inside ill check the perimeter wait william insisted youre just going to stop what about the specifics of fairbairns system theres work to be done william garth stepped from his cruiser into a nightmare ahead on east broadway one of jacksons few main streets lingering flames as well as the headlights and flashing lights of emergency vehicles showed the wreckage of five cars the vehicle in the middle had been ripped apart by an explosion fiery debris had struck and ignited the four police cars eventually setting off the fuel in their gas tanks now the cars were just smoking metal frames paramedics put unconscious state troopers onto gurneys wheeling them toward two ambulances the air smelled of cooked flesh dear god garth thought watching the ambulances speed away movement caught his attention jacksons chief of police finished an urgent conversation with a fireman and walked toward him jackson had about allyear residents with an additional skiseason residents and three million tourists who passed through during the summer the huge influx of visitors meant that the areas law enforcement emergency and medical systems needed to be firstrate but even so they werent accustomed to gunfights and explosions let alone two in less than twelve hours you radioed ahead to warn us about the pursuit the police chief said i sure hope you know whats going on sickened garth scanned the shattered store windows on each side of the street pendletons jackson mercantile chicos haagendazs ice cream the wooden sidewalks were smoldering so were some of the cottonwoods in the town square one of the four elkantler arches that served as entrances to the squares small park had been blown into pieces thousands of chunks of graywhite antlers covered the street like dirty snow this is connected to the attack on aaron stoddards place and what was that about no ones sure garth outlined the facts that were available then asked what did they have in that car a bomb what set it off bullets the police chief pointed toward a crowd at the far end of the square shocked residents and tourists wearing hastily puton clothes some only in housecoats a guy walking his dog saw the whole thing he said there were a lot of sirens and squealing tires but no shots definitely no shots several people who live nearby and were wakened by the sirens say they didnt hear shots either so what set off the explosive whoever was in that car were they so determined not to be questioned that they blew themselves up i dont see how they could have the police chief said what do you mean they couldnt have reached the explosive to detonate it the blast split the chassis upward from the middle from underneath underneath garth asked in confusion well need crimescene investigators to confirm it but at the moment it looks as if the bomb was mounted under the car they didnt know it was there seems that way if it was their explosive theyd have kept the bomb in the trunk or in the back seat where they could get to it in a hurry but this way garth understood yes the only reason to put the bomb under the car was to hide it from the people inside the man who called himself bowie drove west over the rugged teton pass leaving wyoming dark mountains hulked on each side his destination was a motel in idaho falls two hours away hed rented a room there two days previously hed made his preparations and left yesterday before dawn arriving in jackson hole with plenty of time to accompany the sniper on his hike to the ranch at midday the motels maid would have cleaned his room and made the bed there was no way for her to be aware that for much of tonight the bed would not have been slept in tomorrow after he got a few hours sleep she would again make the bed nothing unusual about his patterns by then hed have checked out gone to the idaho falls airport and flown his plane to his next destination as he drove through the darkness his tortured thoughts tugged him back to a longago summer when he and aaron had played in the shadows of the trees in the park at the bottom of their street someone had built a new subdivision a few blocks away to make the location more attractive the owner had put in a lake stocking it with goldfish what the owner didnt count on was the effect of heavy rains the lake overflowed fish and water spilling into the stream that wound through the park aaron and bowie had sat by that stream spellbound by the magic of the sixinchlong fish their speckled gold shimmering beneath the water we could go home and get buckets aaron had suggested trap a couple of fish in each bucket and then what try to convince our parents to buy us each a fish tank i dont think my father would go for that hed probably knock me on the floor for suggesting it i dont think my stepfather would go for it either aaron said but hey we could still get the buckets what well do is catch the fish and carry them back to the lake itll take all day bowie said although his name had been different back then besides it wouldnt make a difference the next rain all these fish will flood back into the stream he removed his knife from his pocket and opened it i know what to do aaron stared uneasily at the sunlight glinting off the blade bowie saw a dead branch on the ground and cut off its twigs he was about to sharpen its tip and suggest that they use the fish for target practice but the look on aarons face told him to make a different suggestion lets get some string and safety pins well fish well pretend our helicopter crashed in the jungle cool a doubt clouded aarons eyes but if we catch any i dont want to eat them theyre not very big and im not sure goldfish taste good who said anything about eating them well put them back in the lake after we catch them but they never did catch any fish no matter how hard they tried throughout that muggy summer most of which they spent in the shade of those dense trees pretending they were the last two members of a special forces team trapped behind enemy lines they became so skilled at hiding from the enemy that kids bicycling past or men and women strolling handinhand along the path didnt see them crouching among the bushes as things turned out it didnt rain again for a long time the stream evaporated until there were only four inches of water most of the fish suffocated by then he and aaron had gotten tired of fishing and instead lay among the bushes reading bowies knife magazines sometimes when bowies father got even drunker than usual bragging about what a hotshit football player hed been and how bowie had damned sure better be as good bowie went down to the park on his own he speared a couple of the surviving fish his knife was so sharp that it made him feel as if he cut through butter when he sliced their bellies open after all what did it matter the fish would have died anyhow by the time i concluded that you and aaron stoddard were the same person id learned a lot about your alterego william said in the cabin aaron stoddard is part of jackson holes searchandrescue team he volunteers to coach basketball at a local school he teaches childrens groups about wilderness camping a hell of a swell guy cavanaugh said knowing that hed been investigated made him feel vulnerable if william could find him others could in fact they had the cabina hunting retreat that garth leased from the governmenthad a livingcooking area a bedroom a handpumped well and an outdoor toilet after scouting the perimeter cavanaugh had waited in the woods listening satisfying himself that the night was quiet meanwhile jamie had closed and locked the interior shutters when he entered he saw her put a lamp in a corner where it wouldnt help a gunman who peered through cracks in the shutters and tried to use its feeble light to guide his aim mrs patterson tireless wonderful mrs patterson used the cabins coleman stove to heat cans of soup that she found in a cupboard youre going to get your wish cavanaugh told jamie after a long silence she looked confused by the apparently outofnowhere reference im accepting what duncan gave me in his will im assuming control of global protective services the stove hissed william and mrs patterson watched him i think the only way to catch whoevers responsible is to offer myself as bait he continued and thats an awfully good reason to own global protective services itll give me access to the best operators in the business the stove kept hissing all my life i tried to protect people cavanaugh said even when i was in delta force i thought of it as protecting against terrorists against all the cowards and sadists who think they can kill anybody in the name of god or because they believe theyre god but this is something new for me this is the first time ive needed protecting venice the suite in the hotela converted twelfthcentury doge palacehad a dramatic view of st marks piazza crowds persisted despite a chill spray from rising waves glass making the internet tycoon said glass making the head of his protective detail frowned nobody comes to venice without taking the boat across the lagoon to murano the tycoons wife said for certain i dont muranos the most famous glassmaking town in the world its pieces are museum quality the protective agent nodded give me twentyfour hours to set up the security in twentyfour hours well be in madrid the tycoons wife told him madrid that isnt on the schedule we decided during breakfast this citys too damp the agent a former member of britains strategic air service nodded again yes all those canals one hundred and fifty of them to be exact four hundred bridges one hundred and seventeen islands every nook and cranny of them a security nightmare so thats the plan the tycoons wife dropped her napkin onto a halfeaten bowl of fruit in ten minutes we leave for murano there wasnt much to be said after that the agent whose name was miller had five men at his disposal three of whom were resting after the night shift because the change in schedule was last minute a predator couldnt know about it so there wasnt any point in sending a man to scout the location miller took some consolation that he didnt need to be overly concerned about a longdistance threat from a sniper with a business executive the likely threat was kidnappers wanting a ransom the bumpy twentyminute lagoon crossing made the tycoon and his wife slightly nauseous as millers eyes roamed the choppy water on guard against any boats that might speed toward them he studied the island of san michele venices main cemetery several boats were docked there draped with funeral cloths and wreaths hed read somewhere that with land so scarce in the venice area soil had to be brought to the cemetery so that it could continue accepting coffins he switched his gaze toward murano the heart of which had two rows of renaissance buildings separated by a canal yellow and brown the long stone structures adjoined one another almost all of them glassmaking factories my god if we need to go into every one of these buildings miller thought well be here all day but the tycoon and his wife had made phone calls and knew precisely where they were heading miller instructed one of his men to stay behind and guard the launch to make sure it wasnt tampered with then miller and his remaining agent flanked their clients never looking at them always peering outward at potential threats the tycoon and his wife ignored the tourists crossed the street next to the canal and entered a building where two welldressed owners waited for them miller didnt like the shadowy corridor he facedor the roar at the end of it he entered a large area that consisted of several blazing furnaces their hatches open men wearing fireretardant aprons and gloves held metal poles into the flames turning them softening the large pieces of glass suspended from their tips at a precisely judged moment one of the workers removed the pole and applied various tools to the molten glass cutting twisting and shaping it sometimes blowing through a tube to expand it into a globe keeping his attention on the corridor through which theyd entered miller heard a conversation behind him the two owners using english to explain to the client and his wife how timeintensive a handcrafted piece of glass was how it could take all day to make one perfect vase and certainly much longer to fashion a glass peacock its fannedout tail as multicolored as that of an actual bird the most ambitious pieces the most complexly contoured and layered required centuries of glassmaking experience the techniques were handed down from generation to generation miller straightened as a man and woman came along the corridor in their midthirties pleasant looking they wore shorts and sandals the mans shirt was tucked in so was the womans blouse no outline of a gun or a knife no fanny packs nothing to cause concern the man had a camera around his neck he nodded to miller a little puzzled that miller wasnt watching the activity around the ovens miller nodded in return behind him the two owners were telling the tycoon and his wife that the almost finished vases they saw on a table required one more procedure and then would be ready for exhibition twenty of them how much will their total value be the tycoon asked the answer was a very long number in lira more tourists entered miller scanned them nothing threatening how much in dollars the tycoon asked miller heard fingers tapping a calculator four hundred thousand the tycoon said i assume they can be safely packaged and sent by air of course signore one of the executives said presumably to a tourist whod entered photographs are not permitted the man answered in french that he didnt understand the executive switched to french and repeated that photographs were not allowed the room became more crowded no dont touch that the other executive said in italian glass shattered the startle reflex cannot be eliminated its hardwired into the human nervous system knees bend shoulders hunch forward hands rise to the chest palms outward these movements provide an instinctive defense against an attack his reaction unwilled and automatic miller swung his gaze from the corridor toward the scene behind him where the two executives and millers clients gaped at an almost finished vase that the man with the camera had knocked over chunks of colored glass lay at their feet im so sorry so sorry the man kept saying in french miller suddenly felt lightheaded his leg was wet he peered down gasping when he discovered that his right pant leg was cascading crimson that he was standing in a pool of swiftly spreading blood femoral artery was all he could think somebody cut my a knife slash with a sharp blade almost never caused pain unless delivered with force as the skin parted there was only a stinging sensation spinning miller saw the woman whod followed the group into the factory shorts sandals she walked along the murky corridor toward the bright sunlight that formed the exit looking once over her shoulder abruptly millers vision turned gray groping to find something to keep him from falling he stumbled toward his clients wife who jerked away in horror somebody screamed but miller barely heard the roar of the furnaces became muted their blazes dimmed despite the heat radiating from them he felt cold reaching falling he struck the table upended it and sent the remainder of the vases crashing onto the floor with his head sideways on the concrete floor he stared at colored chunks of nowworthless glass shimmering around him their luster faded as did his vision the last he saw were the chunks being covered by his blood sunlight glinting off its bulletresistant windows the helicopter landed in the meadow in front of the cabin the wind from its rotor blades bending the grass but when will i be able to come back and see my family the noise from the choppers engines forced mrs patterson to strain her voice when were sure youre out of danger jamie explained which is the same as saying when aarons out of danger mrs patterson nodded toward cavanaugh jamie had gotten so used to his assumed name that she felt a sense of unreality when people referred to him as aaron its for your familys protection as much as yours jamie told her believe me youll be wellcared for new york yes manhattan mrs patterson thought a moment is radio city music hall there jamie almost smiled ten blocks from where youll be staying weve got some nicelooking young men wholl be pleased to escort you behind her cavanaugh told garth william phoned judge canfield and got permission for us to leave the state until the grand jury convenes he certainly has the power to get things done in a hurry garth didnt sound happy that influence achieved results were checking every hotel and motel in the area were especially interested in the cabins at moose junction where you saw the assault team were also checking the airlines and the local rental car agencies the car that blew up youre sure the bomb was under it the crime scene investigators confirmed that what the hell is going on but even as cavanaugh asked the question the answer was obvious whoever hired those men was afraid of what they might say if they were captured and interrogated ditto the sniper in the helicopter the pilot motioned for everybody to get aboard thanks for your help garth im just glad you got out of this alive except for angelo cavanaugh thought anger burning inside him ill find who did this the chopper lifted off gaining altitude to clear the bluffs its destination was eastward but as it flew from the teton valley cavanaugh did something hed promised himself that he wouldnthe asked the pilot to fly north first he wanted to see his ranch above his canyon he surveyed the scattered wreckage of his home the charred timbers the craters where the propane tank and the helicopter had exploded the flattened lodge the burned meadow he and jamie looked at one another yes ill find who did this he thought albuquerque new mexico the newly constructed jail was on the outskirts of the city the states hottest time was from the middle of june to the middle of september but this had been a drought year the heat lingering into the fall even now in the middle of october at midmorning the temperature was although bowies car windows were open the absence of a breeze made the interior feel hotter than the air outside his brow beading with sweat his wet shirt sticking to the back of the seat but he had trained himself to ignore inconvenient sensations and focused all his attention on the glass doors at the front of the jail fifteen minutes later a lanky hispanic stepped out his hair was cut so short that his scalp showed he wore sneakers jeans and a white tshirt whose short sleeves revealed tattooed gang symbols on his arms bowie knew that the man whose name was raoul ramirez was twentythree raoul had been a member of an eastside gang called the blades the name of which bowie approved although he wondered if raoul had the awareness to know that blade didnt mean only knife raouls blade had certainly gotten him into trouble he spent five years in prison for forcibly restraining a woman in a motel room and raping her in addition his police record listed arrests for assault theft shooting at an occupied building and torching a car that belonged to a member of another gang except for the rape every arrest had resulted in probation because of overcrowding in the states prison system raoul had been allowed to serve his final months in the relative ease of the spacious new jail now the sneer on his face and the sociopathic dullness in his eyes became more pronounced as a lowriding car stopped at the curb raoul got in gang handshakes were exchanged the car pulled away maintaining a careful distance bowie followed to the modest singlestory home of raouls parents where relatives and friends parked and hurried in music and the smell of barbecued chicken drifted along the street bowie took for granted that one of the ways raoul would celebrate was with alcohol around two in the afternoon when the booze had its effect and the urge to have fun took control raoul left his parents home got in the lowrider with his friends and drove down the street the car stopped next to bowie who assumed that neighbors had phoned raouls parents about the man watching the house a window slid down pounding music boomed out raoul glowered id like to talk to you bowie said i did my time why dont you chingado cops leave me alone im not a police officer i was innocent the bitch lied ive got a business proposition for you raoul lapsed into a string of hatefilled spanish bowie surprised raoul by answering in spanish im serious ive got a business proposition for you raoul spat on bowies car the window went up the car moved on bowie followed raoul and his friends reached an allsups gas station where they bought two twelvepacks of tecote beer they drove over to interstate and headed west bowie continued to follow as they left the crowded highway and turned north onto a deserted narrow road bowie noted the mountains in the distance and the cacti around him the paved road became gravel and except for the two vehicles was now totally deserted as it rose toward a low hill from a quarter mile back staying clear of the dust their car raised bowie had an occasional glimpse of them drinking beer and knew that in their quest for fun theyd decided that he would provide it their car went over the hill following cresting the hill descending bowie saw what he expected the car blocking the road an embankment shielding it from anybody watching from a distance raoul and his three friends were propped against the lowrider drinking beer watching him stop as he got out the sun weighed on him but he ignored it focusing his reflexes leaning sideways when raoul threw his empty can at him thats what i think of your shitface business proposition raoul said the can clattered over stones but bowie wasnt distracted the jeans that raoul wore from the jail had been replaced by baggy bigpocketed pants that hung low on his hips like the pants his friends wore the pants arent hanging down to their butt cracks just for style bowie thought its because of weight they have weapons you cops shouldnt be harassing me raoul seemed proud that he knew the word its against the law his friends thought that was hilarious i told you im not a police officer bowie assured him so this isnt entrapment another big word raoul was proud of i wont be charged for stomping a cop or cutting you a kid next to raoul said drawing a knife or maybe i should just give you a red hole in your head raoul pulled a semiautomatic pistol from his pants it was small a you wouldnt enjoy doing that bowie said no you ever hear of carrie fisher who the actress debbie reynolds is her mother what the she played princess leia in the first three star wars movies man i might as well shoot you to keep you from talking me to death she also writes novels and screenplays her best line is the trouble with instant gratification is it takes too long raoul looked as if bowie was speaking martian you wont shoot me bowie said because its too quick it wouldnt be as much fun as prolonging the foreplay by cutting or stomping me foreplay for a moment raoul looked confused as if the concept wasnt familiar to him yeah you got that right can i have him raoul one of the kids asked let me take a piece of him raoul thought about it perhaps hes beginning to suspect bowie thought if so thats encouraging im not wasting my time all of usll take him raoul decided they pushed away from the car and spread out one of the kids finished his beer and threw the can so did the others bowie had no trouble avoiding the cans whatll it be raoul a kid asked stomp or cut the kid with the knife grinned want to make a bet bowie asked that your arms and legs are gonna be busted thats a sure thing as they came closer bowie folded his left arm across his chest and raised his right palm to the side of his face in an absolutely nonthreatening pose well well look at how chilled this guy is a kid said he wont be after we stomp him im serious you want to make a bet bowie asked they came even closer bowie kept his left arm across his chest his right palm on his face for what the money in my wallet were gonna have it anyhow raoul said holding the gun but dont you want to know what the bet is they were almost to him so whats the stupid damned bet raoul wanted to know that you can stand twenty feet away from me holding your gun at your side yeah and i can get to you before you shoot me raoul snickered yeah right believe me raoul snickered again and turned to his friends at that point bowie could have taken them and whatll i tell the cops when i put a bullet in your guts raoul asked selfdefense youve been smokin too much crack one of the kids said a gun against fists aint selfdefense well maybe if i had something that the police would agree was a threat like what raoul asked oh i dont know a knife maybe this is loco the kid with the knife sneered he wants me to give him my wait shut up while i understand this raoul told him i stand thirty feet away i said twenty thirty thats the length of a goodsized room bowie pretended to object and you stand over here with a knife yes and you bet i cant shoot you before you get to me bowie nodded and if you do shoot me its selfdefense because ive got a knife you can tell the cops how i followed you stalked you im telling you this guy is loco the kid with the knife said how about it raoul youve been away five years didnt you lie awake dreaming of action and now here youve got it and its perfectly legal your first day out raoul studied him as the sun became more intense bowie waited forty feet raoul said youre taking advantage the bet i offered was forty feet raoul said he turned to his friends right forty feet sure raoul thats what he said okay if you want to be tough about this bowie said looking amused raoul took forty steps backward generous steps the kid with the knife said i aint givin him this then ill need to use mine bowie still had his left arm folded across his chest his right palm to his chin with his left hand at his right armpit he reached into the short sleeve of his loose shirt and brought out a fiveinch folding knife that he had secured under his arm with velcro on a hypoallergenic strap wound around his chest his handcrafted knife was different from the one with the polished ebony handle that he liked to play with this knife was for business its action was butterslick as he thumbed the button at the back of the blade flipping it open anodized black forged from c steel it was sharp enough to slip between the fibers of a kevlar vest its handle was made from a grooved laminated almost indestructible plastic called micarta the grooves were important because they allowed bowie to keep a tight grip even if his fingers were slippery with blood where the hell did that come from a kid exclaimed raoul raised his pistol take it easy bowie said i just need this for the bet if you kill me it needs to look as if youre defending yourself if theres no if about it raouls eyelids lowered the bet was fifty feet right he took another ten steps back aw come on bowie complained you want this to be fair dont you fifty feet is fair but you need to keep the gun at your side you cant raise it until the bet starts bowie said sure across the vast distance raoul smirked at my side he lowered the gun bowie lowered his knife and braced himself without seeming to whos going to do the counting counting nobody said anything about screaming at the top of his voice bowie charged im going to rip your guts out cocksucker he shouted cocksucker cocksucker reaching full speed almost immediately he hurtled across the distance his motion so violent his face so contorted with fury that raoul flinched instead of raising the gun aiming and pulling the trigger he lurched backward offbalance to begin with he became more offbalance when his knees bent with a will of their own his arms jerked protectively up toward his chest the instinctive motion caused the gun to point upward instead of toward the target who rushed at him screaming killyoukillyoukillyou the scenario was a worstcase nightmare for anyone who earned a living with a gun lawenforcement officers specialoperations personnel protective agentsany professional knew that someone with a knife could scream and race across those fifty feet and kill you before you overcame your surprise and defended yourself the only defense was to avoid the scenario and shoot that sob dead the moment you saw the knife then if you were in law enforcement you had to justify your actions to a review board and maybe a grand jury almost certainly the relatives of the dead piece of shit would complain tearfully it wasnt fair a gun against a knife the cop had the advantage he didnt need to shoot and youd think i damned well did need to shoot and if i needed to do it again id nail that sucker just as dead as he is now because in the popular imagination the person with the knife stops running gets set and then jabs with the knife wasting a valuable second or two in which time the person with the gun overcomes the startle reflex and starts blasting but in reality the person with the knife doesnt stop but keeps rushing using all that raging momentum to slam into the person with the gun and send him or her flying backward crashing against a wall or onto the ground and then the assailant drops onto the victim and goes to work with the knife that was close to what happened now raoul gaped knees bent arms thrust uselessly upward as bowie seemed to cross the nolongervast distance in hardly any time at all using his shoulder he rammed into raoul with such power that raouls lungs emptied his feet left the ground his body arched backward his head made a sickening crunching sound when he landed at that moment bowie could have used a curving downward motion to slice raouls throat instead he yanked the gun from raouls hand and spun toward his gaping pals ready with the knife and the pistol want to make a bet bowie asked jesus man dont shoot me the kid with the knife begged farthest thing from my mind bowie put the gun under his belt raoul are you watching this i want to make sure you see it uh raoul murmured what damn it are you watching this uh yeah uh bowie folded his knife and clipped it onto a pants pocket you bowie told the kid with the knife i asked you if you want to make a bet bet that the three of you cant take me the three kids kept gaping bowie again assumed his absolutely nonthreatening position folding his left arm across his chest raising his right palm and pressing it against the side of his face come on for gods sake do something the kid with the knife took his chance as he lunged with the knife bowie whipped his right hand down and deflected the knife at the same time he turned his left hand so that his palm was outward and slapped the kid as hard as he could the blow so powerful and covering so large a portion of the kids face that his eyes rolled up in the same motion bowie spun so that the edge of one of his thicksoled shoes caught the side of the second kids leg hitting a nerve that temporarily disabled the leg and sent the kid screaming onto the dirt meanwhile the kid with the knife sagged to his knees bowie thrust his right palm upward under the kids chin holding back just enough force that he didnt break the kids neck when he struck he kicked the third kid in the testicles and when that kid pitched his head reflexively forward bowie jabbed a palm to his exposed chin also both dropped unconscious that left the one whose leg was paralyzed the pain so intense that he could barely make himself fumble for something in a pants pocket as the kid pulled out a shitty shortbarreled revolver bowie kicked him in the chin taking care that he only broke the jaw and didnt kill him raoul lay on the ground struggling to catch his breath blinking in disbelief and what did you think of that bowie asked uh howd you like a job uh howd you like to learn to do that be an operator win friends and cause a world of pain job what kind of working for me bowie pulled a money clip from his pocket the steel clip handcrafted by him had a knife so skillfully concealed along the side that he never had trouble taking it through security checkpoints two thousand dollars as a signup fee two thousand you get room and board free clothing and equipment two thousand the signup fee then you get three thousand a month you never got that much robbing liquor stores what do i need to do prove you can learn and then yes do what youre told a slap william asked as if cavanaugh were joking cavanaugh felt subtle pressure in his stomach as the gulfstream g soared away from the airport in casper wyoming jackson holes airport could have handled the jet but there was too great a chance that the attack team would watch that airport better to use the helicopter to fly miles east to casper where the gulfstream had been instructed to land and wait for them global protective services was stenciled across the side club chairs a conference table livingroomstyle sitting for up to ten passengers a spacious galley a sophisticated entertainment system a transcontinental fuel range quiet engines one hundred percent filtered air plenty of natural light you think a slap sounds like a sissy kind of thing cavanaugh asked well certainly william said jamie came from the bathroom where shed put on a white blouse blue blazer and gray slacks clothes that william had instructed the pilots to bring turquoise earrings brought out the deep green in her eyes shed undone her ponytail her brunette hair hanging to her shoulders its actually very serious she told william fairbairn wanted his closequarters combat techniques to be simple cavanaugh said easily taught easily remembered when condensed to essentials there are only a few moves but just as important fairbairns system ensures that the person making those moves doesnt get injured in the process mrs patterson stopped admiring the gulfstreams appointments and listened a punch for example jamie made a fist and pretended to hit the wall im going to hurt that person no question about it but im probably also going to hurt my hand at the least my fist will swell and throb and become useless if i try to keep punching at the worst ill break bones incapacitating me with pain and shock i dont care how tough you areyou cant will yourself not to experience shock cavanaugh added so fairbairn asked himself what are the parts of the body that can administer force with little risk of injury since were talking about slaps i assume one of them is the palm of a hand william said yes but when we say a slap were not talking about anything dainty cavanaugh told him were talking about a slap thats as hard and fast as you can make it the full force of your body your palm covers a lot of area almost the entire side of someones face if you dont knock the opponent out youll daze him enough so that when you slap the opposite side of his face hell go down what are the other parts of the body that fairbairn decided were the best to use william asked the feet if you wear thicksoled shoes you can stomp down hard and break somebodys toes fairbairn recommended a variation in which you stomp the side of your shoe all the way down your opponents shin before you hit the toes ouch william said the knee jamie said to the groin william asked definitely mrs patterson kept listening the elbows cavanaugh said you can break ribs with them but not hurt yourself you can chop the edge of your hand against someones throat and not hurt yourself jamie said william winced imagining the damage to the other person mrs patterson leaned forward and you can shove the palm of your hand up under someones chin gouging their eyes with your fingers while you thrust back your opponents head and william looked more uncomfortable why didnt my husband teach me any of this mrs patterson demanded he never taught me about the guns he kept around the house either he was a good husband but he always treated me as if i was weak nows your chance to make up for lost time jamie motioned for cavanaugh to stand fairbairn recommended combinations she crossed her left arm over her chest and raised her right palm to the side of her face im defenseless she asked william and mrs patterson pretty much william said while mrs patterson nodded thats what you want the opponent to think the idea is to make him feel overly confident and then to engage his startle reflex when you do something he isnt expecting cavanaugh pretended to strike at her stomach her right hand swept down to knock the blow away her left hand whipped palm outward in a pretended slap across cavanaughs face she mimicked a kick to his groin and when he bent forward in pretended pain she delivered a slowmotion palm thrust to his chin fingers near his eyes pushing his chin back the slap would have so stunned him that he couldnt defend himself jamie concluded fairbairn wrote a book get tough well find a copy for you which reminds me i have something for both of you william said they watched with interest as william opened a drawer in a storage compartment that resembled a side table he took out a briefcase you told me to arrange to have a bugout bag delivered from gps headquarters and put on the plane but i confess i havent the faintest idea what a bugout bag is its something you need when you bugout cavanaugh said what an emergency kit for when you expect youll be on the run most operators have a bugout bag stashed somewhere cavanaugh opened the case and revealed knives nine millimeter ammunition an extra magazine an easytoconceal sig sauer pistol lock picks a miniature flashlight an ample supply of twentydollar bills fake id small rolls of duct tape and assorted seemingly nontactical items such as safety pins and zip ties the thin supple plastic strips that were used to bundle wires or close garbage bags what are they for william asked pinning things and tying things william gave him an unamused look right and i suppose the duct tape is for sealing leaky pipes or veins some day youll need to teach me about that william turned to jamie this is for you he handed her a black plastic case the size of a laptop computer sigarms was stenciled on it how thoughtful jamie said everybody wants to give me firearms youll also need this william handed her a holster no cavanaugh said jamie looked at him youre not in danger if youre not with me he said youre suggesting stay with mrs patterson keep away from me the attack team might still try to find where i am and use me to get at you jamie said youll be well guarded see this ring on my finger jamie said im in this as much as you are babe theres no way im going to hide while youre out making yourself a target its the safest thing for you i dont give a damn about whats safe for me if this were reversed if i were the target would you hide of course not but that would be different how because im a woman and youre a man you know i dont think that way its just if we do this together if things go wrong and something happens to you i couldnt bear losing you you think i could bear losing you you wont get a better more motivated protector than me i know and im good at it as you often told me together cavanaughs emotions made it difficult for him to speak yes together part three do you like to play video games raoul oaxaca mexico the movie star surprised dominic by being polite and compliant not at all what he was used to when protecting celebrities her name was shana lane twentyone with a knockemdead figure shed had five hit movies one of them good enough to earn her an oscar nomination but then she disappeared for a long hot summer after police private investigators and the media looked everywhere she finally turned up drugged out of her mind staggering down the main drag of a small town in nova scotia canada where she was on her way she thought to buy a race horse nobody including herself was ever able to figure that out the authorities did some investigative backtracking and found the cottage where she was staying with her boyfriend a possessive boyfriend who was also a crack addict they returned to los angeles after paying fines and listening to a judges lecture about the pointlessness of wasting a talented life but despite shanas determination to clean up her life and sever their relationship the boyfriend persisted in wanting to see her he showed his love and determination by burning her bmw and strangling her cat then vanished and waited until the police became weary of guarding her that was where dominic came in for an enormous fee paid by a movie studio desperate to protect its investment dominic and five other protectors went to shanas film location in mexico working in shifts of two they made sure the boyfriend didnt show up they made sure of something elsethat in keeping with the plot line of a movie about drug smugglers shana didnt get tempted to go back to sampling the real stuff to dominics amazement shana behaved in an exemplary fashion following instructions arriving at the set on time with her lines prepared never once complaining about the twelvehour shooting schedule and the rigid control of her time off the set sundays were her only free days and she used them accompanied by dominic and another protector to buy rugs pottery and carved animals from nearby towns or to visit oaxacas baroque cathedral the vaulted interior of which had dazzling gold ornaments on this his secondlast evening of the assignment dominic and another protector stood separately at the shadowy sides of the hotel victorias patio restaurant watching the various approaches to it as shana and the films director ate dinner together on a lower level cast members splashed in a swimming pool then dusk thickened dominic and his fellow protector escorted shana to her room one of a series in a long low building next to the restaurant pleasantsmelling flowers lined the softly lit walkway while his partner watched the approaches to the building dominic unlocked and entered shanas room making certain that it was safe for her only when they heard shana secure the numerous locks on her door did the two protectors relax after we escort her back to the states do you have another assignment dominic asked his partner no im thinking about coming back here with my wife what are your plans new orleans im scheduled to be part of the security at the world trade organization conference after the devastation from hurricane katrina the wto wants to show support for the new orleans recovery effort by meeting there the last time i worked at a world trade conference the protestors rioted and shut down the city talk about an elevated threat level i was on condition orange for a week then i slept for a week they pulled out their room keys and unlocked the units that flanked shanas from there they could easily get to her if she pressed a button linked to alarms in their rooms when they opened their separate doors they encountered the embodiment of a local proverb you wont find a doctor to cure a bite from this snake as a machete hissed toward each of them slicing off their heads the fourth major airport in the new york city area after kennedy la guardia and newark international was teterboro a socalled reliever airstrip that catered to charter corporate and private jets relieving congestion from the larger airports from there a twelvemile drive via the george washington bridge could have taken cavanaugh to global protective services corporate offices in midtown manhattan but because the attack team might have anticipated that he was headed in that direction and might have put teterboro under surveillance he decided against the risk of using an automobile and instead took a helicopter manhattan had three heliports cavanaugh chose the one farthest from gps headquarters reasoning that it was the least likely to be under surveillance an armored van drove him and the others through sparse midnight traffic to the secure garage under the madison avenue building in which gps had its fortiethfloor offices a team was expecting the vans arrival they escorted cavanaugh and his group into the elevator and through the upper security checkpoints the view from the conference room was spectacular lights gleaming throughout the city but even though the windows had bulletresistant glass cavanaugh pressed a button that closed the draperies the moment he and the group entered the room the draperies so thick that silhouettes couldnt be seen through them he glanced at the plush carpeting and oakpaneled walls every chair at the long conference table had its own computer terminal and phone console one of which he used to summon three gps officers whod been alerted to remain after business hours looks like youre settling into authority nicely william said how do we make it official dont you have documents for me to sign i instructed my assistant to go to my office and bring them william answered he ought to arrive shortly it cant happen soon enough mrs patterson if you want to get some sleep we can find an empty office that has a couch jamie offered thanks but i napped on the plane mrs patterson clearly didnt want to miss anything but cavanaugh couldnt allow it this is where you need to step out of the loop the less you know the better it is for you she looked crestfallen think of it this way jamie said you had an interesting ride while it lasted interesting im having trouble understanding why as frightened as i was it was just about the most exciting time of my life winston churchill once said theres nothing more exciting than to be shot at and to survive the thing is cavanaugh added we dont want to get excited like that too often william when did duncan put me in his will a month before he died why do you ask three people entered the office the first was from east indian parentage born in akron ohio latethirties short thick black hair compact build strong square face steady dark eyes muscular shoulders his name was ali karim and when hed served on a special forces team his specialties were languages medicine and explosives as well as the ability to blend into an asian environment he was currently in charge of recruiting training and monitoring gpss protective agents the second person was chinese female early thirties kim lee raised in seattle her lustrous black hair hung to her waist five feet four slender with thin delicate but attractive features she looked too vulnerable to work for a security corporation but anyone who acted on the foolish assumption that she was defenseless quickly discovered that she was a blackbelt instructor of aikido and jeet kune do she was one of the few employees of gps who had not been in special operations but her expertise didnt require military training duncan had hired her because she was once a notorious computer hacker and virus designer skills highly desirable in a company that defended against electronic assaults as well as physical ones cavanaugh wondered how kim and jamie would get along inasmuch as jamie too was a computer specialist the third person was white gerald brockman early forties a handsome solidly built afrikaner who once belonged to south africas reconnaissance commandos experts in working behind enemy lines in the most hostile outdoor environment one of the units endurance tests involved surviving for five days among the lions elephants and fires of africas bush country with no food except a tin of condensed milk half a days ration pack and twelve biscuits the bulk of which students discovered to their dismay had been soaked in petrol by their instructors in addition to his elite military background brockman had superior administration skills that qualified him to be the interim ceo of the company all three paused special operators were trained to control their emotions even so it was clear that they were surprised cavanaugh brockman stared when william had contacted global protective services hed followed cavanaughs instructions and told brockman only that william would be arriving with the new owner brockman looked at jamie and mrs patterson eliminated them from the possibilities and said youre the new ceo but kim turned her attention to the attorney william for the past five months youve been asking me to search our computer records for someone named aaron stoddard i got the impression he was the person duncan willed the company to thats true william replied now that i have my clients permission i can finally tell youaaron stoddard inherited gps im aaron stoddard cavanaugh said the room became silent i had a theory that a protector would be vulnerable if the bad guys learned about his private life he explained pressure could be put on his family and friends in order to put pressure on him so i decided to use a pseudonym but how could the bad guys get that information ali asked between kim and me those records are absolutely secure wrong cavanaugh told him yesterday a hit team attacked my home what my home for gods sake the deeds in aaron stoddards name the people where i live know me only as aaron stoddard anger forced cavanaugh to work to control his breathing but somehow the hit team found me the only way that could have happened is through gpss search for somebody with that name what about williams office ali suggested williams the one who started the search i assure you i informed no one other than the three of you that it was essential to find a man named aaron stoddard william turned toward cavanaugh for reasons of confidentiality i couldnt mention the terms of duncans will but they quickly made the connection what the hell are you implying brockman demanded that we sent the hit team to keep you from inheriting the company to give us a chance to gain control of it until now the thought hadnt even occurred to me cavanaugh lied this is bullshit alis perfect american idiom contrasted with his east indian features as if we dont have enough problems now weve got a guy who told us he doesnt want to be in the business any longer who decides he does want to be in the business and comes back to tell us were all working for the other side time out cavanaugh said it really is bullshit ali insisted honestly time out did duncan keep any whiskey around here youve become a drinker kim asked in astonishment no cavanaugh said but maybe if we hit each other over the head with the bottle long enough well start talking sense duncan trusted the three of you absolutely i trust you absolutely but that doesnt change the security breach we need to find and it doesnt change the problem ive got somebodys hunting me somebody with a lot of money and resources just because the first attempt failed doesnt mean the threats over ive got to believe therell be another attack bigger and better organized brockman ran a hand across his shaved head ali exhaled slowly sorry kim said i guess were all reacting to stress after a knock on the door a security guard brought in a package mr faradays assistant delivered this cavanaugh gave the bulging legalsized envelope to william who spread the contents onto the conference table where do i put my autograph cavanaugh asked arent you going to read it first as your lawyer i strongly advise you to study what youre signing is there anything in it you dont approve of its elegantly simple you accept the bequest you assume control of the company with all its assets and i emphasize its liabilities yesterday you told me duncan made some questionable business decisions he expanded the company too quickly london paris rome hong kong the new office planned for tokyo granted after nineeleven firstrate security has never been in greater demand but right now gps has more money going out than coming in theres a risk of bankruptcy bankruptcy ali frowned at brockman nobody told me anything about cavanaugh signed the document we need a witness william looked at jamie but it cant be your wife wife kim looked stunned hell ill do it mrs patterson said happy to have continued to be part of the group she signed where william indicated so the companys mine now cavanaugh asked william down to the paper clips and the water coolers then lets get started gerald cancel the tokyo office merge the paris office with the one in rome ali mrs patterson needs to be protected around the clock put her in a safe site and assign some handsome young men to watch her jamie said william needs a safe site too cavanaugh added the hit team can use both of them to get at me kim do a computer search on every assignment i ever had theres a chance the attack on me was meant to keep me quiet about something i learned i want the best protectors to escort jamie and me send for rob miller dominic benuto hans dietrich and the somber looks he received made him stop he suddenly processed two incongruous statements that ali and kim had made ali had said as if we dont have enough problems kim had said i guess were all reacting to stress whats wrong he asked kim drew a breath except for eddie theyre all dead within the past twentyfour hours at first cavanaugh was certain he hadnt heard correctly miller was in venice protecting a corporate executive and his wife ali explained dominic was in oaxaca escorting a movie star the others were on equally unrelated assignments all of them were killed with sharpedged weapons cavanaugh leaned forward pressing his hands on the table all the blades were covered with a rapidacting poison kim added cavanaugh couldnt speak the clients survived brockman sounded troubled they werent harmed in the least nobody attacked them nobody but that doesnt make sense william objected sure it does cavanaugh said if the clients werent attacked it means the protectors were the targets but why not just use guns because theres something creepily intimate about being stabbed cavanaugh replied a victim often doesnt feel the cuts or have any idea how serious the wound might be theres a video that knife trainers use the tape came from a security camera mounted to the ceiling of a bar in california you see a bunch of anglo tough guys beating up a short latino man they really put the boots to him finally the worst of the attackers has the latino on the bars pool table wailing the hell out of him on the video you see a little movement to the left the latinos hand trying to get out from under the bad guy struggling to reach into his jeans pocket then you see a lot of quick little movements the hands a blur then the bad guy straightens as if he pounded the latino as much as he wanted to he turns and his stomachs wide open but hes in shock and doesnt know hes been cut everybody runs the bad guy looks puzzled by their reaction and walks over to the bar he sits down the latino whos covered with blood gets off the pool table puts his knife in his pocket straightens his clothes and walks out the bad guy sitting at the bar orders a drink hes still in so much shock that he doesnt know how many times hes been cut he sits there a moment longer shakes his head as if hes a little confused about something and falls over dead william looked appalled most security personnel are so worried about a knife threat they make sure they carry at least one knife so they can scare somebody with it if the situation gets that bad several knives are preferable so youve got a better chance of drawing one of them attached to a breakaway chain around the neck cavanaugh opened his shirt displaying a short black knife in a nylon scabbard part of the contents of the gulfstreams bugout bag it was called la griffe a french word for talon which described its shape and here jamie pulled back her blazer showing william a utility knife holstered above her left hip something else from the bugout bag and here cavanaugh unclipped a fiveinch tactical folding knife from the inside of his pants pocket the clip attachment made it easy to find and retrieve the knife on the back of the blade a hook snagged on the pocket the resistance caused the blade to open as the knife was being drawn i had years of training with blades a master knife maker taught me to forge them but i hate the thought of being attacked by one believe me a lot of protectors will feel cold and naked when word gets out theyre being stalked with blades but you werent attacked with a blade jamie told him whats the connection raoul had no idea where he was being taken after he used a pay phone to tell his parents that he was heading north to find a job in denver the stranger drove him to a small airport double eagle west of albuquerque there the stranger returned his rental car no security check was required as they walked toward a small jet a few minutes later they soared into the cobalt sky i use small airports the stranger explained as if raoul understood what the hell he was talking about i stay below eighteen thousand feet that way i dont need to file an instrument flight plan and i dont turn on my transponder which is how radar would otherwise track me raoul had trouble concentrating until now hed never been in a plane vertigo threatened to make him vomit but there was no way hed let the stranger realize he was afraid although his palms were slick with sweat he kept them firmly on his knees he forced himself not to tremble the secret was not to look down he decided he began to wonder if this was some kind of sex thing that the stranger would be like the predators raoul had fought off in prison but the stranger made no moves of that sort in fact after paying raoul the promised two thousand dollars all he wanted to talk about was fighting ever want to join the military the stranger asked hell no the jet engines were muffled through the earphones the stranger had given him dont you think it would be cool to carry a handgun and an assault rifle as part of your job that part but who wants to go through all the bullshit of taking orders one goes with the other the stranger had powerfullooking forearms his sundarkened face was gaunt with a crease down each cheek and an unusual intensity in his hazel eyes nobodys going to give you a gun without telling you how and when to use it i already got a gun that piece of junk thirtytwo even if youd shot me with it i could have reached you grabbed it out of your hand and shoved it down your throat well get you some real guns ever fired an mp a what a submachine gun do you know the difference between a submachine gun and an actual machine gun raoul didnt even know there was a difference a submachine gun fires pistol ammunition nine millimeter a machine gun fires rifle ammunition a point twotwothree cartridge for example the kind that goes in an m wicked the bullet flips end over end when it hits something rips the target to shreds ever fired a submachine gun raoul hesitated afraid hed lose face if he admitted the truth no well make up for that deficiency theres nothing as sweet as firing an mp on full auto thirty rounds zipping through that gun in two seconds raoul you might not have made love to the most beautiful woman you might not have tasted the greatest whiskey you might not have driven the fastest car but im telling you when you put thirty fullauto rounds through an mp you can definitely say youve shot the worlds best submachine gun but to be given the chance to do that and to get the further money i promised you need to follow some orders i mean thats in any job right i realize nobodys gonna give me money and not expect me to do something raoul said but you asked if i ever wanted to join the army theres no way im gonna make bunk beds and bounce quarters off them and shit like they show in the movies movies raoul you like movies sure did you see any movies when you were in prison on tv sounds like a cushy prison try it sometime see how cushy you think it is oh ive been in prison raoul believe me but the kind i was in didnt have tvs what they had was redhot needles under my fingernails and electrodes on my testicles raoul noticed the scars on the strangers fingers when youre not learning about mps and fun stuff like that youre going to have a different kind of fun watching a lot of movies the stranger said quite a job huh to get paid three thousand dollars a month to watch movies what movies action movies i think well start with thief michael mann directed it james caans the star ever seen it raoul had no idea who the hell michael mann and james caan were sounds like an old movie i dont watch old movies i guarantee youll love this one at the end caan goes into a house and blows away a bunch of gangsters using a handgun its one of the first times a gunfight had an accurate look in a movie mann uses terrific technical advisors the way caan holds the pistol his balance his footwork amazing ive got a bunch of other movies like it ronin proof of life spy game the recruit the thing is raoul you need to ignore the plots and concentrate on the individual scenes on what the characters do and the way the actors handle themselves because those movies had terrific technical advisors too and except for a few spots theyre accurate in their tradecraft tradecraft the way operatorsprofessionalsdo things youll catch on to the vocabulary as we go along youll watch black hawk down of course and the tv series the unit which is about delta force and dark blue kurt russell plays a corrupt cop the director ron shelton got a really good technical advisor the gun stuff is accurate and theres a moment when kurt gives a speech and says im a gunfighter i come from a family of gunfighters thats a first i never saw a movie before in which somebody like a police detective who earns his living with a gun calls himself a gunfighter in life of course privately they do call themselves that gunfighter you like the sound of that word raoul sounds like an old western a western good idea raoul ill make sure you look at the wild bunch the sun was behind them the expanse of the landscape changed from mountains to flats from brown to green sunset occurred swiftly soon they flew in darkness raoul controlled his dizziness by staring at the faint glow of the lights on the cockpits dials you impress me the stranger said what are you talking about youre afraid to fly who says im afraid but you dont show it who says im afraid not me raoul continued to stare ahead surprised by how much light was on the ground towns glowed cities glared headlights blazed on freeways there were seldom stretches of pure black he hadnt realized how many people there were and how bright the night could be when they reached one of the few sections of black the stranger aimed the jet toward the heart of it immediately two rows of lights appeared in the gloom as the stranger guided the plane down toward them raouls stomach rose toward his throat he repressed the urge to be sick but by god he wasnt going to show the stranger any of what he felt descending he suddenly had the sense of high trees on each side of the lights then the lights got big and he felt a nudge through the plane as the wheels touched down the stranger steered to the right toward other lights which were in a corrugatedmetal building that had its large doors open at once the lights on the runway went out but not before raoul looked back and saw men scurrying across the runway pulling something over it a net they were covering the runway with a camouflage net the stranger shut off the planes engines in the blessed silence their sound still echoed in raouls ears when the stranger opened the exit hatch humidity enveloped raoul sweat moistened his face and threatened to make his clothes stick to his skin as they stepped from the plane the air weighed on him where the hell was he there was too much else to think about three men waited for the stranger and him to climb down they wore thicksoled camping shoes pants with numerous pockets loose shirts hanging out and baseball caps over what their short sideburns suggested was closely cropped hair one was anglo one was black one was hispanic the latter made raoul feel less isolated it took him a moment before he noticed that although he thought of them as men two seemed younger than his twentythree years but something about the way they carried themselves made clear they were definitely men everythings on schedule the stranger asked yes mr bowie the black man said at last a name for the stranger this is mr ramirez bowie said indicating raoul despite his uneasiness raoul felt proud to have been introduced in that formal manner mister no one had ever called him that before hes smart bowie said no one had ever spoken about raoul in that way either hell be an excellent contribution to our group bowie turned to him wont you mr ramirez yes then an amazing thing happened raoul didnt think about the next thing he said he just did it yes sir see bowie told the three men an excellent contributor get him squared away clothes equipment something to eat show him where hell be bunking mr ramirez as you can tell from these representatives of our group this is not a whitebread operation if you have any problem relating to various races youll need to get over it in a hurry we follow the one true god here and that is discipline sudden gunshots made raoul flinch in an instant he tucked down his head bent his knees and raised his hands to defend himself quick reactions the anglo said the shots came from behind the building he shows promise the hispanic agreed the shots persisted a steady rattle his stomach on fire raoul stared past the plane toward the rear of the building he had no idea how thick its corrugated metal was and the only thing that kept him from diving to the concrete floor was that no one else in the group seemed alarmed its a nighttraining exercise bowie told him youll be involved in them soon enough out there something exploded again no one else reacted and when youre not training bowie said youll learn to sleep despite the noise sleep is the operators friends fatigue is among the legion of his enemies always sleep and eat whenever you get the chance although you wont have much time for rest here do you like video games raoul uh video games the seemingly weird question made raoul frown as he glanced nervously again in the direction of the shots video games sir sir i used to in the joint there werent any well thats different now here when youre not in classes or watching movies you can play video games as much as you want the latest versions soldier of fortune mortal kombat doom the us military licenses that one and encourages its soldiers to play it medal of honor brothers in arms men of valor full spectrum warrior americas army weve got every action video game on the market hone your reflexes have a ball dont you think you should try to sleep jamie asked cavanaugh from the shadowy doorway to the bedroom duncan whod sometimes worked twentyhour days had put his living quarters next to his office that duncans personal and professional life had been so severely joined made cavanaugh wonder how his own life and jamies would change now that hed assumed control of the corporation he sat at duncans desk a thick computer printout spread before him i doubt i could sleep eyes sore with fatigue he ran his finger down the list that kim had prepared his former assignments it depressed him to realize the number and extent of the protective details hed worked on politicians corporate executives movie celebrities sports stars realestate barons on and on thered been hundreds but only a few had seemed special apart from the money power or fame they had the work had been what hed cared about as duncan had insisted unless theyre obvious moral monsters it isnt our place to make judgments about our clients the only thing thats important is theyre somebodys prey and predators are always the enemy that list will look fresher in the morning jamie said but in the meantime what if somebody dies because i didnt do my job i have to believe somewhere in these past assignments theres a clue about why the hit team tried to kill us and why those other agents were killed or maybe the attack was revenge because of an assassination or kidnapping i prevented i dont know where else to look you cant do your job if you cant think straight ive gone without sleep a lot longer than this i hear it makes a person psychotic cavanaugh had to grin you say the sweetest things im serious jamie massaged his shoulders the list will look fresher in the morning cavanaugh thought about it and sighed all these assignments when this is over making me think about the future so i dont worry about the present im projecting myself into the future so i dont worry about the present when this is over cavanaugh set down the pages youre right lets get some sleep he put his arm around her and guided her toward the bedroom the phone rang he paused it rang again he turned dont answer it jamie said he stared at the desk not duncans desk not any longer now its my desk whatever its about can wait until morning jamie told him no cavanaugh decided but when he reached for it the phone stopped ringing couldnt have been that important if the caller hung up jamie said cavanaugh pointed toward a light on the elaborate phone console somebody else answered maybe after a specific number of rings the call gets transferred to another phone he stared at the constant light on the console next to each light was a name in this case the name was brockman if it was a wrong number hed have hung up by now id better go find out whats wrong what makes you think somethings wrong was there ever a call at three in the morning that wasnt about something wrong they entered the corridor cavanaugh had the feeling of being lifted of him and jamie being thrown through the air and striking the corridors wall of dropping to the floor immediately his senses caught up to him the roar behind him from the office no from beyond the office from the bedroom the searing flash the shockwave punching air from his lungs groaning he rolled toward jamie as chunks of plaster and wood fell over him despite the ringing in his ears he thought he heard jamie moan then he heard her curse anger giving her the energy to paw rubble off her he smelled smoke struggling to his hands and knees he peered through the doorway into what had been the office the wall between the office and the bedroom had been ruptured the lights had been destroyed but flickering flames allowed him to see into the gutted bedroom the windows bulletresistant glass was spread across the bedroom floor an october wind howled through the jagged opening fueling the flames an alarm went off overhead sprinklers gushed water into the bedroom and the office somebody pulled cavanaugh awayali somebody else pulled jamie belatedly cavanaugh realized it was kim brockman had a fire extinguisher and charged into the wreckage spraying foam where the flames resisted the water from the sprinklers then cavanaugh was clear of the smoke and the dust ali set him down in the conference room and turned on the lights jamie squirmed next to him blood running from her nose cavanaugh realized that blood ran from his nose also through blurred vision he stared at the draperies that covered the conference room windows get us out of here his voice seemed to come from far away what ali asked as if cavanaugh spoke gibberish and maybe cavanaugh did speak gibberish he pointed toward the windows get us out of this room he tried to say it as distinctly and forcefully as possible his throat raw his lips numb the glass from the other window he managed to say what about it sprayed inside the bedroom the explosion came from outside it must have been a rocket kim realized handheld types were only thirty inches long at this late hour with midtown manhattan mostly deserted one could have been easily launched from the opposite sidewalk hurry ali helped to pull cavanaugh and jamie from the conference room into the lobby but they didnt stop there brockman was suddenly with them again dropping the fire extinguisher he helped ali yank open doors that led to a bank of elevators a bell rang an elevator opened brockman kim and ali drew their guns the man who emerged from the elevator wore black pants and a black leather jacket he stared at the weapons stopped chewing gum and raised his hands whoa he said slowly the pistols were lowered the man was eddie macintosh one of the protectors cavanaugh had sent for he studied the blood trickling from cavanaughs nose tell me what to do have you got a car in the parking garage downstairs from the gaping window down the hall they heard the wail of approaching sirens jamie sat up get us out of here to the hospital no wed be targets there and wed be defenseless at a police precinct cavanaugh forced himself to stand we cant assume every police officer and fireman who arrives is genuine through the shattered window the sirens sounded closer cavanaugh wavered then helped jamie up how did they know to hit our bedroom maybe they saw its light go on brockman said no that light was off jamie insisted what was that phone call about brockmans tone was stark another agents been killed what jack gantry he was in vancouver protecting a tv anchorwoman from a stalker he escorted her home when he walked back to his car he got hit a crossbow those things are almost as powerful as some pistols no sound a crossbow cavanaughs confusion made him feel as if the floor shifted kim do you have a backup for the printout you gave me she fumbled in her suit coat and gave him a memory stick tell the police well contact them when were safe unwilling to trust the elevator cavanaugh motioned for jamie and eddie to follow him toward the fire door the stairs felt cold cavanaugh tried to assure himself that was why he shivered footsteps scraping the group descended from the fortieth to the thirtieth floor where he surprised jamie and eddie by opening the door eddie looked puzzled you said we were leaving the building the others dont need to know cavanaugh glanced inside and made sure that the softly lit corridor was empty after they went in he held three fingers in front of jamie how many she told him blurred no headache yes jamie wiped blood from her nose we need to wait and see if its a concussion how will we know if you throw up or feel sleepy sleepy at this hour imagine that jamie turned toward eddie we havent been introduced jamie travers eddie macintosh are you an operator you must be new i havent seen you around shes my wife cavanaugh said wonders never cease and yes cavanaugh said shes an operator havent seen you around either i heard you left the business i tried but now im back cavanaugh led them to a door marked william faraday law offices he raised his jacket collar reached into a slit in the material and pulled out lockpick tools that hed taken from the gulfstreams bugout bag he inserted one of the picks into the lock probing to free the pins while he used another pick to apply torque and turn the key slot it took him thirty seconds too long he thought i should have been able to do it in fifteen perhaps he was still dazed from the explosions but perhaps his lockpicking skills had atrophied during the months hed stopped being a protector that made him worry about what other skills might have atrophied he opened the door and heard the intrusion alarms beep if he didnt enter the access code within thirty seconds the alarm would blare leaving the lights off he crossed the waiting room to the control panel and pressed buttons for the code that he and william had agreed on when the system was installed the beeping stopped jamie locked the door behind them faraday a voice croaked jerk jamie and eddie drew their guns a dim nightlight revealed a parrot in a cage faraday jerk the bird repeated what the hell eddie muttered one of williams competitors sent the parrot after losing a case to him cavanaugh explained william thanked the rival attorney and promised to keep the bird in his reception room william did that jamie asked in surprise he also swore to keep the bottom of the cage lined with photographs of the man who sent the parrot williams clients find it amusing to look down and see bird droppings over the guys face now that sounds more like william faraday jerk the parrot squawked cavanaugh hurried to the receptionists desk and turned on its computer helped by its glow he inserted kims memory stick and activated the printer as the machine went to work he asked eddie are you armed of course mind watching the front door while we clean the blood off us eddie pushed back one side of his leather jacket and drew a beretta ninemillimeter he had big hands and could handle the doublestacked fifteenround magazine he put another piece of gum into his mouth anybody who breaks through that door wont live to break through another one still got a headache cavanaugh used a moist paper towel to wipe blood from jamies face the restroom didnt have windows so it was safe to turn on the lights which pained cavanaughs eyes not as bad you jamie wiped blood from his face shook up you dont show it her voice echoed off the rooms tiles youre doing a good job of hiding it also are you sure you dont feel dizzy the bright lights continued to hurt his eyes you mean do i think im going to pass out from a concussion no how do i know because im starved for a medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms i guess youre going to live for now yes cavanaugh said the words sticking in his throat for now as he guided her toward the door to the hallway she hesitated no longer able to ignore her troubled thoughts how did they know to make the bedroom the target i didnt turn the light on they couldnt have known we were going in there maybe the phone call cavanaugh replied you didnt answer it they couldnt have known we were in that office but then the call was automatically transferred to brockman cavanaugh reminded her you think he told them where we were i have no idea he claims the phone call was about another agent who was killed wed need phone records to find out where the call came from yes and while we figure out how to get them heres something else thats been troubling me in the harsh light jamies eyes narrowed duncan chose brockman to be his chiefofstaff its a logical choice brockmans a firstrate administrator as well as a proven operator so why didnt duncan give the company to him because duncan felt a bond with you but he also knew i hated working at a desk we were close yes but duncan saw brockman all the time and must have gotten along with him if duncan kept him as chiefofstaff i dont see where youre going with this according to william duncan decided to make me his heir a month before he was killed what if he gave gps to me because hed begun to suspect something was wrong with the company is that what you think you told brockman kim and ali you trusted them absolutely i lied in other words were not sure of anything im sure of one thing you cavanaugh sat in a corner of williams office away from the draped windows on the floor a desk lamp was next to him the light so dim and sheltered that it couldnt be seen from a building across the street eyes scratchy he read the printout the details of his global protective service assignments despite the windows he heard faint commotion outside below on the street sirens the rumble of what might have been fire trucks vehicle doors being slammed voices he imagined what was happening in the opposite direction ten floors above him in what was left of the gps offices police officers and firedepartment personnel would be questioning brockman kim and ali about the explosion the authorities frowns would deepen when they learned about the number of gps operators whod been recently killed teams would be rushing into buildings across the street searching for an indication of where the attackers had placed themselves hoping to find whoever was responsible for the explosion he concentrated on the printout so many assignments hundreds and hundreds theyd accumulated blending in his memory until many of the names of clients were meaningless to him how was it possible to devote oneself to protecting somebody to the point of being ready to risk dying for that person and not have the faintest mental image of what that person looked like he read about the powerful the wealthy and the famous or else about average people under terrible threats the helpless the preyedupon as far as cavanaugh was concerned gps didnt accept enough of those latter cases the victims couldnt afford the companys services unless they attracted a protectors attention and the work was done pro bono but if cavanaugh survived this he was determined to change things take from the rich and give to the poor he suddenly realized that he was projecting himself into the future to distract himself from the present no he warned himself the only way to survive was to concentrate on now but that meant concentrating on the past and regardless of how much he tried no summary of his former assignments jogged his memory about anything he might have seen or heard that would have made him a liability to a former client his employers had always been careful to guard their secrets as for the revenge theory cavanaugh had prevented so many assassinations and kidnappings that he found it impossible to single out any one incident for which an opponent might be determined to get even even so there was something about one of his assignments that nudged at the back of his mind something that connected with the way the gps operators had been killed something about knives at once eddie came into the office somebodys trying to get in the front door when cavanaugh hurried into the dark reception room he saw jamies silhouette crouched behind the desk aiming her pistol toward the door next to him eddie drew his own gun aiming cavanaugh noticed a slight shadow in the sliver of light that came through the bottom of the door he heard the scrape of metal as someone worked to pick the lock hearing it slide free he tensed as he remembered that he hadnt reset the alarm when the intruder opened the door and didnt hear the warning beep it would be obvious that someone had entered and turned it off imagining the intruder removing the lock picks and putting them away before turning the knob cavanaugh hurried across the reception rooms carpet and pushed the alarms set button he got back to the desk as a different scrape of metal indicated that the knob was being turned in the darkness jamie and eddie kept aiming the door opened a few inches from the hallway a beam of light angled in the warning beep began cavanaugh drew his pistol a shadow obscured the beam of light how many are out there he wondered the doors too solid for them to shoot through it or for us to shoot at them theyll need to show themselves faraday jerk the parrot croaked the alarm kept beeping in fifteen more seconds it would wail summoning security personnel the intruders it was foolish to believe there was only one needed to make a decisionassume that the warning beep meant that no one had entered the office or else take the chance of bursting in and shooting as the alarm went off knowing that they had to finish the gunfight before the police who were already in the building hurried to this floor no there was a third option cavanaugh realized maybe the plan was for the intruders to throw in flashbang grenades temporarily blinding and deafening anybody in the office then they could easily charge in and finish anyone inside avoiding a prolonged gunfight gaining time to get away before the police arrived with no time to try to protect his eyes or his ears cavanaugh tightened his grip on his pistol and frowned as an object hurtled through the gap in the door thumping onto the carpeting only one object if the intruders were using flashbang grenades theyd have thrown several the door was slammed shut in the corridor footsteps raced along marble get back cavanaugh shouted as the alarm blared he tugged jamie from behind the desk eddie retreated with them the object detonated but not with a roar and a flash instead it made a whumping sound that could barely be heard amid the alarms wail even in the shadows cavanaugh saw a cloud burst from the object back back back he kept saying tugging jamie almost tripping over eddie into williams office they reached the corridor near the reception room looking over his shoulder cavanaugh saw the cloud obscure the murky furniture hissing pressure expanded it rapidly faraday the parrot squawked it didnt get a chance to add jerk before it toppled to the floor of its cage wings thrashing jamie and eddie ran into williams office cavanaugh followed and slammed the door poison gas his voice was barely audible amid the alarm as he recalled how much force the vapor had been under we cant stay here itll seep under the door he pivoted toward a wall of shelves that had an array of imposing law books on them after yanking down a book on the right of the middle shelf he flipped a lever then tugged at the entire section of shelves the section was on rollers it swung smoothly out revealing a circular metal staircase that led down jamie and eddie looked surprised william got so paranoid about his security he insisted on another way to leave his office cavanaugh flicked a switch that illuminated the stairs and motioned for jamie and eddie to hurry down about to follow he balked and stared back at the closed office door the gray haze was seeping under it unable to subdue his protectors instincts he lunged for the desk grabbing the phone what are you doing eddie shouted from the staircase the buildings security guards cavanaugh thought the police the explosions put them on heightened alert the alarm will bring them to this office theyll burst in theyll breathe the gas and die williams phone system had an emergency button that directed a call to the lobbys security desk what a voice asked quickly sounding harried pressing the phone hard against his ear holding a hand over his other ear cavanaugh thought he heard sirens and urgent voices in the background theres an alarm on the thirtieth floor we know a teams going up there cavanaugh stared again at the crack beneath the closed door more of the gray haze seeped under it dont go into the office its filled with poison gas he slammed down the phone and charged through the opening in the wall the metal staircase echoed as he pulled at the section of shelves closing the barrier he heard a latch click shut then he ran down the circular stairs turning repeatedly the echo rumbling jamie and eddie waited at the bottom a dead end how do we that latch on the right eddie yanked it and pulled a section of the wall moved toward him the light in the stairwell revealed a janitors closet they closed the wall unlocked the closet door and peered out checking the corridor after the dim light in the stairwell the overhead fluorescents seemed bright when they emerged from the closet the police will search the building jamie said and emergencyresponse teams cavanaugh agreed assuming theyre all genuine he eased a stairwell door open from below footsteps and voices rumbled upward we cant go that way i always get the shit duty the fireman thought his name was ben gutowski laboring up the stairs in complete firefighting gear he felt sweat soaking his clothes his legs ached would you rather be in an elevator he asked himself suppose this is another world trade center attack suppose more bombs go off or rockets or whatever caused the explosion suppose the building collapses howd you like to be in a friggin elevator then and whats this alert about poison gas you want to be trapped in an elevator with that maybe the captain did you a favor breathing hard ben reached another stairwell door twentyninth floor below him other firemen in full gear struggled upward checking other floors he pressed his hand against the door feeling for heat he did the same to the doorknob normal he put his oxygen mask over his face breathed and opened the door assuming he didnt encounter a fire and his airtesting meter didnt detect any gas he would then take off his oxygen mask and lumber along the corridor making sure nobody was in danger bang crash clatter elvis presley sang blue hawaii surprise made ben almost drop his ax ahead a janitor took a wet mop from a pail and swabbed the corridor while a radio played music through the partially open door of a maintenance closet what are you doing here ben demanded while elvis crooned cavanaugh peered up from mopping the floor his gray janitors coveralls covered the blood on his clothes and gave him the rumpled look of somebody whod worked too many years on the night shift the small radio was a bonus what does it look like im doing cavanaugh answered annoyed the fireman appeared genuine but after the nights threats it was foolish to make assumptions and what are you doing here he almost let go of his mop in apparent sudden realization wait a minute is there a fire didnt you hear the explosion explosion on the fortieth floor what and poison gas the exhausted fireman said poison jesus dont tell me its terrorists we dont know what it is you need to get out of here buddy i dont need convincing anybody else on this floor nobody youre positive ive been up and down this corridor for the past hour the place is deserted a bell sounded down the corridor an elevator opened a policeman charged out this floors clear the fireman shouted to be heard above the music im getting this janitor out of here on the double we dont know what else might happen the policeman ducked back into the elevator its doors closed you heard him the fireman said go im outta here cavanaugh said he and the fireman hurried toward the stairwell door hold it i forgot my coat cavanaugh said hurry the fireman turned and yelled down the stairs toward where footsteps and voices struggled upward evacuee coming down im right behind you cavanaugh yelled check the other floors poison gas god help anybody whos in the building breathing hard the fireman climbed to the next level simultaneously cavanaugh opened the maintenance rooms door all the way there amid boxes of cleaning supplies jamie and eddie waited only one other set of coveralls had been in the room theyd been too big for jamie so eddie wore them jamie grabbed a box holding it as if it contained something important clutching his mop as if he was too startled to realize it was in his hand cavanaugh led the way through the stairwell door lights glared above the door to the thirtieth floor banged shut as the fireman went in below other firemen climbed and opened doors cavanaugh jamie and eddie hurried down one of your men ordered us out of here he told the next fireman four floors down i dont understand whats happening just do what he told you the fireman breathed hard from the climb and the weight of his equipment get out of the building evacuees coming down he yelled to his team farther below as cavanaugh jamie and eddie hurriedly descended the clatter of their footsteps added to those of the emergency team evacuees a fireman yelled to other men below him are you hurt he asked cavanaugh no just scared i hear you the fireman said putting his oxygen mask on he braced himself and opened a door they hurried lower passing emergency workers breathing hoarsely they reached the fifth floor the fourth a few seconds after they passed the lobby door it banged open a fireman charged up the stairs shouting into his twoway radio affirmative poison gas the thirtieth floor make sure the buildings empty with his attention focused on the upper floors the fireman failed to see them below garage level two the sign said cavanaugh cracked the door open and listened hearing only stillness he opened the door farther and studied the few cars in an emergency that required a building to be evacuated it was standard procedure for the teams to start at the bottom moving upward subsequently they assumed areas theyd checked didnt need to be revisited as he stepped into the parking garage the overhead lights made everything a sickly yellow over there eddie pointed past three drabcolored tauruses that global protective services used eddies car was equally anonymous lets see if it explodes they crouched behind the farthest car and put their hands over their earsexcept for eddie who could protect only one ear while he pressed an ignition button on his cars remote control when the car started eddie relaxed well at least we dont need to worry about that but there might still be a bomb jamie said eddie agreed the attack team would have seen me drive in here theyd have had plenty of time to hide one somewhere other than attaching it to the engine cautious they approached the car its nostrilstinging exhaust made eddie press another button on the remote shutting off the engine in the smothering silence cavanaugh reached under his sport coat felt behind the pouch that contained his spare ammunition magazine and unsheathed a small flashlight another item from his bugout bag for its sizeas long and wide as his index fingerit produced surprisingly intense light jamie took out hers also they knelt and aimed the beams behind the wheels and at every area of the cars undercarriage then cavanaugh went to one side of the car while jamie went to the other he aimed his light through a window toward the rear of the interior while jamie did the same from the opposite side the idea was to concentrate on small areas progressing from one tiny space to another in an ordered way cavanaugh had difficulty keeping his flashlight steady when he knew that at any moment the door to the parking area might bang open and what came through might not be an emergency team through the windows they looked for anything that seemed out of place but the chances were a bomb wouldnt be that easy to notice sometimes the only indication was a slight shadow the dashboard the steering column the brake the accelerator what they mostly searched for was a wire when a door was opened the wire would tug a concealed igniter and the car would explode the extremely thin wire might have a nonreflective coating that made it difficult to detect cavanaughs mouth felt dry see anything no jamie answered time for the game cavanaugh referred to rock paper and scissors he and eddie made a fist and shook it three times when they stopped they had three options to leave the fist closed rock to open the hand flat paper or to hold out the first two fingers scissors cavanaughs scissors cut eddies paper okay he told jamie and eddie get back behind the far vehicle while i open the doors you didnt play the game with me jamie noted cavanaugh studied her fine he said they held up their fists and shook them three times jamies paper covered cavanaughs rock i dont want you to do this cavanaugh said i dont want to either but im part of the team and im going to risk my life the same as everybody else yeah youre tough eddie said cavanaugh had never understood the expression heart in my throat until now do it slowly he said keep looking for wires the speed of his pulse made him sick as he and eddie crouched behind the farthest car he opened his mouth and pressed his hands over his ears to minimize the impact of an explosion but even with his ears muffled he was sure he heard jamie open the doors a few instants lasted forever then jamie was standing in front of him looking terrified but proud okay he said exhaling my turn ill check inside as jamie and eddie crouched behind the far vehicle cavanaugh aimed his small flashlight and cautiously leaned into the car peering up under the dashboard he checked under the seats nothing looked suspicious as jamie and eddie rejoined him he reached into his jacket pocket and came out with something else from the bugout bag a zip tie without needing to be told what came next eddie unlocked the tauruss trunk but kept his hands on the lid so that it opened only a crack while jamie aimed her flashlight cavanaugh inserted the zip tie into the crack between the lid and the cars chassis and drew it from one side to the other what he felt for was a taut wire all an enemy needed to do was pick the trunks lock put a bomb inside attach a wire to the bombs detonator close the lid until only the enemys hand fitted inside hook the wire to the inside of the lid and then close the lid the twist tie was pliant enough that if it encountered a wire it would bend without putting pressure on the wire sweat trickled down cavanaughs face his hand wanted to shake but he kept it steady five minutes later he nodded to eddie who raised the lid slightly higher while cavanaugh and jamie aimed their flashlights inside finally the trunk was all the way open they searched among weapons and an armored vest and to their relief found nothing that looked like a bomb security specialists were paranoid about being held prisoner in the trunks of their cars one of the first things an operator did when acquiring a vehicle was to inspect the trunks interior and rig its latch so that it could easily be tripped from the inside as a further precaution a weapon and escape tools were hidden behind the trunks lining and air holes were drilled tubes leading from them to the vehicles interior finally the best agents had a secret stash of something else smiling eddie now displayed it peeling off the lining on the right side of the trunk cavanaugh grinned at a plastic bottle of water and a bag filled with energy bars god i love working with a pro they took turns drinking water had never tasted so wonderful cavanaugh wiped drops from his lips and bit heartily into a caramelflavored energy bar all the while staring toward the door that led into the parking garage he looked at his watch almost five am we still need to check the engine and under the car twenty minutes later every part of the vehicle had been studied clean eddie said but we cant leave the building yet jamie said the police and the emergency crews would see us and stop us theyd probably take us somewhere and question us cavanaugh nodded we need to assume the assault teams watching the building theyd follow im tough to follow eddie said even so yeah wed better stay put and get some rest after another round of rock paper and scissors eddie got the spacious back seat jamie the front and cavanaugh who hated enclosed spaces got the trunk it faced a wall he set the weapons to one side then he crawled in put his handgun beside him saw a section of rope threaded it through a rib in the underside of the lid and lowered the lid until the trunk was open about five inches he tucked the rope under him so that his weight would keep the lid at the level he wanted if he needed to hed be able to release the rope and raise the lid in a hurry jamie stepped back pretending she was someone whod just entered the garage it looks natural with the trunk facing the wall i cant tell its partly open eddie was already stretched out in the back seat with both doors closed jamie couldnt see him unless she stood at the side of the car and looked directly in she turned toward the trunks lid and peered through the gap sweet dreams babe part four the rule of five missions dreaming that he was buried alive cavanaugh woke with a start having imagined the sound of dirt being shoveled onto his coffin he knew that further sleep was out of the question instead he imagined jackson hole near dawn the crisp autumn air elk in the pasture sounds interrupted opening his eyes cavanaugh clutched his pistol and listened to a door banging he heard car engines footsteps voices but there wasnt any sense of urgency the police and the emergency crews must have finished their investigation decided that the risk was over and finally allowed the building to be reopened as more cars arrived he pulled the rope down lowering the trunks lid almost all the way in the murky enclosure he stared at his watch waiting for his eyes to detect the faintly luminous dial the hands showed that the time was eight minutes after one time for lunch babe jamies voice was close outside the trunk dont you think about anything except food and a bathroom jamie said but restaurants have bathrooms so were got everything covered incidentally im pretending to unlock the trunk cavanaugh released the rope and let jamie raise the lid her green eyes studied the enclosure reminds me of the first dormitory room i had at wellesley minus the weapons of course nobodys watching im partially shielding you come on out cavanaughs legs felt stiff as he stepped down to the concrete eddie looked rested putting a stick of gum in his mouth more cars entered the parking garage sounds and movement filled it men and women wearing business clothes walked toward the elevators cavanaugh heard bits of troubled conversation about rumors of what had happened during the night ready to go eddie no longer wore the janitors coveralls despite his beard stubble his clean leather jacket and turtleneck made him look the most presentable of the three jamie closed her blazer over the blood spots on her white blouse cavanaugh decided that the coveralls he wore would attract less attention than the damaged clothes underneath lets do it they got in the taurus eddie behind the steering wheel cavanaugh next to him jamie in the back despite the care theyd taken to make sure the car didnt have a bomb cavanaugh tensed when eddie turned the ignition key but the only sound was the cars smooth drone eddie drove up the ramp toward the buildings exit where he showed a gps badge to a security officer the crossbar went up they emerged onto the noise and commotion of rd street itll be hard to follow us in all this traffic eddie drove through noisy madison avenue and continued along rd unless they planted a location transmitter so small we didnt spot it when we searched the car unpleasant thought eddie checked his rearview mirror where to get us off the island cavanaugh said he turned on the radio billy joel sang about a new york state of mind cavanaugh pushed a button that switched the sophisticated radio to an extremely wide fm spectrum a global protective services modification jamie why dont you tell us the fascinating story of your life jamie hesitated only long enough to gather her thoughts before starting her monologue it is fascinating first i was born and then i learned to crawl and then i was toilet trained cavanaugh proceeded fm spectrum on the radio most location transmitters used an fm setting as did many eavesdropping devicestuned to bandwidths that werent employed by local radio stations and policefiredepartment radios to discover if that type of beeper or bug had been concealed in the car cavanaugh needed only to continue up the fm spectrum and listen for jamies voice or the beep of a location transmitter to come through the radio and then i went to junior high and then i started dating boys and then i went to high school and i really started dating boys you can skip that part cavanaugh said and then i went to wellesley and i dated men you can skip that part also and then i met you and my life got weird and cavavaugh reached the top end of the fm spectrum without hearing jamies voice come from the radio seems like its safe to talk he didnt add his next thought which was that if the attack team had used a radio transmitter that gathered conversations on exotic frequencies and sent them in microbursts there was no easy way to detect it eddie had his hands at ten oclock and two oclock on the steering wheel his fingers slightly spread as a professional driver was trained to do how about the lincoln tunnel good cavanaugh said then head south on ninetyfive to washington eddie passed fifth and sixth avenues then turned south onto seventh switching his grip on the steering wheel the next light remained green the many lanes of oneway traffic increased speed why are we going to shit whats the matter jamie asked something eddie took his right hand off the steering wheel and stared at it stung what something stung me they kept with the rapid traffic a bee cavanaugh glanced around a mosquito or something its a little late in the year for no eddies voice was thick steering wheel something on the eddie pointed toward the two oclock position on the steering wheel jesus his breathing sounded labored hey jamie touched his shoulder are you all right dont feel cavanaugh have you got a eddie shivered handkerchief cavanaugh frowned in my jacket he pulled it out wrap it eddie gasped your hand what grab the eddie shivered more violently bottom steering suddenly eddies head jerked back he slumped when cavanaugh had learned defensiveoffensive driving techniques one of the drills involved what to do if youre in the front passenger seat of a car your partner driving and the windshield blows apart from supervelocity bullets and the driver takes one in the head you cant let the car veer off the road into a wall or a tree you cant let it stop the prime imperative is to get away from the shooting zone as quickly as possible and that meant you had to do what cavanaugh did now conscious of the rapid traffic on either side he undid his seatbelt and shifted close to eddie with his handkerchief wrapped around his fingers he grabbed the lower portion of the steering wheel far from where eddie had gripped it far from whatever had stung him simultaneously cavanaugh shifted his left foot over to the floor pedals pressing the brake as traffic slowed and then stopped for a red light seeing a police car ahead on the left he blurted jamie lean forward prop eddie up tilt his head so he seems to be looking forward make it seem like hes driving sweating cavanaugh propped eddies right hand on the steering wheel as he neared the police car he told jamie now lean back cavanaugh tried to put distance between him and eddie making the space between them look normal while still managing to stretch his leg toward the brake amid waiting traffic he eased to a stop next to the police car put the transmission in neutral and moved back to the passenger seat the idling engine allowing him to take his foot off the brake looking ahead he pretended this was the most boring day of his life from the left side of his vision he had a blurred image of one of the policemen peering at the taurus the officer watched eddie and cavanaugh for what seemed an eternity the light turned green traffic shifted forward the cruiser seemed frozen in place the policeman studying eddie then the van ahead of the police car went through the intersection and the police car caught up to it filling the gap working to control his breathing cavanaugh slid close to eddie gripped the bottom of the steering wheel put the transmission into drive and eased his left foot onto the accelerator matching the pace of traffic jamie lean forward again put your head next to eddie as if youre saying something to him put a hand on his shoulder keep him from slumping over in the middle of several lanes of traffic cavanaugh saw a space open on his right and steered into that lane so he wouldnt be next to the police car a taxi blared jamie had the sensation of spiraling downward since having met and married cavanaugh which wasnt even his real name the abnormal had become the rule chases gunfights even getting shot five months earlier she didnt understand how shed managed to adjust to cavanaughs dangerous upsidedown world where things were seldom as they appeared he once joked that she must have been a protective agent in another life leaning toward eddie holding his shoulder to keep him from slumping putting her head next to his to keep it from tilting while she pretended to talk to himall this seemed insanely natural from the listless feel of his body and the increasing coolness in the skin she was certain he was dead another first she thought touching a corpse talking to it ive gone crazy what killed him she tried to keep her fierce emotions from affecting her voice cavanaughs face showed the strain of concentrating to keep the taurus moving with the chaos of traffic ahead a vans brake lights came on as an intersections signal turned red he stretched his leg over and pressed the brake pedal stopping just before his car would have hit the van eddie said something stung him a needle on the steering wheel another pointed weapon with some kind of toxin on it we need to find a place to park in midtown manhattan lots of luck which we seem to have run out of the light turned green the van moved ahead cavanaugh shifted his outstretched leg from the brake to the accelerator i dont trust myself to try to turn a corner without hitting another car we need to stay on seventh avenue flanked by a limousine and a delivery truck they headed farther south a taxi veered from the left to get into cavanaughs lane he barely stretched his foot to the brake in time to avoid smashing into it as eddies head threatened to list to the right jamie gripped the back of his neck tighter to keep it straight his skin felt cooler driving from the passenger seat i guess thats something else you need to teach me when we get out of this yeah when we get out of this the lovely concept of the future they kept heading south on seventh avenue staying in the middle of the numerous lanes of traffic jamie had the sense of being on a runaway wagon cavanaugh struggling to keep it under control a red light stopped them at th street then they sped forward again car horns blaring around them five more red lights later they crossed below west th leaving the rectangular grids of midtown for the randomly arranged streets of greenwich village traffic became less crowded easing to the left toward sheridan square cavanaugh reached a no parking zone in front of the speartipped metal bars of tiny christopher park with no policemen in sight he jumped from the car and ran around the front to get behind the steering wheel and push eddie into the passenger seat meanwhile jamie hurried from the back and fastened eddies seat belt she closed the passenger door against him then rushed to the back again and leaned eddies head against the passenger window as if he were sleeping cavanaugh pulled from the no parking zone driving was still awkward because cavanaugh had to grip the bottom of the steering wheel keeping a handkerchief around his right hand wary of whatever sharp object was embedded in the wheel he steered around a block and got back onto seventh avenue continuing south the holland tunnel jamie asked yes hoboken a shopping mall in addition to fresh clothes what they needed were a magnifying glass and a strong pair of tweezers all of which were in bags jamie carried to where cavanaugh had parked in a remote area of the shopping malls parking lot jamie had worn eddies leather jacket to conceal the blood on her top to be thorough shed bought two magnifying glasses and after she and cavanaugh put on jeans and pullovers in the back seat they leaned toward the steering wheel careful not to touch it as they gazed through the magnifying glasses examining it in painstaking detail i see something glinting jamie said on her third pass over the wheel she pointed there careful cavanaugh stared through the magnifying glass yes i see it he raised the tweezers and probed at the back of the wheel gripping something pulling it free the needle glinted in the lateafternoon sunlight coming through the windshield jamie shivered looks like the back ends been snipped off cavanaugh said after it was pushed through the padding on the steering wheel it must have been trimmed so it wouldnt stick out on either side but hidden the way it was the driver wouldnt get pricked unless he gripped the steering wheel with a little extra force jamie said which eddie would have needed to do when he turned the corner onto seventh avenue lets keep checking in case there are more but twenty minutes of further searching revealed nothing else they dropped the needle into a plastic bag global protective services the receptionists voice said using his cell phone cavanaugh stood next to the taurus at the deserted edge of the shopping malls parking lot in the background he heard objects clattering as if workman were removing debris from the explosion at the gps office mr brockman please im sorry hes not available then give me mr karim may i tell him whos calling mr stoddard hes expecting my call one moment cavanaugh heard a click then nothing he held the phone closer to his ear as an eighteenwheel truck roared past on a neighboring highway cavanaugh karims voice suddenly asked where are you weve been worried about whats your cellphone number cavanaugh worried that the office phones were tapped karim told him the number go to encryption ill call you right back duncans justified mania about security had prompted him to arrange for all gps cell phones to have a scrambler capability so that protectors could speak to one another while eavesdroppers with radio scanners would hear only garbled words it was the only time cavanaugh felt comfortable using a cell phone immediately he activated the encryption on his phone then pressed numbers on the other end the phone barely rang before karim answered are you okay we had another casualty eddies dead what a needle hidden in his cars steering wheel it had some kind of poison on it the phone became silent for a moment as karim reacted to this information a sharp object like the others after eddie parked and came up to the office somebody must have gotten into the buildings garage and rigged his car maybe cavanaugh said how else would after jamie eddie and i went down in the elevator did you kim brockman stay together together waiting for the police and the fire department did you stay together no not all the time we went back to your office trying to save files and contain the damage each of us had different things to do when the police and the fire department showed up things got more confusing why what are you getting at would there have been time for one of you to go down to williams office i dont understand karim sounded more confused why would any of us have wanted to go there because one of you got information that we went there but how cavanaugh thought did someone have williams office bugged to find out if he learned who aaron stoddard was wait a minute karim said are you suggesting one of us tried to kill you wheres brockman i havent the faintest idea home probably even if hes not the boss any longer hes entitled we spent all night at the office remember karims voice had an edge to it or maybe hes as dumb as i am and hes putting in another shift meeting a client or whatever dont tell me you think brockman im just trying to cover the possibilities next youll be asking about kim ill save you the trouble shes not here did you think she had something to do with this what about me i told you im just trying to cover the possibilities there isnt time for this we need to do something about eddie im in a parking lot at a shopping mall in hoboken then i guess im not the only one having a fabulous time tell the police ill leave eddie with his car cavanaugh told karim the license number and directions to the shopping mall everythings the way it was when he got killed except the needles in a plastic bag on the seat next to him the police wont be happy you moved the murder weapon would they rather somebody else died from being stung by it tell them to expect to find our fingerprints all over the car but maybe theyll also find some evidence left by the killer well call them later and answer their questions but theres no way well take the risk of exposing ourselves by coming in in the mall cavanaugh and jamie stood in a corner near glass doors concealed by customers who came and went wont be long now jamie said the sign says its supposed to come at four oclock air brakes hissing a bus stopped outside the glass doors the sign said weatherview retirement center as elderly people cued up to get on the bus cavanaugh and jamie merged with them the only young people in the group cavanaugh noticed that the driver wasnt collecting money the bus was apparently some kind of community service howd the shopping go cavanaugh asked a whitehaired man ahead of him shopping dont come here to shop i walk exercise know what i mean sure do jamie said but why dont you walk in a park or some place nice and get killed yeah the streets arent as safe as they used to be the ozone layers shot skin cancer im talking about skin cancer know what i mean sure do not to mention all the junk in the air smog car exhaust thats what i mean as cavanaugh and jamie got on the bus jamies rapport with the man made it seem they were together when the man missed his step cavanaugh caught his arm helping him inside he gave the bus driver an i need to keep an eye on the old fellow look then proceeded with jamie and the elderly man toward seats in the back when the bus eased away from the mall heading toward a busy street jamie touched cavanaughs arm and nodded toward the deserted part of the lot where theyd left eddie in the taurus sirens wailing three police cars sped toward the vehicle where to the taxi driver asked across the river jamie said manhattan gonna cost you the driver ignored cavanaugh enjoying jamies figure and her captivating eyes once i get over there im not allowed to take a fare back to hoboken i dont have a choice ive got a meeting i absolutely need to attend ill pay double plus a twenty percent tip they got out at times square and went into a store that had camera in its title but sold almost everything they came out with two overtheshoulder travel bags went into a nearby drug store bought the toiletries they needed and put them in the bags they went into a clothing store and used some of the cash from the gulfstreams bugout bag to buy a few more clothes including underwear and socks they walked east on fortysecond street having fun yet cavanaugh asked loving every minute god help me ive been with you so long i cant tell the difference between being scared and feeling an adrenaline surge did i ever tell you about the rule of five no jamie made her way along the congested sidewalk the time was almost six oclock car horns blared amid stalled traffic but ive got nothing better to do so why dont you tell me youre sure cant wait in the second world war instructors training american fighter pilots couldnt help noticing how many students died on their early missions no matter how hard the instructors tried to teach the pilots the way to spot traps and get out of tough places a large percentage of each class got shot down so the instructors researched files that dated all the way back to the first world war and what they discovered was a mathematical pattern the majority of novice pilots were shot down within their first five missions jamie looked at him the same pattern showed up in the korean war and in vietnam five was the magic number after that their chances of surviving combat flights increased dramatically during the first five missions the tension of combat was so unfamiliar that the students had trouble using what theyd learned they were too busy adjusting it was only after five missions that they started to know the difference between fear and adrenaline once the pilots understood that adrenaline primed their reflexes and made them better able to track a target and pull the trigger in the split second when it mattered they were on their way to being professionals the pilots who survived five missions tended to survive thirty and forty missions if you consider everything that happened to us im not talking about the training i gave you since we got married trainings only half of what it takes the real thing adjusting to fearthats the other half you graduated you passed your five missions is that supposed to give me confidence that i that we have a better chance of surviving we got this far didnt we as the evening became dimmer and cooler they stared up at the imposing entrance to grand central station the stocky black man jogged around a curve and increased speed down a straightaway through a wooded park in a suburb of washington dc he wasnt alone at in the morning an army of his fellow exercisers primed themselves for another days combat in offices throughout the nations capitol the chill of october had its effect prompting the black man to wear a longlegged navy exercise suit breath vapor blew from his mouth hearing rhythmic rapid footfalls behind him he waited for the faster runners to pass him a white man and woman each wearing gray exercise suits came abreast of him he maintained his moderate pace waiting for them to surge ahead but instead they kept even with him one on each side their footfalls matching his when he looked at one and then the other he almost faltered i do believe the southern baptist said ill tell you what i believe cavanaugh said im not sure i want to know the black man john rutherford said i believe in gun oil and plenty of ammunition im relieved for a second i expected you to say something you hoped would shock me bull durham jamie said rutherford nodded jogging past a duck pond baseballs an enjoyable pastime so are the slow kisses kevin costners character believes in jamie said if you expect me to be shocked by that rutherford breathed hard as he ran i remind you i was married my wife god rest her soul believed in slow kisses also how are you jamie his smile was genuine the last time i saw you you were in a hospital bed im glad you recovered from your wound hows the guy who shot me doing not well im afraid prison doesnt agree with him seems he prefers solitary confinement to all the inmates who want to be his friend what a shame and how about you john cavanaugh asked how are you getting along i understand congratulations are in order you mean my promotion director of the fbis counterterrorist unit im proud of you sure you are they ran past a homeless man asleep on a bench i hate to ask this were having such a great time so far rutherford said how are you need a little help john gosh and here i thought youd just happened to be in the neighborhood you decided to drop by at the crack of dawn say hello and catch up on old times while you joined me for a little exercise exactly what we had in mind cavanaugh said but as long as were here let me guess you want to talk about the global protective service agents whove been killed you know about that cavanaugh looked at him in surprise theyre not the only ones protectors in various government agencies are being killed also what cavanaugh slackened his pace and veered from the path stopping next to bushes rutherford and jamie followed him the secret service the us marshals the diplomatic security service three days ago agents from all of them suddenly became targets rutherford took a towel from around his neck and wiped sweat from his forehead at first it looked like theyd taken hits meant for the people they were protecting but the casualties kept mounting and most of the attacks happened when the agents were offduty we soon had to conclude the protectors were the targets on a hunch we checked the civilian protection agencies the small ones didnt know what we were talking about but a major one like global protective services we took our share of hits cavanaugh said we rutherford frowned i thought youd left the business whats that line from one of the godfather movies just when i thought i was out they dragged me back in now im not only back in the business i own the damned thing cavanaugh explained what had happened at the gps office in manhattan and later in eddies car eddie macintosh rutherford looked appalled hes one of the best drivers i ever worked with thats how he died behind a steering wheel a group of joggers sped by rutherford stepped farther toward the bushes trying to get out of hearing range of anyone on the path sharp weapons bladed ones rutherford asked thats the pattern up close and intimate except for the attacks against jamie and me but at the time of the first one you were retired out of the game why would anyone attack you maybe somebody found out who was set to inherit global protective services jamie said maybe that couldnt be allowed to happen cavanaugh looked around the park arent you nervous being out here in the open every morning protectors are the ones getting killed not fbi agents but now that youve paid a visit we werent followed after last may its no secret were friends hey so far so good nobodys made a move against us while weve been talking jamie said im not consoled at first i thought this was a client from my past trying to keep me from revealing something incriminating that i happened to learn cavanaugh said then when i realized how many toprate gps operators had been killed i figured this was an attack directed at the companyto put it out of business or to get even for an assassination or a kidnapping that we prevented but now attacks this widespread youre assuming this is whos got the money the organization and the determination rutherford asked the bureau believes its a terrorist network taking out key security personnel and trying to intimidate the others so were not prepared for another major assault protectors are trained to be shields not targets presumably the bad guys figure our protective divisions will be so busy looking over their shoulders that they wont be able to do their jobs its a hell of a distraction cavanaugh agreed hell might be appropriate in this case the southern baptist said got any leads every extreme faction in every country who hates us take your pick these days there are plenty to choose from and as for possible ultimate targets plenty to choose from there also for starters the president wed better keep moving worried about directional microphones cavanaugh pointed toward a street next to the park where traffic accumulated over there next to the refreshing smell of automobile exhaust and the noise of car engines jamie asked hey whats the harm in a few precautions youre going to ruin this place for me rutherford complained they increased speed toward the street how did the government protectors die cavanaugh asked sniper rifles remotecontrolled bombs car ambushes no bladed weapons a few but no pattern nothing like what happened to your gps operators then why was gps singled out for that kind of weapon jamie wondered last night when i was studying the printouts of my former missions cavanaugh breathed quickly as he ran i couldnt find any client who might want to kill me because of things i knew about him but the idea of knives reminded me of somebody who rutherford asked a former gps agent can you use your bureau resources to get a profile of a man named carl duran and while youre at it do a deep background check on gerald brockman kim lee and ali karim but arent they the top officers in gps somethings wrong there maybe its got nothing to do with whats going on or maybe its got everything to do with it either way i need to find out whos carl duran jamie asked lying next to cavanaugh on a motel bed bad news preoccupied cavanaugh removed the magazine from his pistol and pulled back the slide letting jamie see that the firing chamber was empty clear clear he pressed the release lever causing the slide to snap forward then as was the habit of many operators he practiced raising the pistol and lining up its sights it was the equivalent of fingering worry beads carl duran and i went through delta force training together jamie was propped against pillows the same as cavanaugh was she removed the magazine from her handgun then pulled back the slide clear clear she too practiced aiming the pistol came with a widenotched rear sight that had a white dot on either side to encourage focusing the front post had a similar easytodistinguish white dot that made sighting easy some people have a misguided notion about specialoperations personnel cavanaugh said they think were beerswilling barbrawlers they dont understand that what our trainers are looking for is discipline and control and anybody who acts like a thug when hes offduty doesnt meet those requirements in fact the best operators are amazingly well mannered theyve been conditioned to unleash massive amounts of violence theyve also been conditioned to have a mental onoff switch and to turn on that switch only when its appropriate when theyre not working its essential to remain calm and carl duran didnt he almost got kicked off delta force what was his problem special operators are attracted to the profession because they enjoy the rush of taking risks you might even say theyre addicted to it they crave the satisfaction of knowing they were in danger and had the strength and determination to survive cavanaugh thought a moment remembering carl special operators are also attracted to the profession because they like the reinforcement of belonging to an elite group theres no place for a grandstander in a specialops unit as the old joke goes theres no i in team for most special operators the bond they feel for their group is greater than what they feel for their family they get a powerful satisfaction from knowing that they and their teammates survived unimaginable dangers that theyre among the most special human beings in the world and that they can count on each other for support even if it comes to dying for each other carl duran was a grandstander he wanted to prove he was better than anybody else for him everything was a contestnot with himself which is the way delta wants it but with everybody in his unit he had to be superior the best operator the best gunfighter and he had to make sure everybody knew it even when he was a kid he acted that way jamie quit aiming her pistol and looked at him you make it sound like i went to high school with him in iowa but you told me you were raised in oklahoma until my dad beat my mom and me once too often and she took me and left him eventually we landed in iowa city where she got paralegal training went to work for an attorney and married him how is it we need to be running for our lives before you tell me about your past why should i talk about what i want to forget your stepfather wasnt kind to you either he didnt know how to react to a child he was a better husband than he was a father lets put it this way he disapproved of mistakes and in his eyes i made a lot of mistakes but he didnt raise his voice he didnt beat me he didnt beat my mother or the daughter my mom and he had by comparison with what wed been through he was a saint i was grateful that he gave us a home still am even so i did my best to stay out of his way when it came to sternness though nothing could equal carls father that guy was a pusher in his youth carls father played football for the university of iowa in iowa few things are as important as college sports carls father had ambitions to be a pro quarterback might have done it too to hear him tell it he was a fantastic athlete but he broke his leg in a game in his junior year it crippled him and he never got over the bitterness so the old man decided that carl by god was going to be the pro quarterback in the family he pushed carl and pushed him until carl was so determined to please his father that he needed to prove he was better than anybody else on the west high team needed to prove he knew more than the coach needed to prove he was smarter and tougher than anybody and proved it so well that the coach kicked him off the team so carls father beat the hell out of him and sued the school and what a mess jamie said it got worse carls father was a stockbroker he was also a secret drinker finally he got better at one than the other and his company fired him the drinking problem got so bad that the family was forced to sell their house they moved to an apartment then they moved out of state trying for a new start and was it successful eventually word came back that carls father died from liver disease carl never went to college he certainly never had a chance for that profootball career but while we went to high school together he and i were friends i dont understand why you thought about him in connection with whats happening jamie said carl had a thing about knives jamie looked at him knives this was before those two kids shot up that high school in colorado and suddenly every school had a zerotolerance policy about bringing anything that might be a weapon onto campus carl was obsessed about knives he carried one in his pocket every day he went to school or under his sweater or in his knapsack he showed them to me when nobody was looking once he even hid one under his uniform when he was playing football and this was your friend its hard to explain we lived on the same street cavanaughs memory was painful hafor drive he was the first kid i met when my mother and i moved to my stepfathers house there was a soccer field at the end of the street woods a creek carl and i used to play in those woods a lot he didnt like to go home neither did i the thing about a friendship is once its formed you get used to how your friend behaves no matter how strange he acts you think its normal you mean the knives folders fixed blades utility knives tactical knives fishing knives skinning knives carl and i had jobs delivering for one of the local morning newspapers the gazette this was before newspapers decided it was safer and cheaper to have adults deliver them by throwing them from cars my stepfather insisted i put the money i earned in a bank account but carls fatherat the time i thought this was coollet carl spend his money however he wanted i didnt think the knives themselves were cool the truth is they made me nervous but carls father was really pleased with the knives as if they proved carl was macho enough to have a chance at being a profootball player so carl played with knives and because he was my friend i joined him we had contests to see how fast we could pull them from our pockets and open them we practiced throwing them we imagined scenarios in which we saved somebodys life with one then carl discovered in a knife magazine that a top knife maker lived right outside town on a farm near a place called west liberty youre talking about a hammer and anvil and forge jamie asked the oldtime real deal one day carl showed up at my house to say that hed phoned this knife maker and convinced the old guy to teach us how to forge blades he was more excited than id ever seen him so i thought what the hell ill go along and see what its like my mom wound up driving us every sunday afternoon it turned out that the old knife maker belonged to something called the american bladesmith society he had the rank of master a big deal when you realize there are only about ninety masters in the world making knives was the old mans life his name was lance sawyer the first time i heard it i thought that name was hilarious a knife expert whose name was lance he was seventyfive years old he wore bib overalls he was stooped and scrawny and bald and had brown tobacco juice on his white beard but his arms were as muscular and strong as anybodys ive ever seen for a year and a half until carls father moved the family out of state carl and i learned how to stoke a forge how to use a hammer and an anvil to shape a blade how to cool the metal and then do the reverse heattempering it the old man made us use leaf springs from old pickup trucks as our rough material it was hard heavy work my arms used to ache all week but i must say we turned out some awfully finelooking knives did you continue the lessons after carl moved away for a while but it wasnt the same without carls enthusiasm and then the old man died i wasnt there but i heard he keeled over in the middle of hammering a blade went out happy doing what he liked cavanaugh smiled wistfully to himself after that i went to the university of iowa im pretty sure my stepfather wanted me to be what he was an attorney but i surprised him and my mom by leaving school before my first year ended and joining the military that hatredofbullies thing i told you about eventually i got into delta force cavanaugh paused and not long after carl showed up jamie whod resumed aiming her pistol now stopped and looked at him again seems a hell of a coincidence dont you think except it wasnt a coincidence from bits and pieces of what carl told me i eventually realized what happened as his fathers alcoholism got worse and the familys fortunes disintegrated carl kept looking back on iowa city and his friendship with me and the lessons with the old knife maker as the best time of his life he never went to college as his father planned he never played football he never had a chance for the big career his father wanted for him he used to phone me a lot the calls always felt as if they came from a ghost i didnt talk long then one day he phoned and my mother told him i was in the army as near as i can figure he joined the army shortly afterward i realize now that he was hoping to get stationed with me and continue the ideal friendship he imagined we had he kept following my career taking specialops training eventually trying to get into delta force as he knew i had suddenly one day there he was at the fort bragg delta compound i turned from completing a training exercise and saw him grinning at me that was one of the few times in my life when somebody took me totally by surprise creepy jamie said its like he was stalking you yeah and it didnt help that the other delta operators associated him with me when he got too competitive i could sense they wanted me to tell him to cool it but carl was in competition with me more than anyone he wasnt about to let me give him advice he knew enough to be a team player when it came to our missions one time in iraq in the first gulf war he saved my life i made up for that by saving his life in bosnia the knives though he couldnt stop his fixation on the knives in an effort to buy the teams friendship he even went to the trouble of making tactical folders for everybody but then he sabotaged any good will he created our team went on a mission to the philippines to retrieve an american diplomat whod been kidnapped by terrorists carl was supposed to take out an enemy sentry using a soundsuppressed pistol instead he crawled up to the guy and killed him with a knife almost jeopardized the assignment later after we extracted the diplomat our co was furious carl claimed his pistol malfunctioned he said his only option was to take out the sentry handtohand the co seemed to accept his explanation but carl never got sent on another mission and three months later he was dismissed from the unit so how did he get hired by global protective services cavanaugh hesitated after duncan retired from delta force and set up his business carl came to me asking if id put in a good word even if it was sometimes strained the friendship was there hed never done anything against me to the contrary hed kept me from coming home in a body bag maybe his pistol had malfunctioned on that extraction assignment for sure his courage was never in doubt duncan and i talked about it duncan tried him on some lowlevel assignments no problem some midlevel assignments again no problem then carl and i got assigned to protect a teenage female rock star who was getting death threats from a fan the rock star was dating a sports celebrity and the fan got jealous i notice you havent told me her name when cavanaugh mentioned who she was jamie nodded yeah a knockout the kind that flashes a lot of skin but claims to be a virgin you can see how this nutcase fan felt conflicted the singer had the money for a fullscale nineoperator team including two female agents made up to look like her which is really twentyseven operators divided in shifts of three jamie did some rapid arithmetic thats a budget for some third world countries then the police caught a man they were sure was the stalker he even confessed to get attention jamie said anticipating where cavanaugh was going but the real stalker came at her after shed reduced the protection detail to five operators it happened outside her hotel i was the agent in charge i tried to convince her to use a hotel that had an underground parking garage so she could get into her limousine where there werent any crowds no anonymous car for her jamie said exactly she needed to see her fans she told me and they needed to see her it was great publicity she said entertainment tonight wanted to show her interacting bravely with her admirers so we came out of the hotel trying to part the crowd i never would have agreed to the setup if i hadnt believed what the police told methat they had the stalker we moved in a standard square formation two agents in back two in front the singer was in the middle with me next to her the deal was if somebody came at her i was to shield her with my body and get her into the hotel or into the limo whichever was closer meanwhile the rest of the team was to surround us to provide a barrier between her and the stalker and make sure he wasnt acting alone the idea was to protect the client first and disable the attacker second so when this man charged out of the crowd thrusting a knife at her i went into my covering mode the rest of the team formed a ring as we backed toward the hotel and that son of a bitch carl broke ranks to have a knife fight with the guy what yeah there they were in front of the plaza hotel a couple of thousand fans a ton of tv cameras everybody screaming as the team and i hurried the singer back into the hotel and carls out there showing the guy how the business end of a knife works flash flash slash before the stalker died i bet he was astonished by the enormous quantity of blood he lost carl was standing over the trembling corpse meanwhile the crowds in a panic and the tv cameras are taking it all in getting carls face in closeup a little too much recognition factor for someone in the protection business the grand jury called it a justified killing carl claimed that the guy was coming at him to drop him and get through to the client no choice carl said privately the members of the team knew that was bullshit we knew carl was so highly trained he could have disarmed and disabled the guy before the situation got lethal he killed the guy because he wanted to have a knife fight jamie said cavanaugh nodded not that it was much of a knife fight but yeah im sure that was half his motive and the other half were trained not to look at our clients when were protecting them the idea is to watch away from them to see if theres a threat coming but i noticed carl giving the singer glances checking her out enjoying the view i think the knife fight was carls way of trying to impress her to earn a permanent gig protecting her did he get what he wanted what he got was fired and this time when he begged me to put in a good word to persuade duncan to rehire him i told him to go to hell the friendship had been strained for a long time that broke it i wanted nothing to do with him even on a professional basis because as far as i was concerned hed stopped being dependable i wasnt the only operator who felt that way no reputable protection agency would hire him the last i heard he was working for a colombian drug lord but now you think hes back whoever arranged for all those protective agents to be killed with sharp weapons couldnt have done it without a thorough knowledge of how the protection business works combine that with a knife obsession and you get carl duran jamie said maybe it wasnt the female rock singer he was trying to impress with the knife fight not her who else would he you he has to assume youve made the connection between him and the blade attacks hell hunt you as hard as he can part five the iron mistress rutherford almost drove past the place before he noticed it it was in a seedy section of alexandria virginia a locale so unexpected that he was sure hed misunderstood the address hed been given but then he looked harder and spotted the hideaway motel between a massage parlor and a pornvideo shop shaking his head at what he hoped wasnt a practical joke he turned left at the next intersection he went up and down several streets at random and watched his rearview mirror to check if he was being followed finally he headed back to the motel and steered into its lot where he parked next to a dumpster and knocked on a door winos drug dealers and gang members watched as it opened and jamie smiled stepping in rutherford surveyed the grimy floor cracked mirror and sunken mattress years of cigarette smoke permeated the walls he nodded to cavanaugh who stood behind the door ready with his pistol in case rutherford had unfriendly escorts homey rutherford said nobody here thinks its strange if we pay with cash instead of a credit card jamie said locking the door they probably think youre a hooker as long as we dont leave a paper trail i dont even care if they think im a lobbyist jamie pointed toward a thick manila envelope rutherford held what did you learn gerald brockman made several disastrous investments he borrowed money to buy on margin when the market collapsed he needed to pay off the loans basically hes broke so when duncan was killed brockman might have hoped hed inherit global protective services cavanaugh said except he had reason to suspect someone named aaron stoddard was set to inherit maybe he decided that getting rid of stoddard would move him to the front of the line whos aaron stoddard me cavanaugh said thats my real name words getting around fast enough you might as well be in on the secret your real name from time to time it does a person good to be somebody else not me im still trying to figure out how to be john rutherford what did you learn about kim lee jamie asked she has a drug problem what two years ago she fractured a spinal disc during a martialarts competition now shes addicted to bigtime painkillers like oxycontin so many pills a day that she needs a blackmarket supply but she never gave the slightest indication some dont if her stash runs out though shell give you plenty of indication when she climbs the walls during withdrawal its as bad as trying to withdraw from heroin someone wanting information about global protective services could blackmail her to supply it what about ali karim so far he appears to be squeaky clean for a change good news cavanaugh said and what about carl duran as you mentioned after he got fired from gps he worked as the director of security for a colombian drug lord rutherford paused for emphasis until two years ago what happened then he disappeared cavanaugh frowned you mean his boss suddenly mistrusted him and had him killed no theres not even a hint of that weve got an informant who says carl was considered irreplaceable he was so furious about the way legitimate protectors turned against him that he went in the opposite direction and made the drug lords security the best in the business he even got his pilots license so he could handle the drug lords private jet in an emergency then one day he was gone did your informant say if anything unusual happened before carl disappeared as a matter of fact he said the compound had a visitor the newcomer was so important that the cartels leader went out to meet the helicopter any idea who he was not by name but even after two years the informant remembers what he looked like hard to believe jamie said not when you hear the description the guy was in his forties with a mustache solidly built intense eyes dark complexion serious expression doesnt help us he came from iraq rutherford said iraq cavanaugh repeated in surprise yeah they dont see a lot of guys from that part of the world paying visits to drugcartel compounds in south america rutherford said at least they didnt before nine eleven jamie looked mystified rutherford explained after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon we started the indepth investigation we should have been doing all along extreme religious terrorist groups figure that because were corrupt depraved infidels theyll attack us through our corruption a lot of terrorist funding comes through proceeds from prostitution and drugs drugs a reason to pay attention to kim jamie said the stranger spent a lot of time talking to carl rutherford continued the next morning carl and the newcomer were gone so carl was recruited because of his deep understanding of how the legitimate security community works cavanaugh said but he cant be doing this on his own too many agents have died he cant be everywhere he needs help trained help like the team who attacked us in jackson hole jackson hole youd better bring me up to speed on that cavanaugh told rutherford about the incident the men i shot turned out to have been released from prison all within the past six weeks they were each in a different prison and it doesnt seem theyd ever met before they were convicted so what brought them together after they were released rutherford wanted to know maybe the right word is who brought them together cavanaugh answered and how did carl change them so rapidly that in six weeks they became operators instead of thugs shots echoed through the swamp explosions rumbled even wearing ear protectors raoul heard the concussions as bowie shook him yelled obscenities and spun him three times one way then the other raoul wanted to push back to shout at bowie and knock him to the ground but he didnt act on the impulse because he knew the purpose was to disorient him and get his adrenaline flowing bowie shoved his face close to raouls screaming four bad guys ran into this building they have automatic weapons they have hostages no time to negotiate theres a bomb set to explode in thirty seconds itll level the block get in there kill the bad guys save the hostages and shut off the bomb move with a force that snapped raouls teeth together bowie pushed him into the building it was actually a maze of walls without a roof but raouls emotions were so engaged he imagined it was a building he was vaguely aware of bowie rushing behind him but all raoul paid attention to was the pistol he drew from his holster a target popping up a man with a gun shooting him crouching peering around a corner another target a man with a gun an elderly woman next to him shooting the man pivoting another target popping up a woman holding a baby bowie yelling shes got a gun in the blanket shoot her ignoring the voice rushing forward a guy with an assault rifle popping up shooting him the fourth guy where was the fourth guy where was the bomb peering around another corner a kid popping up a priest popping up pivoting in search of the fourth guy realizing the priest had a gun ducking turning shooting him seeing a metal box on the ground rushing over flipping the off switch and suddenly noticing how fast his heart was pounding how sweatsoaked his clothes were trembling he looked up from the box seeing bowie and a couple of students grin at him three seconds before the bomb would have blown bowie said every bad guy down no hostages lost you spotted the trick with the priest very good mr ramirez thanks raouls voice was unsteady remembering to add sir the emotional involvement in navigating a shooting house amazed him outside as more shots and explosions rumbled from the swamp he watched bowie approach more students mr ferguson youre next the tall redhaired twentyyearold didnt look enthusiastic lets go mr ferguson bowie pushed him beginning the disorientation process he shook him cursed spun him yelled orders and shoved him into the shooting house so hard that ferguson nearly fell raoul and the students whod passed the exercise followed bowie ferguson shot the first bad guy and the second ignored the old woman shot the third gunman saw the woman holding the infant pivoted in search of another target and heard bowie yell shes got a gun in the blanket he fired three times into the target you missed bowie yelled shoot her shoot her ferguson emptied the rest of his magazine into the target he did a rapid reload hurried on ignored the priest and ran to the metal box flicking the off switch looking up in triumph he frowned when he didnt receive the approving looks he expected mr ferguson it appears youre a menace to society bowie said what are you talking about i shut off the bomb didnt i youd have been dead before you reached it that guy in the white collar would have dropped you the priest give me a break hes not a priest how the hell do you know that the gun in his hand what gun ferguson groaned when he took a closer look even if you had shot him and disabled the bomb it wouldnt have been any consolation to the woman and baby you killed that wasnt a baby the woman had a gun in the blanket no but you told me i made a mistake you lied to me i tested you this is bullshit no mr ferguson its an exercise in discipline and control qualities you apparently lack ferguson seemed about to raise his gun bowie drew his knife from his pocket ferguson stared at the knife and took his hand off his pistol i didnt come here to get bossed like i was still in the joint no you came here for a twothousanddollar signing fee and three thousand a month plus room board and training what good is the cash if i cant spend it anywhere would you prefer to leave mr ferguson does it show all these damned mosquitoes if i stay any longer ill get malaria or some fucking thing bowie turned from ferguson and faced raoul his tone hard mr ramirez raoul was taken by surprise yes sir after your next class report to my office as raoul crossed the packed earth of the compounds parade ground he tried not to gaze around in continuing wonder at the sundrenched encampment dense bushes and trees formed the perimeter to his left were two wooden barracks mounted on stilts beyond students shot at moving vehicles or learned to storm a building others practiced handtohand combat while still others learned how to handle knives raoul had no idea where all this was headed but he knew that he couldnt be happier guns movies video games the only thing missing was booze and women almost heaven and he was getting paid for it the weight of the pistol on his waist the sense that he was doing something important and doing it wellthese brought a straightness to his posture a fullness to his chest he heard an instructor shout when you catch your enemy from behind and pull back his head dont try to slit his throat you might cut your hand grab his chin and mouth so he cant scream yank his head back stab a kidney thats the killing stroke a kidney almost instant renal failure pausing outside a corrugatedmetal shed raoul heard the clang of a hammer against metal he had no idea why bowie wanted to see him his elation at having done well in the shooting house was replaced by confusion about the argument between bowie and ferguson and what it had to do with him the hammers angry clang became rapid and insistent when raoul mustered the resolve to knock the noise abruptly stopped come in according to the bible cain had many descendants one of whom was the first to forge iron carl enjoyed that idea just as he enjoyed the notion that hephaestus the son of zeus was also supposed to have been the first to forge metal the armorer of the gods it was an interesting parallel for hephaestuss skill with a hammer and an anvil had an effect as terrible and longlasting as cains murder of abel the greek gods most ingenious creation was an elaborately engraved metal box that contained every evil and disease the box was given to the seductress pandora and when she opened it she released war pestilence famine and a host of other darknesses only one evil did not escape before pandora closed the box cruel seductive hope carl wore gloves a canvas apron and safety glasses through their dense lenses he watched the burning coke in his forge the thick strip of steel beginning to glow the requisite orange color while he worked the bellows heating the metal for exactly the right amount of time and at the necessary temperature he used tongs to remove it from the forge and set it on his anvil with his powerful right arm he wielded a hammer pounding the steel into submission flattening shaping the forges heat softened the metal making it malleable allowing him to impose his will upon it clang aaron clang aaron bittersweet memories seized him the rhythmic highpitched din of the hammer on the anvil sounded to him like ricochets like screams of pain he pounded harder then sensed another sound and turned toward the door where someone had knocked come in the door slowly opened raoul stepped apprehensively into shadows that were dissipated by the glow of the forge come closer i want to show you something carl said raoul did what he was told the knife im working on is named after the one the first jim bowie carried youve made the connection bowie the bowie knife raoul showed that hed absorbed one of the lessons carl had taught himto admit what he didnt know ive never heard of it its the most famous knife of all time bowie was a land speculator along the mississippi a knife fighter an adventurer he died with crockett and travis at the alamo in he used a knife to kill one man and wound another in whats known as the sandbar duel nobodys certain what bowies knife actually looked like the one im making is based on a design from a movie called the iron mistress alan ladd played bowie but the knife was the true star it was later used in other movies walt disneys davy crockett and john waynes the alamo when you see the beauty of the finished product you wont be able to take your eyes off it a whole generation of knife makers was inspired to take up the craft because of this knife carl remembered the first time hed seen the iron mistress the old knife maker had taped it off television and lent the video to aaron and him the start of the movie was boring alan ladd in frilly clothes trying to make virginia mayo fall in love with him he and aaron had hooted at the television but then ladd went to a blacksmith and showed him a wooden model of a knife he wanted made the blacksmith got all excited and said he had a piece of a meteorite that he would melt and add to the metal the knife would have a bit of heaven he said and a bit of hell in the next scene the knife was finished it flew through the air and stuck into a post it had a long wide blade the elegant curving lines of which made aaron and him shout cool the handle was black wood with a brass cap it had bowies name engraved in ivory and set into the handle it had a silver guard and a brass strip on the back of the blade the purpose of the brass strip baffled aaron and him until they asked the old knife maker about it and he explained that it protected the knifes owner during a fight since brass was softer that steel it snagged an attackers blade and kept the edge from slipping down the back of the knife and cutting whoever held it aaron and he watched the best parts of the movie again and again there were all kinds of knife fights especially one in a dark room during a lightning storm blades flashing a bit of heaven and a bit of hell but then the movie itself went to hell when alan ladd felt guilty about all the men hed killed and threw the iron mistress into the mississippi carl came back from his memory pay attention he told raoul the blade has to be carefully cooled raoul concentrated as carl used tongs to set the long wide strip into a metal container of olive oil that had been one of the old knife makers jokesto use olive oil to cool metal and then pour the oil over a salad but contrary to the way it was depicted in movies carl didnt put the glowing knife in tip first rather he set the knife in lengthwise so that the oil didnt touch the back of the blade the oil hissed after a few moments carl lifted the knife slightly so that the oil cooled only the blades edge vapor rose the smell like a hot oiled frying pan before a steak was added after another few moments carl removed the knife and set it on the anvil people who dont know anything about forging think the entire knife has to be plunged into the liquid carl explained that could destroy the blade because sudden cooling has only one purposeto produce hardness in the metal a blade thats been hardened one hundred percent shatters if you strike it against something instead the cooling needs to be done in stages here at the edge of the blade i cooled it the longest because i want the edge to be hard enough to retain its sharpness i cooled the middle of the blade for less time because i want it somewhat pliant as well as hard and as for the back of the blade i didnt subject it to any sudden cooling because i want it even more pliant pliant capable of bending under stress carl paused hoping raoul would demonstrate his intelligence by asking the appropriate question at last he did i can understand why the blade needs to be hard to be sharp but why does the back need to bend in order to be certified a master a knife maker must produce a blade that passes four tests first the blade must be sharp enough to cut through a oneinch freehanging rope with a single stroke second the blade must be hard and sharp enough to chop through a pair of twobyfours third it must still retain sufficient sharpness to shave hair off the knife makers arm finally it must be pliant enough to be placed in a vice and bent ninety degrees without snapping the only way to meet all of these requirements is to cool different parts of the blade for different amounts of time the hard edge supplies the sharpness the pliant back supplies the give otherwise the knife snaps raoul thought about it and nodded can you be like this knife carl asked ill be anything you want me to be the door to the shed banged open raoul flew backward through the opening and landed hard on the packed earth carl stormed after him and kicked his side sending him rolling at the nearest firing range students sensed the commotion and turned seeing carl kick raoul again and roll him farther across the parade ground nobody talks to me like that pack your stuff carl shouted raoul came to a crouch barely avoided another kick and lurched toward one of the barracks carl stalked toward the students at the firing range ferguson you too im sick of your sloppiness get your stuff im driving you and that other asshole out of here but now carl twisted fergusons pistol from his hand and shoved him away you said you wanted out youre out do i keep the clothes you gave me and the money that was the deal wasnt it i honor my word even if you dont honor yours move you and that other prick have five minutes as ferguson ran toward the barracks carl turned in a fury toward a pickup truck in front of the administration building he pulled keys from his pocket started the truck and made so fast a turn that dirt flew he sped toward the barracks made another sharp turn and skidded to a stop waiting for ferguson and raoul raoul got there first holding his knapsack get in the back damn it carl yelled as raoul climbed into the uncovered cargo space ferguson arrived with a duffel bag breathing heavily inside carl commanded before ferguson could shut the door behind him carl sped away tearing up more dirt youre sure you got all your stuff carl demanded i want to keep my part of the bargain quit trying to make me feel like a pieceofshit quitter ferguson said isnt that what you are who wants to put up with the bugs and the heat and the fucking humidity obviously not you and the snakes and the spiders and the damned rain most afternoons and trying to sleep while those jerkoffs play those stupid video games bang bang bang my ears havent stopped ringing since i came here you knew from the getgo you were being paid to learn about guns i know about guns yeah right ive seen the way you shoot and you didnt tell me id have to clean the damned guns after i shot them and you didnt tell me id be humping heavy packs and crawling through swamps and i might as well have joined the stupid army everybody telling me what to do this is worse than when i was in the joint not hardly carl stared at the scars on his hands and where the hell are we anyhow how close to the nearest city i want to get back to chicago hang around with the guys find some action get laid man that would be different wanting sex too much is what got you in prison carl said maybe you should stick with guns just answer the question how close is the nearest city ferguson demanded an hour and its not a city its a town what why didnt we fly out of here thats how you brought me into this mess youre not worth the price of aviation fuel buddy you want to know a secret you were part of a great experiment living in a swamp some experiment about visualization whatever that means first i show you how to do somethingshoot use a knife whatever then i make you close your eyes and repeatedly imagine doing what i showed you i reinforce it by making you watch accurate movies of what i demonstrated hollywood stars doing things so smoothly you want to be those stars finally i tell you to do what you imagined in the movie in your mind the truck hit a bump carl heard it jostle raoul in back the military discovered that by using visualization a fourweek course could be reduced to three days carl said its a form of selfhypnosis reinforced by the video games yeah well ive been here three weeks how come it didnt work on me nobodys perfect you want to know another secret a long time ago this used to be a plantation whats that got to do with anything drive faster then the plantation went bust and the owners tried to keep the land in the family and finally a private foundation bought it as a nature preserve tears man youre boring me to then the cia took over the foundation and all this land cia finally got your attention strictly speaking not the cia it was a company that worked for a company that worked for the company they call it compartmentalizing the risk plausible deniability i call it yawning man the whole point was to build a private airstrip that hardly anybody knew about see to fly what youd call spies into hot spots in those days central america had a lot of those yawn man the truck hit another bump the cia couldnt just pop their people onto a united jet and fly them to el salvador or nicaragua theyd leave whats called a paper trail you know what i call it ferguson made an obscene gesture so this company that worked for the company made up its own airline and flew its people out of here straight across the gulf to where the action was gulf of mexico ferguson looked interested were near mexico but then times changed and the hot spots moved to other countries and the company that worked for the company didnt have any more use for this place besides it had started to attract attention so they sold it to some drug smugglers theyd been working with drug smugglers now ferguson was really interested sure the spy business is based on you scratch my back ill scratch yours the same as any other business the spies had been working with the drug smugglers getting tactical information from them using them for cover giving the spies an excuse to go in and out of various countries via secret airstrips if youre a drug smuggler nobody questions why youre so secretive but if people think youre a spy youre in trouble so when it came time to get rid of the airstrip it made sense to sell it to the smugglers who were already using it but eventually the smugglers decided to switch locations too and the place was rotting until we bought it yeah ferguson said rotting step on it would you cant carl drove slower what are you doing stopping to take a leak man cant you hold it till we get to town you want me to hold it for an hour carl gave him a get real look and steered to the side of the road he stepped out and went down a slope to the edge of the swamp under deceptively attractive spanish mossit was always bug infestedhe undid his fly and urinated into the algaecovered water ferguson banged the truck door open stepped sullenly to the spongy earth and walked to the water fumbling at his fly carl finished relieving himself shook lingering drops from his penis pulled up his zipper and asked ferguson you want to make a bet three shots roared crimson blossomed on fergusons shirt blood erupted from his face he dropped on his back thrashing the shots echoed across the water carl turned toward where raoul on cue had shot from the back of the truck under carls loose shirt he had a colt commander if raoul had delayed carl would have drawn his pistol in a continuation of zipping up his fly shooting both of them raoul looked pale the darks of his eyes were huge obviously despite all his bravado he had never killed anyone before better distract him carl thought very good mr ramirez two shots to the body and one to the head why were you taught that pattern raoul had to switch to a different section of his thoughts uh he looked confused his need to seek approval became greater than the shock of his emotions uh the target might be wearing a kevlar vest so i also shot him in the head your instructor explained that no raoul continued to look confused i just figured that was the reason it is the reason your intuition is excellent did you do what i told you and sit with your head against the back window yes you heard what i said about the cia yes then you understand the necessity for what i ordered you to do there are serious issues at stake that im not allowed to reveal to you not yet but the targets lack of discipline would have made him talk about our camp he would have destroyed us using his shoe carl shoved the body into the scummy water immediately an alligator erupted snapping at the head jerking the body under the surface a second alligator fought for the corpses right leg blood swirled amid the green scum when i set up the camp carl explained i drove here once a day urinated into the water then threw raw steaks in after a while the alligators learned to identify food with the sound of the truck my footsteps and urine streaming into the water now those signals bring them here for dinner the turmoil in the water subsided after the frantic splashing of jaws and tails birds again sang pleasing carl raoul picked up his empty cartridges get rid of his duffel bag carl said raoul took a chain from the back of the truck shoved it into the bag and hurled it into the water quick sharp obedient carl said raouls eyes brightened im going to pull you from the group carl decided no what did i do wrong the reverse you and a select few are coming with me to do what hunt an old friend waking slowly cavanaugh felt as exhausted as when hed gone to sleep with jamie next to him he reached to put his arm around her discovered that she wasnt there and opened his eyes focusing on where she sat at the cigaretteburned table in their seedy motel rooms corner she wore a tshirt and boxer shorts her brunette hair hanging over her shoulders she didnt notice that hed wakened too preoccupied rereading the documents rutherford had given them you talked in your sleep she said so im wrong he thought she did notice i was awake oh what did i say how much wood could a woodchuck chuck well thats a relief for a second i was afraid i said another womans name you did mumble something about ramona my thirdgrade math teacher cavanaugh pointed toward the documents have you learned anything didnt you tell me carls father died from alcoholism liver disease thats what carl said in a phone call to me when i was still living at home according to this police report his father stumbled while he was drunk fell on a knife in the kitchen and bled to death in the middle of the night numbed cavanaugh didnt react for a moment he got out of bed ignored the cold air on his bare legs and went over to her she indicated the bottom of a page cavanaugh read the passage and felt colder the police report says carl found the body in the morning since he knew for certain how his father died why did he tell me it was liver failure jamie looked up you think carl finally got tired of his father picking on him he might have told you the cause of death was liver disease because that was an easy explanation but bleeding to death from a knife wound knowing carls obsession with knives you might have started wondering how old were you when he made that phone call i was still in high school my senior year young to start to be a killer if his father was his first cavanaugh said the room became silent what do you mean thinking about those days i suddenly remember things but im seeing them in an entirely different way what things our neighbor had an irish setter named toby my stepfather was too buttoned down to allow a pet in the house but the neighbor didnt mind if i played with toby so i sort of had a dog the summer before my senior year the dog ran away the neighbor phoned the pet shelter no sign of the dog nobody ever found him a couple of neighborhood cats ran away that summer also didnt anybody think there might be a pattern if anybody did i never heard about it anyway there was a lot going on that summer carls dad was fired in august the family needed to move meanwhile i was excited about beginning my senior year at west high and to tell the truth carl demanded i spend so much time with him that i was relieved to see him go so he practiced killing animals before he graduated to killing his father or maybe what are you thinking jamie asked do you suppose carl killed other people before he mustered enough rage to go after his father nashville tennessee rutherford asked thats where carls father took the family after losing his stock brokers job in iowa city cavanaugh explained can you arrange for someone to investigate a rash of missing animals or stabbings while carl was there they sat at a corner table at a truck stop near alexandria virginia cavanaugh and rutherford drank coffee while jamie dug into a cheeseandham omelet with hash browns stabbings rutherford frowned homeless people drifters backalley drunks the sort of victims who wouldnt be missed and didnt look like they could defend themselves this guy sounds scarier and scarier rutherford said maybe you should check iowa city too jamie looked up from her omelet and any other place carl lived and where he was stationed in the military rutherford decided what about ali karim cavanaugh asked did you find anything still seems squeaky clean but global protective services lost another operator last night jamie set down her fork frank tamblyn rutherford said i know him cavanaughs voice was stark a former army ranger eight years with gps wife two children dependable always ready to be the first operator out the door to check if its okay for a client to leave a building apparently he loved to bowl why is that important last night he got in his car to drive to a bowling tournament afterward around midnight he returned to his car he probably checked it for explosives not that it matters when he got behind the steering wheel a springloaded knife burst from under the dash and hit him in the groin there werent any trip wires so he wouldnt have spotted the device it was rigged to a vibration switch death was so rapid the blade must have been coated with poison greenwich village new york kim lee stepped out of a martialarts studio and turned left on bleecker street her cheeks were flushed her eyes intense after two hours of practicing aikido she wore jeans and a blue sweater and carried a gym bag around the corner she came to a cafe that on this notyetchilly october evening still had tables on the sidewalk although most of the customers were inside she sat ordered tea removed a magazine from her bag and settled back to read but she seemed more interested in her surroundings than in her magazine the tea came she tasted a few sips looked around again reached under the table detached something concealed it within her magazine and put the magazine in her bag she paid for the tea and continued down the street glancing behind her as she turned a corner no one followed and she soon fell into a comfortable pace her cheeks no longer flushed at her brownstone she took the elevator to the third floor unlocked her apartment stepped in closed the door locked it flicked the light switch and turned toward the living room only to freeze at the sight of cavanaugh and jamie how did you get in here picked the lock cavanaugh said maybe youre like a physician who forgets to have a yearly medical exam or an accountant whos too busy to balance her own check book what are you talking about for someone who works at a security company you dont pay much attention to your personal security cavanaugh said you should phone gps and order a technician to install an intruderdetection system right ill do that just as soon as i call the police kim picked up the phone good idea jamie said im sure theyll want to know whats in your gym bag gym bag blackmarket prescription drugs probably oxycontin kim stared at the cafe they were taped under the table you used jamie said this isnt funny kim scratched her arms with so many operators getting killed arent you worried about walking around in the open maybe if i were an operator but there doesnt seem to be a bounty on computer specialists kim set down the phone she picked up the gym bag and headed toward the bathroom time for another pill jamie asked kim didnt answer im told getting off oxy is a nightmare cavanaugh said or maintaining your addiction when you cant find any more doctors to write prescriptions for you and you need to turn to dealers cavanaugh gestured toward the living room which was sparsely furnished only a lamp a canvas chair and a small television not even a rug been selling things to feed your habit since were being so candid why dont i stop the charade of going into the bathroom the pupils of kims eyes were pinpoints she opened the gym bag and took out a plastic bag that contained a fistsized quantity of white pills with a look of defiance she put two in her mouth and chewed jamie frowned why do you the pills have a timerelease coating so the body absorbs the painkiller over twelve hours cavanaugh explained if you just swallow them you cant get a rush you have to pulverize them and snort them or chew them kim said what the hell do you want gpss assignment records cavanaugh said kim looked baffled you still havent sold the computer in your bedroom cavanaugh told her so why dont you crank it up and get me some information i need thats what this is all about for gods sake why didnt you just come to the office to do this the last time i went to the office i almost didnt leave it alive i could have given you the information over the phone sure but this way i know the information hasnt been edited you still believe someone at gps cant be trusted me distrust a drug addict perish the thought jamie said you know lady kim said i dont need to take crap from the bosss wife she turned toward cavanaugh you want to fire me do it just get into the gps assignment records cavanaugh told her kims cheeks looked flushed again she went to the bedroom and turned on its light revealing that there was only a mattress on the floor but that a lavish computer setup occupied a desk in a corner cavanaugh went over to the window and closed the draperies against the thickening darkness when kim touched a button on the keyboard the monitor came out of sleep mode jamie stood behind her while kim sank into a chair wincing slightly if youre in that much pain maybe you need to ease off on your martial arts jamie suggested cant give them up just like oxy jamie said you dont know i tried detoxing last spring kim glanced toward cavanaugh supposedly i was in the caribbean on vacation but i was right here i vomited for a week my bones ached my heart raced hot and cold sweats wobbly legs twitching and that was the fun part you tried it on your own had to would anybody at gps have relied on me if word got out id checked myself into a detox clinic go ahead and check yourself into one now cavanaugh said take advantage of our great medical plan kim avoided the subject turning toward jamie you know anything about computers a little jamie lied i know the difference between a big mac and a mac apple always thinking about food cavanaugh said you need to step away while i type in the security codes kim told her dont think so i coown the company i get to see everything kim looked questioningly at cavanaugh i just made her viceceo cavanaugh explained lets see those security codes jamie told her kims fingers flew across the keyboard an elegant blur that made jamie nod in wonder as she watched information flash across the monitor this is brilliant jamie leaned forward seeing security code after security code i never could have hacked this i hope to god not kims fingers kept working the keyboard as you looked for more oxycontin cavanaugh said i dont suppose people ever offered you unlimited quantities in exchange for showing them the codes no cross your heart i guarantee it hard to guarantee not really how do you figure if i had unlimited quantities of oxy in exchange for giving the bad guys information kims fingers kept flying yes would i be forced to humiliate myself by paying a cheesy drug dealer to stick that plastic bag to the bottom of that table a lousy hundred pills i can go through those in a week she has a point jamie said or maybe thats part of her cover story im into the files tell me what you need kim said all the gps assignments carl duran was on he watched kim intently checking for a hesitation a slight narrowing of her eyes anything that might indicate that the name meant something to her he was fired three years ago does the first name have a c or a k c cavanaugh still detected nothing to suggest that the name was important to her no pursing of the lips no tightening of the cheek muscles in his experience most dopers couldnt repress telltales when they were under stress sorry kim said carl duran doesnt have a file doesnt you must have made a mistake when it involves computers i dont make mistakes but gps always keeps records about former employees kim tapped more keys nope no assignment list no photograph nothing duran must have deleted it jamie said couldnt have at least not on his own only three people know the codes to get that far into the system gerald ali and you cavanaugh said another nasty mark against me right but before you get judgmental again watch this kim tapped more keys the purging was so thorough i cant retrieve durans file but i can search every assignment weve ever had and tell the computer to isolate any that duran worked on kim touched a final key and here you are the printer came to life flipping out pages plenty of trouble at gps kim remarked yes cavanaugh agreed frank tamblyns the latest casualty i mean new trouble the phone rang and im afraid kim said that thisll be more the agent made sure his weapons were in place before leaving his house his semiautomatic on his hip under his suit coat his millimeter subcompact in his ankle holster his tactical folding knife clipped to a pocket concealed by his suit coat and another knife on a breakaway chain around his neck under his shirt uneasy he glanced back toward his wife whose eyes were filled with equal unease as she held their baby boy meg believe me ill be careful but what about us i dont mean to make it seem like the risk youre taking doesnt matter but the baby squirmed under megs left arm he had a slight fever what if whoevers doing this starts attacking not just operators but their families i couldnt bear it if something happened to the baby stay inside keep the doors locked i need to take bobby to the doctor theres a gun on the top shelf in the closet right im going to hold the baby and blast away like in that john woo movie you watched last night where the heros in a nursery in a hospital with kids in his arms and guns in his hands i kind of doubt it why dont you go to your mothers im off this assignment in a week when i get back from new orleans well take a vacation someplace we feel safe wherever that is maybe i should take a pay cut and get a less dangerous job if it was just the two of us what a joke im a security specialist but i cant make my wife feel secure outside a car beeped the taxi listen the clients got his jet waiting hes obsessive about maintaining a schedule ill call you en route to the airport well try to figure a way to handle this meg nodded unconvinced love you he said love you as the taxi drove away the agent glanced back at his house he felt encumbered by his numerous weapons but he knew agents whod responded to the recent attacks by carrying three guns instead of his two he pulled out his cell phone and called headquarters for updates while the phone on the other end buzzed he continued gazing through the taxis rear window toward the third house from the corner the one with the bright flower boxes a huge fireball roared chunks of walls floors windows furniture and bodies spewing from the churning core the neighboring houses burst apart from the force of the blast flaming debris hurtling across the street the taxi wavered to a stop a brick struck the window bursting through but all the agent cared about was shoving the door open lurching onto the street meg he shouted running bobby he felt the heat of the blaze but ignored it charging closer no his shriek threatened to tear his vocal cords nooo kims knuckles whitened as she clutched the phone all the while she listened the shocked look on her face made cavanaugh and jamie remain absolutely still yes ali she said yes i understand she took a breath nothing will help him of course but youre rightwe need to do what we can she set down the phone another agents been killed cavanaugh asked his family kim answered his family jamie looked stunned jim driscoll word about what happened to his wife and child got around fast now our agents are calling their duty officers to say theyre sick we hear the same things happening with the us marshals the secret service and the diplomatic security service only a few so far but the trends not hard to predict why should agents protect strangers when they themselves are the targets and their loved ones those reporting for duty are either unmarried or else insisting on protection for their families while theyre not home they also want twice the operators they normally have on an assignment the systems falling apart kim nervously scratched her arms her brow glistened with sweat through the open bedroom door she saw her gym bag on the living room floor the bag of white pills was on it for a moment cavanaugh thought kim would move toward it his own move was toward the global protective services information that shed printed continuing to stare toward the bag of pills kim asked you think this carl duran has something to do with whats happening cavanaugh took the pages from the printers tray he tried not to allow his emotions to tighten his voice at the moment hes the only lead we have well if youre willing to allow a doper to help kim turned from staring at the pills well all see if we notice anything they slid to the floor in the nearly bare room their backs to a wall reading the material all of carl durans assignments nothing about the clients he protected draws my attention cavanaugh noted what about where the assignments took place jamie asked they scanned the pages washington new york paris the same places i was usually assigned cavanaugh said nothing suspicious what about incidents on his assignments kim asked i see there was something about a female rock star and an obsessive fan he stabbed thats what got him fired and here jamie pointed a client died on one of his assignments a russian oil tycoon i heard about that but i had no idea carl worked on it frowning cavanaugh explained to jamie it happened four years ago the tycoon was in rome negotiating to lease oil tankers he believed some of his russian competitors were conspiring to have him killed it turned out he was right a sniper got him cavanaugh scanned another page who was carls team leader and who were some of the other operators he worked with kim drew a finger down a list shit she suddenly said what ali kim said ali was the team leader when the tycoon was assassinated that was before ali got promoted to running our personnel department thats not the only time ali worked with duran jamie said here she pointed toward the middle of a page and here she pointed toward the top of another and here kim said duran and ali worked together on several long assignments the tycoon was hit by a rifle bullet that went through a window in his hotel suite jamie said reading ali was in the room with him and then duran hurried in from standing watch outside the suite when an assignment ends that badly we send an investigator to learn from our mistakes kim said the report concluded that nobody was at fault who ran the investigation all three read the summary of the incident gerald brockman they said at once okay okay lets not jump to conclusions cavanaugh stared at the page these could all be coincidences it doesnt mean somethings wrong who else was on the team kim asked is there anyone we can ask wholl either confirm brockmans report or insist it was a coverup four of them cavanaugh scanned the names his stomach sinking as he read each of them most are dead what jamie asked over the years they not most of them kim said i recognize these names leaving out gerald ali and carl duran all the operators on that team are dead kim hurried to the computer set down the page she held and typed names that were on it she stared at the monitor one was shot on an assignment the others car crash scuba accident altitude sickness while climbing mt everest cavanaugh said i was invited on that expedition a job kept me from going carl went though guy gets around jamie said but if carl was involved in a coverup that gerald and ali were part of carl would never have allowed gps to fire him cavanaugh said hed have put so much pressure on gerald and ali blackmailing them that theyd have persuaded duncan to let him stay good point kim scratched her arms are you okay jamie asked couldnt be better kims brow was beaded with sweat right if you need it chew more oxy this isnt the time to make another attempt at withdrawing just a little longer kim said when duran was fired gerald was duncans secondincommand he had the authority to stop duran from being dismissed but since gerald didnt intervene that suggests carl didnt have any way to blackmail him jamie pointed out that leaves ali when was he promoted to running the personnel division kims fingers tapped the keyboard a year after duran was fired he couldnt have suddenly demanded that carl be rehired cavanaugh said it would have looked suspicious but if ali couldnt get duran rehired how else could ali have been useful to him by giving carl information about gps assignments we a noise made cavanaugh pause whats the matter jamie asked cavanaugh glanced from the bedroom toward the front door the noise was repeated get down the lock and the hinges disintegrated presumably from thermite cord as the front door crashed inward three men charged in firing muffled automatic rifles in the bedroom cavanaugh grabbed jamie and dove to the floor chunks of the wall erupted he and jamie drew their pistols but before they could shoot the gunmen veered out of sight kim astonished him by squirming across and slamming the bedroom door locking it stay down kim theyll shoot through the door its metal with a ringing echo the bullets struck the door but didnt come through the shooters returned their aim to the wall firing holes in it their soundsuppressed weapons no louder than sewing machines given enough time they could level a portion of the wall and step through to finish their job but they didnt have time they counted on surprise and massive firepower to give them the advantage now they had another obstacle to overcome and despite their muffled weapons the din of bullets bursting through walls would alarm the neighbors cavanaugh prayed that someone would phone the police that sirens would converge on the building the shooters would worry about that they would soon need to run the sudden silence in the living room supported his logic they were leaving no he was wrong he heard a noise against the hinges and locks on the metal door theyre using thermite cord on this door also cavanaugh fired three times at the wall not expecting to hit the attackers but wanting to make noise hoping to panic neighbors into calling lets go he hurried toward the bedroom window shoved it upward and stared at a fire escape hed noticed earlier when hed closed the draperies waving jamie and kim through he squirmed to follow a dark narrow alley was three stories down a brick wall across from kims apartment had prevented the shooters from establishing a snipers post faster cavanaugh yelled hearing jamie and kim scramble down ahead of him the clang of their impact on the next landing was followed by the crash of kims bedroom door falling inward they realize weve gone cavanaugh thought they used all their time they need to run before the police arrive to assure himself cavanaugh spun and peered up dismayed to see a face and a rifle barrel at the open window the slots of the fire escape deflected the gunmans bullets the ricochets loud in the confines of the alley go go go he yelled to jamie and kim he heard jamies desperate breathing as she surged down ahead of him kims martial arts training allowed her to vault the railing dangle from the bottom of the platform and drop to the next landing cavanaugh rushed down next to her seeing her straighten an expression of pain tightening her face he stared up the face was gone from the window were two floors below them he thought but there might be other gunmen on the street we dont know what well be running into he noticed that the windows next to him were dark look away protect your eyes he warned jamie and kim he kicked the window glass flying jamie reached through freeing the lock raising the window go he urged he crawled in after her as glass crunched under his shoes kim gripped the inside of the window frame and swung in behind them eyes adjusting to the dark cavanaugh hurried from a kitchen into a living room put his ear against the door heard footsteps thundering down stairs unlocked the door yanked it open and slammed against a man with a rifle who tried to charge past the impact knocked the mans breath out a railing snapped when he struck it as the man dropped his rifle and almost plummeted into the stairwell cavanaugh grabbed him dragged him back and gripped him in a restraining hold leverage pried cavanaughs gun from his hand abruptly more thundering footsteps made cavanaugh spin toward where the stairs led upward a second gunman charged into view as the man raised his rifle he lurched back his eyes going blank jamies bulletstwo to the chest one to the headdropping him at the end of the landing a door opened an elderly woman peering out stay inside cavanaugh shouted struggling to keep the man in a restraining hold call the police wheres the third man cavanaugh yelled to jamie and kim there kim shouted pointing downward the last of the gunmen aimed from the bottom of the stairs cavanaugh lurched back as bullets disintegrated what remained of the railing at once a metallic scrape indicated he was reloading jamie leaned into the stairwell and fired repeatedly the man groaned slumping there might be others get into the apartment cavanaugh yelled continuing to restrain the first gunman as jamie and kim hurried toward the dark kitchen cavanaugh forced the man across the shadowy living room he winced when the man slammed a thicksoled shoe onto his right foot holding him from behind cavanaugh applied a strangle grip feeling him squirm hearing his labored breathing the man tried to reach behind him and grab cavanaughs testicles cavanaugh strengthened his grip and stomped the mans left foot the man grunted lurched backward walloped cavanaugh against a wall and rammed an elbow into his ribs as cavanaughs grip loosened the man charged free and suddenly had a knife in his hand cavanaugh blocked the exit from the apartment the man pivoted toward the kitchen where jamie aimed her pistol toward him no cavanaugh said we need him alive i dont care jamie told the man take one step toward me and ill the man swung toward cavanaugh jabbing with his knife cavanaugh leapt back and threw a lamp while the man avoided it cavanaugh unclipped his knife from his pocket by design the hook on the back of the blade snagged against the edge of the pocket the motion causing the blade to open as cavanaugh yanked the knife out kim jabbed the light switch cavanaugh saw her doing it but the man did not surprised by the light and by how quickly cavanaugh had produced his knife the man thrust again cavanaugh parried slicing the back of the mans hand and now the crucial element was who acted faster no staring at one another no assessing no calculating a clever move most knife fights took less than five seconds flick flick flick now youre bleeding now youre dying overwhelming primordial power would win cavanaugh believed that the term martial arts was a selfcontradiction when it came to combat there was nothing artistic nothing smooth and graceful about it as adrenaline dumped into cavanaughs system his blood vessels expanded his heart sped martial arts students claimed to be able to use zen techniques to control their pulse during combat but in cavanaughs experience his adrenaline took charge and as sure as death followed life his heartbeat went ballistic fine motor skills which use dexterity and handeye coordination to perform precise movements accurate shooting for example disintegrate at heartbeats per minute complex motor skills which help muscle groups perform a series of blunt movements kicks and punches for example disintegrate at heartbeats per minute but most handtohand combat causes the heart to surge to beats per minute in that frenzy of adrenaline the combatant becomes one of two large furious deadly animals charging one another along with burnt gunpowder the smell of testosterone filled the living room musk a man smell of fierce power everything seemed fast and yet terribly slow sounds faded vision narrowed all of this happened in an instant as cavanaugh screamed flicked his knife back and forth and up and down with a violent speed that the eye couldnt follow and charged his opponent using a buzzsaw technique against which his enemy couldnt defend unless he too used his knife as a buzz saw but it was all happening so fast so overwhelmingly that the opponent jerked back screamingnot as cavanaugh screamed in massive aggression but instead in abject terrified surrender as blood flew from the mans arms and his chest as the man tripped and fell backward cavanaugh was on him kicking no jamie yelled but cavanaugh couldnt stop kicking youll kill him jamie shouted you said we need him alive cavanaughs frenzy snapped jamies urgency reaching him he stopped he stood over the unconscious man breathing frantically his clothes were soaked with sweat he was suddenly aware of sirens a voice yelled i told you to drop the knife and put your hands up lady drop the gun dont make me shoot everybody hands up chest heaving cavanaugh turned slowly and saw two policemen in the living room their pistols aimed at him jamie and kim in the open doorway an intense man in a suit aimed a pistol also outside more sirens joined the commotion as the man in the suit yelled for the last time drop your weapons cavanaugh let go of his knife it clattered onto the floor my gun might go off if i drop it jamie told the man gently the man said aiming set it down jamie obeyed then carefully straightened both hands in the air kim raised her hands also get the paramedics up here the man told someone behind him you three he said to cavanaugh jamie and kim over against this wall lean forward spread your legs get a police woman up here he shouted down the stairs we were defending ourselves cavanaugh maintained as he leaned forward with his hands against the wall sure you were they attacked us in my apartment kim said the third floor check that the man told a policeman he studied kim so if you live up there how did you get down here lieutenant an officer said peering into the kitchen weve got a broken window i think were going to be a long time sorting this out the lieutenant said just so we dont have any misunderstandings with a judge and a jury you have the right to remain silent you know the drill yes do you want an attorney seems like i dont have a choice you got that right the lieutenant searched him from behind lifted cavanaughs jacket and found his empty holster wheres the gun that goes with this cavanaugh nodded toward where it had fallen near the door you better have a permit for this i do why do you need it im in the security business global protective services yeah i saw how you were protecting this guy on the floor leaving impressions of your shoes on his kidneys global protective services huh im impressed all to hell cavanaugh decided the conversation had just about come to an end how do i contact my attorney unless youve got a supply of carrier pigeons i suggest using this the man pulled cavanaughs phone from his jacket now when im finished the man patted cavanaughs chest and found his clawshaped knife in a plastic sheath suspended by a breakaway chain around cavanaughs neck meanwhile a policewoman arrived and searched jamie removing her knife from her hip the man glanced from it toward the pistol and the knives on the floor between these and the automatic rifles on the stairs weve got enough weapons to outfit the military of a caribbean country lieutenant a policeman said at the door the apartment upstairs is shot to pieces just your normal saturday night in greenwich village the lieutenant said sit on the floor he told cavanaugh cavanaugh obeyed cross your legs cavanaugh did heres your cell phone tell your attorney to be quick tell him lt russell cant wait to talk to him ambulance attendants crouched next to the man cavanaugh had subdued is he going to live russell asked hell be able to answer your questions my my hes got a pistol under his jacket and therell be another knife somewhere cavanaugh said yeah the ambulance attendant said on a chain around his neck the attendant pulled it from under his shirt looks like a claw like the one that was around your neck russell told cavanaugh are you guys making some kind of fashion statement and whats this another fashion statement using forceps the attendant probed the mans left ear and removed a fleshcolored object an earbud radio receiver cavanaugh said if hes got one of those hes also got a miniature microphone cavanaugh studied the mans bloodspotted turtleneck probably pinned to the front of his collar a mike the size of a dime damned if there isnt the attendant said lt russell yelled down the stairs does the wounded guy down there have a microphone on his collar and something in his ear just a second lieutenant while iyeah same with this guy someone shouted from the upper stairs where the third gunman lay dead russell inspected the microphone and pried off its back just before he pulled out a tiny battery he asked cavanaugh who the hell did you take on the cia the cia sprawled on a dark rooftop across the street carl listened to the radio transmission crackle and die like the men in the apartment building he had an earbud and a miniature microphone unlike them he had a small black box the size of a pack of cigarettes this box a radio receiver and transmitter had a switch that allowed him to communicate with each man separately for the past fifteen minutes until the microphone had failed hed been able to eavesdrop on the conversation he hadnt heard aarons voice in several years it filled him with a welter of emotions anger regret bitterness a fond need to be able to return to that longago summer when they pretended to be soldiers caught behind enemy lines and hid among bushes watching men and women holding hands as they strolled through the woods concealing himself behind a chimney carl raised an ar sighted through its holographic scope and waited the cellphone numbers cavanaugh pressed were for the landline at williams safe site as the phone buzzed on the other end he heard more sirens outside red and blue lights flashed beyond the window hello this is cavanaugh put william on maybe hell talk nicer to you than he does to us the phone made a bumping sound then williams voice said i hope this means everythings back to normal and i can get out of here afraid not cavanaugh said theres been some shooting and some shooting the lieutenant said in the background i was with the marines in the first iraq war i think we used less ammunition why dont i let lt russell explain it to you so i dont say anything i shouldnt name rank and serial number williams voice cautioned nothing else put him on the phone cavanaugh handed the phone to the lieutenant then looked at jamie and kim against the wall jamie impressed him with her composure as if shed been an operator all her life but kim was another matter the pupils of her eyes resembled pencil points her brow was beaded with sweat her withdrawal symptoms accelerating cavanaugh gave her a firm nod of assurance at the precinct in half an hour russell said to the phone then gave it back to cavanaugh yes william cavanaugh asked into it name rank and serial number no exceptions i want you to call somebody cavanaugh gave william a name and a phone number tell him i need help when william heard the name his response was hell get their attention okay were ready to move this guy the ambulance attendant said the attendant and his partner lifted the semiconscious man onto a gurney and wheeled him from the apartment below a clatter of equipment indicated that the gunman jamie had wounded was being lifted onto a similar gurney hands behind your back russell told cavanaugh the lieutenant clicked handcuffs onto him the policewoman did the same to jamie and kim is the van here russell asked a policeman cavanaugh managed to stand preceded and followed by police officers he jamie and kim left the apartment on the stairs a camera flashed a medical examiner and his team inspecting the other gunman jamie had shot cavanaugh descended the smell of burnt gunpowder widened his nostrils he stepped over empty ammunition casings and left the building confronted by the chaos of flashing lights police cars ambulances and several hundred onlookers as aaron emerged from the building into the kaleidoscope of lights carl almost pulled the trigger aaron had his hands cuffed behind him he had policemen ahead of him policemen behind him and two women next to him one of the women chinese was the gps computer expert whose apartment carl had ordered watched the other woman was the one hed seen in jackson hole aarons wife carl studied her tall wearing slacks with legs that drew his gaze from her ankles to her inviting hips athletically trim with upwardtilted breasts that made him imagine standing behind her cupping his hands over them glossy brunette hair that he wanted to stroke eyes so intense carl felt their power even on the roof across the street aaron you and i always had the same great taste do it carl told himself shoot but no matter how much he wanted to he mustered the discipline that he had not possessed while he and aaron had been in delta force and later when theyd worked for global protective services no i in team i understand that now he thought no selfcontrol not then not when i took out that sentry with a knife instead of obeying the order to kill him with a soundsuppressed pistol not when i stabbed that crazy fan when he pulled out a knife and attacked that rockstar babe no i learned my lesson aaron you and duncan taught me that lesson i spent a lot of time on shit jobs learning that lesson stay cool keep the mission in mind dont get distracted dont screw things up for a moments satisfaction i learned that lesson so well i could teach you but if i shoot ill never get off this rooftop and make it to where raouls waiting with the car right now theres only one thing more important than killing you and im so cool so disciplined so in control thats what im going to do carl pulled a transmitter from his pocket when he pressed a button a green light flashed then he pressed a second button uneasy cavanaugh stood at the entrance to the building partially blinded by the flashing lights he watched attendants wheel the injured gunmen toward two ambulances we got what we need he thought when theyre conscious we can question them we can find out where carl trains his men i want an officer in each ambulance lt russell said two policemen stepped toward the vehicles as the attendants shut the doors and suddenly the ambulances heaved explosions shattering their windows blasting their rear doors open the shockwaves knocked the ambulance attendants and the policemen to the pavement others stumbled back bystanders ran many screamed bombs russell spun toward cavanaugh what the hells going on how did wyoming cavanaugh said trying to recover from his shock his skin itching from wariness he nudged jamie back with him into the cover of the buildings vestibule kim noticed and retreated with them as cavanaugh scanned the roof on the opposite side of the street he lowered his gaze toward the windows and the entrances to the brownstones but the emergency vehicles and the flashing lights made it difficult to see much of anything at street level wyoming what are you talking about russell demanded emergency personnel ran toward the ambulances smoke drifted from the open doors thats where this started cavanaugh stepped deeper into the building jamie and kim following a hit team tried to kill me there also russell stared when two members of the team were about to be captured their car blew apart cavanaugh told him russell stared harder we think the teams leader planted a bomb under the car and used a remote control to detonate itto keep them from being questioned earlier somebody on the team shot a sniper working for them presumably because he couldnt be counted on to keep his mouth shut youre telling me the guy who organized this attack watched from down the street and blew up his men when he saw them being carried out alive russell asked in dismay he might be out there even now cavanaugh said prompting russell to turn and scan the street with the intensity that cavanaugh did how the hell could he put a bomb on his men without them knowing about it or us finding it a frenzied voice shouted from one of the ambulances theyre blown in half at the waist the plastic sheaths cavanaugh said sheaths russells voice was raw for the knife each man had your people took the knives but left the sheaths the plastic must have had explosive in it along with a miniature detonator for the first time russell was speechless carl was here watching us go into the building cavanaugh felt a chill from the buildings vestibule he stared toward the crowd across the street maybe hes still watching maybe hes up on a roof with a rifle lieutenant have you still got that earbud and microphone russell pulled them from a suit pocket put the radio receiver in my ear cavanaugh said feeling helpless with his hands cuffed behind him russell hesitated then did what cavanaugh wanted please put the battery back in the microphone and raise it to my mouth cavanaugh said after less hesitation russell did carl cavanaugh asked all he heard was static carl i know youre out there youre probably watching the entrance to this building more static carl i think i know how youve been training your recruits remember those visualization courses our specialops instructors arranged for us to take we couldnt get over how fast visualization accelerates the learning curve you used that technique reinforced by movies and video games right its an efficient way to program someone only static i dont know what your objective is cavanaugh said into the microphone russell held in front of him but i know youre behind all this so theres no point in continuing to try to kill me it wont make a difference nothings going to divert suspicion from you so quit taking the risk im a worthless target cavanaugh strained to listen to the plug in his ear to ignore all the distracting shouts doors slamming the drone of automobile engines before him the rumble of footsteps on stairs behind him the static changed subtly carls voice unheard for so many years said you should have been a better friend then the static changed again as if the transmission ended cavanaugh told russell you can put the microphone away hes gone carl carl duran cavanaugh said you and i have a lot to talk about russell pulled a twoway radio from his belt randall get a swat team down here tell your men to check the roofs what are we looking for a voice asked if im to believe what im hearing the prince of darkness who a guy who doesnt leave loose ends ill get you a description as soon as six feet tall cavanaugh said lean women find him attractive until they discover he almost never smiles strong arms particularly his forearms from working with a hammer and anvil a blacksmith russell asked a master knife maker cavanaugh said he spends a lot of time thinking about blades and sheaths i guess it finally occurred to him how sheaths could be weapons also russell stared toward the ambulances and the blood on their shattered windows yeah he said you and i definitely have a lot to talk about part six the knives of old san francisco kim threw up again a policeman hurried toward a door in the harsh corridor only to be blocked by lt russell who suddenly opened the door russell was accompanied by two other grimfaced men one white the other black william faraday and john rutherford sick the policeman explained to russell pointing toward the holding cell the chinese womans throwing up my client demands medical help william said and believe me counselor shell get it ill send for the police chiefs personal physician if thatll make you happy nothing makes me happy i already got that impression russell turned to the policeman send for a doctor the group marched along the corridor stopping in front of the cell where russell motioned for an officer to unlock the door hi william hello john cavanaugh said as they stepped in kim threw up again whats wrong with her russell asked back injury jamie explained she needs a pain killer like more of those oxycontin pills we found in her apartment russell asked those pills belonged to the attackers william said yeah right russell said in the frenzy of the moment the pills fell out of a gunmans pocket the attorney said thats the sort of man whod be capable of that kind of violence a pill popper a drug addict whatever you say russell told him and you had plenty to say william turned to cavanaugh i told you to volunteer nothing but your name and your vital statistics its nice to see you too william but the lieutenant tells me you pretty much gave him your life history if you want to be your own attorney why drag me down here hey i thought i was doing you a favor freeing you from your safe site cavanaugh told him well you didnt do me any favor lt russell pointed toward the black man next to him bringing in the fbi at the start i figured you were bullshitting me to try to talk your way out of that shooting now the director of the fbis counterterrorist unit invokes national security bottom line rutherford told cavanaugh youre coming with me but that doesnt stop me from trying to untangle this mess russell said we managed to get fingerprints from the men who were killed in those blasts it wont be long before we find out who they were maybe that information will lead us to your exbuddy carl duran wont help cavanaugh said youll discover they got out of prison recently probably within the past six weeks they were doing time for violent offenses but they each went to a different prison and they didnt know each other before they went in russell asked rutherford is this more bullshit afraid not then enlighten me russell told cavanaugh show me how smart you are how did these guys wind up together carl approached them when they got out of prison and in a brief time he turned them from being rough criminals into operators how i think carl selects his recruits on the basis of their capacity for violence their ability to learn and their need to be somebody important theyre wannabes guys whod love to be in marine recon the rangers special forces or the seals just to show how tough they are and force people to look up to them but they dont have the character and the discipline to make the grade approach them when theyre fresh out of prison with no prospects and no money but a powerful urge to let off the anger theyve been building up pay them flatter them use visualization and other accelerated instructional techniques give them a chance to play with guns six weeks later their egos are so pumped theyll do anything to prove to carl they deserve his respect just as important theyre the kind of guys nobody cares about and nobodyll miss if carl thinks theyre in a position to be captured and questioned he blows them up its like they never existed thats quite a theory the lieutenant said help me prove it cavanaugh said you suggested i look at places where carl duran lived rutherford interrupted including where he was stationed in the military we searched for a pattern of cats and dogs that disappeared or maybe they didnt disappear maybe they showed up in alleys or ditches with their guts sliced open and their heads cut off the police and the humane societies had records of clusters like that in iowa city just before duran moved away in nashville tennessee just before he moved from there in columbus georgia next to fort benning where he started his ranger training in tacoma washington next to fort lewis where he got more ranger training in fayetteville north carolina next to fort bragg where delta force is trained especially just before duran moved to another base or when he left delta there was a high incidence of mutilated animals rutherford paused then the bodies started turning up bodies russell asked winos and homeless people all of them stabbed to death other winos and homeless people spread a rumor about a man who stalked them at night under bridges in storm culverts in parks and alleys in abandoned buildings and junkfilled lots the rumors were about this man kicking drunks awake or knocking cardboard boxes over and making homeless people crawl out he gave them a knife and told them to fight then he went to work but the patterns of the cuts showed that he took a long time to finish them off yeah russell said the prince of darkness kim threw up again after the doctor left cavanaugh and jamie studied kim where she lay on the bunk an ambulance is coming jamie assured her pale kim managed to nod the doctor says youre in stress from withdrawal what time is it two in the morning longest time ive gone without oxy since last spring at least im not shitting my pants yet the doctor says hes taking you to a detox clinic cavanaugh said kim nodded weakly again he says you asked to be taken there cavanaugh added hey kim ran her tongue along her dry lips im into withdrawal this far i might as well go all the way cavanaugh noted that kim didnt qualify her statement by saying she would try to go all the way dont worry about your job itll be there when you come back kim crossed her arms over her chest and shivered im not worried about me its the two of you she shivered harder asking jamie do you remember the computer codes you bet jamie said your securitys so brilliant i cant get in otherwise nail the bastard whos doing this lt russell arranged for numerous cruisers to leave the precinct at the same time so many that carls operators couldnt follow them all but if any tried the sparse traffic of two am would make the surveillance obvious and easily intercepted cavanaugh and jamie hid in the back seat of one of those cruisers they got out at central parks west drive slipped into the trees and headed north from time to time they paused among murky boulders and bushes to check if they were being followed only the parks usual predators stalked them but cavanaugh and jamie gave off such strong dontscrewwithus vibrations that just four kids made a move and what happened to them was so swift and decisive that word spread quicklystay away confident that theyd eluded carl and his men cavanaugh and jamie crossed eighth avenue and proceeded along west seventythird street they reached a modest apartment building outside which a man with a beer can in his hand seemed asleep behind the steering wheel of a car farther along a man walked a dog still farther along a van had a small air vent in its roof the vent actually an aperture for a surveillance camera outside the front door cavanaugh studied a list of tenants he pressed the intercom button next to the name zimbalist after a moment a mans voice said this better be good its the middle of the night jimmy lile sent us jamie said mentioning a famous knife maker whose name theyd selected as a code a buzzer sounded cavanaugh opened the door and stepped into a warm pleasantly lit vestibule halfway along a hallway a door was ajar a security camera looked down from a corner they went up one flight of carpeted stairs and prepared to knock on door c when it opened and rutherford smiled you two dont look so good you dont need to seem so cheery about it jamie said im just glad youre all right he locked the door after they entered what about william cavanaugh asked did he get back to his safe site okay nobody followed the car in the living room two men in white shirts had their suit coats draped over chairs their holstered handguns visible on their belts they watched a row of closedcircuit tv monitors that provided views of the street the door to the building the vestibule and the stairs leading up you ought to feel flattered rutherford said the bureau maintains this place only for prized informants the park cavanaugh rubbed his arms cold youve got your pick of two bathrooms to take a hot shower hungry jamie said the pizzas already here rutherford said with pepperonis right and anchovies and black olives and salad and garlic bread everything you ordered are you okay cavanaugh asked in the darkness of a bedroom a few bumps and bruises nothing serious jamie lay next to him i mean are you okay why wouldnt i be its just the usual isnt it fear and trembling you were talking awfully fast in the kitchen you sound as if youre on speed adrenaline will do that it should have worn off by now the darkness seemed to compress around him i guess im resistant she said i just want to make sure nothings wrong the darkness got even thicker jamie lay unmoving next to him finally she said you mean because i killed somebody cavanaugh exhalednow that you mention it he was trying to kill us best reason in the world to pull the trigger cavanaugh agreed you didnt panic you didnt let the heat of the moment make your hands waver you acted precisely you saved our lives is this what the military calls an afteraction report its useful to talk to sort out your emotions in other words a cheap form of psychotherapy jamie remained motionless beside him imagine that you didnt raise your pistol fast enough imagine him firing the rifle full auto bullets tearing into us blood and flesh and bone flying you and kim and me dropping trying some neurolinguistic programming on me its nothing i havent used on myself when was the first time first time outside the curtained bulletresistant window a car drove by its lonely drone echoing in the night you mean the first time i killed someone jamie didnt answer twenty years ago cavanaugh said in peru jamie turned toward him isnt that where you told me duran was held prisoner by revolutionaries they called themselves the pcp the partido comunista del peru american soldiers were down there helping prop up the government carl and i and some other delta force members were sent to teach the peruvian soldiers how to put together their own version of delta lord knows enough officials had been kidnapped that the local government needed experts in hostage retrieval we accompanied peruvian soldiers on a mission to rescue a highranking politician the pcp was threatening to kill him if the government didnt release some pcp members the army was interrogating but somebody leaked the details of the mission to the revolutionaries and we walked into an ambush carl was knocked unconscious by an explosion the government soldiers he was with ran away later we received photographs showing that carl was alive with a message that gave the government three days to release the pcp agitators cavanaugh forced himself to continue delta looks after its own within twentyfour hours a full extraction team arrived from fort bragg twelve hours before the deadline expired we got a lucky break some excellent intelligence reports along with aerial surveillance photos that showed the mountain camp where carl was being held at night we parachuted into a clearing about three miles away and converged on the target the infrared satellite images wed studied gave us a pretty good idea of where the prisoners eight of them including carl were being held about twenty revolutionaries were guarding the camp we used nightvision binoculars to confirm what was on the satellite images i was with the men assigned to get to the prisoners and protect them once the attack started basically the tactic was coordinated sniper shots followed by overwhelming automatic fire and a hail of fragmentation grenades it was a textbook assault and it went perfectly no casualties among the prisoners or the attack force the revolutionaries were utterly outclassed you killed some of them that was your first time jamie asked i laid down covering fire three thirtyround magazines but i have no idea if any of my bullets connected i need to assume i did damage but it was as if i was destroying objects i had no sense that i was actually killing people my primary emotion was relief that carl was safe and that id survived the mission then i dont understand it doesnt sound like your first time we radioed for evac choppers and set up a perimeter in case other revolutionaries heard the shots and came to investigate when i found cover and waited i had a sense that something was terribly wrong a feeling that i was being watched that something awful was about to happen by then it was dawn i glanced to my left and saw a face in the bushes a kid he was maybe sixteen raising a pistol before i realized what i was doing i swung my rifle and emptied the magazine into him total reflex thirty rounds just about blew him apart even if id probably killed before that was my first time up close and personal the moment was so intense i could see into the kids eyes past his feardilated pupils into his brain into his soul i remember thinking you stupid kid why didnt you hide why did you need to try to be a hero it was so pointless so damned unnecessary what happened then i threw up cavanaugh said thats what i felt like doing i had a lot of nightmares about that kid cavanaugh continued his chin had a wart he had scruffy hair and a scar on his forehead his clothes were filthy and ragged he was so thin he probably hadnt eaten a decent meal in weeks the revolution was one of those share the wealth deals millions of poor people against a handful of rich landlords and financiers trying to control them im sure the kid had been exploited all his life he was probably consumed with hate i bet he went to sleep every night longing for a decent future a lot to sympathize with but if i had the chance to do it again id shoot him just as dead as i shot him the first time otherwise you and i wouldnt be having this conversation jamies hand touched his and if i had to do it again id shoot that man as dead as he now is just to make sure you and i could be lying here like this its one way to decide if something was justifiedwhether youd do it again cavanaugh agreed but i hate that it needed to happen yes i measured my life from that moment before i killed and after rescuing carl duran jamie said his eyes feeling raw cavanaugh peered toward painful sunlight seeping past the draperies with effort he got out of bed he opened the door a crack and saw a different pair of armed agents in the living room with the attentiveness of their predecessors they watched the numerous surveillance monitors cavanaugh shifted his gaze toward a different area in the living room and saw jamie seated at a table tapping on a computer rutherford stood behind her watching her fingers work magic jamies fresh jeans and turtleneck were part of the safesite resources he took the longest hottest shower of his life but tension insisted he couldnt keep his mind off everything that had happened damn it what was carls objective khaki slacks and a brown shirt were on a bureau along with fresh underwear and socks motivated by a sudden idea he dressed so hurriedly that he continued to button his shirt as he walked into the living room morning sleepy head jamie kept her gaze on the computer screen did i miss anything breakfast we left you a doughnut rutherford said havent you heard of dr atkins cavanaugh picked up the phone and pressed the numbers for information cincinnati ohio he told a computerized voice f and w publications jamie and rutherford looked at him f and w publications a cheery voice said blade magazine steve shackleford cavanaugh said one moment please cavanaugh said a silent prayer that steve wouldnt be out of his office on an assignment blade was a favorite magazine of knife enthusiasts but it was a mistake to imagine a redneck goodoldboy reader with bikers boots a beer gut and a chain leading from his thick wallet to his belt instead most of blades subscribers were attorneys physicians computer experts and other whitecollar professionals their average income in six figures a subscription base that many magazines envied the magazines avid readers had knife collections theyd assembled with the care of sophisticated art collectors some of the knives were treasured antique bucks evoking pleasant memories of trusty jackknives from a happy childhood others were pocket knives crafted so painstakingly and with such elegance those by michael vagnino for example that collectors whod paid for one of his folders felt lucky to have gotten a bargain now that hed risen to the top of his field some knives were valued because of the lifeexperience they symbolized vietnam veterans treasuring the rugged kabar combat knife that in many instances had meant the difference between death and survival other knives were valued because of their current reputation as a dependable tactical knife those by ernest emerson for instance who in handcrafted tactical knives for soldier friends departing to the gulf war these soldiers bragged to their comrades about how well designed the knives were eventually emerson received so many orders that he shifted from making knives by hand to manufacturing them in a factory with the goal of proving that with proper diligence a factorymade knife could have the quality of a forged one he followed the example of al mar a former green beret who in the late s pioneered the modern tactical folder and became known as the father of specialty knives an original al mar or ernest emerson knife had an auction price of several thousand dollars still other knives were prized because of their place in popular culture the prop knives for the film the iron mistress were diligently acquired by hollywood productionartist joseph musso a wooden version a rubber version an unfinished steel version used in a forging scene and the magnificent fully realized knife mussos unique collection traveled to various museums including one in san antonio texas the site of the alamo where jim bowie had died mussos love for the iron mistress prompted him to allow skilled bladesmiths to study the knife and its studio blueprints copies by george cooper joe keeslar and gil hibben were better made than the original and highly prized this was the world that cavanaugh needed to tap into as he listened to the other phone ring steve shackleford the pleasant voice had a tennessee accent thank god cavanaugh thought steve its aaron stoddard both jamie and john straightened frowning at one another so unusual was it for cavanaugh to use his real name aaron what a surprise i havent talked to you in it has to be three years the last time i was at the blade show in atlanta cavanaugh said of the numerous knifeenthusiast conventions the blade show was the hugest with more than ten thousand attendees i was afraid youd dropped off the face of the earth steves voice said not quite i had a lot of obligations at the ranch as far as steve knew cavanaugh was a cattleman thus explaining the wyoming address but when i told you i was a rancher i was really referring to a sideline my main work is in the security field oh a moments thought was broken with i guess you get a lot of use for knives in that kind of work more than you can imagine i need a favor steve sounded wary what kind your magazines subscription list youve got to be kidding names addresses phone numbers if youve got them the works thats confidential information my friend i cant just what sort of security work did you say you did why dont i let the fbis director of counterterrorism explain it to you i think youre going to hear the words federal government and national security cavanaugh gave the phone to john five minutes later john gave the phone back to cavanaugh now can you supply the subscription list cavanaugh asked as important as this sounds give me your email address steve said ill send the list in five minutes are you looking for anybody in particular maybe i can ask around carl duran your friend he dropped out of sight im trying hard to find him its no wonder you cant steve said i dont understand carl died three years ago died im surprised you didnt know we had an argument we stayed out of touch shame about arguments especially when its too late to repair them he stopped going to the blade show about the same time you did after he was fired from global protective services cavanaugh thought cavanaugh had stopped going to the blade show in order to avoid crossing paths with carl i asked around wondering what happened to him steves voice continued the word i got was that hed been killed how cavanaugh pressed the phone harder to his ear a car accident in thailand or maybe the philippines i heard two different versions carl was a construction worker right that had been carls cover story the theory being that it paid to pretend to have a whitebread business that no one felt a compulsion to ask many questions about i heard he saved enough money to take a vacation and thats where he got killed steve said i checked our subscription list and sure enough he didnt renew sorry to break the news to you even if you had an argument im sure you still thought of him as a friend cavanaugh didnt reply i guess you wont need the list now steve said better send it anyhow ive got other names to check they spread the printouts across the floor and studied them here jamie said durans name three years ago rutherford said but not later when youre trying to disappear cavanaugh said the rule is abandon everything about your former life some people cant make a complete break though they have ties they cant give up such as a passion for knives jamie noted cavanaugh nodded carl got fired because of discipline problems maybe those problems carried over into his attempt to disappear hed have tried to be careful he might have used intermediaries but im betting that under another name he continued to subscribe to knife magazines hes been getting blade since he was a kid after he dropped the subscription maybe he just bought the magazine in a store rutherford suggested when he was working for a drug lord in south america jamie looked skeptical a specialty englishlanguage publication would be almost impossible to find down there then maybe he had somebody buy it in the states and mail it to him cavanaugh wondered a big nuisance needing to depend on somebody jamie said plus that probably wouldnt be the only knife publication hed want the easy way is to subscribe have the publishers mail them to a drop site in the us and then have them forwarded john can the bureau investigate the background of anyone who subscribed after carls name disappeared from the list cavanaugh asked no jamie said not after his name disappeared from the list before cavanaugh and rutherford looked puzzled suppose duran anticipated that someone might try to find him this way jamie explained what if he took out a new subscription using a different name before he pretended to be dead its a better way to hide his trail smart rutherford concluded thats why i married her cavanaugh said its all a long shot of course jamie admitted but its the only lead weve got rutherford picked up the phone atlanta georgia his hands in his windbreaker caressing a special folding knife hed crafted carl sat on a bench and watched pedestrians crossing the expanse of centennial olympic park in summer children were able to skip back and forth through what was called a dancing water fountain a wide area of water jets that gushed twenty feet into the air now ignoring a cool october breeze carl imagined youngsters scampering through the spray he could almost hear their laughter wouldnt it have been great to have something like that when you and i were kids aaron he remembered the two of them bicycling to the swimming pool at iowa citys park below the treelined river meandered toward the low summerhazed buildings of downtown he remembered an afternoon when they chained their bicycles to a post and when they returned from the pool they found four kids trying to break the chain and steal the bikes when aaron shouted at them to stop the kids attacked but carl showed aaron that nobody could push them around he pulled out his jackknife causing the kids to gape when he opened it and chased them through the trees he remembered how surprised aaron was he remembered a man sat down next to him nondescript clothes thin midforties mustache swarthy skin from the middle east this location is too exposed it shows weve got nothing to hide a directional microphone can easily overhear everything we say not with my associate playing with that miniature batterypowered car carl indicated raoul a hundred feet away the young hispanic working a remote control that made a tiny jeep go this way and that the control interferes with directionalmicrophone reception the man asked enough to cause hearing loss to anyone using earphones its good for us to be outside fresh air sunshine people going about their business keeps us in touch with the basics of life the olympics explosion was over there incidentally the man looked toward where carl pointed three pipe bombs wired together he said with contempt even so the device managed to kill one woman and wound one hundred and eleven bystanders carl reminded him the army of god thats the group the bombers note gave credit to the army of amateurs is closer to the truth the swarthy man studied the unobstructed space around them how are you going to deal with cavanaugh aaron carl corrected him i dont intend to not any longer i wanted him eliminated because he could make the connection between me and the knife attacks some of those agents needed to be killed with blades the plan depended on it now that aaron knows im involved im at risk but he hasnt discovered anything that threatens the mission itself hell keep hunting you thats a personal matter but it only jeopardizes me i set traps be sure of that but from now on my concentration is focused entirely on the mission i wont waste any more resources going after him carl withdrew his right hand from his windbreaker and showed the knife it held since we probably wont be meeting again i have a gift for you the man hesitated then took the knife examining it with curiosity the handle is unusual its carved from fossilized ivory mastodon tusks uncovered in alaska some knifemaking supply stores sell the material why go to all the trouble of using ivory that old a gesture to the environment this way you know the ivory didnt come from slaughtered elephants or walruses the man studied carl trying to determine if he was being ironic seeing no reaction he returned his attention to the knife the pale yellow handle had two circles carved into it one above the other the bottom circle represented a clock with roman numerals an arrow depicted the clocks hand the top circle was formed by stars a profiled face was in the middle thats the man in the moon carl explained the details in the carving are impressive i worked on that knife for a long time years waiting for missions to start im honored the man tried to open the blade but failed he tried again somethings wrong the blades caught on something no and yes i dont understand something is not wrong but yes the blade is caught on something i still dont thats a model of one of the rarest knives in the world its called a secret knife secret the man asked with interest it was designed in the late sixteen hundreds in france in a royal court known for its secrecy hidden compartments were the rage the original version of that knife might have been used by a spy hiding a secret message the man again tried to open the blade but how do you by figuring out the combination carl said the arrow in the clock the profiled face in the middle of the stars each needs to be twisted to a precise location in order to free a catch that holds the blade in place like a combination to a safe the man noted exactly but in this case there are two dials when you get both in the correct position the blade will open youll be amused to find astrological symbols etched into the blade no one is sure of their significance but i suspect they have something to do with alchemy or perhaps the freemasons the man turned the dials and tried to open the knife without success itll take you a long time to discover the combination and learn the knifes secret carl told him ill use it for distraction while i wait for the start of the week the man said he looked across centennial olympic park toward a tall impressive grayfronted manywindowed building mounted to the top floor bold red letters announced that this was the main headquarters for cnn two days from now broadcasters in there will exhaust themselves reporting aroundtheclock on what weve done with an agent in front an agent behind and an agent on either side cavanaugh and jamie crossed the cold parking garage rutherford was next to them a classic protective formation they identified themselves to guards entered the elevator and rode upward in silence now i know what it feels like to be a client cavanaugh thought when the sternfaced group reached the fortieth floor they flashed their credentials to other guards their concealed weapons set off metal detectors as they stepped through the entrance to global protective services the receptionists jaw dropped several protective agents stopped in their tracks crossing the brightly lit lobby cavanaugh barely had time to note that the damage from the explosion had been erased the place looking splendid as if nothing had happened without bothering to knock he opened a door marked ali karim and heard his personnel director tell two fbi agents who flanked him if youre arresting me tell me the charges but you cant keep me here without a reason standing angrily behind his desk ali spun toward the suddenly opened door ah he said to cavanaugh and jamie as they entered now this all makes sense does it cavanaugh asked all of it as i explained mr karim one of the agents flanking him said we just wanted to be sure you stayed here so you could cooperate and answer questions when everyone arrived hey nobodys better at cooperating than me ali glared cavanaugh you promised to keep in touch when you didnt i got worried that something had happened to you a couple of times something almost did you didnt need to make a production about this if youd let me know you were coming id have canceled my appointments and waited for you unless you dont trust me ali pointed toward the stocky black man next to cavanaugh whos this rutherford showed his fbi credentials does this have anything to do with kim going into drug rehab ali asked you know about that she phoned from the clinic if id realized she was on drugs id have fired her long ago in fact this morning i did fire her its too risky having her around god knows how much tactical information she blabbed when she was drugged up at least we know who the security leak is actually cavanaugh said i promised kim she could have her job back when she finished her rehab what were not certain shes the security leak and just to guarantee we dont get fooled again jamie added were instituting a new security measure a drugtesting program we ali asked jamies our new deputy ceo cavanaugh explained it helps to let the personnel director know so i can get an office ready for you and spread the word and basically do my job as far as the drug test goes firstrate idea i wish id thought of it ill be the first man to piss in a vial to show my loyalty but i have to tell you right now my loyaltys being sorely tested obviously im not on your popularity list whats the problem four years ago cavanaugh said give me some help here i have no idea what that means you were in rome in charge of a team protecting a russian oil executive alis face tightened that he looked at the four agents next to rutherford beyond them gps personnel listened at the open door how public do you want this to be do you still care about security or are you too busy suspecting me rutherford gestured for the agents to leave as cavanaugh started to close the door gerald brockman came in private party the afrikaner asked i forgot to send you an invitation but you might as well join the fun brockman leaned against the wall and crossed his arms over his dark suit cavanaugh finished closing the door and turned toward ali the russian oil executive was shot to death thats right while you were in his hotel suite right again a sniper bullet through a window one of the russians competitors probably ordered the hit carl duran was part of your team duran that son of a bitch hasnt worked for us in years why do you care about him the russian cavanaugh said tell me what happened why did the security fail he was one of those arrogant clients who thinks his protectors are butlers and bell hops carry my bags phone for diner reservations get my shoes polished i told him we did only one thing and that was to protect but we couldnt do that if our hands were compromised and we were distracted by silly errands i told him if he didnt like that idea if he was unhappy with our security then he should hire somebody else i checked with gerald ali indicated brockman leaning against the wall who was my superior at the time and he said i did exactly right brockman nodded the client loved his vodka ali said he also loved standing in front of his hotel suites windows at night grinning at the lights of rome i kept closing the draperies he kept opening them i kept telling him he had to stay away from the damned windows one evening when he was especially drunk he yanked the draperies open spread his arms toward the city lights and told me you see nobodys out there waiting to kill me then why in gods name did you hire us i asked for show he said he chuckled gulped more vodka and told me i must be important mustnt i if i need so much protection he laughed again and thats when the bullet smashed through the window the glass wasnt bullet resistant it wasnt an option he chose the hotel anyway how many hotels have that kind of glass we wouldnt have needed bulletresistant windows if the stupid bastard had followed instructions and kept the draperies closed the bullet caught him here ali touched the middle of his forehead mushroomed blew most of his brains out the back of his head working with the police we discovered that the shot came from the roof of a building two hundred yards away it had been raining for the previous two days and nights the shooter must have had a poncho rigged to form a low tent we found his dry outline where hed been lying on the otherwise wet gravel on the roof patient man or woman jamie said cavanaugh nodded nobodys more patient than you are he stepped toward ali how did carl duran fit into this he was part of the security outside the russians suite the sound of the bullet shattering the glass was loud enough that he heard it and charged inside wasnt the door locked of course it was ali said you let him in i was too busy trying to help the russian when i realized i couldnt i hurried to phone for an ambulance then carl couldnt have gotten in unless he had a key its been a long time but yes obviously he must have had a key brockman straightened pushing himself off the wall i was in charge of the team that investigated the shooting there were some questions whether ali should have been more insistent to the russian about staying away from the draperies for example insistent i did everything but put him in handcuffs but on balance we saw it as a basic case of a client jeopardizing his own security brockman continued as for duran he was with a member of his team outside the suite when the bullet came through the glass chunks of the glass were all over the room clearly the bullet came from another building where is all this going why are you so interested in duran cavanaugh explained what theyd learned he knows so much about our agents somebody in gps needs to be passing information to him somebody in authority jamie told brockman we think durans using blackmail to get that information the only time you ali and duran intersected was in connection with the russians death so theres a strong chance thats when the trouble started you think im involved brockman said angrily no you were secondincommand when carl was fired if carl had a way to blackmail you hed have forced you not to fire him so youre blaming me ali demanded you had a connection with duran dating back to the russians murder cavanaugh pointed out meanwhile kimour company drug addictgets a free pass she helped us jamie said in fact she risked her life for us then what do i need to do to prove im not the leak jump off a building i dont see anything you can do cavanaugh told him until we get this crisis settled im putting you on administrative leave were going through all your phone records to see if youve been in contact with anyone suspicious jamie will analyze your computers hard drive to retrieve emails youve erased of course in most cases theyre never fully erased jamie explained why the hell dont you check my bank records too its being done as we speak ali ran a hand through his thick dark hair you know what shove your administrative leave shove your damned job he glared at rutherford am i under arrest i dont have enough proof then why dont all of you go fuck yourselves no one spoke for several seconds after ali stormed from the office if hes acting rutherford said he deserves an academy award yeah but if hes innocent ill never be able to regain his trust cavanaugh added welcome to the world of running a corporation brockman said lets think about you and duran rutherford told cavanaugh you havent been in contact for the past three years and then suddenly he tries to kill you in wyoming why i could make the link between the way our agents were killed and his obsession with knives he tried to keep me from drawing suspicion to him but why wait so long jamie wondered if he was worried about you hed have needed to eliminate you at the startbefore the agents were killed with sharp weapons cavanaugh thought about it as long as i was out of the business maybe carl didnt consider me a threat but then his contact alerted him that someone named aaron stoddard might inherit global protective services carl knew who aaron stoddard was at all costs he had to stop me from getting involved because of the knives brockman said but the pattern still isnt clear not all our agents were killed with knives and only a few of the governments agents why only those agents jamie suddenly headed toward the computer on alis desk geralds right weve been studying all kinds of lists but what we havent looked at is what the agents killed with sharp weapons might have in common jamie typed the codes kim had given to her accessing gpss security files she typed more keys studied something and pressed other keys immediately the printer began processing pages cavanaugh grabbed them and spread them over the desk the group joined him nothing similar in their backgrounds rutherford concluded they were born and raised in various areas they belonged to various elite military units eightysecond airborne marine recon army rangers special forces seals britains sas south africas reconnaissance commando unit but hardly any of them served at the same time and the same place jamie pointed out and they hardly ever worked on the same protective assignments together brockman said maybe were going at this from the wrong direction what do you mean if theres a common denominator maybe it isnt where theyd been or the assignments theyd been on maybe its where they were going going jamie asked their next assignments brockman drew his finger along the pages he stopped at one item his features tensing dear god staring at where brockman pointed cavanaugh felt sick he grabbed the phone wed better check with the secret service the us marshals and the diplomatic security service their agents who were killed with sharp weapons we need to find out where they were being assigned the same place jamie asked she and the others stared at the pages new orleans the world trade organization two days from now the gps conference room was crammed with agents using computers and phones messengers hurried in printers whirred as rutherfords team worked with cavanaughs trying to take advantage of every second similar battleplan rooms were at the fbi secret service us marshals and diplomatic security service the groups constantly communicating with each other updating schedules coordinating trying to prevent a disaster the rooms noise forced rutherford to raise his voice when the world trade organization had its conference in seattle riots nearly shut down the city cavanaugh knew about the thousands of protestors and millions of dollars in damage wto protests had also disrupted geneva indeed wherever the wto held its meetings huge violent demonstrations followed in reaction to what protestors claimed were antienvironment and laborabuse policies that the wto encouraged you wouldnt believe the political pressure to make sure this conference happens rutherford said and the economic pressure from megacorporations brockman added they rely on the wto to provide clear sailing for them in third world countries billions of dollars are at stake cavanaugh stood behind jamie as she studied a computer screen that showed images of blockades and barbed wire in downtown new orleans therell be hundreds of diplomats politicians corporate ceos and heads of state theyre all targets with the security crisis were having they cant get the firstclass protection theyre used to why wont the secret service listen to us its the people they take orders from rutherford explained they dont call it the secret service and the diplomatic security service for nothing protections a service industry they need to oblige the people paying the bills what do politicians and diplomats know about whats involved in setting up security theyre too busy wheeling and dealing and asking their protectors to carry their luggage every available gps agent is being routed toward new orleans brockman said well make damned sure nobody gets killed on our watch but some of those agents are replacing dead agents on wellrehearsed teams theyve never worked with itll take them precious time to get up to speed cavanaugh said plus now that protectors know how it feels to be the primary targets will they worry more for their clients or for themselves rutherford wondered oh sure theyre professionals day in day out hardly anybodys braver but how can they focus on defending strangers when theyre worried that theyre the ones wholl be killed or that somebodyll blow up their families the systems dangerously overloaded jamie typed more computer keys accessing images of the crowded docks in the new orleans area while were worrying i hope somebodys checking those ships new orleans has the second busiest port in the united states a dirty bomb would be easy to smuggle in wed better get down there cavanaugh said maybe not rutherford frowned at a message he was handed maybe you can help somewhere else somewhere rutherford showed cavanaugh the piece of paper as you suggested we checked the backgrounds of new subscribers to knife magazines especially blade we began a year before durans name disappeared from blades list all the names were tracked to people with legitimate identities except for these three were still checking we investigated so quickly that we might have made mistakes but do any of those names and addresses mean anything to you cavanaugh stared at the names the last one robert loveless so brockman asked bob loveless was a famous knife maker i emphasize was hes dead could be a coincidence rutherford said but not at that address its a ruralroute number near west liberty iowa thats where lance sawyer lived the old man who taught carl and me to forge blades as the gulfstream took off from teterboro airport and sped toward iowa cavanaugh and jamie unpacked two more bugout bags seated in a leather chair that swiveled rutherford interrupted his appreciation of the jets luxurious interior to study the contents of the bags pistols knives ammunition miniature flashlights duct tape money some soldiers in third world countries arent as well equipped i dont suppose youre licensed to carry those firearms in iowa afraid not cavanaugh said rutherford sighed does this phone work yeah but you need to leave fifty cents on the table after giving cavanaugh a dry look rutherford took a notebook from his suitcoat pocket found a number picked up the phone made his call and identified himself i need to speak to the agent in charge we expect to arrive around your time eleven pm i want to confirm that lodging has been arranged and that your team will be assembled for a six am briefing good also i need temporary lawenforcement credentials for two civilians so they can carry concealed handguns ill give you the serial numbers when we land thank you rutherford set down the phone youre a handy guy to know jamie said as long as you dont expect me to make a habit of pulling strings for you hey we helped you a couple of times cavanaugh said rutherford sighed again in lengthening shadows brockman stared at the glut of traffic and told his driver to leave the car in global protective services garage i can walk home faster call me in an hour ill tell you when to pick me up after the stress of the days events he welcomed the chance to move six feet one inches tall with two hundred and ten pounds of solid muscle he exercised ninety minutes a day using weights a treadmill and a multipurpose flex machine in his apartment although the temperature was forty degrees and he wore only his suit he welcomed the chill as he loosened his tie and took long strides past madison avenue onto fiftythird street stretching his legs dodging pedestrians he almost broke into a run as he reached fifth avenue and headed north the exertion warmed him the blaring horns rumbling engines and choking exhaust of traffic blurred until he was hardly aware of them he concentrated on the satisfaction of using his muscles of feeling blood surge through his veins fiftyeighth street ahead beyond jewelry and designer clothing stores he saw central park stretching away on his left its leaves red yellow and gold in the last of the sun sixtythird street now only the park was on his left its bushes boulders trees and grass looking surreal in the concrete of the city he took out his encrypted cell phone and pressed numbers case he said using the name of a knife manufacturer as a code word he waited for a reply new orleans he explained to the person listening im supposed to fly there tonight cavanaugh has the company jet so i need to go out to la guardia and take a commercial flight he waited for a response then added he went to iowa brockman put the phone away and walked even faster he purged his mind of traffic of pedestrians of bicycle messengers and kids on skateboards he imagined that he hiked through a wilderness far from people and the messes they made in his reverie the only sound was the crackle of his footsteps on fallen leaves as his skin tingled and he inhaled mountain air at seventyfirst he turned right went a block and a half and entered his apartment building there he took the elevator to the tenth floor his forehead was beaded with sweat as he walked along a corridor reached his apartment and unlocked it when he opened the door the intrusion detector began its shrill beep giving him twenty seconds to press buttons on a number pad to the right of the door despite his years in the security profession brockman made the error that virtually every intrusiondetector owner makes the anxiety that the beepbeepbeep created caused him to leave the door open while he pressed the buttons on the pad only when the beeping stopped did he turn toward the door to shut it but the beep beep beep had obscured the sound of approaching footsteps suddenly brockman felt a sharp sensation in his right thigh reaching to draw his pistol from under his suit coat he saw ali karims dark face glaring from the hallway brockmans leg felt warm as the dart in him spread its toxin alis angry features seemed to waver brockman floated backward downward alis blurred hands striking him yanking his pistol away a phone rang muffled as if blankets were wrapped around it hello the voice seemed a faraway whisper it sounded eerily like brockman pick me up to go to the airport no i changed my plans theres something urgent i need to attend to i wont be leaving until tomorrow ill call you silence gathered slowly brockman understood that he was sitting upright his back against something metallic tied against something metallic a sudden light blazed toward his face many bright lights he wanted to paw them away but his arms wouldnt move footsteps the air seemed denser as someone hovered in front of him hey slap wake up slap i know youre faking slap open your damned eyes or ill tape them open so you cant blink brockman warily opened his eyes and squinted from the pain of numerous lamps their shades had been tilted backward their exposed bulbs aimed in his direction nearly blinding him unable to move his head he shifted his eyes this way and that to try to protect them but the heat from the lights was inescapable his right leg where the dart from the tranquilizer gun had struck him felt swollen and throbbed ali stood close before him along with his dark hair his dark features and dark suit he wore dark leather gloves brockman strained to move shifting his eyes blurrily from side to side he saw barbells a treadmill his exercise room his pistol and his cell phone were on a table along with his clawshaped knife its plastic sheath and breakaway chain that ali had found on him he angled his eyes down realizing that he was secured to the flex machine his legs strapped to the legcurl extensions his arms raised and attached to the butterfly extensions i know im not the security leak ali said and cavanaugh was awfully sure kim wasnt after all who would be stupid enough to blackmail her and trust a druggie to deliver information on time and accurately that means you my friend and would you like to know why im sure youre the son of a bitch who told carl duran where our agents would be on what assignments and when brockman relied on his rugged military training on the weeks hed spent in the south african outback with hardly any food and water amid brush fires lions and elephants he gathered all his discipline everything hed ever learned about withstanding interrogation youre making a mistake slap i asked would you like to know why im sure youre the son of a bitch whos the security leak have you gone out of your slap alis glove burned brockmans cheek because protectors are getting killed right and left because all of us are constantly checking over our shoulders wondering if well be next except you my friend ive been watching you the last few days when youre on the street you dont seem the slightest bit threatened or nervous the way the rest of us are youre not acting as if youre worried that somebodys going to stick a knife in you the way im worried now why would that be do you suppose its because youre part of this because you know youre safe brockman didnt answer well weve got time ali said hours and hours tonight tomorrow morning i heard your accent so often over the years i can do a damned good imitation in case anybody telephones i told your driver he wont be needed are you expecting any visitors a friend male or female female shell get suspicious if i dont answer the intercom ill disguise my voice again ali said she knows me too well shell realize it isnt me especially if pain distorts my voice shell get suspicious and call the police so id better take it easy on you is that it ali smiled well at least i got you to answer several questions in a row even if the answers are lies how could you be expecting a girl friend when your driver was expecting to drive you to la guardia slap mustnt lie gerald but weve got plenty of leisure to discuss this first though i think a little exercise will relieve the tension these flex machines are wonderful i hope you dont mind that i took the liberty of rerouting some wires and readjusting some parts nearly blinded by the lights brockman watched as ali pulled a handle its wire was attached to a series of pressureincreasing wheels that ali had attached to the machine the device allowed ali to exert minimal energy in order to move a lot of weight in horror brockman watched as the legcurl extension began to rise unwilled his legs rose with it they felt as if they were going to snap from the enormous weight of barbells tied to his ankles weighing them down sweat burst from his face his mouth opened he thought he was going to scream ali jammed a rag into his mouth immediately he pulled another handle its cable attached to another series of pressureincreasing wheels the machines butterfly extensions moved forward and inward causing brockmans bent arms to follow but the weight against brockmans arms was enormous and his arms had been strapped to the extensions in the reverse of the usual way so that his palms faced outward rather than inward muscles were pulled in unnatural directions backbones crackled he had a terrifying image of a roasted chicken of its overcooked wings being torn off sweat dribbled down his face the scream inside him built until it threatened to propel the rag from his mouth abruptly ali released each handle the machines legcurl and butterfly extensions shot back into place forcing brockmans legs and arms to shoot back with them the excruciating impact sent a shockwave through him pain made his stomach heave ali pulled out the rag just before hot bile filled brockmans mouth now didnt that get the kinks out ali asked theres nothing like working the muscles a little to relax them and unwind at the end of the day and encourage conversation right but before we start our chat lets review the basics of interrogation the absolute certainties that you and i both know no one regardless of how strong and determined can resist a steady assault as sure as the sun rises you know that the combined effect of weakness pain shock trauma fear and disorientation will reduce you to a whimpering nearanimal wholl do anything to stop the agony knowing that youll make bargains with yourself right now youre thinking ill hold back information as long as i can maybe someone will burst in to rescue me or maybe the person im trying not to betray will suspect im being interrogated and take steps to protect himself and the mission that way if i eventually confess it wont matter dont think about a day from now or an hour from now or even a minute from now just concentrate on this moment i can deal with this moment thats a doable task isnt that the attitude you were taught to have when youre being interrogated gerald sure but this is what im going to teach you before tomorrow morning youll tell me everything i want to know or else ill cripple you ill leave your body so broken your senses so impaired youll be a prisoner within yourself for the rest of your long days and nights as i cripple you youll experience pain of a sort you never thought possible pain that wont ever end at last youll talk you know that the question you need to ask is since you realize youll eventually surrender the information why suffer the pain in the meantime of course you need to prove that youre strong and brave i understand and ill give you the chance to show your stuff but the emotions that usually stop someone from talking are loyalty or fear i cant imagine you feel loyal to whoevers killing your fellow protectors so im forced to conclude that you fear this person more than you fear me ill make you a promise gerald tell me what i need to know betray him and ill personally guarantee your protection ill make you another promise gerald if you dont do what i ask ill make you fear me far more than you ever feared the person you report to ali shoved the bilesoaked rag back into brockmans mouth and pulled the levers on the machine faster than before causing brockmans legs and arms to jerk upward and forward with greater force the weight against them threatening to tear sinews and ligaments and pop sockets brockmans vision turned gray again ali removed the rag from brockmans mouth letting bile spew out talk to me gerald tell me about carl duran even when viewed from a wooded hilltop a half mile away the farmhouse barn and outbuildings were obviously in disrepair as the sun rose cavanaugh jamie and rutherford lay on cold ground behind redleaved bushes using binoculars to peer down past the stubble of a cornfield in the middistance a dirt road went from right to left beyond was a field of wild grasses that belonged to one of the few cherished places in cavanaughs memory of his youth the farm where he had spent so many wonderful sundays at least the sundays had once seemed wonderful not because of what he had learned about making knives the knives hadnt been as important to him as the time hed spent with the person he once consideredand believed would always behis closest friend with the sun behind them they didnt need to worry about light reflecting off their binoculars signaling their location even so cavanaugh took care that his were shielded the place looks deserted jamie said porch needs paint roof needs new shingles the barns listing when carl and i visited there the old man kept it in perfect shape he never let age slow him down sounds like someone id like to have known jamie said i doubt john here would have not the way lance was always cussing rutherford looked amused well theres cussing and then theres cussing this was the latter according to the local fbi office after the old man died an english professor from the university in iowa city bought the place rutherford said gentleman farmer sort of thing sold some of the land to the neighbors leased out the rest yeah i remember when i was a teenager cavanaugh felt hollow so much had happened in the meanwhile except for jamie so much of it had been painful four years ago the professor retired and moved to arizona lying on his stomach rutherford scooped up black dirt and studied it thats when bob loveless bought the place seems like duran had a yen for the good old days jamie said rutherford kept examining the dirt in his hand awfully rich soil excellent loam breaks apart easily since when do you know about soil cavanaugh asked my dad was a farmer in arkansas i grew up helping him plow and plant what he wouldnt have given for soil like this youve got all kinds of secrets john none like yours aaron how strange it feels to be called that did the local fbi office talk to the neighbors jamie asked is there any indication that duran actually lived there someone matching durans description lived there off and on four years ago a few of the neighbors dropped by to welcome him they remember he was polite but that he didnt encourage socializing when he smiled it was sort of distant yeah thats carl cavanaugh said as near as they could telltire tracks in snow that sort of thinghe seemed to be there only a week or two at a time so this is where he went between assignments jamie said to cavanaugh the same as you went to jackson hole this was his home close to iowa city and hafor drive where his real home was when he was a kid three houses up the street from mine cavanaugh thought he remembered the twostory homes along the street most were painted an idealized white big front windows thick bushes luxuriant flower beds lush lawns again he felt hollow then three years ago according to the neighbors he pretty much stopped coming rutherford told them thats when the place started looking worn down three years ago cavanaugh nodded after carl got fired and wound up working for that drug lord in colombia the postman who drives this route says bob loveless gets magazines and bills renewal forms advertisements things like that and tax forms cavanaugh said he needs to keep paying his property taxes or else the county will take the farm we need to assume someone comes here to check if theres mail and to forward it maybe the same person who pays his taxes someone wed like to talk to rutherford concluded the mail gets delivered late in the afternoon yesterday when you told us this was the address we wanted the local fbi office had just enough time to intercept the postman and arrange for him to leave some advertisements in the box agents have been watching the place since then so far theres been no sign of activity in the house and nobodys picked up the mail we dont dare go in there until someone stops at the mailbox otherwise we might scare the courier away well just need to lie here and wait maybe not as long as you think jamie pointed to the right a dust cloud appeared moving steadily to the left along the dirt road through his binoculars cavanaugh saw a gray suv approaching the mailbox rutherford spoke into a walkietalkie everybody stay in place until we see what weve got the suv drove closer continuing from right to left cavanaughs pulse increased although he was oddly conscious of the emptiness between heartbeats steady rutherford said into the walkietalkie the suv appeared to go slower as it neared the mailbox despite the dust the car raised the sun reflected off the drivers window braced on his elbows cavanaugh concentrated so much that he leaned forward trying to get closer to the car it passed the mailbox and continued down the road no one spoke for a moment if that was the courier maybe he or she sensed something was wrong and kept going jamie wondered maybe rutherford said or maybe its just someone driving into town another cloud appeared on the road this one caused by a red pickup truck that drove from left to right it sped past the mailbox almost obscuring it with dust the faint drone of the engine drifted away a minute later it was a blue sedan that came from right to left cavanaugh felt an increased sense of being stuck in time while the world sped toward disaster he thought of brockman who should have been in new orleans by now organizing global protective services agents several times the previous night cavanaugh had tried to contact him on his cell phone no response hed tried brockmans home phone again no response rutherford had called the fbi office in new orleans to see if brockman had checked in no sign of him once more cavanaugh pulled out his cell phone but this time instead of trying to call brockman he pressed the numbers for global protective services intending to send an agent to brockmans apartment only to cancel the call when he stared toward the road beyond the field and saw the blue car stop at the mailbox the dust cloud hovered all cavanaugh could see was a vague figure leaning out the far window of the car opening the mailbox steady rutherford said into the walkietalkie this could be somebody putting an advertisement or something into the box a young womanjeans leather jacket blond ponytailstepped from the car she walked to the gate unhooked its chain and swung the gate inward then she got back into the car and drove up the lane toward the house the sound of her engine receding not yet rutherford said to the walkietalkie wait until we see what happens the car reached the house through his binoculars cavanaugh watched the woman get out she stepped onto the porch and tried the front door but found it locked she looked through the windows she proceeded around to the back out of view listening to an earbud linked to the walkietalkie rutherford reported what the other watchers were seeing shes trying the back door its locked also now the slender woman came back into view she tried to get into the barn tried to get into a shed then gave up returned to her car and drove back toward the road go go go rutherford shouted into his walkietalkie abruptly the countryside was in motion camouflaged men with rifles rose from tall weeds near the house vehicles that had been hidden on a nearby farm sped from that property and raced along the road hurrying to block the lane a faint drone became the growing rumble of two enlarging specks on the horizon helicopters speeding toward the farm the womans startled face was visible through the windshield shocked by the sudden appearance of the camouflaged men she urged the car forward armed men blocked the lane the woman swerved into a field desperate to veer around them but now a dark van arrived blocking the open gate as the men with rifles converged on her the cars wheels got stuck in the field tires spun dirt flew through his binoculars cavanaugh saw that the woman had her hands to the sides of her head she was screaming hell of a start to the day jamie said standing they brushed dirt from their outdoor clothes from lying on the cold ground cavanaughs knees felt stiff a long time since i was with delta force he thought you take the car john he pointed toward the back of the hill where their vehicle was parked i need some exercise so do i jamie said rutherford considered them for a moment then nodded descending through stiff brown grass jamie told cavanaugh and maybe you need a little more time to get used to coming back to this farm that too the crunch of his footsteps seemed to come from a distance as cavanaugh gazed ahead past the cars at the entrance to the property past the blue car and the men searching the distraught driver toward the house the barn and especially the building next to the barn he remembered being in the passenger seat as his mother drove him and carl up that lane for their weekly lessons then cavanaughs memory was shattered by the roar of the helicopters landing where his mother had always stopped near the barn instead of two boys getting out of a car men with rifles leapt from the choppers and scurried among the buildings wordless he and jamie reached the lane at the same time rutherford arrived with the car they stepped aside for a van that sped past them toward the house squinting in the cold stark morning sunlight cavanaugh watched the van stop next to a leafless oak tree men hurrying out with dogs cavanaugh pointed toward the woman she was outside the car now slumped against a fender jamie there were no other females on the team yes ill talk to her jamie said taking the opportunity to postpone going up the lane cavanaugh watched jamie speak to the armed men when they stepped back she went over and leaned against the car mirroring the womans slumped posture the woman wiped away tears jamie approximated that gesture by pushing a few strands of hair behind her ears using imitative body language to establish rapport amid the chaos around them they spoke for several minutes at first the woman talked haltingly but soon the full torrent of her distress poured out jamie listening sympathetically guiding her with questions nodding at last pressing a hand on her shoulder she returned to cavanaugh and rutherford her names debbie collins shes a nurse in a doctors office in iowa city lives here in west liberty the rents cheaper every morning she checks if bob lovelessactually she calls him roberthas any mail what was she doing with the doors and looking in the windows rutherford asked thats part of her routine she makes sure nobodys broken in that everythings secure in winter she uses a key and goes inside to check that the furnace keeps the interior at fiftyfive degrees and that the pipes havent frozen she does this every day for the past three years jamie answered except when she visits her parents in des moines or if she takes a vacation but shes never away for long and she always arranges for someone to substitute for her they must be lovers cavanaugh said no then he pays her right sort of a hundred dollars a month what for doing this month in and month out for the past three years thats hardly enough youre sure theyre not lovers the opposite he never tried to touch her she wonders if he might be gay then i dont understand a little over three years ago debbie was in a bar in iowa city saturday night a few beers after seeing a movie with some girl friends early december the group stayed until midnight then split up to go home it started to snow debbie was parked on a side street she hurried to get to her car so she could drive home before the weather turned worse one moment she was fumbling in her purse to find her car key the next moment two guys grabbed her while a third pulled up in a van she struggled they punched her they dragged her into the van and before the first guy could close the side hatch his buddy was already using a knife to cut off her clothes the driver started to speed away when all of a sudden another guy lunged through the halfclosed hatch the stranger knocked the first attacker senseless when the one with the knife attacked the stranger pulled out a knife of his own debbie says she can still here the scream when the stranger slammed into the guy did something with the knife and threw the guy out into the snow meanwhile the driver stopped the van jumped out and ran away before the stranger could get to him duran rutherford said who as far as she knows is named robert loveless jamie continued the men reeked of whiskey the knife they used makes her think they might have killed her after they raped her then what happened rutherford asked the stranger managed to get her to calm down enough to tell him where her car was her overcoat was in shreds her clothes were half cut off so he wrapped her in his own coat and carried her to her car her purse was in the snow by the drivers door the key was where shed dropped it he unlocked the car put her in the passenger seat got the car started so shed be warm and then told her he was taking her to the hospital not hurt she told him she was thinking about being brought into the emergency ward halfnaked then ill drive you to the police he told her she didnt want that either shed still be halfnaked people staring at her as she clutched his coat shed been drinking the police would probably think shed asked for it suddenly an engine roared while they were distracted one of the attackers had come back and escaped with the van the two other men had run off so now there wasnt any way for the police to investigate the assault i want to go home she managed to say between sobs all i want is to go home the stranger told her hed drive her but she was suddenly afraid to be alone with him she told him that where she lived was too far that she didnt want him to go out of his way she kept insisting she could drive so finally he got out of the car and despite the storm she did manage to drive home to west liberty the next morning she discovered how bruised she was and fully realized how close shed come to possibly being killed she also discovered that she still had the strangers overcoat then what cavanaugh asked around noon a car pulled into her driveway a lean lanky man got out and knocked on her door the temperature was almost zero but instead of a coat he wore a sweater debbie was afraid to answer the door but finally she couldnt bear watching him stand out there freezing so she opened a window to talk to him and thats when she discovered he was the man whod helped her the previous night it turns out he was so worried about her that he got in his car and followed her home making sure she didnt have an accident or slide into a ditch if she didnt mind hed like his coat back well of course she had to invite him in and offer him some coffee he kept a respectful distance taking care not to make her feel nervous about having a stranger in the house she thanked him for going out of his way that made him smile and when she asked him why he said he was surprised to find that they were practically neighbors he lived two miles down the road imagine that cavanaugh said when he reached to take the coffee cup from her debbie noticed the fresh bandage on his wrist the man with the knife had cut him imagine that rutherford said so they became friends jamie continued he kept treating her with respect never making a romantic move although she wished he would eventually he told her he needed to leave the farm for a while he was a construction worker but because of the cold weather hed been unemployed for a while and now hed learned that his father who lived in miami was sick with emphysema so he was going to florida to find work and take care of his dad but would she please watch the farm for him forward his mail little things like that hed be glad to pay her cavanaugh said after all it was the least she could do rutherford added so you get the picture jamie asked classic recruitment rutherford concluded almost makes me proud of him cavanaugh said bitterly the guys a natural does she realize it was all a setup rutherford asked jamie duran scouted the west liberty area spotted her found out she was single followed her learned her habits and then paid those three guys to pretend to attack her she hasnt the faintest idea nice to be innocent cavanaugh said i wrote down the miami address where she forwards the mail jamie handed rutherford a piece of paper and from where a drug courier probably forwarded the mail to colombia rutherford said the question is where is durans mail being forwarded now he pulled out his cell phone pressed numbers and began reading the address to someone the woman says duran came back here yesterday jamie said he told her he needed to leave something for a friend cavanaugh stared up the lane toward the building next to the barn for several moments he didnt seem to breathe brockmans legs and arms were racked with pain his left calf muscle feeling torn his right rotator cuff about to snap the pain combined with his nausea and the heat from the unshielded lamps made him sweat so much that his shirt and suit coat were drenched the strap that attached his neck to the spine of the flex machine made him feel increasingly strangled the glaring lights hurt his eyes but no matter how often he blinked he couldnt get rid of the spots that the lights seared into his vision abruptly the spots turned gray they swirled and wavered ali slapped both cheeks with his leather gloves wake up gerald its not polite to pass out when youve got company conversation gerald thats what a guest wants stimulation what i wouldnt give for an intelligent discussion about oh say rome four years ago that russian oil tycoon who was assassinated now that would be interesting despite how sick brockman felt he desperately needed water to soothe his parched lips to clear the taste of bile from his mouth i bet i can read your mind i bet youre thirsty right gerald brockman closed his eyes ali peeled their lids upward thirsty hang tough brockman thought take it a moment at a time hope for somebody to break in and rescue me make ali believe id rather die than tell him anything but what if it comes to that i might in fact die stop thinking like that ali held up a pitcher filled with water and ice cubes he swirled the cubes making them clink against the pitcher on the outside moisture beaded trickling down like rain on a window gerald im getting tired of asking if youre thirsty brockman tried to nod but the straps kept his head in place yes his voice reminded him of the sound of a boot breaking crusted mud thats all you needed to say ali poured ice cubes and water into a glass inserted a straw and raised it to brockmans lips easy only a little at a time you dont want to get sick brockman sucked on the straw feeling the delicious cold water fill his mouth ali took the glass away as brockman swallowed and ran his wet tongue over his crusted lips he had thought that the crust was from dried bile but now he tasted the copper of blood ali dipped a cloth into a basin of water he twisted the excess from it and pressed the cloth against brockmans forehead he stroked brockmans cheeks with it the cloth felt wonderfully cool the russian gerald tell me about the russian this doesnt need to be difficult the russian was long ago four years ago i dont want you to talk about whats happening now four years ago its safe to talk about that its safe to talk about the russian through his groggy nauseaandpainfilled thoughts brockman tried to decide what to do stay silent suffer more pain or try to string ali along seem to give him information but not really tell him anything stop him from have more water gerald ali lifted the glass extending the straw brockman opened his mouth at once ali shoved the rag into it then yanked the handles on the flex machine thrusting brockmans legs up propelling his arms inward brockmans rotator cuff ripped he could hear it give like a zipper being yanked open in the blazing lights his mind went black fire filled his throat he fought to breathe coughing mouth open rag gone water streaming over his head dripping cooling shadows have more water gerald brockman blearily opened his eyes and saw that ali had turned off most of the lamps the one that stayed lit had its shade adjusted properly shielding the bulbs glare his parched burned skin felt refreshingly cool ali took away the basin part of the contents of which he had poured over brockmans head again ali extended the glass and the straw desperately thirsty brockman studied it afraid that when he opened his mouth ali would again yank away the straw and shove the rag between his lips he was conscious of his wet hair clinging to his scalp drink gerald brockman opened his mouth and sucked on the straw he rinsed bile from his tongue he spit it out unable to project it far some of it landing on his pants he sucked more water swirling it swallowing purifying his throat i promise to protect you from carl duran ali said he kind of seems in control dont you think brockman murmured all the protectors whove already died nobody could protect them the shadows in the room were luxurious he wanted to close his eyes and i can fix it so you seem to disappear gerald hed never be able to find you disoriented brockman realized that ali had managed to engage him in a conversation a sin of being interrogated that had to be avoided at all cost at all cost brockman thought groggily look at what its already cost me after the last three years do i care anymore do i want to keep living like this he licked his coppery tasting lips what if ali waited what if hes not the one im afraid of brockman asked then who are you afraid of all of you need more water ali extended the straw brockman sipped ali prompted him afraid of all of us protectors afraid of what youll do if you find out ali set down the glass and raised an electrical box with a switch on it and numerous plugs attached to it when he flicked the switch the room blazed again all the lamps were attached to the box all the bulbs suddenly glaring no brockman groaned the heat swept over him from the shadows behind the glare ali asked what are you afraid well find out suppose i did something something sleepy feel sleepy dont worry gerald the glare and the heat of the lights will keep you awake what did you do how can you protect me from stay awake gerald or i might need to tear your other rotator cuff protect you from what keep me from being punished a deal gerald is that what youre asking me to make with you a promise to protect you from carl duran and from your fellow protectors can you do it i promise you this you tell me what i want to hear and ill look after you as if youre my closest friend ill do everything in my power to get you out of whatever trouble youre in itd be a be a what gerald relief the bastard held it over me for so long tell me ali said the building was made of weathered boards it was twentyfeetsquare singlelevel with a dusty window on two sides and a black stovepipe protruding from its sloped roof the door was blank wood on leashes two dogs sniffed at it they dont seem interested one of their handlers said the same as the other buildings so far no indication of explosives the second handler told cavanaugh cavanaugh looked aroundat men coming in and out of the farmhouse whose door theyd rammed in at other men searching the barn whose padlock theyd cut no indication of radiation either a man said walking over with a geiger counter a dirty bomb or anything like that or smallpox or anthrax another man said he held a compact device programmed to identify the dna of selected bacteria and viruses his hands were covered with latex gloves and the place tests negative for stashes of drugs rutherford said joining them a man with bolt cutters indicated the buildings locked door shall i do the honors cavanaugh walked to where a window provided an inside view of the door through the dusty glass he didnt see any sign of a booby trap but even though trained dogs had failed to indicate that they smelled explosives he needed to be sure reaching into a windbreaker he pulled out a twist tie free the lock he told the man with the bolt cutters when the lock fell to the ground cavanaugh eased the door open a quarter inch knelt inserted the twist tie through the narrow gap and slowly raised the pliant strip from the ground alert for any sign of resistance from a wire attached to a detonator while jamie aimed her flashlight searching for a reflection off a wire cavanaugh drew the twist tie along the entire door anybody care to step back he asked the group they thought about it wouldnt hurt to crouch behind that car one of the dog handlers said john why dont you and jamie go with them cavanaugh asked what jamie did instead was cautiously open the door sunlight pierced shadows dust on the floor showed the footprints of someone whod recently gone in and out the marks were large presumably a mans they led past a metal stove that the old man had used for burning wood in the winter they passed a dusty anvil and a table of equally dusty forging tools cavanaugh had worked with them so often that even after many years he recognized them as the old mans especially the battered anvil the footprints veered around a waisthigh metal container that had a propane tank attached to it the old mans forge they led to another dusty table upon which an envelope was set against a small wooden box the box was made of oak so polished that it reflected cavanaughs flashlight the box was open it was lined with green felt into which was nestled the most beautiful knife cavanaugh had ever seen hey he warned himself pay attention he and jamie looked for wires stretched across the shadowy floor as cavanaugh approached the far table he stayed clear of the footprints preserving them as evidence but the closer he came the more he found it difficult to take his eyes from the envelope and the contents of the box at last he stopped before them the envelope had handwriting on it neat solid strokes in black ink to aaron looks like youve got a pen pal rutherford said its carls handwriting trying to ignore the beckoning knife cavanaugh reached for the envelope but then hesitated turning toward the door he saw one of the technicians peering in youd better check this the technician followed the trail cavanaugh and jamie had made in the dust he moved his detector over the envelope and the knife no pathogens at least none that this device is programmed for got any more gloves the technician reached into a jacket pocket and gave him a pair after putting them on cavanaugh picked up the envelope and saw that it was sealed he tore it open removed a sheet of paper and cautiously unfolded it the handwritten message had the same neat solid strokes it was dated one day earlier aaron do you ever miss lance i used to lie awake nights wishing that old bastard was my father and you were my brother all the adventures you and i had old buddy you need to be reminded of the military virtues loyalty courage honor and sacrifice thanks to them we were able to fight our way out of a lot of trouble because we knew we could depend on one another loyalty thats the greatest virtue and aaron as i told you on the radio you werent a good enough friend you should have backed me up when i got fired i felt like youd cut my parachute lines i know you thought i killed that stalker to impress that twat singer the truth is i did it to impress you i expected you to say damned good job man you sure showed that piece of shit instead you let me get fired okay i made a mistake but a true friend doesnt turn against another friend just because of a mistake a friendships supposed to be stronger than that you cant choose your parents but you can choose a friend trust thats what a friendships about being able to count on somebody no matter what well buddy i sure found out i couldnt count on you none of this would have happened otherwise i hope youre satisfied of course you were supposed to be in a grave in wyoming and not know any of this you always could rise to a challenge not that it matterstwo days from now not even you will be able to find me just to show im big enough to stop hating you heres a present i think its the best knife i ever made carl cavanaugh showed the letter to the group so now hes justifying what hes done rutherford asked this doesnt feel right and whats the significance of the knife jamie wondered its beautiful i admit the handle is it covered with gold quartz cavanaugh said and those red dots they look like rubies embedded in gold rivets cavanaugh said the slender knife was eleven inches long five inches of which were the amazing handle cavanaugh couldnt take his gaze off it michael price he finally said i dont understand old san francisco cavanaugh kept staring at the knife then he felt that he was being stared at breaking his concentration he looked up at jamie and rutherford who watched him puzzled whos michael price jamie asked old san francisco eighteen fortyeight the village had a population of about four hundred people when gold was discovered at sutters mill a hundred miles away within a year two hundred thousand miners passed through san francisco on their way to the gold fields the town was so undeveloped that necessities had to be brought in by ship knives were some of those necessities in the east most communities had blacksmiths who could forge crude blades but quality knives needed to be imported from manufacturers in england suddenly in san francisco a market developed for thousands of knives dependable ones blades that could be trusted to hold an edge while they pried nuggets from a stream and protected those nuggets from thieves a shipment of knives took a year to travel from england to san francisco seizing the opportunity knife makers began setting up forges and charging top dollar soon a distinctive style and a high level of expertise became common one of those knife makers was michael price who came to san francisco in the mid s and whose clients were some of the richest most powerful men in the community judges bankers merchants and realestate moguls were wealthy beyond their fantasies to show it they dressed extravagantly including the knives they carried for selfdefense michael prices elegant designs were characterized by a handle made of gold diamonds mother of pearl and other precious materials the blade was enclosed in an elaborately engraved silver sheath attached prominently to a dress belt customers vied with each other to have the most beautiful subtle and yet ostentatious knife theyre proof that knives can be works of art cavanaugh said knife collectors search for them recently a michael price dagger sold at auction for almost a hundred thousand dollars one way master blade smiths prove their skill is by replicating a michael price knife cavanaugh pointed toward the knife in the box carl did it flawlessly at the back of the handle you see that screw if you detach it you can take the handle apart and spread it out in small pieces the grip the bands that hold it onto the tang the various fittings that form the guard each of those tiny parts is perfectly crafted as if hypnotized jamie reached for it cavanaugh stopped her i dont think thats a good idea why the blade should be gleaming it should have a satin polish but it doesnt its finish is dull still wanting to touch the enticing knife jamie said sure it has dust on it after a day cavanaugh said there wouldnt be that much dust no carl put something on it probably the handle also im betting its some kind of topical poison something that the pathogen detectors havent been programmed for you wouldnt need to cut yourself skin contact would be enough youd probably die instantly jamie jerked her hand away playing with us showing how smart he is hes pissed at being rejected and hes getting back at everybody cavanaugh reread the letter he says that in two days hes going to disappear the message is dated a day ago so tomorrow somethings going to happen new orleans the world trade organization jamie said cavanaughs cell phone rang reluctant to be distracted he looked at its screen the name made him frown ali karim he pressed a button and said to the phone theres no point in trying to persuade me to change my mind i cant even think about reinstating you until we finish the investigation yeah well i believe youll reinstate me a lot sooner than that alis voice said i just had a hearttoheart talk with gerald he says you figured out carl duran is arranging an attack in new orleans the world trade organization cavanaugh cut him off if youre the security leak you knew that already every available agents been sent there right alis voice asked ditto the secret service the diplomatic security service and the us marshals i cant discuss any of it cavanaugh told him then lets discuss this alis voice ordered the agents are the real targets a chill made cavanaughs chest contract stay away from new orleans alis voice rose thats where carl duran wants everybody to go its a trap part seven the most expensive knife in the world what you did to me brockmans features were contorted with pain none of it matters i can bear anything certainly ali said it had been a long painful night im as tough as you are if i talk its not because you got the better of me of course not carl duran matters then well need to make sure he keeps away from you the only way to guarantee that is to kill him brockman said tell me what you know ill see what i can arrange dont you think i had plans to kill him but first you need to find the bastard strapped to the flex machine brockmans body was rigid with anguish and if anything happens to him he left instructions for someone he trusts to release documents about me unless you tell me i cant help you brockman took a long breath duran had nothing to do with the hit on the russian ali leaned forward concentrating to hear brockmans faint words i did brockman said i arranged the hit on the russian the revelation was far from what ali expected concealing his surprise he asked you why money we get paid a lot not enough to risk our lives for strangers not those kinds of strangers do you ever hate them hate i grew up in pretoria anger cut through brockmans pain in the alleys i fought for a cardboard box to sleep in for the rags on my back for every scrap of food i managed to get my hands on as sweat ran down his face brockman stared fiercely ahead when i got big enough i thought hell ive been fighting all my life might as well join the military he took another anguished breath turned out i was rightit wasnt any worse than what id already been through in many ways it was better all the shit i had to do to qualify for special ops nights in the bush country with wild fires water holes dry the petrol my instructors put in the only food id been given to eat even then it was still better brockmans eyes were fierce because i proved i was special because i had something to be proud of my discipline my skills brockmans voice cracked ali put the straw in his mouth letting him drink then i got too old brockman said thirty too old shit so i went to work for gps he said with contempt and was assigned to protect some of the most wealthy attractive and powerful people in the world id read about people like that but nothing prepared me for meeting them they owned penthouses villas jets yachts islands anything they wanted in a world of poverty starvation and pain they were blessed brockman inhaled they took it for granted vain arrogant domineering greedy and disgusting i hated them ali used a cool washcloth to rub sweat from brockmans face when i left the commandos all i had were scars and empty pockets these people had everything but they didnt have the character to deserve it the worst of them the biggest pig of tall was that russian ali listened harder id been assigned to him two years earlier before i was promoted his language was filthy his manners were brockman faltered shouting bragging insulting i once saw him vomit in the middle of a business dinner on the floor next to him must have been the red wine with the fish he said and told the waiter to bring him more vodka he was a subhuman whod bullied his way into an oil fortune bound rigidly to the machine brockman tried to lower his eyes toward his swollen knees do you think they can be repaired or will i be crippled ali didnt answer well my days of jumping from aircraft were probably over anyhow brockman stared into an imaginary distance i wanted what those clients had the penthouses the yachts the villas the islands i overheard stock tips every day these people made fortunes on insider knowledge so when i learned about a drug company that would soon be bought by a rival for double its value i invested everything i had in it i borrowed heavily brockman lapsed into a selfhating chuckle the stock tip was only a rumor the drug company went bankrupt i lost it all rough break ali said wasnt it though the next time the russian hired gps to protect him the rome assignment the one i worked on yes as ali wiped more sweat from his face brockman said the russians enemies were expert they needed someone familiar with how he was protected another selfhating chuckle somehow they got word of how much i hated the russian somehow they learned about how desperate i was for money i often wonder if they didnt arrange for me to hear the stock tip about the drug company they set you up brockman tried to shrug but he was bound too tightly to the machine they promised to pay off my debt they promised to set my finances back the way theyd been all i needed to do was arrange for a man i despised to be killed you were in new york while i was in charge of his protective team in rome ali said every time i reported to you you told the hit team what i said you kept telling me that he wouldnt stay away from the windows in his hotel suite so you passed that information on telling the sniper where to take his position it was so easy brockman said the son of a bitch was no longer on the planet and my debts vanished carl duran had nothing to do with the hit nothing he had no influence on me when he sliced up that stalker in front of the plaza hotel i didnt have the slightest reason to keep him from being fired then how does this relate to the damned sniper after duran was fired after he went to work for a drug lord in colombia he and the sniper crossed paths brockmans voice became thicker sounding as if hed swallowed sand try ali said giving him more water were almost there thisll soon be over tell me about the sniper duran and the sniper compared notes talking about former assignments the sniper told duran about your involvement in the russians death everything brockman grimaced with selfloathing duran threatened to expose me at the least it would have put me in prison more than likely it would have gotten me killed the russian had two brothers almost as vicious as he was theyd have brockmans voice trailed off you didnt see an alternative you had to let duran blackmail you into providing information about our agents and their assignments so there you have it brockman said with greater selfdisgust no i dont have it why is duran doing this brockman didnt answer so ali shoved the rag back into his mouth and pulled handles on the flex machine five minutes later after tearing brockmans left rotator cuff after brockman completed his silent scream ali removed the gag why is he doing this i dont know ali reached for the handles on the machine but ive got a strong suspicion when brockman told him ali felt his stomach turn cold in the shed cavanaugh clutched his cell phone listening to what ali told him how do i know this is true if you dont believe me alis voice said maybe youll believe gerald cavanaugh heard a bump as the phone was repositioned alis voice was now muffled by distance tell him damn it tell him what you just told me another bump then brockmans painridden voice said i it was me im the security leak tell him about new orleans ali insisted in the background brockman obeyed hoarsely between difficult breaths his thick words sounded as if they were forced through swollen lips cavanaugh felt that the shadows around him got darker staring at the michael price knife that carl had expertly reproduced smelling the dust and the old metal around him he was hardly aware of jamie and rutherford reacting to his strained features alis voice returned now do you believe me stay with him dont leave the apartment ill send a team to protect you get a doctor for gerald ali said cavanaugh broke the connection then quickly arranged the help hed promised as he hurried toward the door he told jamie and rutherford what ali had discovered after the murky interior the glare of the cold sun was blinding passing members of the search team taking long strides down the lane toward rutherfords car cavanaugh said at yesterdays meeting we tried to find a link among the agents who were killed with sharp weapons brockman steered the conversation we were looking for a common denominator based on their previous assignments or the military units theyd been in but it was brockman who suggested their past assignments didnt matter the next assignments brockman made us look at those i can still hear him saying the world trade organization that was his final job in case we missed the significance of the blade killings carl ordered him to make sure we noticed the connection he wanted to focus us on new orleans the note carl left here reinforced that idea but why would he go out of his way to warn us when and where the attack will be rutherford asked every available agents been sent there duran wants to destroy as many targets as possible but he doesnt care about the trade ministers and corporate executives at the conference theyre a bonus the agents are his targets hes already strained the system now he wants to bring it to its knees if he cripples the entire us security network itll take months to train new operators meanwhile whoever hired him will be able to attack domestic targets at will the warehouse was next to the mississippi despite dampness that rose from the floor the building was used as a dormitory cots with sleeping bags formed three rows twenty in each men sat on the cots cleaning weapons others sat at tables playing manhunter video games or watching action movies that emphasized accurate tradecraft ample food was available after the punishing youth most of these men had known after their prison experience after the pride and discipline theyd acquired at the training camp they were content when a side door opened they looked toward a man silhouetted by sunlight his tall lanky figure and powerfullooking forearms were immediately recognizable dressed in hiking boots multipocketed pants and a slightly large shirt hanging over his hidden gun he closed the door obscuring two men outside who looked like dock workers but were actually sentries as he walked to a podium the men gathered before him without needing to be told each assumed a military posture with his feet apart and his hands behind his back good afternoon gentlemen carls voice echoed off the metal walls eyes alert they nodded in response to the respectful way he addressed them lets deal with the most important thing first are you getting enough to eat they chuckled well are you yes sir taste good yes sir nothing beats new orleans cooking oysters crawfish shrimp in creole sauce pecancrusted catfish red beans and cajun rice praline bread pudding lord im making myself hungry they laughed when we get this job done ill arrange a feast worthy of antoines or some other of those fancy restaurants around here in the meantime just remember when theres ample tasty chow make sure you take advantage you never know when famine follows feast thats a soldiers law got all the equipment you need they nodded if you have any doubts about the weapon you were given get another one load up on ammunition after all youre not paying for it they laughed again speaking of pay this finelooking gentleman over here carl indicated raoul has your next months cash you can pick it up after the briefing guns money and respect this was heaven i mentioned work are you ready to get down to it yes sir positive yes sir then heres the drill tomorrow a conference starts they call it the world trade organization and it brings a ton of important people to town politicians billionaires the fat cats who run international corporations it also brings a ton of people who think the world trade organization wants to chop down the worlds forests and stripmine whats left they believe it wants to keep poor folks in the mud so rich guys can get richer by paying twenty cents an hour in an overseas factory and then slapping a big price tag on shoes and shirts or whatever they make these protestors start a riot it always happens its as sure as sunrise and sunset they riot which is where we come in the people we work for want us to help the rioters they want us to make this a really impressive riot a riot the world trade organization will never forget to make them think twice about chopping down forests and stripmining and paying poverty wages so how are we going to make this the endall and beall of riots were going to give each of you one of these carl held up a battered knapsack that looked as if it had been tied to a truck and dragged along a dirt road for ten miles the group studied it the only time anyone would ever pay attention to the nondescript object each of these knapsacks has a smoke canister in it youre going to mix with the crowd therell be so many protestors thousands of them that no onell pay attention to you each knapsack has a number go over to the map on the wall and find your number on it convention center boulevard fulton street commerce street poydras street along riverwalk outside harrahs casino up past lafayette square duncan plaza the city hall each street has one of your numbers thats where youll place yourself and when the riot gets going when they start torching cars and smashing windows and throwing molotov cocktails when the police march in to stop the festivities youre going to find a place to hide your knapsack at eleven hundred hours on those expensive synchronized navy seal watches you were given youll tug this cord here and trigger your smoke canister wait until the smokes thick enough with all these knapsacks evenly spaced therell be plenty as soon as the cops cant see you draw your gun and rapid fire above everybodys head we dont want to kill anybody just scare them sixty guns going off itll sound like a war but nobodyll be able to see you to know youre doing the shooting the riotersll think the cops are doing it the copsll think its the rioters therell be screaming and yelling and stampeding use all your ammo drop your piece make sure youve got these stickon latex pads on your finger tips so you dont leave prints and make sure you wore gloves when you loaded the magazines so there wont be any prints on the ejected cartridges then get out of there rendezvous two days from now at the campground i told you about near galveston texas well celebrate and plan the next mission your part in all this shouldnt take more than a minute but it requires steady nerves thats why youve been training a cando attitude dependability resolve control a cool head thats the secret to getting along in life gentlemen youre not punks anymore prove it show me how professionals behave but being a professional also means knowing your limitations if theres anybody here who doesnt think hes ready who needs more training tell me now and you can walk away with no hard feelings about a dozenthe least sociopathiclooked hesitant but no one raised a hand good bowie said then get your cash and your knapsack find your place on the map make sure your weapons ready get plenty to eat and a good nights sleep ill talk to you tomorrow morning as carl stepped from the podium the men formed a line in front of raoul who distributed the money mr culloden carl said to one of the men when you first came to us you looked soft and pale from solitary confinement you were puffy from lack of exercise and the starchy crap the prison called food now youre solid youve got a healthy glow you ought to be paying me for treating you to a spa culloden chuckled right mr bowie but if its all the same to you ill keep the cash carl continued his banter making the men grin and feel part of a cherished team sometimes he shook hands or gave a man a goodnatured slap on the back but as he scanned the line concealing his calculated assessment he noticed that a halfdozen men hung back they waited while the majority pocketed their money and drifted back to cleaning guns playing video games watching action movies and eating the best buffet in new orleans mr bowie one of them said knowing where this was headed carl replied yes we uh weve been wondering another man said did you mean it that if we didnt think we were up to this we didnt have to do it this isnt a dictatorship mr todd i believe that the best team is one thats totally voluntary then another man said yes mr weaver i think ive got myself in enough trouble for one lifetime i dont need any more its not as if youre going to kill anybody carl said all you need to do is activate the smoke canister and shoot into the air i guess i was more comfortable holding up gas stations but i dont even want to do that now totally voluntary carl said i wont pretend im not disappointed a lot of effort went into training you but if you cant commit to the mission youre doing everybody a favor by admitting it youre sure you wont change your mind they didnt respond okay then carl sighed naturally you wont get next months wages and naturally you cant stay with the team any longer but i cant let you stay in new orleans either if you get drunk you might stagger into some bar in the french quarter and say more than you should we wouldnt do that mr bowie you know you can count on us all the same mr weaver you have an alcohol problem that made you do things that put you in prison you also mr todd ill arrange for the six of you to stay in a motel for a couple of days outside town stock it with booze get takein food i dont want you out in public no sir two days from now you can leave the motel and it wont matter what you tell anybody after that todd looked relieved thanks mr bowie bowie told raoul bring the van ten minutes later raoul was driving them through dense traffic west on interstate the setting sun hurt his eyes as they left the city he said mr bowie says the motel cant be fancy nothing where you need to show a credit card and leave a trail youve got plenty of cash you havent been able to spend use it that placell do he pointed toward something called the escort inn as long as its near a liquor store todd said i havent had a drink since an hour after i got out of prison then bowie convinced me to go to his damned camp and that was the end of that hey weaver said theres a liquor store across the street they stocked up with beer bourbon scotch vodka gin soft drinks potato chips onion dip beef jerky and a deck of cards then drove to a parking lot at the side of the motel ill wait here while you register raoul said in case the mission turns to merde you dont want to be seen with me right good idea we dont want to be linked to what goes on in town ask for rooms in back less chance of anybody noticing me park back there while you unload this stuff yeah well tell the clerk we want to be away from the noise of traffic five minutes later the six men returned from the motels lobby raoul drove them to their rooms in back ground floor todd said proudly we wont be seen carrying all this stuff up the stairs raoul watched them take the booze and food into one of the rooms everybody set he asked from the doorway need anything more a couple of hookers todd said smirking mr bowie doesnt want you talking to anybody raoul warned yeah okay dont get bent out of shape i was just making a joke one of the men twisted the cap off a jim beam bottle another popped the tab on a budweiser can while a third turned on the television see if they get the history channel weaver said maybe theyll have a program about machine guns or something else thats neat gotta use the bathroom raoul said he went in closed the door urinated and flushed the toilet he pulled two beretta fifteenround handguns from under his baggy shirt he attached sound suppressors that he took from pouches on his belt when he opened the door he heard a tv announcer describing the invention of the ak assault rifle stepping from the bathroom he emptied both pistols into the six men the suppressors made sounds as if a pillow fight were taking place the ninemillimeter ammunition had fragmentation tips that disintegrated in their targets instead of passing through and piercing walls alerting someone outside or in a neighboring room raoul searched for and picked up every expelled cartridge a few of them taking longer to find than he intended even if somehow he didnt locate every one it wouldnt have been calamitoushed worn gloves when he loaded the weapons taking care that he didnt leave fingerprints on the shells but without empty cartridges the investigators wouldnt have firingpin marks and extraction scratches that could provide ballistics evidence linking raouls pistols to the crime scene for certain the bullets were so mangled and fragmented that they wouldnt provide ballistics evidence in addition raoul planned to wipe his fingerprints from the pistols and abandon the weapons the moment it was safe to do so as mr bowie had taught him survival depended on details he removed cash from the bodies then he cleaned his prints off the toilet lever and the few other things hed touched leaving the unit about to lock the door behind him he heard the history channel announcer explain that the communistera inventor of the ak never received royalties from it hearing a barge chug past on the mississippi carl pressed buttons on his cell phone and yet again got a recording that told him to leave a message he pressed a different set of buttons and got a similar message he interrupted the transmission and brooded it had been twentyfour hours since he and brockman had been in touch brockman was supposed to have flown to new orleans the previous evening this morning he was supposed to have reported to the global protective services base here and evaluated the security preparations for the world trade organization conference he would then have spoken with his counterparts in the various government protective services when he knew the schedules and the routes that various agents would use to escort their clients to the convention center he was under orders to get in touch with carl and inform him of the details had brockman decided that he could no longer tolerate being part of this had he fled was he being detained for questioning because the latter had the more serious implications carl was forced to give weight to it in the worstcase scenario how long would brockman resist interrogation would he be weak enough to confess his involvement in the deaths of so many operators would he tell the authorities that carl manipulated them into sending as many agents as possible to new orleans disloyalty was the worst sin for a final time carl angrily pressed brockmans numbers on his cell phone youre lucky im on retainer to global protective services the doctor was a spectacled fiftyyearold whod once been a nurse in a mobile military hospital she nodded toward brockman who lay in his bed groggy from pain relievers hell need physical therapy on his knees and his torn rotator cuffs she told ali considering all the damage you inflicted another doctor would have phoned the police talk to cavanaugh ali said hell explain why it needed to be done this way down the hall in the exercise room brockmans cell phone rang it wasnt the first time several times throughout the interrogation calls had been attempted none of which ali had answered most callers had left messages all of them related to gps business wondering why brockman hadnt reported for work in new orleans only one caller had not left a message the phones display had shown the name william scagel and a telephone number now as the phone rang again ali left the bedroom and walked to the exercise room after six rings the phone stopped ali went to a table where the cell phone sat next to brockmans pistol and claw knife its display again showed the name william scagel troubled he unclipped his own phone from his belt and pressed numbers two rings later cavanaugh answered i hope this is good news just a question does the name william scagel mean anything to you hell yes scagel was a famous knife maker where did his name come up hes been calling brockmans cell phone and his home phone but he doesnt leave a message the transmission was silent for a moment its carl hang on lets find out if he left a message this time ali pressed buttons on brockmans cell phone whats the telephone number on the display cavanaughs voice asked ali dictated the numbers to him then listened for a message on brockmans phone an electronic hiss indicated that something had in fact been recorded leaning against the table shifting brockmans weapons aside ali waited hopeful the hiss was interrupted by an electronic shriek the exercise room blew apart carl clipped his cell phone onto his belt and put his small radio transmitter into a camera bag he carried he strolled along the riverfront nodding to tourists pretending to admire boats on the mississippi although what attracted his attention were more police officers than usual and numerous barricades stacked to the side in preparation for tomorrows demonstrations he imagined brockmanmore likely an interrogatorlistening to brockmans phone hoping to hear a message but the only message was the trigger signal from carls radio transmitter he reasoned that the claw knife hed given brockman wouldnt be far he imagined the radio signal reaching the miniature detonator in the knifes sheath the blast from the powerful explosive molded into the sheath would have destroyed everything around it one instant the transmission cavanaugh listened to was alive the next it was dead that word came involuntarily to cavanaughs mind dead en route to new orleans aboard gpss jet he felt something inside him drop reminding himself that phone communication on an aircraft wasnt reliable that an electronic glitch might have interrupted the transmission he stifled his premonition and called alis cell phone again but the only response he got was a computerized voice that told him the number he had called was unavailable is something wrong jamie asked im afraid there is cavanaugh hurriedly called gps headquarters in manhattan the duty officer had already heard from two gps agents outside brockmans apartment an explosion tightness took cavanaughs breath away he lowered the phone god damn you carl when the gulfstream landed in new orleans a row of emergency vehicles waited the lights on their roof racks flashing in the darkness somber officials with handguns under their jackets formed a protective square as cavanaugh jamie and rutherford stepped from the jet into louisianas humid air the phone number your man read to you before he was killed has a local area code a secret service agent told cavanaugh william scagel bought the phone yesterday in st charles twenty miles from here carl probably didnt do it in person someone working for him did the honors so the clerk couldnt provide an accurate description the address the buyer gave was bogus what a surprise ill bet several other phones got purchased in various other storesby the same person using more fake names and ids rutherford said police officers flanked a van accompanied by fbi agents cavanaugh jamie and rutherford scrambled inside the moment the side door was secured the driver headed toward an exit gate cruisers to the front and back we cant assume carl will keep that phone much longer cavanaugh said as they sped onto a freeway is the satellite in position ready and willing an agent answered the eyes and ears of the sky are aimed at new orleans then do it the agent spoke into a walkietalkie baker to butcher do you copy affirmative a voice replied commence tracking tracking engaged the agent nodded to cavanaugh who pulled out his cell phone and pressed the numbers ali had dictated to him seconds before he was killed the group watched intently but cavanaugh was conscious only of the phone pressed against his ear and the sound of ringing at the other end one two three he got rid of the phone rutherford said if anybody does answer itll probably be a junkie cavanaughs heart sped as carls voice said hello aaron the van swayed veering around car lights on the freeway good guess carl no guessing involved i know you old buddy i can predict what youll do same here cavanaugh noted that there was something odd about the sound he heard music and laughter in the background carls voice was muffled and distant you were sure id call unless you were interrogating gerald brockman in which case youd be a smear across a wall right now acid burned cavanaughs throat he wished he could reach through the phone and with effort he kept his voice steady you also blew apart ali karim plus two protectors and a doctor karim good man to work with knew his stuff sorry to hear hes gone try to sound more sincere who were the other carls voice faded although the music and voices strangely persisted i can barely hear you cavanaugh said the voice strengthened who were the other protectors cavanaugh gave their names didnt know them they must have been brought aboard after i was fired carls voice said pointedly i told you i had nothing to do with getting you fired headlights blazing the van veered down an exit ramp forcing cavanaugh to grip the wall for balance but you didnt do anything to prevent it buddy carl said and deep in your heart you know you could have you kept exceeding orders you were out of control when duncan fired you it was the right thing to do ah so finally im getting some truth you admit you could have stuck up for me but instead you went along with firing me the incident outside the plaza hotel wasnt the only time you lost control blame me how about blaming yourself take some personal responsibility is that what youre suggesting stop what youre doing thats what im suggesting how long did you figure you could keep me talking carls voice asked as long as it takes to persuade you to stop this are you triangulating the signal from my cell phone old pal figuring out which microwave stations are relaying my voice needs to be done you know the procedures in a situation like this nothing personal thats a laugh you certainly proved as far as youre concerned nothing is ever personal cold aaron i never realized how cold you are and youre not listen to me carl stop whatever youre doing the van veered around a corner and stopped abruptly forcing cavanaugh to grip the wall again even before the vehicle was motionless the agent in charge yanked the side door open revealing men with rifles silhouetted by lights flashing on emergency vehicles now why would i want to stop something that took so long to set up carls voice asked pressing the phone to his ear cavanaugh jumped to the pavement and followed agents toward a onestory brick building the pungent smell of the nearby mississippi filled his nostrils carl if its me youre getting even with name the place and the time ill give you all the security you want no tricks one on one you can show me how much you hate me an agent opened a metal door bright light spilled out a huge room was filled with radio equipment computers video and audio recorders and closedcircuit monitors the screens depicted hundreds of views of the streets around the new orleans conference center busloads of police arriving barricades being set up at least two dozen technicians worked the equipment but as one they became silent turning toward cavanaugh as he entered hate you aaron carls voice came from speakers next to a monitor a technician turned down the volume the reason im so pissed at you is i love you man not like i want to bang you not that kind of love but you were the only person i felt close to and you walked away like i had the plague getting even with you no way what im doing is making a point im proving im not out of control anymore and now that your satellite technicians had their chance to try to find where i am adios carl wait the only sound was the music and the voices carl how do we stop this tell me what you want no answer carl as the music and voices persisted cavanaugh lowered his phone he had to leave the transmission open in case carl said anything else but by leaving it open he allowed carl the opportunity to overhear what was being said in the room clever stifling the impulse to curse he gave the phone to a technician and told him to take it outside do you have his location rutherford asked a technician the french quarter he must have set the phone down and walked away but why did his voice sound distant maybe he wasnt speaking directly into the phone the signals coming from the corner of bourbon and st peter another technician said is there a team close to there rutherford asked the police must have plenty of officers in the bar district a third technician finished speaking into a microphone a halfdozen teams converged on that area during the conversation more teams are on the way the streets are being blocked one thing bothers me the first technician pointed toward a monitor that showed a map of the french quarter and a stationary pulsing dot only one thing rutherford asked he never moved while he was talking the technician said jamie got it first never moved why would he stay in one place when he knew we were using satellites to get a fix on his position the van stopped on chartres street between jackson square and st louis cathedral protectors converged on the vehicle as rutherford opened the side door cavanaugh stared out at the glow of streetlights at numerous tourists passing in the shadowy background plastic cups of beer in their hands are you sure you want to do this rutherford asked he could be baiting you im positive he is trying to bait me then why are you playing his game because its the only game we have how many agents are mingling with the crowd almost enough that they are the crowd cavanaugh looked at jamie want to stay here and miss the excitement she answered lets hope there isnt any excitement flanked by agents they got out and headed up narrow st peter street passing the majestic cathedral and its gardens approaching the glitter and activity of bourbon street cavanaugh slowed his pace the sound of music and partying filled the night doortodoor bars and restaurants most of them open to the street were crammed with customers if we stick together like this cavanaugh told the agents we wont be able to surprise him but if we dont stick together one of them said we cant shield you at night bourbon street was closed to traffic the agents scanned the raucous bars and the rowdy crowd in the middle of the street they switched their attention to the ornate wrought iron of the numerous balconies many of which were occupied by revelers sweating cavanaugh crossed to where a man with a german shepherd stood next to a garbage bin the dogs owner seemed to be enjoying the music and the enthusiasm of the crowd as were a man and woman on the other side of the bin and another couple amused by a man dancing in the street all of them including the dancer were part of the team the man with the dog told cavanaugh arnold here is the best in our canine unit he never fails to locate explosives so far the area seems clean the man indicated the two couples and the dancer they have radiation and pathogen detectors negative readings show us what you found rutherford said the man and woman on the other side of the bin shifted garbage bags away revealing two cell phones ducttaped together there was also an apparently mystifying object next to them for now cavanaugh concentrated on the ducttaped cell phones son of a this is one instance where i think your language is needlessly restrained rutherford said cavanaugh took latex gloves from a pocket and put them on hating the chalky feel of the powder inside them he crouched removed his compact flashlight from his belt and studied the phones taped together their ear and mouth areas were positioned against one another an agent lowered his phone and said one of the phones is still on back at headquarters they hear our voices coming through it cavanaugh looked at the man with the german shepherd have arnold sniff this again for explosives happy to then cavanaugh asked the couples near him how about another scan with those detectors they obliged but the readings on the handheld monitors continued to be negative for radiation and pathogens they did it so discreetly that the hundreds of tourists who passed them didnt notice cavanaugh picked up the phones holding them at the bottom where he was less likely to smudge fingerprints he unclipped his knife from his pants after studying the way the phones were secured facetoface he sliced the duct tape separating the two the second phone is on also its receiving a signal cavanaugh said pointing toward the lit display screen it would require three phones jamie said cavanaugh nodded the one you called jamie said the one taped to it and a third phone that carl used to phone the second one again cavanaugh nodded im missing something an agent said what are you talking about carl assumed id eventually call the number for the phone he used to contact brockman he knew brockmans caller id would keep a record of the number but even if both brockmans phones were destroyed in the explosion the phone company would still have a record okay im with you so far the agent said carl and a companion waited for the call jamie pointed toward one of the phones before carl answered it he turned on the second phone then he used a third phone to call this second one he put the first and second phones together and used the third phone to relay his voice through the second into the first while he spoke a companion taped the phones together so theyd be secure then carl and his companion hid the phones behind these garbage bags and walked away the agent nodded because we didnt have information about the third phone he could talk to you as long as he wanted without worrying that wed use a satellite to track him wherever he was talkingprobably outside the french quarter and hes listening to us right now cavanaugh said rutherford straightened cavanaugh noted with approval that the agents kept their attention where it belonged on the crowd and the raucous buildings along the street isnt that right carl cavanaugh said into the second phone youre listening to us right now he didnt get an answer but a slight electronic hiss told him that the connection was still active he showed the phones display to the agent in contact with the communications center noting the incoming number the agent stepped away from the group so that he wouldnt be heard when he told the communications center the new phone number they would track its signal are you there carl cavanaugh asked again he didnt receive a reply i hope youre having fun listening to us what about the other thing he left rutherford asked the knife cavanaugh referred to the apparently mystifying object yeah its one of the meanestlooking blades ive ever seen cavanaugh picked it up his latex gloves protected him from any dermal poison that carl might have put on it its called a khukri the knife had an impressive ivory handle and a thirteeninch blade what made the blade intimidating was that it curved like a sickle it was designed for chopping its sweet spot almost anywhere along its curve the gurkhas use these cavanaugh said rutherford nodded the gurkhas were a military tribe in nepal their main source of income came from being mercenaries in various armies they never drew their knives unless they intended to draw blood and if they didnt wound or kill an enemy they allegedly felt obligated to draw blood from themselves when an enemy hears the gurkhas are coming the sweat starts to flow cavanaugh raised the second phone and said carl you did a fabulous job on this the engraving on the ivory handle is magnificent i thought the michael price dagger at the farm was fabulous but the craft on this one is better excellent work fossilized ivory carls voice said from the phone cavanaugh smiled slightly in victory lance taught us nothing should die in order to be used to make a knife carls voice said the agent in contact with the communications center gestured to indicate they were tracking the signal from the third phone mastodon ivory cavanaugh said from alaska right i like the way you put black epoxy over the main part of the blade and then let the edge of the blade retain its natural shiny metallic look contrasts beautifully with the ivory coming from you thats high praise aaron nothing should die in order to be used to make a knife you heard lance say that often enough so the killings justified only after the knife is made hey dont get moralistic aaron in delta force you did your share of work with a blade did you figure out why i left you the khukri a threat well lets just say a warning carls voice was faint for all you know im watching you right now maybe ive got a rifle trained on you maybe i could blow you to hell at this very moment i doubt it carl youre blocks away you made sure this phone registered the number youre using you want us to track the signal youre using but all well find is another set of phones taped together are you enjoying yourself just like when we were kids and pretended to be soldiers hunting one another in those woods at the bottom of our street but were not kids any longer exactly do you remember the last time we were in new orleans the blast we had drinking listening to jazz all night except for the club behind you theres hardly any place that has jazz anymore the bar down the street features karaoke for gods sake when i was there earlier some kid with rings in her nose was screeching the lyrics to love shack the jazz clubs were turned into strip joints and sextoy shops pitiful this townll destroy your memories if you dont get out as fast as you can ease off go back to wyoming not much there for me now you burned my house remember rebuild it occupy your time with something constructive stay out of my business aaron do you want to make a bet what do i get if i win ill stop whatever im doing if you can tell me whats the most expensive knife in the world then i win carl the most expensive knife is the solid gold replica of king tuts dagger that buster warenski made wrong carls voice said come on cavanaugh said when buster made that knife in the s it was valued at fifty thousand dollars two years ago the estimate was raised to a half million but then the collector said it wasnt for sale at any price yeah buster did a great job on that dagger but its still not the most expensive knife in the world you want to know what is sure carl go ahead and tell me the knife that costs you your life carl made the statement sound so final that cavanaugh had the sense that the conversation was over whatever youre doing cavanaugh said stop it youve got so many people looking for you you cant expect to get away negotiate with me what can we give you to make this stop the phones subtle electronic hiss stretched on and on carl suddenly cavanaugh heard voices coming through the phone angry men cursing the agent in contact with the communications center lowered his phone and said they tracked the signal to the garden district a team found two phones taped together in a flower bed outside one of those old mansions both phones are active yes sure carl did it again he relayed his voice from a further location if i go there hell start talking to me through another relay phone hell lead me all over the city a cemetery or the river will probably be next anything to distract you from trying to stop whatevers going to happen tomorrow jamie said oh were going to stop it as a police car hurried cavanaugh and jamie through the busy night he noted increasing signs of the trouble that was coming more lawenforcement officers on the streets more barricades in several parks large groups of demonstrators were gathered some of them sprawled on sleeping bags others gesturing in animated discussions distant sirens wailed jamie looked at her watch almost one oclock not much time they reached the delta queen hotel one of several on canal street the districts proximity to the convention center made it a logical place for many of the delegates to stay although cavanaugh hated the idea of so many influential people being grouped so close to each other he and jamie showed their id to guards and ran past barricades into the ornate hotels lobby next to the checkin desk the concierge directed them to a banquet room on the hotels second floor they ran up a staircase and along a thickly carpeted corridor to where they showed their id to more guards and entered the brightly lit command post for global protective services tables filled the huge room computers and monitors seemed everywhere phones ringing printers whirring dozens of agents working to keep up with the massive influx of information outside the hotel more sirens wailed for several weeks prior to the conference gps advance teams had traveled to new orleans and studied the security layout of this and other hotels where clients were staying they assessed possible routes to the conference as well as to various tourist spots that the delegates would insist on visiting the agents took photographs they made diagrams of streets and the room patterns of floors and suites they created time charts of how long it took to get from one building to another they did background checks on limousine services and arranged for armored cars to be available they hired guards to make certain the limos werent tampered with and that the guards inspected each vehicle on a regular schedule they arranged for medical personnel to be on call and made detailed notes about how to reach the nearest hospitals these and numerous other preparations were the hidden part of the protective world each security measure made to look effortless when in fact everything was the result of intense planning amid the organized commotion a tall woman looked up from a printout she studied a former marine who was also a former member of the defense intelligence agency she wore dark slacks and a dark blouse that could be made to look formal or casual depending on the type of client she needed to blend with her red hair was cut short her strong features had only faint makeup and were tight with fatigue looking as if she welcomed the distraction she approached cavanaugh and jamie i hear youre the new boss just my bad luck cavanaugh said jamie this is dawn finch the best advance agent we have flattery flattery dawn this is my wife jamie word came my way about that also youre full of surprises lets hope tomorrow doesnt bring surprises heres how it lays out dawn led them to various charts mounted on a wall cavanaugh studied them i dont like the pattern of the choke points he referred to the potential attack sites common to every route that the attendees would need to use yeah the convention centers in a centralized area the warehousearts district canal street the french quarter everythings within a few blocks no matter how we try to vary the routes everybody has to pass through the bottlenecks here and here bombs and snipers are the big worry of course we tagteamed with the police and the government agencies to reinforce security at those points keep the protestors back occupy roofs watch for movement at windows that sort of thing how many agents eight thousand and more on the way for a moment cavanaugh thought he hadnt heard correctly eight thousand to hit that many people you need a dispersive weapon a dirty bomb something like that dawn continued homeland security has radiation and pathogen detectors all over the waterfront any vehicle that enters the downtown area is being scanned give me a list of the most influential delegates what do you have in mind to make sure tomorrow doesnt happen remember almost the first thing i told you when i brought you to our training camp carl asked raoul they paused outside the warehouse insects swarmed around the overhead light a tugboat sounded from the mississippis gloom i told you rest was the operators friend that you should take advantage of it whenever possible you put in a good day mr ramirez raoul stood straighter in response to the term of respect you did what you were instructed you executed your orders perfectly now its time to reward yourself with sleep itll be difficult plenty of exciting things going on but tomorrows where were headed and the most important thing you can do now is stretch out even if all you manage to do is keep your eyes shut youll still get the benefit clear yes mr bowie okay then carl slapped him on the back and gave an approving nod to guards near the door then he opened it and ushered raoul inside the warehouse was in shadow only a few dim lights near the lavatories a male smell filled the area the musky odor of men primed for action bodies shifted on cots occasionally snoring and coughing carl gave raoul another reassuring slap on the back and watched him go to his cot where the young man obediently closed his eyes carl surveyed the other men then switched his attention to the knapsacks against the wall to his right sixty of them nerve gas carl had told the swarthy man weeks earlier blazing noon they were at the training camp far from the shots and explosions of the conditioning exercises at the main part of the facility sweating from the heat and humidity his suit sticking to him the man peered into a corrugated metal structure large enough to hold one hundred chickens the birds clucked pecked at each other and scratched the dirt floor looking for food i got these from a farmsupply outlet a hundred miles from here carl explained just another customer nobody paid attention stepping among the chickens sending them scurrying noisily carl set a knapsack in their midst as you know from your experiences in iraq detonation devices of this sort require a twostep process one to arm them the other to set them off the two stages guarantee that the devices wont go off prematurelyin our hands for instance the man eyed the knapsack and took several steps back from it after all we want to make sure the detonations occur at the scheduled time and place so this is step one carl pulled a cord on the side of the knapsack then he made his way through the clucking chickens emerged from the structure and shut the door he walked around the building and lowered metal panels over the screened windows the van was a hundred yards away through ferns and weeds some of the ground was spongy and caused the man to look annoyed at the seeds on his pants and the mud on his dress shoes carl opened the vans side hatch and indicated a television that received signals from a camera in the concreteblock structure the image came from high in a corner angling down toward the chickens the pullcord on the knapsack activates a radio receiver attached to the detonator carl said on the day of the event all the receiverssixty of themwill be calibrated to a common frequency used by law enforcement god knows therell be plenty of law enforcement in the area all of them eager to stay in radio contact with each other one of them will inadvertently set off the detonators but just in case ill send a radio signal of my own for the safety of this demonstration i chose an uncommon frequency so a radio broadcast from a police car that happens to be in the area wont get us killed ready the man nodded carl pressed a button on a transmitter and drew the mans attention toward the television a black cloud billowed from the knapsack ominously silent it filled the structure so thickly that the chickens could no longer be seen of course the nerve gas is colorless carl said the smoke is for dramatic effect for the tv cameras otherwise all the viewers at home would see is people falling down terrifying enough but this way the cameras will see mysterious black clouds spreading and joining the viewers will watch with rapt attention as the clouds clear and then the thousands of corpses will slowly come into view bear in mind there wont be any onsite announcer to describe whats happening everybody in the area will be dead on the screen the black cloud continued to be all that was visible carl pressed another button at the distant structure metal clanked the window coverings opened the black cloud emerged from the gaps on the tv screen daylight struggled through the black haze the gas kills only when breathed carl said this particular batch isnt full strength itll lose its potency by the time it disperses this far even so you might want to put on this he gave the man a gas mask then he too put on a mask a bird flew over the structure skirting the edge of the dispersing black cloud it folded and fell crashing onto the buildings roof another bird fell then another as you see carl said pointing toward the screen where the black cloud dispersed enough to reveal that all the chickens were dead its extremely effective another bird plummeted in the warehouse carl glanced from the knapsacks and made a final assessment of the men on the cots they slept restlessly primed for the morning satisfied he took his own advice and left the building he closed the door and went down an alley to a parking space where he entered the van raoul had used to transport the six men whod chosen not to participate crawling into a sleeping bag he reviewed what needed to be done the next day his knife in one hand his pistol in the other he practiced hardlearned biofeedback techniques and drifted off to sleep the last thing his mind considered was the end of the conversation at the training camp for the actual event the man asked the gas will be full strength absolutely how much area will it cover spreading the men out arranging them in a strategic pattern all of downtown new orleans i once had the privilege of meeting frank sinatra when he performed in my country the japanese trade minister said he wore a white bathrobe over gray pajamas his thinning hair was rumpled with sleeppuffed eyes he peered over slim spectacles seated across from him cavanaugh waited indeed some months later in los angeles i was invited to an event at mr sinatras home something one of his republican politician friends asked him to host the official continued there was a sign next to the intercom at the gate it said youd better have a damned good reason for ringing this bell i assume you had a good reason for waking me at this hour i apologize cavanaugh bowed slightly the official gave no indication of caring about apologies i want you to think twice about continuing with the conference mr yamato out of habit cavanaugh scanned the suite pleased that the draperies were closed and that security personnel were on duty youre one of the most influential members of the world trade organization i strongly recommend that you persuade your associates to move the conference to another location because of your friend former friend cavanaugh said hes capable of anything and you arent capable of anything such as stopping him it doesnt make sense to risk you think this is about money dont you yamato asked cavanaugh didnt reply about multinational industries and power the official continued or pride do you think this is about pride six months ago the demonstrators forced us into a premature conclusion of a conference now we refuse to be humiliated again is that what you believe thats one of the theories ive heard cavanaugh said this isnt about wealth or power or pride this is about survival cavanaugh leaned forward listening closely as more sirens wailed outside in the darkness and this isnt about demonstrations as a voice in a debate yamato said if youre right your former friend wants to extend the rioting into something far more extreme the only motive that makes sense to me is that hes being paid by terrorists whose purpose by definition is to destroy the underpinnings of our system thats right if we allow them to intimidate us if we run and hide we surrender to that intimidation eventually it becomes easier to continue running and hiding if we dont resist at every opportunity we can never win am i afraid yes do i believe people will die tomorrow yes perhaps i myself will die but if theres an atrocity perhaps public outrage against the terrorists will make it less likely that future atrocities will occur you fight in one way we fight in another i cannot recommend canceling or moving the conference i admire your bravery cavanaugh said but its not bravery yamato told him its the refusal to act like a coward an alarm suddenly blared shrill eartorturing outside the suite cavanaugh and yamato swung toward the door someone pounded on the door mr yamato cavanaugh drew his pistol mr yamato a voice yelled cavanaugh through doors on each side of the suite japanese protectors rushed in from adjacent rooms they held pistols cavanaugh took for granted that theyd been electronically monitoring the conversation and knew that he wasnt a threat stepping in front of the trade minister shielding him they directed their fierce attention toward the main door as the alarm kept blaring and the pounding persisted next to it a television camera revealed the corridor outside and a security agent yelling mr yamatos name cavanaugh hurried to the door glanced back at yamatos protectors got a nod of agreement from them and freed the lock inching the door open ready with his weapon cavanaugh saw other agents pounding on other doors shouting the names of occupants the agent told him smoke in the elevator shaft before cavanaugh could respond another shouted and the front stairwells fire or toxic gas we dont know yet as the alarm blared sirens wailed outside the hotel presumably from fire trucks and other emergency vehicles what about the back stairwells cavanaugh asked protectors and trade ministers peered starkly from doors along the corridor security agents talking urgently to them so far theyre clear this could be a way to funnel us into a trap cavanaugh said behind him the suites phone rang past the open doors in the corridor cavanaugh heard other phones ringing at the end of the corridor abrupt movement made cavanaugh stare toward an agent who jerked his gaze from the elevators and frowned at the ceiling gray vapor swirled above him the air conditioning vent somethings coming from the gas i smell it another agent yelled coughing he shifted back from a vent in the ceiling cavanaugh pivoted toward a security agent who set down the phone in yamatos suite and raised his voice to be heard above the fire alarm ive just been told that the hotel lobby is filled with smoke can we use the service elevator yamato asked no even if its clear of smoke you cant use it what if it stops between floors plus we dont know what well face when the door opens yamato headed toward the corridor can we use the back stairs seven floors do you have a heart condition any problem that makes the distance too far for you no yamato hurried along the corridor but what if as you noted this is a way to funnel us into a trap cavanaugh smelled the acrid vapor wafting from the airconditioning vents along the corridor agents and clients were coughing as they rushed peering back cavanaugh saw black smoke at the bottom of the elevator doors at the moment all we know is we cant stay here an exit sign marked the door to the rear stairwell eyes burning cavanaugh turned toward yamato and the other officials he gestured to the gps agents whod been watching the elevator and the stairwells tony use your phone tell the fbi whats happening arrange for plenty of vehicles to meet us downstairs the rest of you lets clear the way one man banged the door open trying to startle an enemy as cavanaugh aimed into the stairwell all he saw were harsh lights concrete steps and metal railings using the metal door for cover he pivoted around it showing only enough of his body to allow him to aim toward the higher levels no one confronted him clear he shouted an agent hurried past him jumping three steps at a time to the lower landing crouching and aiming downward clear footsteps scraped on concrete as an agent scurried upward to make sure that the higher levels didnt conceal a threat hard to do when the eighth ninth and tenthlevel doors crashed open other hotel occupants rushing to escape amid the blare of the fire alarm cavanaugh heard their echoing clatter as he and the other agents added to it charging methodically downward checking the next level clear clear someone groaned cavanaugh turned toward a commotion behind him an elderly man in pajamas tripping falling down the stairs two young men catching him is he all right the mans face was twisted in pain he broke his leg someone shouted urgent cavanaugh motioned for yamatos protectors to accompany him down the stairs flanking their client they led the way the rest of the officials and their protectors following adding to the din cell phones rang officials shouted into them trying to be heard having even more trouble hearing the door to the fifth level banged open a gps agent aimed into the stairwell saw cavanaugh reacted to the swarm of people descending from the upper floors and urged his own group of officials and protectors downward the fourth and third doors remained closed the hotel offices behind them unoccupied at night at the second floor dawn finch and the communication team escaped into the stairwell smoke followed them dawn slammed the door telling cavanaugh we waited as long as we could i grabbed these she showed him a handful of computer discs the security data shed accumulated about the conference is anybody hurt a trade minister broke his leg staring down watching for threats cavanaugh hurried with her toward the ground floor wait dawn said i dont see jamie she isnt here there were so many officials to try to convince we split up shes talking to trade ministers at the southern belle that hotels being evacuated too what four hotels were hit i need to find her reaching the ground floor cavanaugh spun toward the officials and security teams who pressed toward him his agents knew immediately what to do no need to discuss forming a barricade in front of the door and holding out their arms everybody relax cavanaugh shouted amid the fire alarm and the reverberation in the stairwell he could barely be heard stop he yelled the other security teams shifted into the proper mode calming the officials youre safe cavanaugh told them the footsteps stopped clattering the reverberation diminished in a few seconds the only sound was the fire alarm the door behind me is metal the walls are concrete theres a firewall nothings going to happen to you here ill check outside vehicles are supposed to be on their way well evacuate you as soon as possible what if theres a sniper an italian trade minister demanded too much commotion too much to aim at cavanaugh said noticing that many of the officials wore pajamas he said find a security agent whos your size put on his jacket thatll make it hard to distinguish you from the team a sniper wouldnt be able to decide whos a target and whos a protector by the time he managed to sort everybody out youd be gone from here as protectors took off jackets and gave them to their clients cavanaugh noticed the elderly man whod fallen two young men cradled him well get an ambulance as soon as possible cavanaugh assured him he nodded to tony the agent hed spoken to earlier again without the need to discuss it tony understood what needed to be done the passwords treadmill cavanaugh said tony freed the deadbolt lock and opened the door aiming cavanaugh scanned the chaos in the street behind the hotel then rushed outside the rumble of parked emergency vehicles was so loud that cavanaugh barely heard tony locking the door behind him sirens approached exhaust fumes choked the street as men in uniforms rushed through a panicked crowd lowering his weapon cavanaugh saw a van creeping through the commotion other vehicles behind it emergency workers set up more barricades preventing pedestrians from getting in the way before the van came to a full stop rutherford was already jumping out hurrying toward cavanaugh are you all right confused as hell but not hurt ive got at least thirty trade officials behind this door we need evac vehicles and an ambulance a trade minister broke his leg on the way rutherford indicated more headlights coming toward them someone told me this happened at three other hotels cavanaugh said smoke but no explosives gas but it wasnt lethal rutherford said like the security agents in the background he scanned the rooftops it smelled like tear gas cavanaugh said his throat raw his eyes still burning we think the demonstrators couldnt wait until tomorrow and started early to give us a taste of what to expect from them yeah i can taste it all right someone had a heart attack in another hotel the paramedics think hell survive but if this had been durans work wed all be on the way to the morgue cavanaugh said across the street an insistent womantall with a runners build and long brunette hairemerged from the darkness lights flashing across her she forced her way through the crowd she wore rubbersoled lowheeled street shoes and dark slacks her long legs increasing her stride veering around an approaching van she rushed toward cavanaugh who broke into a smile and hugged her are you okay jamie gripped him tightly yes what about you cavanaugh smelled smoke in her hair he was so relieved to have her safely with him that the smoke might as well have been perfume i couldnt be better now that i know youre safe rutherford a widower looked as if he wished somebody would be overjoyed to greet him he knocked on the door and shouted this is john rutherford fbi we have the area secured evacuation vehicles are waiting for you cavanaugh shouted providing the code word its okay tony you can get off the treadmill slowly the door opened wary security personnel stepped out their principals in the protective box they formed carl squirmed in his sleeping bag sirens disturbing his rest more sirens than usual at night even in a city renowned for being festive more than expected as police tried to contain protestors gathering for the demonstrations in the morning his pistol and knife close to him he instantly cleared sleep from his mind and sat up the van didnt have windows at the sides or the back that made him feel sheltered and yet vulnerable to a sneak attack he knelt and stared past the front seats through the windshield toward the end of the dark alley the flashing lights of a police car sped past its wail peaking a major accident carl thought or a fire or perhaps a collision on the river nothing to concern me wrong everything concerns me he squirmed from his sleeping bag and climbed into the front seat getting behind the steering wheel driving from the alley he followed the direction of the lights and the sirens when he realized they were leading him toward the heart of the downtown area he found a safe side street on which to park then he got out locked the vehicle secured his weapons under his loosehanging shirt and went the rest of the way on foot passing barricades and growing groups of demonstrators he avoided the conference center and angled toward the nearby business district where he encountered so many uniforms and barricades that he was reminded of occupation zones hed seen years ago in bosnia at last he reached his destination fire trucks and other emergency vehicles surrounding a hotel on canal street smoke spreading from the ground floor no not one hotel carl realized a further commotion led him to another hotel on canal street more fire trucks and smoke and another and another its amateur night he thought a guy with a sweat shirt labeled outsource the white house to india on one side and keep american jobs at home on the other told a buddy man if its starting this early tomorrows gonna be wild a group chanted stop burning the rain forests keeping a distance avoiding the appearance of any association with the protestors carl drifted into the shadowy background about to return to the van he paused for a final look at the smoke coming from the hotel tomorrows going to be wild he thought you have no idea good morning gentlemen the men looked up from cleaning their weapons as carl entered the warehouse walking toward the podium he rubbed his hands together enthusiastically i trust you had a restful sleep they gathered before him weve got another fine breakfast

watch theyre each set to exactly the same time after you put on your knapsack and go to your assigned street youll mingle with the demonstrators the conference starts at nine therell be delays because the protestors will try to block the streets some of the trade ministers will want to make an impressive late entrance but lets assume that by ten oclock all the participants will be there and the opening ceremony will be in full swing exactly at ten on your watch take off the knapsack and pull the cord on it everybody clear on that they nodded when the black smoke comes out and mingles with all the other black smoke and covers your area pull out your pistol and empty it into the air enjoy yourself stampede the protestors but for gods sake dont shoot any of them weve been hired to disrupt the conference not kill people clear on that again they nodded okay clean up this warehouse put on the knapsacks make sure you know where youre going dont bunch up after the event go your separate

right to choose you that youre worth all the training you received youre not thugs anymore youre operators i cant think of a higher compliment to give anyone operators cavanaugh felt a hand on his shoulder and jerked awake it took him a moment to realize that he was in a hotel room that sunlight struggled past the draperies and that jamie who looked as tired as he felt was leaning over him nudging him williams here she said cavanaugh squinted up toward william who stood at the foot of the bed holding a briefcase despite the long plane trip williams expensively tailored pinstriped suit was impeccably pressed his pristine white shirt was perfectly starched his striped tie dramatically authoritative with his coiffed gray hair and projecting chest he had never looked more like a highpowered attorney he brought us beignets jamie bit into one coffee cavanaugh murmured that too jamie handed him a styrofoam cup groggy cavanaugh sipped the hot bitter liquid youre the best attorney anybody ever had william maybe i should open a catering service what time is it sixthirty cavanaugh turned toward jamie you let me sleep this long you were dead on your feet unfortunate choice of word you were exhausted too but you still got up earlier than i did things on my mind not to mention nightmares i know all about nightmares cavanaugh sat slowly his head feeling as if ball bearings rolled inside it on the phone last night you told me to get here as quickly as possible william said and by god you did thank you william is there a legal emergency theres going to be cavanaugh told him and thats probably not the only emergency when the gulfstream picked me up at teterboro airport my escorts said that i wouldnt be needing their protection any longer thats right jamie said youre not in danger now or perhaps i should say youre not a specific target as opposed to being part of a general target william frowned im going to need your help cavanaugh said but i cant lie to you youll probably be risking your life to help me are you willing to do that as i recall you saved my life back at your ranchnot to mention several times you kept some of my litigation opponents from trying to strangle me then youll do it when do we start good man cavanaugh said he stood from the bed and looked down at his rumpled slacks and shirt dont have a change of clothes theres no time to change them anyhow jamie said peering down at her own wrinkled slacks and blouse or shave cavanaugh scraped a hand over his beard stubble were going to hell jamie said carl is cavanaugh went into the bathroom shut the door and urinated he put his head under the coldwater facet and soaked his hair he toweled it ran a comb through it then came out and took a bite from what was left of the beignet in jamies hand after snapping his pistol holster to his belt he put on his sport coat which reeked of tear gas and smoke knives two spare magazines looks like ive got everything but a winning lottery ticket jamie attached her gun and knife to her belt then hid them with her blazer ready seven am the communications center was even more crowded and noisy than the evening before radios crackling keyboards clattering but in contrast with the chaos of yesterday everyone in the room seemed paralyzed motionless agents stood before a vast array of closedcircuit television monitors that showed intense crowds assembling on various streets around the conference center helmeted police officers and military reservists formed a line behind barricades holding shields and batons ready to respond if the crowd pushed beyond the checkpoints somber rutherford sensed movement behind him and glanced back frowning toward cavanaugh and jamie his gaze lingered on william any developments cavanaugh asked reaching him a stranger shifted next to rutherford a mustached man of fifty he had gray hair the severely short cut of which exposed a crescent of skin above each ear his tie was rigidly knotted his suit meticulously pressed his shoes obsessively shined of medium height and weight with pallid skin suggestive of a career spent at a desk he wore a white shirt whose style communicated the impression he gave buttondown the demonstrators are getting ready to try to block the streets so the trade ministers cant reach the conference rutherford said it starts at nine jamie asked it was supposed to the severefaced stranger said cavanaugh studied him puzzled i dont believe weve met this is deputy director mosely rutherford subtly emphasized the strangers title as if giving cavanaugh a warning pleased to meet you cavanaugh extended his hand this is my wife jamie and my names youve got plenty of names i hear mosely ignored the offered hand im surprised you can keep them all straight cavanaugh looked at rutherford and then back at mosely is something wrong you got what you wanted mosely said two fbi agents edged toward them im not sure what you mean four hotels needed to be evacuated mosely continued the ones with the most trade delegates there wasnt any way to put them in rooms in other hotels in the area every place was full in fact there werent enough available hotel rooms within twenty miles we had to take them to the nearest city st charles all the confusion forced the wto to cancel todays meetings they did jamie asked dont act so surprised mosely answered other agents stepped closer hey cavanaugh said if the conference got postponed its a good thing right it gives everybody more time to try to find carl and stop whatever hes doing oh its a good thing definitely mosely replied with sarcasm frowning with greater puzzlement cavanaugh turned toward rutherford john on the flight here you and i talked about how important it was to get this thing canceled how crazy it was that the wto wouldnt allow itself to appear to give in to the demonstrators now the trade ministers did what we hoped they would a lot of lives have probably been saved oh im all for saving lives mosely stood more rigidly but when you couldnt convince the wto to change its mind do you think it was right to change their minds for them youre not making sense jamie said whos this man mosely pointed toward william my attorney cavanaugh answered you suspected youd need one william has one of the most attentive logical minds ive ever come across i thought it would be a good idea to include him maybe hell notice something we havent thought of well hes definitely going to come in handy mosely emphasized on the various tv monitors the crowd kept getting larger waitll they find out the conference isnt happening today someone said mosely pointed toward a door we need to talk he told cavanaugh you too he told jamie he looked at william and by all means youre invited counselor the door led to an office that was bare except for a metal table and chair two fbi agents joined the group in the cramped quarters everyone remained standing although rutherford shut the door mosely still had to raise his voice to be heard above the noise outside you were seen entering all four hotels of course jamie said we visited trade ministers in those hotels trying to persuade them to cancel the conference we identified ourselves to security personnel someone went to the bottom of the elevator shafts and put smoke bombs in them mosely told her someone went to the roofs opened the aircondition vents and put teargas grenades inside spray paint disabled the lenses on the security cameras in those areas that makes sense jamie concluded thats the way id have done it which begs the question mosely said wait a minute are you suggesting i did it jamie sounded indignant cavanaugh looked at rutherford whats going on here john sorry im afraid its out of my hands william stepped forward before this conversation goes any further are you arresting my clients for what happened at those hotels counselor mosely put rancor into the title i invited you to listen but i dont believe youre licensed to practice law in the state of louisiana that doesnt mean i cant act as a concerned knowledgeable friend william pulled out his cell phone but if you want to put this on an absolutely legal basis ill make a call to my good friend lester beauchamp he and i went to harvard together hes also my brotherinlaw and the former assistant attorney general for the state of louisiana not to mention the most respected defense attorney in new orleans im sure hell be more than happy to represent my clients lets be clear counselor are you advising your friends not to answer my questions if youre arresting them im advising you to read them their rights we dont have anything to hide jamie insisted a man and a woman matching your description were seen in the area of the elevator shafts and the roofs just before the incidents happened mosely said your height your build your clothes where are your witnesses william challenged they worked the night shift at the various hotels that doesnt answer the question the witnesses are where my friends are more than willing to stand in a lineup and be identifiedor not be identified which is whats going to happen moselys gaze almost faltered we havent been able to contact them this morning perhaps because theyre drug addicts semiconscious from illegal substances william continued until you find these socalled witnesses and prove their reliability these accusations are hearsay and possibly slander i was speaking with the japanese trade minister when the smoke and the tear gas went off in his hotel cavanaugh said how could i have been in two places at one time did i neglect to mention that the detonation devices were on timers mosely asked and where are we supposed to have gotten all that stuff your file emphasizes how resourceful you are you have an obsession with being close to what you call bugout bags that have all sorts of equipment in them your wife carries a specialty knife that has numerous tools in the handle she wouldnt have had any trouble opening the airconditioning ducts for all i know your corporate jet is loaded with other equipment you needed then search the jet cavanaugh told him but not before you get a warrant william pointed out moselys eyes flared you present yourselves as such ethical people so concerned about protecting your clients you claim youre the edge between right and wrong then you show how irresponsible you are by putting all those trade ministers at risk thanks to your stunt one of them broke his leg another had a heart attack two cars rammed into emergency vehicles speeding toward the hotels was anybody killed no but that doesnt mean what you did is right cavanaugh looked at rutherford make him understand john whoevers responsible saved a lot of lives now that the conference has been postponed carl will need to change his plans meanwhile weve got time to catch him moselys pallor mutated to a fiery red you think you deserve a medal well i think you took a privilege the bureau gave you and abused it youre a guest here a civilian you dont have any authority but you decided you were running this operation breaking god knows how many laws if its up to me youll go to prison thank heaven it isnt up to you william said after i talk to lester beauchamp ill phone the district attorney and the door opened everyone turned toward an agent theres been a new development the uneasy man told them dont tell me the riots have already started mosely said fifteen minutes ago a man and a woman were caught trying to put tear gas into the conference centers airconditioning ducts what and smoke bombs in the elevator shafts mosely groaned do the suspects look like these two william asked the agent in the doorway yeah in a way sort of theyre white and more or less the same age youre not deceiving me mosely told cavanaugh and jamie those are copycats without talking to the suspects how can you be sure william asked because unlike your friends they dont have the skills to manage that kind of sabotage because the man and woman today got caught an interesting distinction but without legal merit if youre not going to arrest my friends i trust you have no objection to allowing them to go about their business not here they dont have any business in this area uh sir rutherford said mosely stared yes executive assistant rutherford he emphasized assistant reminding rutherford of who had the greater authority if i could make a suggestion by all means mosely clearly wished that rutherford had kept quiet everyone knows im always open to constructive ideas i think it might not be a bad idea to let them stay cavanaugh understands durans personality better than anyone as events develop he might be able to predict what duran will do plus cavanaughs the only person here who can identify him mosely continued staring we need to seem to use every available resource rutherford said otherwise in an inquiry there might be questions moselys narrow gaze pivoted toward cavanaugh and jamie to rutherford he said this time keep them under control he yanked open the door and entered the communications room followed by the agents except rutherford as the noise from out there filled the small area cavanaugh said thanks john i feel my job dangling in the wind i owe you im sure it wasnt easy disagreeing with him rutherford looked pained please remember what he warned you about youre civilians dont make me sorry i trust you cavanaugh solemnly followed him into the communications room on the tv monitors the crowd got bigger on one of the screens a woman carried a large heavy purse she hid an object in her hand and periodically looked at it part of the radiation detection team someone in the communications room explained on another screen a man held what looked like a smart phone a pathogen detector two hundred members of the homeland security team are out there weaving through the crowd scanning it but how many diseases can they program their detectors to test for they cant possibly scan for everything someone said how big is the crowd fifteen thousand and getting larger an agent said what difference does it make if the conference was postponed as long as they think its happening therell be a riot and maybe worse rutherford murmured next to him cavanaugh said right now somebody needs to send agents into that crowd make them act like the protestors tell them to spread the word sounding pissed off that the conference was cancelled moselys gaze was icy as he turned toward cavanaugh and i bet youre dying to get out there and show us how its done seventhirty on the podium carl faced his men and said to tell the truth im jealous youre going to have so much fun i decided to join you there are six knapsacks that arent being used because of the men who opted out i might as well take one and enjoy myself mr ramirez is going to put on a knapsack and join the fun also raoul looked up not having expected to hear that but to carls approval raoul concealed his surprise and nodded firmly has everyone got a watch carl asked they did is your knapsack on you know where youre going they did obviously pleased that carl would be joining them leave here in groups of six split up as soon as possible new orleans has an excellent bus system so you wont have trouble getting to the target area but those buses are equipped with video surveillance cameras so sit separately and look out the window not at the camera remember when its ten oclock take off your knapsack and pull the cord at the side make sure youre wearing these fingertip pads so you dont leave prints when you drop your gun everybody clear good gentlemen show me how disciplined you are eight mingling with demonstrators across from the conference center jamie felt pushed and shoved the heat of so many bodies increased the humidity making her sweat someone stepped on her shoes they had steel caps under the leather standard equipment for protectors even so she felt the jolt but she was less concerned about damage to her body than she was about someone bumping against the weapons under her blazer realizing what they were and trying to take them she kept her elbows tight against her sides bracing them against her handgun and her knife although the conference wasnt scheduled to start for another hour the demonstrators were already shouting their complaints about third world sweatshops increased pollution climate change the vanishing rain forests the overfished oceans and chemicals in the food supply waitll the motorcades arrive someone said well stop those greedy bastards from getting into the building if we need to well push their cars over someone else vowed jamie pretended to be listening to her cell phone she hurriedly lowered it and blurted to the people around her my friend says she saw on television that the cars wont be coming someone overheard and asked what they just announced the conference was postponed bullshit no its true jamie said the crowd banging against her the chief of police just made an announcement something happened at four hotels last night smoke and tear gas the trade ministers were moved out of town ministers were moved out of town cavanaugh said harry listen to this guy they cancelled the conference like hell cavanaugh pointed toward his cell phone thats what my friend just told me he saw it on television a trick they want us to give up and leave close to nine oclock those pigsll arrive in their limos bet on it eightythirty the spreading chaos forced carl to park a half mile away even from that distance he heard the shouting sounds like the party started he grinned at raoul this is what its all about everything else is just waiting he and raoul stepped from the van and made certain their loose shirts covered their weapons heres your party favor carl said handing raoul his knapsack he put on his own they followed magazine street six blocks north of the convention center as they neared the shouting they saw a bus come to a stop amid numerous departing passengers six members of their group emerged keeping separate as instructed like good operators they never glanced at each other as they took separate directions through the crowd dont you love it when a plan comes together carl asked raoul progress became difficult carl passed one of his men halfway down the block exactly where he should be although they didnt acknowledge one another their brief eye contact told carl how much the man was reassured and so it went shifting through the crowd passing various members of his team carl verified that everyone was obeying instructions that gave him reason to believe they would continue to obey by nine he and raoul reached the conference center where the crowd was so immense the protestors so animated that the fourlane boulevard in front was almost totally blocked behind barricades police officers readied themselves to push back where are the cars a demonstrator demanded to his friends they should have been here by now energized by anticipation carl continued through the turmoil buoying his widely separated men with his presence while he made sure they were in place ninethirty cavanaugh and jamie pushed through the crowd reached the back of a large delivery truck and showed their ids to a camera above the rear doors a moment later one of the doors opened hands helping them up against the inside wall armed men were ready in case cavanaugh and jamie were not who they claimed or someone charged in after them the trucks interior was a compact version of the communications center computers twoway radios and closedcircuit monitors seemed everywhere an electronic glow filled the compartment on the screens the police and the protestors shoved at each other outside the convention center but because the police had body armor helmets shields clubs and tasers they had more success the silence of the images contrasted with the tumult outside i told as many as i could about the radio announcement that the conference was postponed jamie said weve got plenty of other operators blending with the crowd spreading the word an fbi agent said doesnt seem to be doing any good cavanaugh frowned toward the violence on the monitors wait an agent pointed on one of the screens cavanaugh saw the protestors shifting back from the police on another screen the shrubs that separated the four lanes of convention center boulevard were becoming visible protestors stared both ways along the thoroughfare baffled that the motorcade hadnt arrived at a twoway radio an agent said im getting reports that portions of the crowd are beginning to realize the conference isnt going to happen look jamie said at the end of the boulevard near the casino on poydras street some of them are drifting away nine fortyfive a cloud crossed the sun casting a cool shadow then the sun returned the heat again as palpable as the humidity the press of bodies smelled of sweat as carl and raoul made their way through them after crisscrossing the target area they entered girod street moving away from the conference center carl verified that the final man he needed to check was in place as carl reached the intersection of tchoupitoulas street where raoul was scheduled to wait until oclock he noticed that the going seemed easier that he no longer needed to struggle against the crowd then he realized that the tide had turned that the demonstrators were moving away from the conference center instead of toward it that he was being carried by the flow he stopped an angrylooking man and woman whats going on why are you leaving damned things been cancelled no carl said jostled by the passing crowd the woman held up an iphone its all over the internet four hotels got smokedbombed and teargassed last night the trade ministers were evacuated but that cant be carl insisted im telling you the bastards left town no motorcade no opening ceremonies nothing down at the convention center theyre getting their heads cracked for no reason as the disgusted man and woman moved onward away from the pointless battle carl stared down girod street except for a truck parked two blocks away all he saw were demonstrators moving in his direction a steady mass of them filling the pavement and the sidewalk four hotels furious carl remembered following last nights sirens and arriving at hotels that were surrounded by the flashing lights of emergency vehicles while smoke streamed from the buildings aaron he thought was that your doing is it over raoul asked for a moment carl didnt hear him over if the conference isnt going to happen whats the point of the smoke quiet carl pulled him toward a wall somebody might hear you but we dont have much time we need to split up and hurry so we can tell the men to forget about ten oclock forget about ten oclock no way carls employers were more frightening than anyone could imagine good god the last thing he needed was them hunting him because he took their money and didnt follow through on what he promised but whats the point raoul demanded you told us we were hired to make sure the conference didnt happen mierda look around you it isnt happening the point carl couldnt tell him was the secret service the us marshals the diplomatic security service and the homeland security response team not to mention operators from global protective services and other major nongovernment firms theyd been lured into coming to new orleans to safeguard the world trade organization in eleven minutes were going to do what we promised carl said but this isnt some stupidass street gang we dont act on impulse we dont change our mind whenever we feel like it we follow orders but what if the orders stop making sense if a man pays me to do something i do it maybe he didnt tell me all his reasons my job isnt to think its to follow through on an assignment are you a coward of course not raoul said his face reddening you know ive done everything you asked youre supposed to be an operator his face even redder raoul said i am an operator then show me carl tugged raoul along the wall here the middle of the block this is where youre supposed to wait more disappointed protestors went up the street carl checked his watch in ten minutes follow the plan okay raoul said angrily all right stop carl warned himself what am i doing keep control he touched raouls shoulders with apparent affection dont take it personally im just stressed keeping track of all the details youre my most dependable operator never doubt that raoul didnt reply but the compliment clearly made him less angry when youre in my place youll understand the burden of responsibility im sorry carl gripped raouls shoulders harder i know you wont let me down raoul didnt answer is everything straight between us carl asked yes then make me proud carl stepped away where i need to hurry and get to my spot carl said over his shoulder he struggled to conceal the irritation he felt for losing control what the hells wrong with me this is almost over keep cool dont screw things up the crowd carried him toward the edge of the killing zone he reached the middle of the next block where nine minutes from now he was supposed to pull the cord on his knapsack he shifted toward a wall freeing himself from the passing crowd he took off the knapsack and shoved it into a garbage bin rejoining the protestors he was eager to let them propel him to safety he had plenty of time to get to the van and flee the area a few seconds after ten he would press a button on the transmitter in his jacket pocket if the police frequencies hadnt already set off the detonators the signal he sent would do the job something made him glance back raoul was at the refuse bin gaping at the discarded knapsack when raoul had started to ask where his intention hadnt been to find out where bowie was going what he wanted to know was whether he should meet bowie at the van or whether he was supposed to get to galveston on his own because of their argument they hadnt finalized their arrangements the way raoul felt he wasnt sure he wanted to meet bowie at the van talking to me like hes a chingado guard in the joint but as seconds passed the heat of raouls anger lessened he didnt want trouble between them the truth was what raoul felt for him was what he was supposed to feel for his father nine minutes plenty of time to ask him and get back here raoul slipped into the crowd moving toward the next block where bowie would be waiting for ten oclock to occur there ahead raoul saw the lanky man slightly taller than those around him flowing with the crowd bowie shifted toward a wall exactly where hes supposed to be raoul thought working toward him but then raoul frowned seeing bowie take off his knapsack raoul frowned harder when bowie shoved the knapsack into a garbage bin bowie rejoined the crowd stunned raoul came to the garbage bin and gaped at the knapsack bowie had abandoned he raised his eyes searching the crowd bowie was glaring back at him the force of it made him dizzy the fury in bowies eyes was so overwhelming that raoul felt shoved he actually took a step backward his dizziness intensifying the world he thought he knew spun the reality he depended on seemed to ripple beneath his feet making him unsteady at once another world took its place a mask seemed to slip from bowies face the man raoul thought of as a father suddenly became a stranger worse than that an enemy the rage and hatred on bowies face shot across the distance and made raoul lurch back another step immediately bowie pushed through the crowd hurrying toward him a terrible heat primed raouls muscles the most searing fear hed ever known fired his protective instincts and sent him fleeing no carl thought shoving protestors out of the way he charged toward raoul the look on his face he suspects if he warns the others the constant stream of demonstrators held him back turning sideways ramming his shoulder through the crowd he was reminded of playing in highschool football games his father yelling drunkenly from the bleachers hey a man said watch where youre going out of my way dont ram into me jerkoff the man gasped struck in the stomach baffled by the blood streaming from him his knife at his side carl shoved harder through the oncoming crowd ahead raoul stayed close to the wall gaining distance managing to reach the next block a young man with a knapsack saw them coming raoul shouted a warning the team member looked confused raoul shouted again the team member saw carl chasing raoul fear tightening his face he turned and ran whats this about in the communications truck an fbi agent pointed toward a monitor where here this cavanaugh and jamie walked toward it somebodys in an awful hurry to go the wrong way the agent said not one person three jamie noted the camera was angled downward from a roof the screen showed the crowd filling the street countless protestors shifting away from the conference center breaking the pattern a line of three men charged in the opposite direction thrusting their way through the demonstrators seems like the guy in backs chasing the others the agent said look at how frightened they are they keep glancing back to see if hes gaining on them and what about this another agent pointed toward a monitor that showed a commotion nearby people formed a circle around a man scrunched sideways on the pavement he held his stomach which was dark with spreading liquid a woman raised her face and soundlessly screamed looks like hes been shot an agent said cavanaugh concentrated on the three men forcing their way south as everyone else went north can you get a closer view of the guy in back the one who seems to be chasing the others sure the agent twisted dials immediately the camera magnified the man at the rear of the line as the face got larger cavanaugh felt a chill speed along his nerves not shot stabbed how do you know because the guy chasing the others is carl eight minutes before ten fighting his way through the crowd carl saw another young man with a knapsack raoul shouted a warning when the man already on edge looked behind the team members charging toward him and saw the rage on carls face he too broke into a run carl shouldered through more protestors hey dickhead watch who youre slamming into a man said only to groan and double over as carl lunged past ahead raoul hurried straight ahead while the team members hed warned dropped their knapsacks and split to the right and left racing down side streets theyll alert the rest of the team carl thought in a fury i trained them to feel they belong to a tightly knit unit thats how theyll act now protecting each other because of raoul all the effort i spent on him hes still a punk ramming through the crowd getting nearer carl angrily calculated that he had sufficient time to teach him the consequence of disloyalty ahead the son of a bitch hurled his knapsack away and shouted to a team member waiting farther along the block what are they throwing away knapsacks they seem to be shouting at people at the side of the crowd cavanaugh stared at the monitors men standing against walls jamie said they all have knapsacks here here here and my god once you notice them they seem to be everywhere i hate to imagine whats in them an agent picked up a microphone surveillance one to all units as the agent described what he saw on the screens cavanaugh pointed toward the one that showed carl what street is he on he asked another agent girod near fulton cavanaugh grabbed a lapel microphone and an earbud keep telling me which direction hes taking before jamie had a chance to think about going with him cavanaugh opened the door and jumped to the street grab the guys with the knapsacks the agent said into a microphone for gods sake be careful we dont know whats in them when jamie jumped to the street cavanaugh had disappeared into the crowd seven minutes before ten without looking back raoul had a visceral sense that bowie was gaining on him his stomach felt on fire his lungs ached his legs felt wobbly although he stayed along a wall there were still too many people in front of him crashing shoving he shouted to another team member bowie lied somethings wrong get rid of the knapsack the alreadynervous team member seemed to be grateful for the excuse to run raoul leapt over the dropped knapsack and veered left onto fulton street the side street had fewer departing protestors giving raoul a chance to run faster but he continued to have that visceral sense that bowie was gaining on him he saw yet another team member and shouted his warning for proof all the man needed was a frightened look behind raoul toward where bowie was getting closer the man dropped his knapsack and raced toward the next corner perhaps raoul only imagined the footsteps pounding behind him but he didnt imagine the increasing tightness in his lungs the worsening unsteadiness in his legs never having been tested never having passed five missions he was ruled by fear instead of using adrenaline to give him strength gotta breathe as long as im running he has the advantage gotta stop on the opposite side of the street an archway beckoned gotta fight raoul crashed past retreating demonstrators knocking a man to the pavement damn it he heard behind him but all he cared about was reaching the protection of that archway he charged inside but there wasnt a door that he could slam and lock a musty brick corridor led to metal stairs angling up shadows beckoned as he raced to the stairs he heard footsteps rushing behind him drawing his pistol he spun and saw a blur as bowie shouted want to make a bet the shout boomed off the bricks along with the fright of bowies swiftly enlarging figure the noise was loud enough to startle raoul his knees bent his shoulders hunched his hands rose to shield his chest he fumbled to squeeze the trigger but at once he felt bowie walloping into him jolting the remaining air from his lungs he landed hard on the stairs their sharp edges chopping his back as bowie continued hurtling into him punching him repeatedly except that the punches were stabs and now it was blood instead of air that escaped from raouls lungs you dummy didnt you learn anything dont bring a gun to a knife fight carl drove the blade deep into raouls chest his stomach his throat again and again each thrust sending a shudder through the body gas escaped blood flew he kept pounding until the torn mass beneath him was barely recognizable with each frenzied blow he felt as if he were out of himself smiling down at the punishment he inflicted courage honor sacrifice but the greatest military virtue is loyalty this is what you get for carl was suddenly in his body again conscious of the gore beneath him the blood dripping from his hands his shirt his face a tremor went through him a spasm of release that raised his head and arched his back his vision turned gray then everything was vivid before him raouls deathcontorted body the black metal stairs now sprayed with red the crimsoncovered knife in his hand how long have i been my god what time is it his watch was so covered with blood that he had to wipe it on the back of his shirt before he could see its display four minutes to ten the last thing he remembered was charging into the passageway at six minutes to ten several quick slashes with his knife that was his plan thirty seconds to teach raoul his lesson in and out five minutes to get away not all the team members would be warned that something was wrong some would pull the cords on their knapsacks and activate the detonators releasing the gas not enough to save the mission although the target area was still dangerous he needed to run looking like this straightening he felt the wet heaviness of the blood on his shirt every security agent in the crowd will converge on me damn you raoul he kicked the body cursing raoul for making him lose control think theres got to be a way to he tore off his shirt in muggy new orleans a man without a shirt attracted little attention but someone with a bloodsoaked shirt was another matter he hurried to a faucet next to the stairs rinsing the blood from his hands and face he almost ran back along the alley toward the street but a commotion out there told him that somebody was charging in this direction trying a door on his right he found it locked he tried a door on his left with the same result terribly aware of time passing he charged up the stairs all the while folding his knife and shoving it with his pistol into one of the baggy pockets of his pants his shoes clattering on the stairs he reached the top and turned the knob groaning when he found that this door too was locked past a closed window next to it he heard two women talking when he pounded on the door their voices stopped let me in its an emergency below him footsteps sounded in the passageway he stared down feeling his heart skip the middle of the block the south side listening to the voice give instructions through his earbud cavanaugh veered through the crowd on fulton street reaching an archway he heard the voice say thats where they went backups on the way no time staying to the side he drew his pistol and listened with the noise of the departing protestors behind him he thought he heard the echo of footsteps on a metal staircase working to control his heartbeat he took a breath held it counted one two three exhaled through his mouth one two three and inhaled through his nose one two three pivoting into view he aimed along a brick passageway and saw the lower half of a man climbing the stairs a bloodcovered body lay at the bottom a bloodsoaked shirt was near a faucet continuing to aim cavanaugh eased along the passageway shifting his feet carefully taking care to place them firmly and maintain his balance nearing the stairs he heard pounding on a door above him ignoring the corpse at his feet he aimed upward carl slowly carls surprised look changed to a welcoming smile my my the smile widened how are you doing aaron ive been better cavanaugh tightened his finger on the trigger yeah im not having a great day either carls lanky chest was bare his ribs showing through his lean muscles his narrow face dripped water he held up his wet powerfullooking arms in surrender its been too long aaron you must be taking a lot of vitamins either that or marriage agrees with you you dont look any older for certain you havent changed i see youre still having control problems well he turned against me i know disloyalty doesnt bother you but it makes me furious apparently a lot of things do only people who trick me into believing theyre my friends when theyre actually the opposite come down the stairs carl i dont think so slowly carefully what happens if i tell you to screw off youll shoot me yes at the top of the stairs voices behind a door made cavanaugh frown not today good buddy the door opened before cavanaugh could fire carl vanished into the building cavanaugh raced up the stairs but not before the door slammed shut he yanked at the knob locked he pounded on the door beyond it he heard shots the door was metal carl knew that pistol bullets wouldnt go through it that meant the bullets were intended for someone else whoever had opened the door cavanaugh thought he heard footsteps running along a corridor hes in a building on the second floor cavanaugh said into his lapel mike well seal off fulton and the opposite street the voice promised loud noises made cavanaugh spin and look down the stairs a half dozen agents rushed along the passageway the person he focused on was jamie he went through here cavanaugh yelled to them seeing flowerpots at the top of the stairs cavanaugh grabbed one and hurled it through the window next to the door convinced that carl wouldnt have risked staying he reached through freed a lock and raised the window air conditioning cooled his hand as jamie and the agents ran up the stairs cavanaugh peered through the window studied an office decided that he had to take the chance and crawled inside two women lay on the floor streaming blood we need an ambulance cavanaugh shouted into his lapel mike rushing he unlocked the door jamie and the agents hurried in but stopped at the sight of the gunshot victims one agent knelt trying to help them while cavanaugh and the others raced along a corridor in an office a man peered up hiding behind a desk in another office a man lay bleeding reaching a lobby cavanaugh saw a receptionist trembling in a corner behind her desk glass doors led to an elevator and stairs weve got operators waiting on the street outside he cant get through an agent told him gun drawn the agent ran past cavanaugh and charged down the stairs the others following but cavanaugh and jamie lingered whats above us cavanaugh asked the trembling receptionist she opened her mouth no sound came out youre safe now jamie said whats above us other offices and a roof garden three minutes to ten a team member stood against a wall as the crowd passed impatient he checked his watch looked up and paled when two men confronted him aiming pistols hands up turn around against the wall an agent shouted to another team member this one a block away jay get the knapsack off him i think its safe to take the knapsack an agent yelled to his partner three blocks away if its a bomb it doesnt have a manual trigger otherwise hed have blown himself up by now someone in the crowd overheard bomb where a bomb run keep your hands away from the knapsack an agent shouted when the team member drew a pistol the agent protected the knapsack and shot the man in the head the dying man fired into the sidewalk fragments hitting the crowd panicking a woman tripped stampeding three men fell over her screams filled the street cavanaugh and jamie hurried up the stairs an office door was open startled faces peering out close the door cavanaugh told them take cover jamie warned continuing higher they reached an open door sky beyond it stay here cavanaugh said you dont need to do this babe im not letting you do it alone cavanaugh went first aiming to the right while jamie aimed to the left amid blazing sunlight potted trees and shrubs surrounded them patio tables chairs and sun umbrellas provided a lunch area through which cavanaugh and jamie darted searching for a target over there jamie said fifty yards away a shedlike structure had an open door with the mississippi spread along their right they raced toward the exit he used the roof to head east farther along the block cavanaugh shouted into his lapel mike the corner they entered a stairwell in time to hear footsteps rumbling below them hes almost onto the street cavanaugh shouted were waiting a voice shouted through his earpiece shots made cavanaugh pause even in the stairwell he heard screaming along the street two minutes to ten nearing the ground floor carl heard shots outside beyond a window a frenzy swept through the crowd people swarming to get away he veered into an office where workers stared in alarm at the chaos outside turning toward him they reacted with greater alarm to his bare chest the water dripping from his face and the gun in his hand out carl yelled when they didnt respond he chose a man with red hair and shot him out out out the survivors collided with each other all of them trying to get through the door at once firing above their heads carl watched them surge out joining the turmoil on the street agents out there would be totally overwhelmed he grabbed a suit coat off a chair and put it on he picked up a chair and hurled it through french doors he surged through and joined the screaming stampeding crowd reaching the ground floor cavanaugh saw that the door was open people rushing past taken aback by the chaos he heard a window shatter in an office to his left go that way he told jamie indicating the open door ill take the side he rushed into the office in time to see carl leap through the window and charge into the crowd immediately cavanaugh followed shouldering past men and women straining to keep carl in sight another distant shot increased the crowds panic bomb he heard somebody say the hysterical need to get away was so powerful that for a moment cavanaugh was actually lifted off his feet by the crush of people around him it was like being swept along in a flood while he tried to break free of the current and maintain a direction ahead he saw carl struggling to go sideways through the crowd but that didnt make sense where carl seemed determined to goto the rightwas a dead end he couldnt escape there abruptly cavanaugh realized he was mistaken what he thought of as a dead end was actually the mississippi river the river that was how carl planned to get away one minute to ten no matter how hard carl strained to break free from the crowd it caught and squeezed him carrying him with it the force was so great that he had trouble breathing jabbing with his elbows ramming with his shoulders he managed to clear a space and thrust closer to the river he was too confined to be able to look at his watch but he sensed that ten oclock was almost upon him any second the few remaining members of the team would pull the cords on their knapsacks the police radio frequencies would trigger the detonator and black clouds filled with nerve gas would drift across the remaining demonstrators vaguely aware of a building on his right he jabbed harder with his elbows and cleared enough space to draw his pistol firing into the air the deafening shots made people scream and run faster several fell others piling onto them carl scrambled over them ahead part of the crowd raced across train tracks up steps and into a tunnel he fired several more shots to keep the crowd hurrying and charged into the shadow of the tunnel when he broke into sunlight a wide expanse of concrete ended at the water barges and tugboats chugged along the mississippi he vaulted a waisthigh fence and dove past a paddle wheeler moored at the shore plunging beneath the surface racing after him cavanaugh saw carl sprinting toward the river he stretched his legs to their limit and sped closer but not enough there wasnt sufficient time to close the gap as carl vaulted the fence cavanaugh didnt have time to stop and try to control his exertiontrembling body enough to aim in a blur carl dove past a paddle wheeler into the river three seconds later cavanaugh vaulted the fence afraid of being weighed down he dropped his gun and the knife on his belt he threw off his jacket tugged his claw knife from its neck sheath gripped it securely and dove the river was cold gritty greasy submerged in the weight of the muddy water he heard the muffled vibrations of engines the water was so murky that when he opened his eyes he couldnt see all he could do was keep kicking with his heavy shoes blindly sweeping his arms following the course that carl had taken into the water as he thrust with his hands he gripped his claw knife slicing hoping to wound carls legs already short of breath from running he felt pressure in his chest his lungs demanding air he kept thrusting his clothes weighing him down caught in the current no longer hopeful that he was on carls trajectory he thrust again with the knife the engine vibrations were louder then he realized that what he heard was the pounding of his heart lungs feeling as if theyd explode he kicked upward pawed through the water broke the surface and gaped at a tugboat looming toward him it was so close that he had to shove his feet against its hull thrusting his body away before he was struck nonetheless the suction of the current pushed him back against the hull the propeller he thought a row of tires hung from the tugs side buffers that kept it from banging against a dock stretching up cavanaugh snagged a hand into one of the tires and felt an agonizing strain in his shoulder as the tug carried him along staring back he saw jamie standing at the side of the river helplessly watching his struggle in the distance a black cloud rose farther over so did another suddenly understanding carls plan he prayed that jamie would realize what she needed to do as a third black cloud rose he raised his free hand the one with the knife waving insistently that he was all right urging her to go she returned his wave and with a frightened look behind her toward the isolated black clouds she broke into a run part eight the fellowship of the knife so far we know almost one thousand people died dawn finch told him including forty federal agents and fifteen gps operators cavanaugh was too overwhelmed to reply he sat in a coast guard office where a patrol boat had brought him after he was transferred from the tug although he clutched a blanket wrapped around him he shiveredonly partially because of his wet clothes jamie brought him a steaming cup of coffee at least another two thousand needed medical care enough to fill the emergency wards in every hospital in the area but it could have been significantly worse an fbi agent said the canisters were so carefully sealed none of the toxin detectors in the crowd registered what was in them if the conference had occurred if all the protestors had remained in the area if all the knapsacks had been detonated and all the gas released the preliminary estimate is that at least fifteen thousand protestors would have died plus the thousands of tourists and business people in the downtown area another agent explained lord knows how many others would have needed medical attention this came close to being the worst outside the office boat engines rumbled a door opened everyone turned toward a coast guard officer who entered rutherford and mosely followed neither of them looking happy the coast guard officer reported no luck finding him were beginning to think he might have been hit by boat traffic on the river perhaps he was knocked unconscious and drowned he didnt drown cavanaugh said one of our men saw you chase him an fbi agent reported our man was too far away to help but he managed to see both of you go into the water only you came up maybe he struck his head on something under the water maybe his bodys caught on something down there the coast guard officer hoped were dragging the area we sent for divers and youre searching the banks all the way up and down the river cavanaugh asked using helicopters as well as boats of course still think youre running things mosely demanded the hostile interruption made everyone turn just contributing to the conversation cavanaugh said sure except for the rumbling of the boat engines the room became silent dont mind me mosely said cavanaugh told the coast guard officer carls an expert swimmer in high school he was state champion on our delta force team it was one of his specialties i once saw him swim under water for a minute and fortyfive seconds given the current he could easily have gone quite a distance downstream before surfacing probably using a boat for cover hes miles away by now well explore every possibility yeah definitely running the show mosely said again the room became silent next to mosely rutherfords dark face brooded have you got a problem cavanaugh asked yeah but youve got a bigger one mosely turned to the coast guard officer does this office have a dvd player on this computer then lets take a look at this mosely handed him an unlabeled disc the officer inserted it and pressed buttons on the keyboard everyone stepped close for a moment the screen was blank then it showed a corridor at the far end elevator doors were visible this is from the delta queen hotels securitymonitor system mosely explained very uptodate technology no blur no haze the screen continued to show the corridor and the elevator doors at the end not too interesting so far william said how much of this do we need to im just setting the scene counselor building suspense the cameras on the hotels maintenanceroom level theres also a camera at the end of the corridor near the elevator doors and one on the stairwell leading down those cameras had their lenses spraypainted but i guess you didnt know about this one mosely told cavanaugh theres no way you can prove my clients had anything to do with spraypainting those cameras william protested keep watching counselor a man appeared at the end of the corridor crouching moving past the elevator doors he aimed a can and sprayed paint at something above him this still proves nothing william said that man is so far away hes impossible to identify he could be anybody i knew youd say that counselor so for your edification i had the image magnified the man at the end of the corridor now filled the screen a good likeness dont you think mosely asked the man was unmistakably cavanaugh he finished spraying paint at something above him then he used lock picks to open a panel next to the elevator he pressed a button inside the panel causing the elevator doors to open the floor of the shaft was empty the elevator at a higher level after flicking a switch on a box he lay on his stomach and stretched down to set the box at the bottom of the shaft finally he closed the doors and stepped out of sight this proves nothing the image could have been manipulated william insisted with fifty dollars of software from a computer store i could make it seem as if you opened those elevator doors yeah but the person who magnified that image is an fbi computer technician wholl testify under oath that the face wasnt altered i cant wait to crossexamine that agent not in this state counselor youre not licensed also i did some checking about your famous brotherinlaw the great defense attorney lester beauchamp is on vacation in europe on the monitor a greentinted image showed a flat roof the green comes from a nightvision camera mosely said at the southern belle that hotel has a stateoftheart surveillance system also the management even put a camera on the roof those are airconditioning units you see in the background and here comes our costar who spraypainted the surveillance cameras on the stairway to the roof but who didnt know about this other camera on the screen silhouetted by the lights of the city a faraway woman came into view she knelt removed a knife from her belt and unscrewed its cap abruptly the image was enlarged the woman was clearly jamie no objections this time counselor mosely asked ill save them for court you do that the group watched as jamie pulled tools from the knifes handle and used them to unscrew an airconditioning duct next she flipped a switch on an object and put it inside finally she used the tools from her knife to close the duct the switch activated a timer on a teargas bomb mosely said the switch cavanaugh tripped was on a smoke bomb naturally he and his wife used latex gloves no fingerprints but seeings believing dont you think you already know my opinion about that william responded well heres my opinion cavanaugh or stoddard or whoever you are you got lucky the trade minister who broke his leg needed a pin put in it the one who had a heart attack is still in intensive care the people whose cars hit the emergency vehicles are still in the hospital also you put four hotels out of business for the days itll take to repair the damage millions of dollars have been lost now you sound like you belong to the chamber of commerce william said counselor shut your mouth you have no legal authority here mosely stared at cavanaugh youre under arrest dont do this cavanaugh said you have the right to remain silent you have the right to an attorney if you cant afford an attorney one will be appointed cavanaugh turned toward rutherford john isnt there any way you can stop this the time for him to have stopped this was last night mosely interrupted trusting civilians is one of the first things an agent learns not to do bankrupt in a stark interview room in the new orleans detention center cavanaugh and jamie listened in disbelief to what william told them you knew global protective services was in precarious financial condition thats why i ordered the cancellation of the planned tokyo office and cutbacks at the others cavanaugh said both were good ideas but the downsizing came too late its not your fault duncan overextended the corporation and this is the consequence in normal circumstances the cash outflow and inflow might have been balanced enough for global protective services to rebuild its strength but the attack on the new york office and the tremendous resources you put into security for the conference tipped the balance its only a matter of weeks before gps collapses couldnt you have waited a while longer before you gave us more bad news jamie asked unfortunately that wasnt an option the judge set bail at a half million dollars for each of you i tried to persuade the bail bondsman to accept gps as equivalent value for the bond but even a hurried examination of the corporations finances was enough to show how wobbly its balance sheet is if you want to be released on bail you need to use your personal resources as collateral personal resources cavanaugh seemed not to understand your jackson hole property william said because the government owns most of the valley and only four percent is available for private ownership the areas land values keep surging even without a structure on it your ranch is worth several million dollars cavanaugh exhaled in what was nearly a gasp not because of the worth of his home but because he suddenly realized how threatened he was carl tried to kill us he burned our home he destroyed my business because of him well probably go to prison which means ill lose my security status dont assume youre going to prison william said mosely arrested you because hes in line to be the bureaus director by refusing to ignore the laws you broke he shows he cant be influenced doesnt play favorites or make exceptions but a lot of people are on your side here are copies of as many national newspapers as i could find usa today the washington post the new york times youre on the front pages and more important the oped pages where youre favorably presented as preventing an even greater disaster youre the topic of every talk show every network called asking for an interview hard to do an interview when were in custody cavanaugh said not to mention protectors shouldnt put their faces on national television programs removes our effectiveness dont you think assuming were ever allowed to work again the point is a lot of people understand the difficult choice you had to make what matters is what the court thinks jamie said what a jury thinks lester beauchamps on his way back from europe hes extremely persuasive i believe theres a good chance youll be exonerated when the trial might not happen for a year williams cell phone rang one moment he pulled the phone from his pocket and raised it to his ear william faraday he listened yes he listened further yes he concentrated thats very generous of you i agreeif things had gone the other way you wouldnt have had the opportunity to be generous youll make the arrangements thank you william lowered his phone in the vernacular it looks as if youll be sprung what happened do you know someone named mr yamato hes one of the leaders of the world trade organization i tried to persuade him to stop the conference i was with him in his hotel suite when the teargas and smoke bombs went off he credits you with saving his life and those of the other delegates if the conference had occurred williams smile showcased his perfectly capped teeth i hope its a sign of the outcome of your legal trouble that he persuaded the world trade organization to post your bail cavanaugh would have been speechless except for the need to ask the most important thing on his mind has anybody figured out where the hell carl is the river was cold gritty greasy submerged in the weight of the muddy water carl heard the muffled vibrations of engines he kept kicking with his heavy shoes in too great a hurry to take the time to stop his momentum unlace them and push them off he had no doubt that aaron was close behind him possibly already in the water thrusting after him kick he ordered himself claw at the water swim harder faster after chasing raoul killing him and rushing to get away from aaron carl felt that his lungs were strained to their capacity his chest ached with the desperate need to take in oxygen no i wont give up i wont let aaron win he swept his arms with greater determination surging through the mucky water feeling the current add to his momentum fifty fiftyone fiftytwo he mentally counted he had to swim as far and fast as possible sixty sixtyone sixtytwo his mind spun even with his eyes closed he saw swirling spots seventyone i once swam underwater for a minute and fortyfive seconds he reminded himself aaron saw me do it he knows how strong i am how far i can carls body took control of his mind no matter how fiercely he willed his lungs not to do it they insisted on inhaling frantic the vibrations around him even louder he propelled himself upward taking in water coughing as he broke the surface a barge sped close threatening to strike him instantly he took a breath and dove kicking aiming toward the opposite shore he had to surface one more time breathe and submerge again then his sweeping arms touched silt and he raised his head slightly from the river blinking filthy water from his eyes wanting to cheer when he saw boats against the shore a wharf see aaron i can still do it but there were too many people on the shore too many chances of being noticed word of the attack in the downtown area would travel fast a man seen crawling from the river would attract so much attention that the police would be alerted they might corner him before he could find a hiding place better to stay where he was under the dock behind its pilings close to the shore where no one would notice him a helicopter thundered overhead a coast guard boat roared past he held his breath and slipped underwater after dark as voices and rumbling footsteps faded from the wharf he eased past a piling listened harder studied the few details he could see above him and climbed a dirt embankment squirming into shadowy bushes seeing nothing to alarm him he crept past a warehouse he worried about the trail of water he left but gradually it lessened as a night breeze dried his clothes he hugged his chest shivering then he heard voices and ducked behind a dumpster bin when the voices receded he skirted the glare of lights creeping deeper into whatever gloom he could find craving darkness by one am his clothes were dry enough for him to be inconspicuous enough to emerge onto a street his cropped hair looked the same as before it had gotten wet granted he was dirty and had an earthy smell from the river but he appeared no different from many homeless people he passed he bought peppermintflavored brandy from an allnight liquor store he approached an alley where several ragged men lay against a wall when he sank next to them they made fists this place is ours here im too sick to drink this he handed the brandy to the most aggressive man after the leader got his share the others shoved at each other grabbing for the bottle meanwhile carl found a space far into the alley next to garbage cans with his back and side protected he gripped his knife under his shirt his pistol having been lost in the river he watched his companions warily until they finished the bottle and sank against a wall eventually he allowed himself to doze although several noises woke him in the night plenty of time to think during the progress of the mission hed accepted two payments of five hundred thousand dollars each with a promise of another million when the assignment was completed that did not include the considerable expense that his employers had paid for him to set up the camp fly across the country to recruit trainees and bring the team to new orleans the receipts hed presented to his employers were detailed and accurate after all he was a principled man although even if hed been tempted to cheat them these people were far too scary for him to risk it but in round numbers the cost to his employers for two years of planning and execution was three million dollars and that did not include his twomilliondollar fee serious money even for a group that got much of its funding from the narcotics trade several times his employers warned him that their investment had better pay off hed given them repeated assurances pointing to the progress he had made they will not he decided be happy i wouldnt have gotten involved if i hadnt been confident these guys would let me spend the money he thought i was sure theyd want me to work for them again i was also sure i could slip away from new orleans and enjoy life in southern france hey i was supposed to be anonymous but thanks to you aaron none of thats going to happen everybodyll be hunting me as the sun rose carl remained still only at nine oclock as the craving for alcohol prompted his companions to stagger from the alley did he leave every action needed to be calculated every decision analyzed from every angle he never went anywhere without a thousand dollars in twenties in a money belt so for the moment he didnt need to worry about cash he bought unremarkable clothes in a discount store he bought jogging shoes he ate two sandwiches from a takeout place thats where he noticed the timespicayune in a vending machine the attack was all over the front page on a secluded bench he studied the newspaper and found a detailed description of him no photograph but one would eventually be found because brockman had scrubbed carls file from the gps records the only source for a picture would be the military but information about delta force was secret and the pentagons bureaucracy would take a while to declassify it the photo would show him in uniform younger and thinnerenough differences that it might not draw attention to him the newspaper had plenty to say about aaron and his wife it gave carl bitter satisfaction that the reporter actually referred to aaron by his given name and revealed that the mysterious single word cavanaugh by which he was known in the protection business was actually an alias but the greater satisfaction came when carl learned that aaron and his wife had been arrested and why they were being charged so that was you at the hotels he thought with angry admiration clever move aaron but now youre in jail while im on the street i bet you think everythings upside down its only starting ill deal with you later pal right now ive got problems to solve a bugout bag always make arrangements for a bugout bag the van carl had abandoned contained one but members of the team might have been captured and interrogated in which case the authorities would know about the van even if that werent the case by now all vehicles left overnight in the conference area would have been investigated he didnt dare return to it always have a backup plan the jet was no longer available having been abandoned at the camp his alternative bugout bag was in a spot that was now offlimits to him a new orleans bus station in theory the arrangement would have worked perfectly get the bag get a ticket get out of town but now he took for granted that the authorities would be watching the bus stations the airport the train depot and the carrental places looking for anyone who matched his description hey he said to a street musician near the bus station want to earn fifty bucks the guy a skinny guitarist with his case open in front of him a couple of dollars in it stopped singing a nasally version of the city of new orleans and asked what do i have to do pull your putz get out of here man nothing funny just a straight business proposition i need you to run an errand for me in the bus station five minutes max and theres a reason you cant run the errand yourself lets make it a hundred reasons carl said showing the money and maybe i walk into trouble in there i guess you dont need the dollars carl turned away wait the scruffy guy said whats the errand this carl showed him the key to a locker ill tell you where the locker is so you dont need to wander around searching for it five minutes in and out you bring me whats in the locker for a hundred right did i say a hundred i made a mistake a scam damn it i figured this was too good to be what i meant was two hundred youre kidding one hundred now one hundred when you bring me whats in the locker and whats in a briefcase the guys eyes reacted want to make a bet carl asked bet that i know what youre thinking you figure the briefcase must contain something really valuable for me to pay two hundred dollars to get it and youre right there are many valuable things in it so your plan would be to take the hundred dollars and steal the briefcase after all if i dont feel comfortable going into the station i must have a reason i dont want to be seen and that means i wont report the theft to the police right the guys face now radiated suspicion something like that carl gripped the arm that wasnt holding the guitar immobilizing him he removed the guys wallet from his back pocket hey the musician said struggling shut up or ill break your guitar carl studied the drivers license okay kenny barrington carl read the address out loud he found a photograph of a young woman pretty she your girl friend no answer four hundred dollars kenny half now half when you come back with the briefcase if i dont see you back here in five minutes the next time you see me itll be the sorriest night of your life and your girl friends life sound fair uh here kenny heres two hundred dollars and the key ill hold your guitar for you be cool my friend easy money minutes later when the musician came back with the briefcase carl watched from a distance the guy looked around in bewilderment then focused on a black kid sitting next to his guitar carl imagined what the kid told him somebody paid me ten bucks to tell you to go into that starbucks over there and buy some coffee if the musician had warned the police about a man who paid him four hundred dollars to get a briefcase out of a locker carl would see if anyone followed no one did as the musician carried his guitar and the briefcase into the starbucks front entrance carl came in from the side entrance took the briefcase gave him the other two hundred and told him nice to meet an honest man in one of the citys lovely parks carl sat watched a bicyclist go past nodded to a woman with a stroller smiled at children on swings and worked the combination lock on the briefcase the case was dull brown attracting no attention he slid his hand inside and felt past five thousand dollars a pistol an extra magazine fifty rounds of ammunition a knife small rolls of duct tape fake id and other necessities he gripped a cell phone his previous phone had been destroyed by the river he pulled the new one out closed the briefcase and enjoyed the pleasant morning then he couldnt postpone his business any longer he pressed numbers on the encryptionequipped phone and waited after two rings the connection was completed although the person on the other end didnt speak presumably waiting to learn which language to use this is bowie carl said you disappoint us carl felt his chest harden things went wrong they couldnt be helped you accepted our money but did not produce results i got some results the mission isnt a total failure you sound like a child making excuses carls muscles tightened now because of anger it was a unique situation the next time the person who caused the problem wont exist your friend if he had been available to us the mission would have succeeded carl bit the inside of his cheek you will return the fee we already paid you the voice said one million dollars an electronic transfer by noon tomorrow of course you will also return the money we paid for expenses and preparations you know its been spent where am i going to find three million dollars perhaps from your friend the voice said acidly we need to meet to discuss what has happened id never survive the meeting carl thought well at the moment thats a little difficult the authorities are hunting me im trying to get out of new orleans i dont mean today thats impossible im flying to the philippines and you feel comfortable talking about this on a plane a private jet i arrive in an hour when you reach a secure location contact me again ill tell you where to meet me carl felt a weightless sensation as if a trap door opened beneath him as soon as i arrange an electronic transfer of the money hell invite me to a meeting and have me killed perhaps hell do it himself on a plane are you passing the time trying to figure out how to open the secret knife i gave you thats another way you disappoint me your ridiculous knife doesnt work i tried every possible combination sure it works have you got it with you in my pocket on the top combination turn the man in the moon to two oclock on the bottom combination turn the arrow to roman numeral x i already tried that nothing happened try it again impatient the voice said the same result nothing did you release the catch what catch recessed into the bottom of the handle see the little hook you didnt say anything about that its barely visible the voice complained pull it this had better the transmission ended near the philippines the newly married couple strolled the deck of the cruise ship holding hands they admired the glorious radiance of the stars you cant see this in philadelphia the man said all the light pollution in the city interferes with the woman pointed whats that oh my god the man said one of the stars exploded it blossomed like a rocket on the fourth of july flaming debris plummeted toward the water seconds later the rumble of the blast echoed over them dont call a knife i made ridiculous carl said he shut off the phone worked to calm his heartbeat then directed a melancholy look at the children playing on the swings in the park detonating the explosive in the knife hadnt solved anything there would be others to take the swarthy mans place and those others too would demand the return of their money he couldnt possibly come up with millions of dollars when the electronic transfer did not occur they would insist on meeting with him something to be avoided with every effort from now on his life would be a matter of running and hiding no blowing up the plane definitely didnt solve anything carl thought but it certainly gave me a world of satisfaction maybe aarons right maybe i do need a few more lessons about keeping control the children he couldnt take his sad gaze from the children hey aaron wouldnt it be great if we could go back to being kids if only life could be simple again the game all that mattered now was the game he picked up the newspaper hed set next to him after reading about aaron and his wife one more time he turned to the classified ads the areas airports train stations bus depots and carrental agencies were being watched but there were other ways to get out of town sounds a little rough carl said hey im not pretending she dont need a tuneup i figured that into the price what about oil changes regular maintenance stuff like that four months ago then the twins got born im so tired working two jobs to pay the bills i aint driven her since truth is i didnt take her out much before the twins got born guess im getting too old for kid stuff naw youre never too old to act like a kid tell that to my old lady well if youre sure you want to sell need to dont have two jobs anymore thats how you caught me at home the factory where i worked my day job got shut down and moved to mexico i really need the money but like i told you on the phone i wont take a check dont blame you cant be too careful heres the three thousand in cash now all you need to do is sign the ownership papers and ill make sure the titles transferred to me hate to part with her well you can count on me taking care of her for you thanks mister i dont suppose youve got a helmet in the garage some place my wife got it for me but i never bothered always made me feel trapped bad for your health gotta stay safe you know youre a decent enough guy tell you what ill throw in the helmet and my goggles naw that wouldnt be right sounds like the twins are waking up as you say you can use the cash i wouldnt want to take advantage heres another fifty bucks much obliged mister a minute later his helmet and goggles adjusted carl fired up the old yamaha and drove from the modest neighborhood by then it was twelve fifteen the sun was pleasantly warm the breeze created by the motorcycle soothed him it had been years since hed driven a bike and now he wondered why he had ever stopped the mobility the freedom the independence plus unless you wore leathers and a hells angels scowl people tended not to pay attention to you as the number of accidents in which cars ran into motorcycles confirmed enjoying the vibration of the engine between his legs carl passed a police cruiser looking straight ahead he concentrated on traffic and obeyed the speed limit confident that the cops in the cruiser wouldnt pay attention to him the goggles and helmet indicated how safetyconscious and lawabiding he was he found his way to interstate and headed west skirting lake pontchartrain impressed by the expanse of the water he reached interstate and proceeded north soon passing lake maurepas the fishing boats the waves the evocative smell of the water the feeling of freedom blending with the flow of cars he luxuriated in each moment and discovered that eighty miles went by like they were nothing before he realized he was in the small louisiana city of hammond which for his purposes had one major asset an amtrak station he knew this because familiarity with the train routes out of new orleans was part of his contingency plan just as hed known the bus routes but after getting directions to the train station he decided that if the station in new orleans would be under surveillance didnt it make sense that the nearest amtrak station in another city would be under surveillance also hell eighty miles was nothing he stopped for a burger fries and a coke at a drivein restaurant they tasted as delicious as when hed been a kid then he returned to interstate and headed farther north in an hour he crossed into mississippi and now he felt less threatened although he didnt delude himself that the hunt for him would not continue to be urgent and widespread the next amtrak station was twenty miles farther in another small city mccomb but again his instincts warned him away too small a station too easy to be spotted by then it was four in the afternoon fatigue insisted but he couldnt rest until he was confident that hed found sanctuary and food he couldnt seem to get enough to eat but there wasnt time he drove another ninety minutes to the large amtrak station in jackson mississippi making sure that his fingerprints were wiped clean he left the motorcycle on a side street a few blocks from the station by midnight the bike would be gone no way to trace it to him trying not to attract attention by hurrying he went to a convenience store he kept his back to the security camera while he bought shampoo toothpaste a toothbrush shaving soap a razor and a packet of kleenex subduing his urgency he shaved in a mens room in the train station making himself as presentable as possible he went into a toilet stall locked it then stuffed kleenex under his lips and into his cheeks changing the profile of his face making it look puffy rather than gauntcheeked as the newspaper described him he leaned forward at the ticket counter reducing his height chicago he said this evening you just made it arrives at nine tomorrow morning got anything in the sleeping car lets see yep one compartment left must be my lucky day your honor my clients request that the conditions of their release be relaxed sufficiently to allow them to leave louisiana and fly to new york city their corporation global protective services requires their immediate presence to oversee urgent financial matters relative to the continuing existence of their company if my clients are unable to perform their corporate functions the result will be calamitous destroying their livelihood and that of hundreds of employees the charges notwithstanding mr stoddard has an exemplary record as a protective agent credited with saving the lives of numerous international figures who function at the highest levels of finance government and entertainment prior to that he defended the united states as a member of the elite military unit delta force you have heard the respect that mr yamato and other members of the world trade organization have for him and his wife so much in fact that they guarantee bail my clients offer to surrender their passports the rhythm of the wheels on the railroad tracks gradually soothed him clickety clickety for a half hour carl sat next to the small table in his compartment his hand on his pistol he expected that at any moment the door would burst open and men would throw flashbangs at him he kept the window shade drawn but then he worried about what he wasnt able to see raising the shade he saw only passing countryside and gathering shadows after his heartbeat calmed he went to the compartments sink removed the wads of kleenex from his mouth and brushed his teeth no matter how filthy he was on a mission he always felt clean if he had a chance to brush his teeth then he washed his hair in the sink and used a wet towel to swab the dirt and river smell from him all the while keeping his pistol close and his gaze on the locked door hunger demanded to be satisfied at the convenience store hed bought a coke two ham sandwiches and a bag of potato chips hed wanted much more but hed been afraid of being remembered if he bought too much food in addition to his other purchases clickety clickety the sandwiches were stale and tasteless he washed them down with the nowwarm coke seasoning them with the equally stale potato chips clickety clickety outside the window the countryside rolled by vague trees and hills in the darkness glowing windows in farmhouses then the glare of towns he shut off the light eased onto his bunk set his knife and pistol next to him and stared at the ceiling the passing shadows rippled over it mercifully he slept but then the clickety clickety slowed the change of rhythm woke him hearing the squeal of breaks he grabbed his pistol and peered out the window only to see a small train station a passenger departing into the gloom no one else was in view nothing to be alarmed about he started to lay back but then noticed a sign on the stations wall newberndyersburg tennessee a hand seemed to reach inside his barely full stomach and twist at his guts the northward amtrak line passed through the extreme western edge of tennessee he knew a hundred miles to the east was nashville where carls father had taken the family after his drunkenness caused him to lose his stockbrokers job in iowa city in nashville the arguments and beatings had worsened one night carl found his father unconscious at the kitchen table at three in the morning the lights were on a halfempty bottle of peppermint brandy sat next to him the peppermint soothed the stomach inflammation that years of too much alcohol caused carl had laid out bread mustard mayonnaise lettuce dill pickles and a chunk of ham as if his father had decided to make a sandwich his father was so stupefied that the muted sounds didnt wake him carl applied mustard and mayonnaise to one slice of bread he took a sharp knife and cut into the ham he used a dishtowel to wipe his fingerprints from everything he used the same towel while he held his fathers hands and applied fingerprints to bottles plates and the bread wrapper uh his father said ssshh carl said he raised his father from the table then hefted him to the counter and the halfprepared sandwich he put the sharp knife in his fathers right hand and knocked his fathers legs from under him making sure that the knife plowed into his fathers stomach when he hit the floor his father tried to moan but carl pressed his hands over his fathers mouth as a pool of blood spread his father trembled then lay still avoiding the blood on the floor taking care that none was on him carl went back to bed he enjoyed the most satisfying sleep of his life now carl wished that the same peaceful sleep would come to him watching the ripple of shadows across the train compartments ceiling he tried to think back to when if ever his life had been the way he wanted there had been a time he decided daylight the illinois train stations went by champaignurbana kankakee homewood that name filled him with bitterness next stop chicago he used his cell phone a womans pleasant voice said grand cayman bank i need to wiretransfer nine thousand dollars to my bank account in chicago that account under an assumed identity had been carefully established two years earlier the nine thousand dollars was less than the tenthousanddollar transaction amount that banks were required to report to the federal government certainly sir may i have your account number and your password carl recited the number from memory the password is stiletto thank you sir a moment lengthened sir would you please repeat that account number is there a problem i may have mistyped it carl repeated it sir our records fail to show any funds in that account but there should be a million dollars no sir im afraid there arent any funds try that number again carl recited it slowly yes sir thats the number im accessing but the account does not have a balance the undigested sandwiches from the night before soured carls stomach was there ever any money in it yes sir as you mentioned a million dollars yesterday afternoon it was wire transferred to another bank carl swallowed something bitter thank you youre welcome cavanaugh admired the gulfstreams interior the last time he would see it the jet needs to go back to its base in new jersey anyhow william said the expense is the same whether were aboard or not so we might as well take advantage it never occurred to me to ask how much it costs to fly this four thousand dollars an hour and we crossed the country several times no wonder the companys going bankrupt when youre protecting a saudi prince the fees high enough to earn out william said but when im fighting to stay alive its too expensive the powerful engines whispered as the jet reached its scheduled altitude streaking through clouds less than a week ago you didnt want anything to do with global protective services jamie said and now you hate to lose it yes cavanaugh told her bitterly because of carl the train arrived in chicago ten minutes late slouching carl blended with the departing passengers on the damp shadowy concourse he carried his briefcase in his left hand while his right hand was primed to reach for a weapon he had strips of a towel under his lips and inside his cheeks altering his features his ears had kleenex wadded neatly into them keeping in the thick of the crowd he entered the brightly lit terminal the din of which was muffled by the padding in his ears he tensed when he saw two policemen studying everybody they stopped a tall thin man who looked somewhat like carl and asked him questions carl showed no reaction face blank eyes forward shoulders drooped he kept moving not breaking rhythm just another zombie take it easy he thought youll be fine the you was deliberately chosen a way of disassociating from the moment and keeping his emotions in check if they really believed you were on a train that arrived here thered be a small army to welcome you not a handful of cops he tried to assure himself approaching an exit he glanced at a newsstand then looked ahead as if the newspapers meant nothing even though a large photograph of him stared from the chicago tribune the chicago suntimes and usa today not a military photograph not him young and in uniform this was a recent photograph of him among a crowd on a street new orleans taken by a security camera it depicted him chasing somebody raoul digitally magnified and enhanced alarmingly clear the image showed carl in profile more than in profile three quarters of his features silently cursing he saw another policeman scanning the crowd and warned himself be cool no onell recognize you from that picture it isnt a full face and the angles downward everythings going to be fine yeah sure right he could no longer objectify suddenly you became i im being hunted by the bastards who hired me and by every lawenforcement agency in the country every intelligence agency also ive got fifty rounds of ammunition and two thousand dollars what the hell am i supposed to do play the game for the rest of my life a policeman appeared at the exit ahead shielded by businessmen carl kept walking the policeman straightened paying attention to him immediately carl reached into a pants pocket and removed an object hed taken from the briefcase a small canister as the policeman blurted something to a microphone attached to his shoulder carl pulled a pin from the canister and dropped it behind him the canister clanked onto the floor and made several people turn to look the policeman drew his gun and stepped toward carl raising a hand to warn him to stop carl pretended not to notice the policeman shouted stop right there at once the canister a flashbang detonated having counting the seconds until it did carl knew when to close his eyes even then and even though the flash was behind him the searing brightness pushed through his eyelids anyone facing that direction including the cop would be blinded the bang from the device was literally deafening except for carl whod used kleenex to protect his eardrums the force of the two onslaughts stunned the policeman and shoved him backward people screamed they scrambled over each other terrorists carl shouted a bomb the panic worsened everybody charging toward the exits carl moved with them instead of fighting their fierce momentum he allowed it to take him the next thing he was outside the stampede spreading into traffic while he blended with people charging along the sidewalk the manhattan headquarters for global protective services looked as busy and professional as ever but cavanaugh knew that the strength and solidity were only apparent with jamie and william he entered his office an outsider would not have realized that less than a week earlier the place had been littered with bomb wreckage now a close look showed cavanaugh that the hasty cleanup was only cosmetic that the damage had been disguised not repaired like the corporation he thought i cant imagine how expensive our lease is a half million dollars a year william said amazing that the company stayed in business as long as it did two executive officers dead and one in a detox ward jamie slumped in a chair its going to be hard dismantling the various operations cavanaugh said jamie youre the one with a business background how do we handle this for starters we alert the heads of our foreign offices and tell them to cancel all upcoming assignments then we negotiate to terminate all our office leases and have other protection firms take over the jobs already in progress after that we a cold october wind breathed a premonition of winter especially after the warmth of new orleans it made carl shiver but as he retreated along the walkway next to the chicago river maintaining a disciplined inconspicuous pace appearing to enjoy the view of the water he was determined not to go into a store and risk buying a jacket after all the photograph in the newspapers was likely to be on television as well word would have spread quickly that hed been spotted in chicago people would pay attention to strangers his discomfort gave him a glimpse of the future decreasing possibilities and increasing deprivations what happens when my moneys gone do i start holding up liquor stores hell i cant show my face to spend the money anyhow where am i going to sleep tonight i cant risk going to a hotel even a seedy one it wont be long before the government offers a reward do i hide in an alley the way i did two nights ago do i hole up in the woods play the game hide and seek he passed a newspaper that someone had stuffed into a garbage bin making sure than no one was near him he pulled out the paper and studied his photograph on the front page aaron you son of a bitch i should be getting laid on the riviera right now in a fury he read that aaron and his wife had managed to post bail and been released it gave him savage pleasure to learn that global protective services was about to collapse only a fraction of what you deserve you bastard aaron and his wife had been allowed to leave louisiana and fly to new york to begin the process of dissolving the company if he had been available to us the mission would have been a success the swarthy man had said before carl blew him up well lets see about that carl thought hide for the rest of my life aaron ill prove to you how good i am on a bench ahead a man slept next to a bicycle the man had beard stubble and matted dirty hair he wore a ragged jacket and filthy jeans attached to the rear of the bicycle a small cart contained plastic bags of what appeared to be even more ragged clothing a cord led from the mans wrist to the bicycle a burglar alarm carl checked that no one was paying attention he unclipped his knife from his pants pocket thumbed the blade open and sliced the cord he wheeled the bike out of earshot it had only one gear and didnt make the clicking sound of sports bikes he stopped just long enough to pull a ragged blue shirt from a bag and pull it over the brown shirt hed bought in new orleans then he got on and bicycled away like a motorcyclist wearing goggles and a helmet a ragged homeless man on a bicycle towing his few meager possessions was invisible he still had the newspaper from the waste bin when he felt that it was safe to stop he planned to study the personal ads and buy another used motorcycle there was always the risk that hed be recognized but he would sense if that happened and make sure the man selling the motorcycle couldnt warn anyone he didnt have enough cash to buy as good a bike as the yamaha hed abandoned in mississippi but then the bike didnt need to function long his destination was only five hours away after cavanaugh cancelled yet another assignment and set down the phone he sensed the receptionist standing in his office doorway yes you had a dozen more calls exhausted cavanaugh glanced at his watch the time was shortly after five pm and he had several more clients to talk to anything urgent they all seem urgent at the desk jamie typed computer keys as william spoke into a phone arranging an auction for the gulfstream one callers more insistent than the others the receptionist said holding up a list so far he contacted us eight times must be a really angry creditor whats his name lance sawyer cavanaugh straightened overhearing jamie frowned but isnt that the name of the old man who taught you and carl how to make knives cavanaugh grabbed the list and pressed the phone number on it william looked puzzled whats going on cavanaugh activated the speaker function on his phone on the other end the phone rang only once its tinny buzz filling the room immediately the three of them heard a mans voice hey aaron hows it going cavanaugh clenched his fists as he leaned over the conference table fabulous not likely i read in the newspaper that you spent time in the slammer yesterday sorry to learn about all the trouble youre having try to sound sincere cavanaugh watched jamie and william approach the phone listening to the smooth voice that came from its speaker is the fbi trying to locate where this calls originating from or are you and the government not on such great terms any longer to tell the truth carl i was so eager to talk to you i didnt think to alert them the truths always nice not to mention rare coming from you half the directional works already been done for them anyhow they know im in chicago chicago havent you been watching television the carl duran show instantly jamie went to a cabinet in a corner and turned on a television afraid i missed it cavanaugh said oh its getting big ratings lots of action suspense and mystery the television was tuned to cnn where a reporter stood in what looked to be a train station nervouslooking passengers going past the words live from chicago appeared at the bottom of the screen the program changed to video from a security camera mounted in a corner the image showed passengers crossing the terminal the picture became magnified focusing on a man who resembled carl the cheeks were fuller as he approached an exit a policeman hurried toward him a flash filled the screen even with the televisions sound at low volume cavanaugh heard a powerful detonation the crowd screamed charging toward the doors im watching it now cavanaugh said nicely done thats high praise aaron considering that you dont believe anybody can do anything better than you i always admitted you made knives better and youre certainly a better swimmer gosh all these compliments are going to my head turn yourself in carl right you cant hide forever i can give it a try that abortionclinic bomber lasted five years in the woods freezing his ass in the winter living off acorns and lizards in the summer yeah good buddy but he wasnt trained the way you and i were im serious turn yourself in carl i can arrange for you to do it safely golly i appreciate your concern you can bargain with the authorities give them information about the bastards who hired you negotiate for a bearable prison sentence dont i wish see the problem is i dont have anything to reveal i dealt with one guy he told me nothing about his organization i dont even know what his real name was was hes dead an unfortunate plane explosion aaron dont bullshit me we both know if i turn myself in the governmentll go for the death penalty a thousand people are dead for gods sake the governmentll snuff me the way it did that guy who blew up the federal building in oklahoma city i dont like that option a whole lot my only chance is to play the game game carl lied he wasnt anywhere near chicago his newly acquired motorcycle had taken him twohundredandfifty miles west where he now sat on a picnic bench watching a shallow creek meander through autumnbrilliant trees while he spoke to the phone the game aaron thats all there is thats all there ever was a chill wind bit into him so heres the deal im offering you one last chance to play tomorrow night the usual place but if you dont show up or you bring help youll piss me off even more than you already have if you betray me again ill come to you but the next time you wont get fair warning itd be nice to meet your lovely wife through the phone carl heard a noise as if a hand slammed a table now youre threatening my wife aaron shouted you cocksucker thats the spirit aaron carl broke the connection hearing the dead air cavanaugh slowly lowered the phone and deactivated its speaker function his heart pounded with rage gradually he became aware of jamie and william staring at him one last chance to play tomorrow night the usual place jamie said hes challenging you to a fight sounds like it one on one that seems to be the idea do you know the place he means william asked cavanaugh thought for a moment yes i believe i do where cavanaugh didnt answer youre not seriously thinking about accepting the challenge jamie wanted to know i hate him so much everything hes done to us you have no idea how much id like to but jamie said you wont you heard him hes giving me a chance at him if i dont take it his target will be you not if you phone mosely and rutherford and tell them about this william said itll go a long way toward getting the fbi on your side again theyll order the placewherever it issurrounded a swat team will take care of this but what if they cant the place i think carl means there are too many ways for him to see if i betrayed him and brought help too many ways to escape im willing to bet my life but not jamies dont i have something to say about that what if he wins then hell leave you alone but he isnt going to win did he ever win before when we were kids well youre not kids any longer if the fbi doesnt get him well deal with the consequences together but i wont let you use me as an excuse to satisfy your hate and possibly get yourself killed cavanaugh studied her william he finally said i assume its easier for you to negotiate in person than on the phone thats correct then arrange a meeting with mosely and john as soon as possible cavanaugh picked up the phone and made a call of his own when a voice answered he said get the gulfstream ready to fly in an hour selling it not just yet im amazed mosely said the lights of washingtons capitol building gleamed beyond his office window shocked in fact youre actually following proper procedure instead of showing everybody what a hotshot you are all i ever tried to do was the right thing cavanaugh told him sure of course it would have been even better if youd alerted us before you made the call so we could try to trace it but i guess im asking for too much this usual place he referred to i assume its the farm where the old man taught you and duran to make knives no then where is it now cavanaugh looked at william do we have an understanding the attorney asked counselor i dont make deals were not asking for a deal my client is willing to cooperate to the fullest extent but he wants that taken into consideration when his case comes to trial consideration oh hell get plenty of consideration if he doesnt cooperate rutherford sat next to mosely at the conference table he leaned forward one friend to another wheres the usual place aaron a park in iowa city its down the street from where he and i used to live a park willow creek carl and i played there often when we were kids we used to pretend we were specialoperations soldiers shot down behind enemy lines we hid in the bushes and trees and kept the enemy people walking through the park from noticing us keep talking aaron then we changed the game and pretended we were on opposite sides we had rubber knives and we hunted each other we got so good at hiding that sometimes it took all day before we finished the game who won rutherford asked sometimes i did sometimes carl did so you assume hes inviting you to have one last goaround mosely asked yes instead of trying to escape maybe carl doesnt think he can escape maybe he figures he might as well amuse himself in the little time he has left well its for sure he cant escape mosely said youre one hundred percent confident about this hunch of yours its not a hunch carl wouldnt have been vague about the location unless he knew it was the only place id think of the usual place where we played the game youd better be right mosely emphasized if this is part of his strategy if hes using you to jerk us around and you fell for it i wont be happy and that means you wont be happy tomorrow night he said cavanaugh nodded the fallout from what happened in new orleans is so complicated i cant possibly get away in fact im expected right now at another meeting mosely stood and looked at rutherford youre in charge of counterterrorism make sure you catch this guy assuming this isnt just a big joke on us mosely picked up a briefcase and left the room cavanaugh thought hes setting up john to take the fall if anything goes wrong john cavanaugh said your friendship means a lot to me i believed i was doing the right thing i still do i never meant to put your job at risk i never thought it would seem i abused your trust things dont always turn out the way we want rutherford said im sorry the office felt cold tomorrow night rutherford asked yes but hell start earlier have you got room on your fancy plane for an fbi swat team and this time you dont carry guns this time youre truly a civilian cavanaugh wasnt prepared for the changes driving into town from iowa citys airport he asked the fbi driver to head toward the park might be risky rutherford said if duran sees you in a van full of people at eight in the morning were just one in a stream of vehicles going to work he wont even try to monitor traffic at this hour what hell look for is stationary surveillance i made sure there isnt any rutherford said i dont want to scare him away tonight after he has a chance to go in and get settled well surround the park and tighten the noose assuming youre right about this i guarantee hes in there at this very moment as their driver turned left onto west benton one of the streets that flanked the park cavanaugh couldnt adjust to how much traffic there was in his youth this had been a sleepy area of town on the verge of farmland now except for the park itself the area was thick with houses and apartment buildings with greater surprise cavanaugh peered to the right and saw that the park wasnt the same either dense woods had been cut down leaving trees only along willow creek clearing the area had made room for more soccer fields on the opposite end near where there had once been a cornfield a childrens climbinggym area had been added in there right now rutherford said it doesnt look to me as if he has many places to hide ive got a bad feeling cavanaugh murmured to jamie and william as they followed rutherford and his men into iowa citys modestsized police station the noisy lobby was crowded with lawenforcement officers the overflow from a crammed conference room two men in uniforms one police one military pushed through and spoke to rutherford not enough room for a briefing rutherford said when he returned were switching locations to the national guard armory time cavanaugh thought even though its eightfifteen in the morning well soon run out of day for that matter im told the armory might not be large enough rutherford said hurrying with them from the police station the current estimate is we need at least a thousand people to seal off that park police officers and sheriffs are coming in from all over the state weve got fbi agents and us marshals flying from as far as st louis denver minneapolis and chicago through homeland security we also received permission to use the local detachment of the national guard another alert william said another stress on a severely stressed system reminds me of new orleans jamie said lets hope for a simpler outcome damn it a policeman pointed here comes a reporter the armory filled rapidly its high ceiling caused a harsh echo as hundreds of military and law enforcement personnel gathered in front of a platform behind a podium a large map of willow creek park hung from a portable blackboard standing to the side jamie said i dont see how they can get organized soon enough john has a lot of amazing skills cavanaugh told her he pointed toward where rutherford spoke to a halfdozen intense civilians all of them holding notepads and tape recorders let you observe the briefing he heard rutherford say let you take notes and photographs what about photographs a reporter demanded only at the end but i dont want you printing anything until i tell you we cant promise that its a matter of national security what are you talking about whats the emergency in return for complete access i want you to swear you wont leak the story if word about whats happening reaches the general population well have so many curiosity seekers at the park our target might slip away park target watch listen and learn rutherford said mounting the podium he did indeed have a lot of amazing skills not the least of which was the clear authoritative way he conducted the briefing as the disparate group concentrated on what he said they stood straighter assuming similar body language showing signs of coalescing into a unit the information that their objective was related to the terrorist attack in new orleans and the subsequent nationwide manhunt certainly got their attention at three hundred hours tomorrow morning well secure the four approaches to the park using a red flashlight beam rutherford indicated areas on the map once we know he cant escape well wait until daylight theres no use going in blind the northern flank will progress into the search area checking every conceivable place where someone might hide the other flanks will remain in position to make sure the target stays trapped some of you might be wondering why every flank doesnt converge on the park squeezing him into the center that way all of you would be part of the action the answer is we dont want you shooting each other in a crossfire if the target puts up a fight the group was so confident about their skills that they assumed rutherford was joking they chuckled continuing to bond weve got a great deal to accomplish in a very short time equipment weapons transportation timing therell be two staging areas here and a high school a half mile from the park rutherford looked toward an official at the side west high is that right the official nodded after the students go home well conduct practice drills in the track behind the school before we enter the search area the streets near the park need to be blocked off we also need to evacuate the homes that border the park this is special agent murphy from the fbi office in des moines shell organize you into north south east and west units as well as traffic diversion and evacuation teams after that one hour later with the briefing almost concluded rutherford said finally i want to introduce a man who knows the target intimately they grew up here they played in that park so often that it was practically their backyard they served in the military together they worked as protective agents together cavanaugh climbed to the platform hundreds of faces studied him new personnel entered through a door in back he took the microphone from rutherford it made an electronic hum then settled down i wont take long youre tired of listening you want to get started they nodded their eyes bright with the urge to hunt when you see the park you might conclude that theres little cover and it wont be hard to find him you might feel confident because there are so many of you and youre going against only one man those attitudes could get you killed never forget that your quarry is exdelta force he has worldclass training in camouflage and concealment fighting in unexpected ways is one of his specialties death is one of his specialties when you go into that park tomorrow morning youre entering his world suspect everything an fbi agent raised a hand but surely he realizes theres a good chance you wont show up alone tonight why would he gamble you wont turn him in actually i think he expects me to betray him by bringing help cavanaugh said the group looked puzzled he wants to prove how superior he is cavanaugh continued for him everythings a competition he doesnt care if i bring even a small army to catch him hes telling me he can outsmart all of you ten feet apart no more than that rutherford shouted we dont want any gaps in the line on command youll step forward at the steady pace youve been practicing supervisors will follow making certain each line remains straight most of you will keep your eyes toward the ground every eighth man will study the trees in case the target tries to hide in one each hollow each pile of leaves each fallen tree limb assume they conceal the target some of you will be in the creek bed look for tracks look for evidence that someone dug into a bank if any of you think youve spotted something blow the whistle youve been given the line will stop while a team behind you checks the area in question your supervisors will tell you when to move forward again each of you has a firearm remember to keep it aimed ahead of you toward the ground or if youre the eighth man upward toward the trees you know the basics do not point your weapon at anything you dont intend to destroy do not put your finger on the trigger unless you intend to pull it do not fire unless youre aware of whats behind your target in other words gentlemen and ladies dont shoot each other the rules of engagement are as follows capture if possible but remember the target is ruthless and dangerous to an extreme we want to interrogate him but not at the expense of anyones life the personnel at the armory will be driven to the high school before dark rutherford told cavanaugh after the briefing well use school buses no one will pay attention to school buses going to a school starting at two hundred hours each unit will walk the half mile from the school to the park i dont want the noise from a lot of buses warning the target that were coming he might slip away before were all in place en route to the search area the teams will be under orders not to talkcan you think of anything else rig a plane with an infrared camera cavanaugh said tonight have the pilot fly over the park while someone takes photographs maybe youll get carls heat signature on the pictures you might find out where hes hiding please remember my clients cooperation when his trial starts william said the teams consumed hundreds of pizzas and sodas in the schools cafeteria afterward they sprawled in the corridors and the gymnasium knowing that theyd soon be on the move they dozed as best they could at they were wakened they used the toilets whether they felt the urge or not at two they left the building in the dark a cold breeze made them zip their coats shut and shift from one foot to the other as they assembled in their assigned groups they heard a plane fly over obeying the command not to speak they hiked to the park by three they reached their appointed areas spread out in lines that flanked the park and waited lights came on in houses behind them troubled questions prompted orders to evacuate automobiles soon driving away then the night became quiet just before five it started to drizzle rain rutherfords voice was loud inside the van the forecast predicted it wouldnt start until late afternoon inexact science cavanaugh said by then wed have caught duran wed have been out of here the downpour pelted the vans window at what should have been a brilliant dawn was a dismal gray where are we going to find rain gear at this hour rutherford complained the men are soaked theyll get hypothermia a car sped toward the van and skidded to a stop on the slick pavement finally rutherford said a man hurried from the car flecked with moisture he scrambled inside the van and handed a manila envelope to rutherford here are your photos impatient rutherford sorted through them frowning he handed them to cavanaugh see anything a few hot spots cavanaugh said this ones so small its probably a squirrel this other one looks like a dog but no heat signature that looks like it came from a human being cavanaugh studied the photos a final time no then he lied to you or you misunderstood the place he meant hes not in there wrong cavanaugh said this is definitely the place and this is part of his game but a human being gives off heat the infrared image would show it if hes in the park unless he shielded himself so a camera wouldnt detect the heat buried himself its one possibility in that case we dont have to worry because hes drowned by now he might not even be wet after all he was trained to plan for the worst but even if he is soaked he doesnt care these conditions are luxurious compared to some of what we went through in delta force you know rutherford said im getting tired of hearing about the good old days in delta you did say you wanted my opinion and whats your opinion of what we ought to do now get started your chance to end this peacefully and give yourself up rutherfords amplified words drifted across the park he used a publicaddress system the speakers of which were mounted to the top of the van he waited two minutes became five he turned from the rain on the windshield counselor i asked him three times i put a lot of sincerity into it do you think thats enough fair warning without waiting for an answer he raised his microphone and said go on the right the northern flank moved into the park while those on the south west and east formed barricades cavanaugh opened the vans side door what are you doing getting some exercise the van was on teg drive a street that bordered the eastern side of the park feeling the cold rain pelt his head cavanaugh passed through the line of men on that side and followed the northern flank as it continued into the park initially there werent any obstacles just the creek flowing through a grassy field then the searchers reached trees along the creek and slowed their advance dead wet leaves lay along the creek their autumn colors now dull sensing someone next to him cavanaugh turned and saw jamie he smiled youll get soaked she said so will you he replied yeah but walking in the rain is romantic she told him while some searchers examined the area among the trees others came to a playground swings slides climbing equipment they passed metal picnic tables they reached a shelter and checked its washrooms as well as it rafters they looked under a bridge that crossed the creek they attempted to pry up a stormdrain lid but it was too heavy they peered into various garbage cans secured in wooden frames more trees another bridge another they arrived at the new playground that a sign said was called kiwanis park climbing equipment was nestled in a grotto surrounded by rock walls and fir trees an open shelter had picnic tables under it its rafters were exposed no place to hide that was it theyd come to the southern flank of men houses behind them the end of the park suddenly rutherford crossed the soaked grass toward cavanaugh and jamie nothing he said flicking rain from his face mosely was right durans playing games with us he isnt here that was just a first pass cavanaughs wet clothes stuck to him they checked the obvious things now they should go through the park again noticing details what about the neighboring houses he might be hiding in a garage or a shed no the houses arent in the park when we played the game we never broke the rules and went out of bounds rutherford shook his head unhappily and walked to the men whod searched the area he spoke to the officer in charge who looked eager to get out of the rain but who nodded and shouted orders motioning for the line to reverse direction rutherford came back to cavanaugh and jamie show me the details that bothered you the ground under every picnic table needs to be checked cavanaugh said walking rutherford thought about it sure the grass under some of them is worn away until theres only dirt if he dug a hole there it would be easier to disguise than if he dug up the grass the problem is hed need a cover something solid that he could put dirt on and slide over the hole after he got in when we drove into town i noticed a halfdozen construction sites cavanaugh said the night before last he could have grabbed a square of plywood and something to dig with where would he have put the dirt from the hole spread along the creek bed covered with leaves how would he have carried it in a bag he found at a construction site an empty cement bag is strong enough to hold forty pounds but the dirt on the plywood lid would look freshly dug not if carl packed it down until he was satisfied that it looked like the dirt under all the other benches leaves on the lid would hide the cracks at the edges ventilation a tube coming up next to a table leg well if thats where hes hiding rutherford concluded hes in rising water hell need to climb out soon youd be surprised how snug and dry you can make a hole in the ground with a little help from a plastic sheet more of the good old days in delta actually the good old days when carl and i were kids this is one of the tricks he used against me in the rain the line searched the park in greater detail moving picnic tables looking under play equipment examining the edges of shelters for signs that someone had dug under the concrete pads they found nothing they need to do it again cavanaugh said those garbage cans in wooden frames lets push them aside and see if carls in a hole under one of them carl wasnt that stormdrain lid needs to be pried up the tunnel needs to be checked but the tunnel was filled with water look for evidence that carl dug under the concrete paths four hours and five crossings later rutherford said firmly were wasting our time he isnt here but either he tricked you or else you made a mistake about the place he meant this is it theres no other place rutherford studied the shivering wet exhausted men many of them coughed wind gusted dark clouds thickened im calling off the search no please theyve been out here since three in the morning rutherford said somebodyll end up in the hospital just one more time to prove that youre wrong as far as moselys concerned that would be the only good thing to come out of this okay aaron just for you one more time they probed the sand under the playground equipment farther along they did the same to the wood chips around the climbinggym yet again they found nothing water trickling down his face rutherford pointed toward tv news cameras near the park they should air this after a three stooges marathon i can only hope the rain blurs any shots they took of me he turned toward the searchers were finished everybody the buses will arrive soon well take you somewhere warm and dry coffee someone said steaming pots of it rutherford promised he stared at a puddle in the grass a thousand men some flew in from across the country food lodging buses vans weapons equipment he gazed up at cavanaugh nothing to show for it moselys waiting for me to report to him i can imagine his reaction when i tell him how much everything cost this time tomorrow i might be looking for a new job shoulders bent rutherford walked toward teg drive and the van the lines disintegrated soaked men wandering toward the nearby streets burdened with discouragement cavanaugh remained in the middle of the field jamie stood next to him the rain gusting at them emptiness made him feel colder want to take a stroll he asked its been a fabulous experience so far lets prolong it as much as possible he couldnt help smiling i love you of course you do i dont want diamonds or fancy clothes all i want is to share the glamour of your life they walked east of the park and reached an upwardsloping street called hafor drive as the rain strengthened cavanaugh held jamies hand and went a half block before stopping in front of a gray twostory colonial house it had carefully pruned evergreen shrubs an ambitious flower garden now wilted in autumn and a wellmaintained lawn this is where i lived in my memory every house on the street is a brilliant white but as you see theyre all different in reality gray brown blue maybe they always were i guess i only imagined they gleamed cavanaugh pointed toward the second level there on the left that was my bedroom the house on that side had the dog i played with the one that disappeared yes the house farther along on the left is where carl lived now that i think about it in my memory that one definitely doesnt gleam i knew too much about carls father and what went on inside that house so long ago cavanaugh turned to look down the street toward the rainveiled park i can see carl and me on the sidewalk heading for the creek and those trees cavanaugh became silent the rain gusted i know hes down there they lay under blankets on a motelroom bed but despite a long hot shower they still had trouble getting warm beyond closed draperies the sound of the rain lessened afternoon became evening shadows deepened they held one another someone knocked on the door a blanket around him cavanaugh crossed the room standing next to the door avoiding the peep hole which could be a target for a bullet he asked who is it the response made him open the door allowing william to enter hi jamie william said cheerily as if accustomed to seeing her in bed hi william she said from her pillow as if receiving a visitor in this manner was the most natural thing in the world cavanaugh locked the door william had two garment bags draped over an arm here are the clothes you asked me to bring from the gulfstream jeans pullovers jackets socks shoes underwear im quickly becoming the most expensive errand boy in the legal community except that we cant afford to pay you any longer cavanaugh said the distraction factor is payment enough rutherford says that he still has some loose ends to take care of that we wont be flying out of here until the morning does that ruin your schedule not at all i went to harvard with the dean of the university of iowas law school im having dinner with him tonight every city you come to you have a connection i win friends and influence people intimidate them into submission is more like it oh i almost forgot i needed to set something down when i knocked william opened the door and retrieved a large paper bag marked with the logo for kentucky fried chicken how could you forget you brought food jamie asked with delight in the night she wakened reached for cavanaugh but didnt feel him outside the night was quiet the rain having stopped she glanced toward the bathroom its door was open its light was off she switched on the bedside lamp went to the closet and found that his clothes were gone cavanaugh told the taxi driver to let him off at a convenience store on the end of west benton street he paid and waited until the taxi pulled away then he left the harsh lights of the store and walked down the street toward the park it was on his right and he was pleased that fog obscured the fields and the creek making it unnecessary for him to take elaborate precautions to hide his approach where the creek entered the park he left the sidewalk immediately he unclipped his knife from his pants pocket allowing the hook on the back of its blade to snag on the pocket the resistance causing the blade to open the creek was on his left he used it as a guide but stayed far enough away that he could respond to the sound of an attacker lunging up from the bed soon the hazy glow of the streetlights behind him dimmed then vanished as he proceeded over the wet grass the fogs moist tendrils drifted around him their chill dampness seeping through his jacket he unfocused his eyes emphasizing the periphery of his vision the effort produced a strain comparable to forcing himself to be crosseyed but in this uncomfortable way trying to look sideways while peering ahead he activated the rodshaped cells in his eyes the cells that were sensitive in darkness the technique made it possible for him to see distinctions among shadows gradations within shades of gray and black having crisscrossed the park numerous times during the day he had a sense of how far objects were from each other strong boyhood memories reinforced his estimate the spongy grass absorbed his footfalls only when he judged that he was within thirty paces of the first stand of trees did he crouch and assess what was ahead he listened for a long while lingering moisture dripped from the trees and bushes water trickled along the creek bed a breeze scraped branches he crept ten paces forward and listened again hearing nothing to alarm him he went another ten paces then turned to the right toward a fogshrouded field while the periphery of his left eye concentrated on the vague shadows of the trees with his rodstrengthened vision he looked for movement that couldnt be attributed to a branch swaying for a shape that didnt fit the pattern of tree trunks the rain had caused many bushes to lose their leaves creating gaps that enabled him to notice if there was a solid shape behind them he crept farther ahead in his experience nothing was more tense or exhausting than stalking someone in darkness patience was everything discipline control the irony wasnt lost on him that because carls lack of discipline had been the cause of so much misfortune carl would take extra care to prove that he now had more control than cavanaugh did knife ready he entered the trees from the rain the dead leaves were so soggy that they made no sound under his shoes in his youth this section of trees had been almost fifty yards wide and long but now it was barely ten yards wide and thirty yards long as wisps of fog drifted past he crouched with his back against a trunk and turned his head slowly one way and then the other using his peripheral vision to scan the indistinct branches and bushes one minute two minutes three minutes this is what you planned carl you knew id be forced to act responsibly and betray you you knew even a small army wouldnt find you you knew when the search failed id finally come so here i am ready when you are wherever youre hiding come out this is what you wanted so lets do it but take your time i dont want to rush you ive got all night eight minutes nine minutes ten minutes cavanaugh couldnt risk staying in one position much longer the chill creeping into his muscles might cramp them if he remained immobile the same liability applied to carl he too would need to shift his body inching forward cavanaugh expected that at any moment a figure would rocket from under leaves a knife plunging toward him despite the cold he felt nervous sweat trickling down his face at once a noise made him flinch on his right something crashing through the bushes low breathing hard a huge dog bounded toward him black it suddenly noticed him and veered through the trees with equal suddenness it howled in agony the howl became yelps as it thrashed grotesquely snapping branches off bushes twisting thudding against a tree its frenzy dwindled its yelps getting weaker finally it lay still at distant houses dogs howled in response gradually the night returned to the quiet of moisture dripping off leaves the wind scraping branches and water trickling along the creek cavanaugh eased toward the doga labrador retriever he estimatedand found the stake that had catapulted into its chest when paws tripped a wire a booby trap carl after dark you crawled from your hiding place and arranged a surprise for me im disappointed since when are traps in the game rage heating him cavanaugh yanked the stake from the dog he felt along the wire it was the sort of item routinely discarded on a construction site he coiled it put it in a pocket and inched forward holding the stake at the open door to his room wearing hastily puton clothes rutherford squinted at his watch his eyes puffy from having been wakened maybe he just went for a walk at one in the morning jamie asked skeptically it was a tough night and day he must have a lot on his mind a lot to rethink hes gone to the park you dont know that for a fact i know him there isnt anywhere else hed go what do you expect me to do tell those thousand men to go back to the park even if i wanted to i couldnt get them organized before dawn did you watch the evening news did you see how foolish we looked for sure mosely would demand my resignation if i repeated todays farce no jamie said i dont expect you to tell those thousand men to go back to the park thank heaven i expect that you and i will go to the park shit the southern baptist said sweat blended with moisture from the fog and trickled down cavanaughs face he lay on his chest on wet grass assessing the gloom of the next stand of trees he was sure that a booby trap waited for him in there also he tried to imagine carls reaction to hearing the dogs agonized howl carl needs to assume i realize what killed the animal he also needs to assume that ill now avoid the trees and any other areas where traps can be easily set hell decide that ill shift to the open spaces hell focus his hunt in those areas that meant cavanaugh needed to do the opposite of what carl expected and go farther into the trees but first he rolled toward a nearby picnic bench he crawled under it was a space that would appeal to someone who wanted to hide his silhouette while looking for his prey cavanaugh used the wire to bind the stake to a metal leg the point projecting outward at head level then ready with his knife he squirmed from beneath the table and studied the closer gloom of the trees probing with the knife moving it up and down then right and left he crawled past a bush he waited he listened with his peripheral vision he stared at the fog and the shadows in the distance the muffled drone of a car proceeded along west benton street his nerves tightened until the sound was gone and he could again concentrate on the faint noises around him he shifted deeper into the trees immediately he froze when his knife met resistance something thin and taut a wire moving to the side he discovered a low branch bent sideways and down feeling in the darkness he found that the wire was attached to a rock that weighed down the branch a stake was tied to the branch if cavanaugh had disturbed the wire the rock would have shifted the branch would have sprung and he held his breathone two three silently exhaled through his lipsone two three quietly inhaled through his noseone two three the technique calmed his heartbeat and steadied his lungs then he pushed the rock off the branch with a whoosh the branch vaulted noisily past him simultaneously he grunted as if hed been hit then crashed against a bush his groan became faint as he remembered the groans of wounded comrades becoming faint when death claimed them holding his breath again onetwothree exhaling onetwothree he crawled silently to the edge of the trees doing his best to make his crouched silhouette indistinguishable from a stump one minute two minutes three minutes ten minutes a whisper on his right made his heart lurch getting tired of waiting aaron the words came from a cautious distance perhaps as much as thirty feet away muffled by the fog id have joined you sooner carls voice continued but i had to check the rest of the park and make sure you didnt bring company like you did this morning cavanaughs pulse was so rapid that his veins felt swollen something crashed among the trees instantly cavanaugh squirmed in that direction he knew that was the one place carl wouldnt be the noise was intended as a distraction right now carl would be hurrying around the stand of trees intending to enter them from behind while cavanaugh theoretically remained in place his attention directed toward the noise all the while cavanaugh squirmed forward he used his knife to probe the air abruptly he felt the resistance of another wire at the same time he thought he heard a slight noise behind him carl entering the trees he rolled to the side threw a branch on the wire heard a whoosh and relied on that to distract carl while he snaked to the side of the grove emerging onto the grass he sprinted soundlessly onto a soccer field and spun with his knife waiting for carl to charge through the fog how do you like the traps carl asked from the murk of the trees makes the game more interesting dont you think cavanaugh didnt answer refusing to be baited into revealing his location i figured if you can break the rules so can i honestly dont you feel embarrassed that you brought all those guys to look for me cant you fight your own battles cavanaugh remained silent all that manpower and they couldnt find me arent you dying to know where i hid a crash among the trees cavanaugh flinched instantly he recovered and tightened his grip on his knife knowing that carl had used the noise to hide the lesser sounds he made as he hurried from the grove now they were both in the open in the fog the truth is i counted on you to betray me again carls voice came from straight ahead after all betrayals in your nature cavanaugh crouched making himself a small target while priming his arm muscles to strike with his knife i wanted you to bring help lots and lots of help this time carls voice came from the darkness on the right cavanaugh moved in the opposite direction so much help that when they didnt find me theyd figure this was the last place in the world to look for me the voice was farther to the right hes tempting me to charge cavanaugh thought the only flaw in the plan was the chance youd feel so ashamed that you wouldnt show up tonight now carls voice came from the left cavanaugh reversed direction and headed to the right even though theyll never find your body theyll be forced to assume i was here the voice was closer to the right now cavanaugh stopped moving after you disappear theyll focus on this area cavanaugh glimpsed a shadow in the fog but of course thatll be too late ill be far away by then taking advantage of carls distraction cavanaugh charged from experience he knew that the surprising rush would provoke carls startle reflex gaining the second he needed to strike a lethal blow but as he raced toward the shadow plunging his knife into flesh feeling blood on his hand he realized with sickening dismay that what he stabbed was the dog carl held the corpse in front of him before cavanaugh could pull the blade free carl twisted the carcass sideways wrenching the knife from cavanaughs hand carl shoved the dead animal at him knocking him backward the dogs weight thrusting him to the ground the impact jolted cavanaughs breath from his lungs wheezing he rolled simultaneously he felt a sharp impact in his right side as a crack and a flash came from carls direction jesus he has a gun he shot me continuing to roll his lungs wheezing cavanaugh realized that the bullet had passed through the dog before it struck him the bullet had penetrated him but not deeply enough to hit a vital organ lunging to his feet he ran but now his urgent footfalls were forceful enough to make sounds on the wet grass he heard carl chasing him the collision had been so disorienting that he lost his bearings in the fog possibly he raced toward west benton street possibly toward the creek possibly toward a branch struck his face the trees hed run back to them as carls footsteps pounded closer cavanaugh scurried into the bushes a sudden glow struggled to pierce the fogfrom a flashlight carl held frantic cavanaugh shifted deeper into the trees i did play fair sort of carl said the guns part of a knife you remember those combination models lance showed us he referred to an antique style in which a barrel formed part of the back of a blade the hammer was the top of the guard the trigger the bottom of the guard of course you cant get much accuracy and power you got hit with a thirtytwo i expect that wont kill you feeling blood swell from his side cavanaugh backed from the searching flashlight and bumped against something that stung his leg peering down he saw a stake on the end of a branch one of the booby traps hed sprung the weak light pivoted through the darkness and the fog moving in his direction he moved farther backward forcing the branch to bend behind him the flashlight beam settled on him you dont look like youre hit bad at all carl shifted toward him through the bushes not to worry about taking another bullet its a single shot i dont have another round for it always had a fondness for this thing two weapons in one saves room in my bugout bag cavanaugh kept backing away he bumped against a tree trunk holding the oddly shaped knife a barrel along the back of the blade carl stalked toward him hate to do this a knife against bare hands but as youre dying i want you to bear in mind ill be going for your wife next carl lunged cavanaugh jumped free of the branch it whipped forward carl screamed as the stake plunged into his thigh jamie and rutherford drove past the park two exits along west benton street they turned right and then right again finding themselves on the street where cavanaugh had lived the fog kept the vans headlights from reaching the park as they got out a dim streetlight allowed jamie to realize that rutherford had parked in front of what had once been cavanaughs house they secured their jackets and started down toward the invisible park only to pause when they heard a distant crack they waited the sound wasnt repeated what was that jamie whispered it sounded like a shot jamies face tingled only partly from the chill of the fog low caliber i think they waited a moment longer then rutherford crouched as if tying a shoe he straightened and handed her something a gun my emergency pistol i keep it in an ankle holster youre trusting me with this rather than discuss it rutherford continued through the fog as jamie caught up to him she heard what might have been muted voices in the park too low and indistinct to be identified they walked faster then started to run when they heard a scream you cocksucker wailing dropping his flashlight carl stumbled backward the stake in his thigh tearing flesh as it pulled free cavanaugh rushed him then dodged away as the flashlight on the ground glinted off the knife carl swung at him cavanaugh grabbed a thick limb from the ground the size of a baseball bat he braced himself to strike as carl hobbled toward him slashing his knife up and down and from side to side in a buzzsaw blur cavanaugh swung the club carl dodged cavanaugh swung again wincing from the wound in his side carl leapt back breathing heavily facing one another they turned in a circle looking for an opening ready to strike the flashlight casting shadows across them at once cavanaugh realized that carl had maneuvered so that his left hand now pulled back the branch with the stake lurching away as carl released it cavanaugh struck a fallen bough and dropped backward the stake zipping past him shouting carl charged and all cavanaugh could do was roll away from the light keeping his hand on the club but in no position to use it he surged to his feet and raced from the trees the picnic table he thought its dark shape was suddenly before him he almost banged into it but managed to slow in time to drop to his knees and scurry under it carefully avoiding where hed secured the stake he groaned as carls blade sliced across his back but he forced himself to keep crawling sensing carl leaning fiercely under the table to stab him something made a grotesque liquid popping sound carls scream communicated sanitythreatening pain cavanaugh tightened his grip on the club rising beyond the table he swung over it aiming toward carl who twisted in a frenzy his left hand clutching his left eye the club whistled past carl who now did an amazing thing the one mistake an experienced knife fighter never makes dont throw your knife at your enemy you might miss and then youre without your weapon but in this case it wasnt a mistake at so close a range that the sounds cavanaugh made guided carls aim relying on surprise carl threw the knife hurled it with all his might cavanaugh wailed from the pain of the knife striking his ribs chipping bone the only thing that saved him was that the blade was upright and didnt slip between ribs to puncture his ribs or his heart nonetheless he felt dizzy in shock from blood loss gasping he wavered he fumbled trying to find where the knife dropped but carl was suddenly on him knocking him to the sand his fingers around his throat squeezing blood dripped from carls missing eye onto cavanaughs face want to make a bet aaron wheezing cavanaugh grabbed a handful of dirt from under the table and threw it at carls bleeding eye socket carl hissed as if the dirt were hot coals but his hands remained firm on cavanaughs throat flesh separating on his sliced back cavanaugh reached painfully up to shove a thumb into carls empty eye socket he actually got it in feeling blood stream down his thumb but before he could probe his hand sank his mind swirling carl squeezing harder carls head jerked up his remaining eye scanning the fog distant footsteps ran across the invisible soccer field you still cant do this without help huh he leaned down so close that he breathed against cavanaughs left ear i bet your friends never find either of us as cavanaughs mind swirled faster carls last words echoed and faded running toward the park jamie and rutherford heard a shout reaching the grass they heard a scream charging across a fogshrouded field they heard another instinctively they knew when they were close enough that they needed to slow their frantic pace or risk giving away their position in the dark and being shot pistols aimed they shifted carefully toward the last sound theyd heard cavanaugh woke in darkness not the darkness of the night and the fog in which thered been gradations of blackness and shadow this was absolute darkness made worse by foul air and the press of carls body against him his neck felt swollen the inside of his throat burning from having been choked his sliced back felt on fire blood streaming from it making his mind swirl again his wounded side throbbed he almost vomited it took him several moments before he overcame panic sufficiently to realize that he and carl lay on their left sides carls chest against his back he felt carls labored breathing against his neck awake aaron carl whispered cavanaugh felt breath against his ear he didnt respond sure you are carl said i feel your heart beating faster cavanaugh didnt see a point in pretending any longer where are we the words stung his irritated throat home sweet home check out the expert workmanship feel the fine wood cavanaughs arms were pinned along his side the narrow space which increasingly reminded him of a coffin made it impossible for him to touch what he now identified as wood against his cheek a floor and against his forehead a wall carls right arm was free in the absolute darkness he reached over cavanaugh and tapped the wood causing a muffled echo the best plywood available on the junk heap of a construction site a sheet of plastics above the roof so water cant seep in comfy huh just the thing for spending a couple of days and nights of course i didnt plan for company when i was the only occupant i had room to drink from a water bottle and eat beef jerky not too much of course because i didnt want to foul my dream house with more piss and crap than was necessary cavanaugh almost threw up so relax well find out if i win my bet but im sorry to say this is going to be a onesided conversation from now on you might try to shout and attract your friends theres an air hole above my head i cant take the chance theyd hear you open your mouth cavanaugh didnt in the darkness he felt something sting his neck the point of a blade i picked up my knife before i carried you here open your mouth or else ill slice the artery in your neck cavanaugh obeyed he felt a gritty musty rag being shoved into his mouth i hope you dont have asthma carl whispered i wouldnt want you to suffocate so here we are snug as two bugs in a rug how do you suppose we should pass the time behind him carls voice was so soft that cavanaugh could barely hear it his hushed breath drifted past cavanaughs ear why dont i give you a little lesson you know the old saying you cant pick your family but you can pick your friends isnt that the truth if only lance had been my father wouldnt that have been great me and the old man making knives as for friends well most people throw that word around what they really mean is acquaintances they mean people they spend time with because they happen to live next to each other or work together or play sports with each other or belong to the same club or whatever people who dont make trouble people who dont ask for much who dont inconvenience them but a true friend aaron thats rare and special a friend is somebody who accepts your faults whos there for you always even when youre not your best somebody wholl do anything for you somebody you can count on totally just as a friend can count on you its the most powerful relationship there is most marriages dont come close because in a lot of marriages the partners arent really friends i chose you as my friend aaron my only friend i never felt closer to anyone there isnt anything i wouldnt have done for you imagine how i felt when i realized that you werent my friend that you were just another selfcentered asshole who said adios when the going got rough in the pitchblackness the gag absorbed moisture in cavanaughs mouth it made his throat dry it made the fetid air he breathed tickle his bronchial passages he feared he would cough he feared he would choke when you think about it weve never been closer than we are right now carl said its not a bad way to die pressed against the person we love fighting not to panic cavanaugh held his breath in the hopes of stifling his impulse to gag he failed his stomach heaved bile soared up his throat where jamie mentally yelled not daring to speak and make herself a target where are they rutherford moved next to her aiming to the right while she aimed to the left they continued slowly warily into the fog as much as she could estimate in the darkness the screams had come from straight ahead with her attention focused there the ground beneath her suddenly collapsed she fell sliding downward tumbling into water rutherford splashed next to her sprawling the creek flowing over them they scrambled upright but any element of surprise was now lost and jamies stomach seemed filled with sharp heavy stones as she peered over the top of the opposite bank more darkness and fog awaited them she aimed to the left listening intensely for any indication of where cavanaugh might be but what caught her attention wasnt a sound it was a glow so faint that it might have been marsh light climbing from the creek aiming she crept toward the pale illumination rutherford moving next to her they reached trees the glow was stronger on the ground among bushes a flashlight when jamie picked it up she did what cavanaugh had taught her to do keeping it away from her center of mass so that a bullet aimed toward the light wouldnt hit her chest she scanned the trees and bushes rutherford pointed crimson attracting her attention blood on a stake tied to a branch her mouth sour she aimed the flashlight toward the ground seeing more blood following it they left the trees the blood went in two directions some of it formed a trail on the left where the flashlight revealed a dead labrador retriever a knife sticking into it what the hell happened here jamie murmured hell rutherford said exactly the blood trail on the right led to a picnic table and here jamie found an astonishing amount of blood a spray of it everywhere the sharp stones in her stomach now felt like cold barbed wire twisting inside her rutherford pointed again the blood led toward the creek they peered down at the water where the blood was no longer in sight take it easy carl whispered pulling the rag from cavanaughs mouth as bile rushed into his mouth we dont want you to choke to death especially when youve got the alternative of the dreaminess of bleeding to death cavanaugh spit acid and gasped for air he understood carl had spoken about the plastic sheet above the roof the barrier that kept water out but the floor was now wet the fluid rising and the only explanation for that was bloodfrom cavanaughs wounded side punctured chest and sliced back as well as from carls stabbed thigh and bleeding eye socket arent we a pair carl said just like being in a womb from the cradle to the grave drifting away on the path to dreamland whats the best time we ever had together no dont answer that instead of whispering you might scream im afraid i need to gag you again carl crammed the rag into cavanaughs mouth then nestled against him blood sure smells like copper but cavanaugh couldnt smell anything indeed he had trouble feeling the wet slippery wood beneath him his mind again swirled the best time we ever had was when we went camping in colorado and screaming inwardly jamie shifted along the creek scanning each side of it while rutherford aimed toward the top of the bank in case a dark figure attacked them where she kept demanding wheres the blood she almost did scream when it occurred to her that they might be heading in the wrong direction rather than searching deeper into the park perhaps they should have gone in the opposite direction her trembling hand made the flashlight waver its beam flicking this way and that time seemed suspended yet she felt that ten minutes went by in an instant the blood wheres the damned there she saw it the crimson rising from the creek blending with deep footprints that struggled up the bank on the right she and rutherford hurried to the top and now jamie felt the barbed wire in her stomach become molten it expanded threatening to burn through her belly the blood formed a pool in the grass in front of her but it didnt go farther looks like ill win my bet carl whispered if they were going to find us theyd have done it by now i cut a piece from my jacket and tied it around my leg so i wouldnt drip blood on the ground i came back here and got one of the plastic sheets i stole from a construction site i wrapped it around you so you wouldnt drip blood when i carried you here as far as whoevers out there is concerned we vanished aint that great our last game of hide and seek cavanaugh managed to nod his consciousness wavering he thought about all the things he regrettednot kissing jamie more often not telling her often enough how much he loved her he regretted the beatings carl had received from his father he regretted not having spent more time with carl in the weeks before his fathers disgrace forced carls family to move to nashville he regretted having treated carls letters and phone calls as a nuisance he regretted not having kept in touch with carl after global protective services fired him what do you say we go out for a drink carl how about a movie and a burger afterward how about visiting my ranch in wyoming youll love my home sunset over the tetons a friendship all this happened so many people died because of a friendship that went bad his suffocated mind couldnt find the words whos the selfcentered asshole carl you think i let you down pal you let me down he knew he ought to feel angry furious and he was if he had the strength hed find a way to grab carls head and pound it until but he felt something else as well and as tears streamed down his face his blood and his life seeping from him he tried to say it tried to spit out the gag and tell carl choking again good buddy carls hand pulled out the vile rag cavanaughs mouth was almost too dry to force out the words got something to say carl asked cavanaugh nodded weakly lets hear it im yes keep trying get it out last words and all that sorry ah cavanaughs mind seemed to plummet sorry you know what my friend carl said i am too three years ago maybe i should just have kicked the shit out of you maybe i was afraid i couldnt do it but hey i sure kicked the shit out of you now cavanaugh felt more tears streaming down his face what he had tried to say was that jamie aside he was sorry that he and carl had ever grown up i wish we were still kids he thought his head thudded onto the bloodsoaked wood john help me think jamie said where did they go jamie aimed the flashlight through the fog frantic she stumbled forward into the darkness whats that over there rutherford said where there rutherford guided her hand the flashlight dimly revealing a childrens climbinggym rods and railings and tubes in a rockwalled grotto whose sides were topped with bushes and evergreen shrubs jamie entered the grotto and shivered as if in another dimension she scanned the dim light over everything the wood chips on the ground the little bridge over a culvert through which children could crawl the beams that formed a sandbox the picnic tables theres no blood a sob escaped her i dont know what to do she stepped farther inside the grotto she aimed the light at everything lingering staring finally desperate to search somewhere else she turned away her flashlight swung past something wait she redirected the light tell me if im seeing things where there she and rutherford walked toward the childrens bridge it spanned a cement culvert that children would find exciting to crawl through on the right there was a second culvert smaller more exciting between the two was the rock wall huge boulders embedded in a dirt slope that boulder jamie said the one in the middle why are wood chips on it rutherford asked there arent any on the others help me jamie pleaded they rushed to the boulder rutherford grabbed its top stand back he told jamie aim the light jamie did she also aimed the gun rutherford pulled with all his broadshouldered strength unprepared for how easily the boulder toppled away revealing a nightmare two men smeared in blood the smell of excrement streaming out next to them lay the strap that carl had wrapped around the boulder hoisting the rock back into place then pulling the strap through slits on either slide at first it was impossible to tell the difference between them both were so mired in gore one wasnt moving but the other raised his head and peered out his left eye was missing his lips were crusted with blood looks like i lost the bet carls voice sounded like his throat was filled with sand no matter i was never going to let you win it aaron carl lowered a knife to slit cavanaughs throat jamie shot out carls other eye cavanaugh saw lights in his coffin blinding panicked he jerked up a hand to shield his eyes fingers startled him grasping his arm lowering it youll pull out your iv line jamie said his eyelids felt as if they were sewed shut slowly he managed to break the imaginary threads and open his eyes jamie sat next to him she was haggard with exhaustion her green eyes dull her brunette hair lusterless from tension and yet she looked as beautiful as hed ever seen her he was in a hospital bed his side and back throbbed stitches and bandages squeezed him his lips felt thick his tongue swollen and dry jamie put a straw in his mouth grateful he sipped the water was tasteless for a moment then it became exquisite but weakness made it difficult for him to swallow he drooled jamie used a cloth to wipe it away afraid im not at my best he said nonsense youre perfect weariness drifted over him when he wakened again jamie continued to sit next to him she squeezed his hand asleep you look like a little boy mustering his strength cavanaugh managed to ask carl dead how she told him he had to concentrate to take in all the details the boulders and wood chips were wet from the rain she said when carl lowered the boulder that hid him wood chips stuck to it they were under the boulder he couldnt have seen them when he pulled the boulder back into place he must have been so delirious with pain that he didnt realize the second person youve killed dont talk about it i understand ive been there no jamie said you dont understand cavanaughs lips felt numb even justified its a terrible id do anything for you thats not what i meant i mean you cant talk about it you cant let anybody know im the one who shot him jamie looked around her voice was so low that he could barely hear it john lent me his gun jamie whispered intensely hed lose his job if anyone found out after i shot carl he took the gun from me and fired it a second time hitting a boulder next to the hole as if a first shot missed that way he had gunpowder residue on him the investigators took his word nobody thought to test me john did that trying to analyze the implications cavanaugh drifted again the next time he rose out of blackness he heard hushed voices looking for jamie he saw rutherford and her talking quietly in a corner rutherford glanced over sleeping beautys awake how are you feeling ready to take up ballroom dancing they smiled at the feeble joke want the first waltz he asked rutherford thanks for the offer but ill sit this one out reject me see if i care they smiled again carl wanted it cavanaugh said wanted rutherford asked puzzled to be shot he didnt act like it he was trying to slit your throat jamie insisted to force john to shoot cavanaugh said as a nurse went past the doorway jamie looked at him with new appreciation he was more alert than she thought even so cavanaugh had to concentrate to form the words carl knew he had nothing ahead of him except probably a death sentence sitting in a narrow cell waiting for the seconds to tick by and somebody to stick a needle in him he hurried things along john you did him a favor cavanaugh said looking at jamie the bastard didnt deserve a favor she told him when he and i were kids we had wonderful times cavanaugh said melancholy made him feel as if carls hands were again around his throat he had difficulty getting his voice to work as he changed the subject so what happens now you lost a lot of blood your doctor says youll need to stay here a few more days while you get more strength back and then we go back to new orleans to prepare for the trial cavanaugh said rutherford and jamie looked at one another what arent you telling me cavanaugh asked mosely dropped the charges rutherford answered cavanaugh needed a moment to adjust to that what happened in the park attracted a lot of media attention rutherford continued a lot of sympathy for you god knows why but many people think youre some kind of hero he halfsmiled the hotels dont want to look like corporate bullies they put pressure on mosely so did the officials for the world trade organization it seems my boss isnt as unbendable as he maintains hows he treating you cavanaugh asked apparently im some kind of hero also rutherford said for now were best buddies knock knock a voice said glancing over cavanaugh saw william in the doorway with his coiffed hair his gleaming teeth his brilliant white shirt his authoritative pinstripe suit and his powerfullooking chest he looked more the celebrity attorney than ever do you feel strong enough for more company youre always welcome cavanaugh said i considered bringing flowers but i decided on this instead he gave cavanaugh an envelope whats this about a letter of credit from a dozen of your wealthiest clients it seems they quaked in their billionaire boots when they realized that global protective services and in particular you werent going to be available to keep them alive from the cheshirecat look on your face jamie said i have a feeling you took pains to remind them quite a few phone calls yes youll receive an itemized bill now that you can afford my services again of course youll need to downsize global protective services considerably but i suspect you prefer it that way as long as it allows me to protect people who deserve it but cant afford me cavanaugh felt jamie squeeze his hand whatever you want its your company william said and jamies yes rutherford said ive seen firsthand that shes an excellent protector cavanaugh studied him so are you john you helped save my life thank you rutherford thought about it and shrugged thats what friends do
