kellen tavadon could never have imagined fighting a battle so onesided as this but he no longer had the energy to spare for despair up and around the circumference of the black cairn he went and as he did the icy wind slowly increased it seemed to kellen as if the source of the wind was the obelisk itself as if it blew from someplace not of this world as if from a great distance he could hear inhuman yelping and the sounds of battle if he looked he knew he would be able to watch his friends die but he refused to look he could not afford to be distracted from his battle it took all his concentration to keep his footing on the stairs kellens teeth chattered uncontrollably in the cold tears that owed nothing to grief streamed from his eyes and froze along his cheeks and lashes he gripped idalias keystone hard against his stomach and prayed that it would hold together if he had been able to think he would have been certain that his situation could not be any worse and then as a further torment grit mixed with the frigid wind began to pelt him fine sand at first that left him blinking and halfblind but soon goodsized pieces of gravel and small rocks that hammered his skin and even drew blood he could taste grit between his teeth on his tongue feel it in his nose in his lungs choking him he pulled his undertunic up over his head it was hard to breathe through the heavy quilted leather but as he heard the winddriven sand hiss over its surface kellen was glad hed buried his head in its folds better to be halfstifled than blind slowly his tears washed his eyes clean soon it was not just gravel that the wind carried but rocks the size of a fist at this rate hed be dodging boulders soon and one direct hit from anything really large and hed be deadand the fate of sentarshadeen and perhaps of all of the elves would be sealed he needed to protect the keystone as well as his eyes and lungs kellen quickly shoved the keystone up under his shirt and turned toward the wall so it was protected by his body as well the keystone was as icy against his skin as it had once been warm against his hands he turned his face against the wall and crept even more slowly up the stairs the sand made them slippery and he knew something was hoping hed fall and break the fragile keystone at least the howling of the wind and the booming of the rocks against the stone shut out all sound of the battle below if it was still going on if all his friends werent dead already i wont look back kellen promised himself whatever happens i wont look back it was so unfair for the enemy he faced to be throwing rocks at him unfairno it wasnt so much that it was unfair it was humiliating the enemy wasnt even going to bother wasting its demon warriors on stopping him he wasnt an elven knight after all he wasnt any sort of a real threat he meant so little to the enemy that the enemy thought it was enough to batter him with a few rocks certain that he was so cowardly so worthless that he would turn tail and run that as much as all the pain and despair nearly broke kellens spirit only his anger saved him anger is a weapon as much as your sword illshowyou he snarled through clenched teeth and went on slowly agonizingly slowly blind aching terrified but now above all else furious he drove onward then came the worst partwhen the wind and rocks began hitting him from all sides kellen realized that must mean he was near the top of the cairn groping blindly his head still muffled in his tunic he slid his hand along the wall in front of his face until he touched emptiness the wind pushed at his fingertips with the force of a river in flood if he tried to simply walk up to where the obelisk was the wind would pluck him off and hurl him to the ground very well then he would crawl kellen got down on his hands and knees and crawled up the rest of the stairs brushing the sand away carefully from each step before him it caked on his abraded hands and every time he wiped them clean on his tunic fresh blood welled up from a thousand tiny scratches and the wind still blew cold enough now to steal all sensation from his flesh he reached a flat place and crawled out onto it pushing against the wind suddenly without warning the wind stopped the silence rang in his ears well you make a fine sight a man said from somewhere above him sounding amused the voice was elusively familiar kellen dragged his tunic down around his neck and stared blinking into the watery green light he was facing himself another kellen stood on the other side of the obelisk grinning down at him nastily the point of the obelisk came just to his heart level this kellen was sleek and manicuredno one would ever call his smooth brown curls unrulyand dressed in the height of armethaliehan finery from his shining halfboots of tooled and gilded leather to his furlined halfcape and the pair of jeweled and embroidered silk gloves tucked negligently through his gleaming gilded belt the cape and gloves were in house tavadon colors of course no one would ever forget which mageborn city house this young man belonged to not for an instant slowly kellen got to his feet though his cramped and aching muscles protested instantly otherkellen clapped his bare hands over the point of the obelisk blocking kellens access to it think about what youre doingotherkellen urged him really think about it now before its too late youve had a chance to taste freedom and youve found its a bitter wine only power can make it sweet but you already know the responsibilities that power brings even the powerful arent really free the only real freedom we have is of choosing our master and most people dont get even that but you can choose i dont serve anyone kellen said angrily oh and you a wildmage otherkellen said mockingly i should think you would have learned better the moment you opened the books kellen snapped his mouth shut abruptly if this was a fight hed just lost the first battle he did serve the wild magic and so far hed done exactly what it told him to do how free did that make him youve made some bad choices in the past otherkellen continued smoothly even youre willing to admit that wouldnt you like the chance to undo them to start over knowing what you know now you can have that few people get that opportunity otherkellen smiled and for the first time kellen could see his fathers face mirrored in this strangers that was his own the sight shocked and distracted him even in this moment and in this place assurance competence or just corruption you left armethalieh because you rebelled against your fathers plans for you but you know better now dont you archmage lycaelon only wants for you what he has always enjoyed himself and thats not so bad now is it what does it matter if it takes a bit of groveling and scraping and a lot of boring makework to get there think about how you used to liveand how you live now the life of a high mage has its compensationsand the high mages were right back when they walled themselves off in their city they were right to want to build safeguards against the prices and bargains the wild magic required his doppelganger said his voice as silken and sweet as honey reasonable and logical kellen himself had never sounded like that whats so wrong with trying to improve something they still practice magic and they do so without the prices that the wild magic demands they give their citizens a good lifeand if life in the golden city is too restrictive well when youre archmage kellen youll be able to make all the changes youve dreamed of that shocked kellen so much that he almost dropped the keystone of all of the things he had imagined and fantasized about that was never one that had occurred to him and you can be archmage the double said persuasively you have the gift and the talent your father isnt wrong about that if everyone must serve then choose your service serve the city go back now beg your fathers forgivenessit wont be that hard give up the wild magic that wont be hard either will it step back into the life you should have had and work for the good of armethalieh youll have everything you wanted just think of all you can do for the city when you return kellen stared in horrified fascination at his doppelganger was this really him the person he could have beenor could still be if he did this could he even turn the city to help the elves and forge a new alliance as in the old days but jermayan would know what had happened shalkan surely would vestakia your companions are already dead you have no one to consider but yourself no one will know what happened here but you isnt it time you did what you want for a change here is your future kellen his doppelganger leaned forward his face wearing a mask of pleasantry his voice eager urging you have but to reach out and seize it and you will receive nothing but praise for your actions now kellen looked away down toward the plain below but everything below the top of the cairn was covered with a thick layer of yellowgreen fog it was as if the rest of the world had vanished quickly he looked back at his doppelganger suspecting a trick but otherkellen had not moved his doppelganger smiled at kellen sympathetically as if guessing the direction of kellens thoughts but if you go through with this foolish adventure your future will be set if you think you have troubles now you cant even begin to imagine what your life is going to be like afterwardassuming you dont die right here think of the demons they know your name kellen the queen and prince of the endarkened know who you are they know all about you and theyll find you wherever you go you wont have an easy death or a quick one tormentoh for them it is the highest form of art and they have had millennia to perfect it you wont die but you will long for death with all of your being for years kellen for years otherkellen shuddered in mocksympathy his eyes never leaving kellens face kellens face kellen trembled remembering his nightmares knowing they must have fallen far short of the truth oh you might survive triggering the keystone you might even manage to get back to sentarshadeen alive and im sure your friends the elves will do their best for you but it hasnt really been much of a best so far has it they couldnt even manage to save themselves without a wildmage or two to help and when it comes right down to it theyre going to take care of themselves and their families first once the trouble starts arent they i wouldnt say were friends exactly but i would say im the closest thing to a friend youve got right here right now think about it kellen this is your last chance after this you have no choices left think use what youve learned theyve all tried to keep the truth from you so you wouldnt know what the stakes are think how hard youve had to work to find out what little you have why is that so you wouldnt know enough to make a fair choice otherkellen said fair kellen thought bitterly nothing about this is fair nothing had ever been fair and out in the open from the moment hed found the three books in the low market and hearing all his secret fears and unworthy hopes in the mouth of this manicured popinjay was the least fair thing of all he remembered jermayan telling him about the sevenhow when theyd faced down the endarkened army at the pass of velalamion and first beaten them back the endarkened had tried to seduce them to the dark as one of the endarkened was trying to seduce him now this then was their last line of defense and the most compelling of all well kellen said walking closer and lifting the keystone in his hands as if he were about to hand it over i guess i really ought to be smart and do what you say the otherkellen smiled triumphantly and relaxed certain of its victory but im not going to kellen shouted he brought the keystone downhardon the doppelgangers hands it howled and recoiled as if it had been burned jerking its hands back from the point of the obelisk and in that moment it changed the otherkellen was gone in its place stood a demon itshetowered over kellen her wings spread wide he caught a confused glimpse of bloodred skin of horns and claws but she was barely there for an instant for in the moment that the demon had released her hold on the obelisk kellen slammed the keystone down over the tip of the stone the instant the keystone touched the obelisk the demon howled in fury and vanished her cheated rage a whiplash across his senses for a moment he was blind and deaf in a paroxysm of pain he cringed but kept his hands on the stone they had not counted on his experience with being lied to and perhaps that was the greatest weapon lycaelon tavadon had given to him i know a lie when i hear it you bastards his father had lied to him so smoothly so convincingly and so often that kellen had learned every guise that a lie could wear kellen trembled all over realizing in that moment how close the demon had come to winning but it hadnt now it was up to him despite everything he had already gone through the hardest part was still to come hardestand yet in its way the easiest all he had to do was surrendersurrender his will surrender his power and put it all in the service of something far outside himself he took a deep breath and reached down into the keystone with his wildmage senses touching the power waiting within the power leaped toward him eagerly but kellen knew that he was not to be its destination gently he turned it toward the obelisk he felt the obelisks resistance and pushed harder adding the last of his strength and all of his will to the keystones power forcing the link into being one by one the obelisks defenses gave way kellen felt the triggering force begin to rush through him and into the obelisk he kept his palms pressed against the keystones sides without him to maintain the link the spell would be broken before the barrier was breached and all of itthe journey the others sacrificewould all have been for nothing then breakthrough and his body spasmed convulsed his mouth going open in a silent scream this was worse than anything he could have imagined he felt as if he were being struck by bolt after bolt of lightning a torrent of energy that somehow went on and on and on searing its way through him his hands were burning holding the keystone was like clutching redhot metal fresh from the forge and there was no respite no mercy he could smell the porklike scent of his cooking flesh could feel blood running down his wrists as blisters swelled up and burst and then in a thunderclap of agony the fire was everywhere coursing through his veins with every beat of his heart kellen howled unashamedly great wracking sobs of hopeless agony and he held on perhaps it was stubbornness but he had always been stubborn and he would not give the demons this victory then came a single thought emerging through the fire and the pain im going to die he realized at that moment that this was the price of the spell the rest of the cost it must be a wildmages life idalia must have known when she created the spell that the price of casting it would be the life of the one who triggered it his life kellen felt a flash of pride in his sister at keeping the painful secret so well but he would have to consent no wildmage could give up that which belonged to anothernot without turning to the dark she had known the price of the magic but she could only have hoped he would pay it well he wasnt going to let her down he would be everything she had hoped and if he had been an uncouth barbarian to the elves of sentarshadeen at least he would be an uncouth barbarian whose name would live on in their legends forever if thats the price he shouted silently to the powers then i will pay it i wish i didnt have to but i swear i pay it willingly and without reservation but more than ever having surrendered his life he yearned to keep it to see the sun again to feel the gentle summer wind to walk through the forest or drink a cup of morning tea but all those things had their price and so did keeping them and some prices were too high to pay the price of his life would be the destruction of all those things soon or late the price of keeping his life would be victory for the endarkened no never my life for the destruction of the barrier a fair bargain done done then the pain was too great for thought abruptly the obelisk began to swell its stark lines distorting as if the malign power it contained was backing up inside it filling it beyond its capacity its swelling carried him upward he collapsed against its surface clinging to the keystone and still it swelled now the stone was a baneful pusyellow color nearly spherical kellen lay upon its surface unable to preserve the thought of anything beyond the need to maintain the link the whole cairn shook like a tree in a windstorm the toxic light flared lightningbright and for kellen there was sudden darkness and a release from all pain then of course there was a return to life and pain and since the latter meant that he still had the former it was less unwelcome than it might have been and through the pain the faces of vestakia and jermayanso they had survived it had all been worth it then only afterward did it occur to him that the compounded trouble he had fallen back into might make him begin to regret that return to life it had taken them only a sennight to travel from sentarshadeeneasternmost of the nine citiesinto the heart of the lost lands to face the power of shadow mountain the return trip took longer though at least nobody was trying to kill them this time that did not mean however that the journey was less trying if anything it was physically harder to begin with it was rainingalthough rain kellen reflected grimly wearily was a mild word to apply to the water that had been falling from the sky nonstop for the last moonturn it was just a good thing that elven armor didntcouldntrust jermayan of course didnt mind the rain at all but the elven lands had been suffering under the effects of a deadly spellinflicted drought for almost a year kellen had only spent a few days in sentarshadeen before heading north toward the barrier and even what little hed seen of the elves desperate attempts to save their city and the forest surrounding it had been enough to daunt him how much more terrifying must it have been for an elven knight one of the lands protectors to watch everything he loved wither and die for sennight upon sennight knowing there was nothing he could do about it no wonder jermayan welcomed the rain vestakia didnt seem to mind the weather all that much either but then vestakia had spent her entire life living nearly alone in a little shepherds hut in the wildest part of the lost lands with only a few goats for company a little rainor even a lot of rainprobably didnt bother her too much but it felt increasingly like torture to kellen for one thing he still wasnt all that used to uncontrolled weather hed grown up in the magecity of armethalieh where everythingincluding the weatherwas governed by the rule of the high mages hed never actually seen rain until hed been banished by the high council for his possession of the three books of wildmageryand his banishment hadnt been that long ago hed never had to stand out in the rain in his life but now well there wasnt anything like a roof for leagues and leagues probably even when they stopped to rest they never really got out of the rain the most they could manage was to drape some canvas over themselves or if they were lucky find a halfcave or shelter under a tree to add to his misery he was still suffering from the injuries he had gotten in his battle to break the barrierspell hed been so sure that his life would be the price of the spell that awakening afterward had been a shock after all every kind of magic required payment and the first lesson the wildmage learned was that each spell of the wild magic came with a cost both in the personal energy of the caster and in the form of a task the wildmage must perform but in this case it seemed his willingness to sacrifice his life had been enough or perhaps just perhaps the cost had been his willingness to live and endure if you can call this living he thought as he rode along behind the others in the direction of home his injuries had been so severe that it had been a sennight before hed been able to ride at all and his burned hands were so heavily bandaged that he couldnt possibly wear his armored gauntlets much less hold a sword any protecting that was going to be done was going to have to be done by jermayan and maybe shalkan and possibly vestakia he was strictly along as baggage he had become so used to pain that now he could hardly remember a time when he had lived without it as a constant presence and underneath the pain was fear fear he never openly expressed but was constantly with him the fear of what was underneath those bandages he would much rather dwell on the minor misery of the rain his heavy hooded oiledwool cloak was soaked through his heavy silk surcoat was wet the unending rain had managed to make it through both of those layers and even through the tiny joins and chinks in the delicatelyjointed elven armor that he wore soaking the padding beneath it wasnt that he was coldhe wasnt even with winter coming on all the layers he wore saw to that but hed never felt so soggy in his life he rested the heels of his handswrapped in goatskin mittens to keep the bandages dry and medicated to the point where the pain was only a dull naggingagainst the front of his saddle gazing around himself at the transformed landscape everything looked so different now on the outward trip theyd been navigating mostly by his wildmage intuition to find the direction of the barrier his sister idalia who was a much stronger wildmage hadnt been able to locate it by scrying and until he and jermayan had linked up with vestakia theyd had no way of sensing it directly so for the first part of the trip theyd been traveling mostly by guess and through a far different countryside than this the rain had changed everything about the landscape that had once been so parched and barren there were lakes where none had been before meadows had become impassable swamps trickling streams had become rivers and all the landmarks hed memorized on the outward trip were gone on their return passage theyd had to rely on jermayans familiarity with the elven lands and valdiens and shalkans instincts to find them a route that wasnt underwater or under mud are we there yet he muttered under his breath sooner than you think shalkan answered kellen sighed he hadnt thought shalkan would be able to hear him over the sound of the rain but by now he should know better than to underestimate the keenness of the unicorns hearing how long he asked less than an hour weve already passed the first scouts from sentarshadeen theyve probably gone back to warn the welcoming party to be ready to greet us the unicorns voice was bland but kellens stomach clenched in a tight knot of tension hed lost all track of how long theyd been traveling and hadnt had any idea they were so close now the aching of his body was joined by the clenching of his gut they had gone out a party of three they were returning a party of four and one of the four was not going to be welcomed with open arms by the elves does he know kellen asked he nodded to where jermayan rode on valdien with vestakiathoroughly bundled up of coursesitting behind him on the destriers saddle at the end of a long tether the creamcolored pack mule ambled along behind valdien every inch of her covered with the black mud splashed up from the road at least once they were back in sentarshadeen it would be someone elses job to try to get herand valdienclean he saw them i imagine shalkan said without adding the obvious that naturally jermayan would recognize exactly where he was even if kellen didnt and that elven senses were much keener than kellens especially now when most of kellens awareness was wrapped in pain almost homeat least as much home as sentarshadeen was dry out of the rain and a chance to sleep in a proper bed again and most of all a proper healer to deal with his hands and anything else that was wrong with him kellen tried to look forward to those things unfortunately there were a lot of things about their welcome home that he wasnt looking forward to and unfortunately he was not really certain that a healer would be able to set his hands right again even at the beginning of winter the elven valley bloomed the silver sheen of the unicorn meadow had turned to deep emerald when the rains came and the parched city had come back to life released from their desperate hopeless task of attempting to irrigate the forest lands surrounding their canyon home the elves had resumed their patrols of the deep woods and the extended borders of their homeland for now more than ever it was vitally necessary with their ancient enemy roused to life once more and only a short time ago one of those scoutpairsa unicorn and his rider had brought word to queen ashaniel that kellen and jermayan had been sighted upon the road idalia had been about to scry for news of them when the queens message was brought to her she had immediately gone to the house of leaf and star both to thank the queen for the news and to hear more of it than the scouts had brought to her though the house of leaf and star wasin every sense that humans understood the wordthe palace of the king and queen of the elves it was not even as grand as the house idalia had grown up in elven buildings were not meant to be imposing but to be suitable and although the house of leaf and star was one of the largest structures in all the elven lands it still managed to look welcoming and homelike it was a low deepeaved house built of silvery wood and pale stone and age and strength radiated from it as from an ancient living tree by the time she had crossed the long roofed portico her cloak and widebrimmed mountain trader hat had shed most of their burden of water and her boots had dried themselves upon the intricate design of slatted wood with which the portico floor was inlaidcrafted for just that purpose as all the works of the elves managed to combine beauty and practicality with flawless ease she was not surprised to see the door open before she reached it i see you idalia wildmage the elven doorkeeper said politely i see you sakathirin idalia answered with equal politeness elvenkind was both an ancient and a longlived race and except under extraordinary circumstances its members were unfailingly courteous and unhurried part of the courtesy was the assumption that a person might not wish to be noticed the greeting i see you was meant to convey acknowledgment of ones presence with the implicit right being that one did not have to respond if one wished to be left alone i have come to share news with the lady ashaniel if she would see me as well the lady ashaniel awaits you with joy sakathirin said gravely be welcome at our hearth he stepped back to allow idalia to enter the rain pattering down on the skylight echoed through the tall entryhall its music a counterpoint to the splashing of the fountain that once more bubbled and sang beneath it idalia smiled seeing that reflecting pool was once again filled with fish their living forms mirroring the mosaic they swam above that of fish swimming in a river the elves delighted in this form of shadowplay combining living things with their copies so expertly that it was often hard for mere humans to tell where nature ended and elven artistry began by the time sakathirin had disposed of her cloak and hat one of ashaniels ladiesinwaiting had appeared to conduct idalia to the queens dayroom in armethalieh such a room would have been called a solar but that was hardly an appropriate word for this room today the walls were made of glasshundreds of tiny panes all held together in a bronze latticeworkand the room seemed to hang in space surrounded by a lacework made of light and air and water raindrops starred the palmsized windows and streaks of rain ran down the outside of the glass like a thousand miniature rivers the effect might have been chilly despite the warmth of the lamps and braziers that filled the room save for the fact that the rooms colors were so warm the ceiling had been canopied in heavy velvetnot pink which would only have been garishbut a deep warm taupe rich as fur the pillows and carpets picked up those colors and added more deep violets emberorange a dark clear blue shot through with threads of silver autumn colors and those of winter concentrated and intensified until they kindled the room the queen herself was dressed in shades of amber every hue from clear pale candleflame yellow to the deep ruddy glow of sunsets heart her hair was caught back in a net of gold and fire opals and she wore a collar of the same stones about her throat idalia she said smiling and setting aside her writing desk as she indicated a place beside her on the low couch upon which she sat come and sit beside me and we will talk your brother and jermayan will not reach the edge of the city for some time yet and there is much to do in preparation they seem well enough so imriban said she added answering the question idalia could not in politeness ask though imriban said that the wildmage rides as one lately injured idalia came and seated herself taking care that her damp buckskins didnt touch ashaniels elaborate velvet gown it would be good to hear all of what imriban had to say she offered carefully learning to speak in accordance with the dictates of elven politeness was one of the hardest lessons for the humans who came to live among them to learn the closest it was possible to get to asking a question was to announce your desire to know something and hope your hearer took pity on you imriban said ashaniel paused and for the first time seemed to be choosing her words with great care imriban said that they do not travel alone not alone it was a struggle to keep from turning her words into a question but idalia managed it puzzles me to hear that she finally said it puzzles me as well ashaniel admitted the one who rides with them rides cloaked and hooded beyond all seeing and it occurs to me to wish that perhaps imriban had been less impetuous and maybe stopped and spoken to them instead of just tearing back to sentarshadeen to bring the news that they were on the way idalia finished the queens unspoken thought silently it was hard to imagine who kellen and jermayan could have run into on their quest and why theyd bring whoever it was back to sentarshadeen i suppose well know soon enough she offered reluctantly indeed ashaniel said with a sigh and yet it will be well should we meet them as close upon the road as we may so andoreniel has said even now a place is being prepared at the edge of the flower forest where we may receive them in all honor looks like they couldnt wait to meet us shalkan said dryly dipping his head to indicate the flash of yellow in the distance with his horn whats that kellen said superfluously jermayan cleared his throat warningly before answering a pavilion kellen took the hint on the road their manners had been free and easy war manners jermayan had called it the elven knight had set aside the elaborate code of elven formality hed asked kellen direct questions and kellen had been allowed even encouraged to question jermayan directly in return but they were back in civilization now and he guessed hed have to get used to it all over again it hardly seemed fair hed gone through so muchand why must he be burdened with this stifling formality now when it was all he could do to pretend that he was certain he would be all right well hed better warn vestakia he was trying to figure out the best way to phrase it when jermayan beat him to it in elven lands except in time of war or dire need to question another directly is considered to be unmannerly i do not say that this is good or bad merely that this is our custom and perhaps we are fonder of our customs than we ought to be jermayan observed as if speaking to valdien perhaps it is a failing in us perhaps it is merely that when one lives as long as an elf custom becomes habit and habit is often so difficult to break that one gives over the attempt kellen heard vestakias muffled snort of nervous laughter i dont think im going to be asking anyone any questions anytime soon jermayan ill count myself lucky if they dont fill me full of arrows on sight that they will not jermayan said his voice filled with grim promise now as they rode closer kellen could see the yellow pavilion more clearly it was rectangular and quite largelarge enough for them to ride right inside as kellen suspected they were meant to colored pennants flew from the centerpost and from all four cornersand whether from the artfulness of their construction or from a touch of the small magics the elves still commanded they did fly and were not simply sodden rainsoaked rags wrapped around the gilded tent posts the tent was trimmed in scarlet and the tent ropes that held it firm against the buffeting winds were scarlet as well in the grey gloom of the day the lamps inside the walls of yellow silk made it glow like the lanterns the elves hung outside their homes at dusk casting shadows of tables and moving bodies against the fabric as they came closer a flap in the near side of the pavilion began to rise kellen saw two elves in full armor walk it out and peg it into place with tall gilded poles so that it formed a sort of canopy entrance now he could see into the pavilion and see that there was some kind of flooring as well trust the elves to do everything thoroughly they rode forward into the tent the sudden cessation of the rain drumming on his head felt wonderful kellen glanced quickly around as he kicked his feet free of shalkans stirrups and swung his leg over the back of the saddle it was awkward not being able to use his hands but he managed idalia was there and it looked like all the cream of the nobility had turned out to meet them as well all wearing their finest robes and jewels there were a few elves wearing armor like jermayans but even their colors blended into the harmonious whole nothing clashed nothing was out of place both ashaniel and andoreniel were present dressed in what kellen thought of as full court robesashaniel in gold andoreniel in bronzealong with several of their counselors and kellen hed barely steadied himself on his feet when a small bundle of energy detached himself from his nurses skirts and ran forward flinging his arms about kellens waist you came back i told them all youd come back sandalon said defiantly of course i came back kellen said patting the young elven princes back awkwardly with one of his goatskin mitts and i brought jermayan back too hes got someone with him sandalon said with a young childs directness kellen turned to see that jermayan had dismounted from valdien and was lifting vestakia down from the saddle as he did her hooded cloak fell back and her face was exposed she grabbed for the hood but it was too late everyone there had seen a demon jermayan brings a demon here tyendimarquen gasped all around him the pavilion was filled with frightened whispers as the elves drew back lairamo rushed forward and grabbed sandalon the elven nurse snatching the boy up into her arms and hurrying back behind andoreniel and ashaniel jermayan you will explain yourself andoreniel demanded his voice harsh before he answered jermayan made sure that vestakia was steady on her feetand then very deliberately drew the hood of the cloak back so that all could see her face her skin was the rosyred of ripe cherries her short curly hair a darker shade of the same red and her ears were as pointed as an elfs pale gold horns sprouted from just above her slanting eyebrows and curved back over her head her eyes were the same yellowgold as a cats with the same narrow slitted pupils all these things everyone knew were the marks of the endarkened the evil race that was the enemy to all that lived and walked in sunlight but despite her appearance vestakia was no demon and had anyone bothered to look past the mask of her face they would have seen her expressionfrightened pleading open and desperately hoping for some kind of acceptance lord andoreniel lady ashaniel i bring before you vestakia an ally without whose help the barrier would not have fallen jermayan said evenly turning to face the other elves she is without taint a fellowvictim of them and i have promised her refuge here shalkan took a step backward toward vestakia knowing what was expected of her vestakia placed a hand on his neck her scarlet fingers sinking into his soft silvery fur at this the murmurings from the gathered elves broke out anew everyone knew that the touch of a unicorn was death to demonkind if vestakia were truly what she seemed she should not be able to touch shalkan but it wasnt enough andoreniel was shaking his head no you have promised that which you cannot fulfill jermayan son of malkirinath she will not enter the city then were leaving for a moment kellen wondered whod spoken then realized it was him but the words felt right the decision felt right andall right he needed a healer but surely idalia would follow them and fix him even if they left surely he glanced at shalkan im with you the unicorn said and i jermayan said firmly we wont stay where all of us arent wanted kellen said locking eyes with andoreniel without vestakias help the barrier would still be standing shes the one who found it for us sheand jermayan and shalkanprotected me while i destroyed it no matter what she looks like she isnt one of them shes as human as i am so theres a simple way to solve all of this idalia stepped forward into the open space between the new arrivals and the elves of sentarshadeen if you wont take the word of an elven knight a unicorn and a knightmage for the fact that vestakia bears no taint it would be good to hear that my word will suffice there are simple tests i can perform right here in the flower forest to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt whether she can bring any harm to sentarshadeenif you will trust me and accept my judgment in this matter idalia announced matteroffactly kellen felt a wave of relief wash over him and saw the tension ease in andoreniels face as well of course we will trust you idalia andoreniel said bowing slightly we are in your debt andoreniel might feel that way but kellen doubted everyone there shared his feelings elven expressions were notoriously difficult for mere humans to decipher but the tension in the pavilion was thick enough to cut with a sword kellen idalia went on turning to kellen and jermayan will you abide by my judgment as well though kellen was the one she askedfor the sake of politenessthe question included both of them and it was jermayan who answered first i have no doubt of what you will find wildmage jermayan said austerely well i uh yeah kellen said he knew idalia wouldnt lie and he knew vestakia wasnt demontainted so how could she be a danger to sentarshadeen go with her child jermayan said softly to vestakia she will do you no harm this was not the grand reunion she had envisioned between herself and jermayan idalia thought with a flash of irritation as she settled her hat more firmly upon her head and led vestakia out of the pavilion and into the rain once more trust kellen to manage to work a few surprises into a simple homecoming and to come home a knightmage as well he was thinner than hed been when hed left there were shadows and hollows in his face that hadnt been there even a scant few sennights before and hed found his way into his magichis own magic what he had become was unmistakable in the sight of any wildmage a knightmage the rarest kind of wildmage only appearing in a time of direst need if theyd needed any more proof that they were all in deep trouble kellens manifestation of knightmage powers should provide it but despite that she found it in her heart to be happy for him because for the first time since her little brother had been dropped back on her doorstep through the auspices of an outlaw hunt she sensed that kellen had a real sense of his place in the world of who he was and what his purpose was it was just too bad it was so very dangerous she and vestakia reached the edge of the flower forest and idalia led vestakia beneath its leafy canopy the force of the rain was muted almost at once to a gentle patterning on the dense canopy of leaves though it was late autumn the flower forest was in full leaf since the destruction of the great elven forests in the great war many of the trees that grew in the elven flower forests no longer grew anywhere else in the world and the flower forestsas had the great elven forests of which they were the only survivalspaid little heed to the turning of the seasons thick moss cushioned the ground beneath their feet and the air was appreciably warmer within the forest than it had been outside the air was filled with the spicy scent of the trees and the rich fragrance of their flowers its so beautiful vestakia breathed in wonder staring about herself in awe i never i was raised in the wild hills you see i saw forests when we rode south and kellen said that there were even larger forests further south but well nothing could really prepare you for the flower forest idalia said kindly there isnt really anything anywhere like a flower forest except maybe another flower forest vestakia giggled nervously are there many of those well there are nine elven cities and every elven city has a flower forest so there are probably at least nine idalia said gravely ive only seen two of the elven citiescounting this oneso i cant say for sure it must be wonderful to be able to travel and see things vestakia said sounding very young idalia wondered just how old she was it was hard to tell given the girls rather exotic appearance but she didnt seem to be much older than kellen was they stopped in a little clearing where the rain had made a small pool tiny white and purple flowers starred the deep green moss about its verge the forest canopy stretched overhead protecting them from the rain we didnt actually have to come all the way in here idalia said but i thought youd like a little privacy elves can be rather daunting when you meet a lot of them for the first time although you and jermayan seem to get on well enough oh abruptly recalled to the reason theyd come to the forest vestakia regarded idalia nervously with wide golden eyes idalia reached into her bag and pulled out a small flask offering it to the girl here have a drink its just brandy and hard cider my names idalia by the way if you didnt catch it back there in the tent im kellens sister yes vestakia said unstoppering the flask and drinking gratefully before returning it to idalia he told me about youa little youre a wildmage my mother was a wildmage too idalias eyes widened a little at that but she said nothing so vestakias mother was a wildmage was she even more reason for kellen and jermayan to trust her and how did you come to find my brother idalia asked she drank in turn and as she slipped the flask back into her bag she closed her fingers about a charged keystone show me truth she commanded oh i didnt find kellen vestakia said simply he found me he rescued me from a bandit who was stealing my goatsand then i went with him and jermayan to the barrier just as they said they never would have found it without me she added proudly all at once her shoulders seemed to droop with more than weariness jermayan told me his people would accept me here but i do not think they will no one will when i look the way i do the keystone spell had told idalia nothing which was in itself an answer the truth was already here for her to see theyre afraid idalia said neutrally but tell me the restif youve known my brother for any length of time at all youll know hes miserably bad at telling a story and if i wait to hear the rest of your tale from him i might very well wait forever it took very little prodding to get the rest of vestakias story out of her of how her mother a wildmage had been seduced unawares by the prince of shadow mountain how discovering that she was pregnant with a halfdemon child she called upon the wild magic to help her and been offered a choice the unborn child could be completely hers in spirit and its demonfathers in body or its fathers in spirit yet human in body vestakias mother had made the harder choice vestakia had a human spirit but a demons body to keep her unborn child from being slain at birth vestakias mother had fled with her sister deep into the lost lands where vestakia had been born there vestakia had lived alone after both women had died until kellen had found and rescued her her demonfather of course continued to hunt for her but vestakia had one great gift that kept her safe though it came at a price she could sense the presence of demons because they made her ill the closer they were the greater her distress and she learned quickly to hide whenever she felt a hint of their presence and then i foundwhen kellen asked me to trythat my gift worked just the same way with the demon magic if the spell is strong enough so we found the barrier vestakia said her voice a mixture of triumph and remembered horror jermayan saved my life there and kellen kellen saved all of us she said softly there was a moment of awkward silence after idalia and vestakia left and kellen wasnt quite sure what to do next at least he was sure that everything was going to turn out all right of course idalia would find that there was nothing wrong with vestakia and they could all stay of course idalia could do anything she set her mind to and if he had towell wait until jermayan told them the whole story of destroying the barrier elven custom would force them into such overwhelming obligation to him that they would probably do anything he asked of them for once the intricate dance of elven custom would work in his favor for by the time vestakia got enough accustomed to the elves that she would be able to tell when welcome was forced and when it was not it would be too late for they would have discovered for themselves just how worthy of their trust she was and the welcome would be real jermayan settled the matter removing his cloak and handing it to another elf who seemed to appear out of nowhere another arrived to take his sword and shield then jermayan removed his helmet and gauntlets handing them off in turn before moving to kellens side it was a little embarrassingokay a lot embarrassingto have to just stand there while jermayan removed his cloak helmet shield and sword for him but kellen couldnt really do any of those things for himself with his hands in the goatskin mitts and he knew that only nervous tension was keeping him on his feet now come and sit jermayan said softly taking him by the elbow when they stepped forward the waiting elves settled gracefully into their places just as if theyd rehearsed every motion for years there was a long table draped in heavy damask set along the right side of the pavilionthe left side apparently being reserved for the comfort of the animalswith simple wooden chairs clustered around it you must be weary after your long journey ashaniel said when they had seated themselves looking across the pavilion kellen could see that servantsif there were servants among the elves something he still wasnt completely sure ofwere unsaddling valdien and removing lilys packsaddle and even helping shalkan off with his armor and saddle that wouldnt make it easy for them to leave in a hurry if they had to but elves did not hurry even if they were angry kellen supposed it was a journey i did not think we would live to complete jermayan answered somberly but leaf and star favored us and brought us safely home again and you kellen knightmage i trust that you also fare well ashaniel said pouring cups of wine with her own hands and setting one in front of each of them well enough lady ashaniel kellen said though well was nothing like what he felt elven custom elven courtesy he was surrounded by them and pulled along as if by a strong current he could not hope to swim against he pulled the goatskin mitts off and carefully set them in his lap before reaching for the cup with both hands it was awkward but he managed his hands were still numb but now that he wasnt soaked to the bone the pain was getting worse and he was beginning to long for something to take the edge off at least i do wish things werent quite so damp though he said ruefully he took a sip of the wine it would probably help idalia says that soon the rain will turn to snow ashaniel said smiling which will not be quite asdamp and by the spring the weather will perhaps have returned to its accustomed ways it gladdens my heart that you have returned to see our city as it should be seenand soon you will be healed of the hurts you have taken in our service kellen glanced down at his hands only the very tips of his fingers were visible in the thick cocoon of bandage and vestakia and jermayan had made sure he never got a good look at them on the infrequent occasions they changed the bandages he wondered just how badly his hands had been burned back there at the obelisk very badly if the pain he felt whenever the salve started to wear off was any indication so badly his mind itself flinched away from thinking about it im certain that is so he said politely it was hard very hard to sit here making polite conversation when what he wanted was to down another of those painkilling potions soak in a hot bath then sleep for oh a year or so shalkan came wandering over and stuck his head over kellens shoulder those little iced cakes look delicious he said pointedly shalkan had a notorious sweettooth one that the unicorn indulged at every opportunity this time however he was going to have to wait kellen couldnt manage anything as small as a cake with his bandaged hands and everyone else was too busy making polite noises at each other while they listened for idalias return to favor him with a treat if the snow is to be heavy this year then the winter running dance should be exceptionally fine jermayan observed all this politeness was enough to make kellen want to scream except that he hadnt enough energy to do more than sit there look solemn and nod even his nervous energy was beginning to flag indeed it should ainalundore said from her position behind the queen from her tone the counselor greeted the introduction of such an innocuous subject with great relief to kellens faint disbelief the elves jermayan included embarked upon a lively discussion of forthcoming entertainments to be held in sentarshadeen just as if the threat of shadow mountain wasnt still hanging over all of their heads just as if they werent all dying for idalia and vestakia to come back just as if they were totally oblivious to the fact that kellen himself was about to fall over from exhaustion cake said shalkan is very nice one could spear a cake with a fork if one was so inclined and place it on a saucer and i could eat it shameless but it made him smile and he did exactly what shalkan wanted now that he knew how he could manage to maneuver things and out of politeness he ate a cake himself and discovered that the sugary thing gave him a little more energy he sat and listened carefully feeding shalkan most of the plate of little iced cakesand taking one or two for himselfas he finished his cup of wine the wine did help he would have liked more but he was afraid in his current state he could slip from pleasantly numb to clearly intoxicated with very little warning and that would probably horrify the elves sandalon was still safe in lairamos clutches somewhere out of sight at the back of the pavilion what was taking idalia so long surely she just had to look at vestakia to know that she was good but there was no point in starting an argument here and now particularly one kellen was pretty sure hed already won andoreniel and ashaniel had promised to abide by whatever idalia said and their word was law here theyre coming shalkans breath tickled kellens ear kellen glanced up a few moments later idalia and vestakia appeared in the doorway of the pavilion all conversation stopped idalia approached the table with vestakia her arm around the girls shoulders kellen had the feeling that without that support vestakia might have run i have searched thoroughly with the wild magic idalia said without preamble vestakia is not one of the endarkened nor does she bear demontaint jermayan halfrose from his seat idalia held up her free hand indicating that she had more to say yet by her heritage the endarkened do have a kind of link to her they can affect her physically by sympathetic magic though she will sense anything they attempt through the gift passed to her by her wildmage mother and for this reason anyone who has been in intimate contact with her is similarly at risk here idalia broke off eyeing kellen sharply she didnt have to say what he knew perfectly well if shalkan hadnt demanded a vow of celibacy and chastity from him in exchange for his aid in helping kellen escape from armethalieh they might all be in very deep trouble right now but the bad is balancedand exceededby the good by her gift at locating demons and piercing their illusions vestakia can aid us to track the endarkened just as she found the black cairn for kellen though her range is not great nor can she see into the future with her aid should she choose to give it we can know when something is just an accident and when its the work of the endarkened and if there are demons around however disguised vestakia will know there was a long pause while andoreniel weighed idalias words this is a great gift he said at last getting to his feet it would make good hearing to know that you will use your power for the good of the nine cities vestakia idalia must have coached her back in the forest because vestakia seemed to have no difficulty understanding what andoreniel meant yes vestakia said her voice very soft yes i will it would be my honor to help you however i can how couldi mean anyone who has any sort of gift that could be used to oppose such evil would do just the same then be welcome in sentarshadeen andoreniel said gravely jermayan and abrinath will see you to your hearth that seemed to settle it no matter who had doubts about thisand there were probably plenty who didthere could be no arguing with the king at least not in public and in privatewell that didnt matter kellen felt almost dizzy with relief and was very glad he hadnt drunk that second cup of wine jermayan and abrinath werent the only ones leaving with vestakia quite a number of those present made preparations to leave as well including a couple of grooms leading valdien and lily away presumably to their stables kellen watched fascinated as they unfurled large parasols at the door of the pavilion only unlike the ones hed seen in armethalieh these were apparently designed to keep off rain not sun youll be fine kellen told vestakia under the cover of the preparations for the departure youll like it here ill see you soon do you promise vestakia asked sounding a little desperate i promise kellen said ah theyll be giving you your own little house by the way one of the guesthouses just be sure to invite jermayan to come inside when you get there i dont think he can come in otherwise vestakia smiled a fleeting nervous smile ill remember she said and then jermayan offered her his arm and the two of them walked away kellen glanced back at idalia to see her watching the two of them go the expression on her face caught him by surprise somethings changed here when theyd left idalia had been holding jermayan at arms length kellen knew that she loved jermayan as much as he loved her but the fact that elves bonded once and for life and that idalia was inevitably going to die centuries before jermayan did had made her refuse to acknowledge that love hoping that jermayan would find someone else but now idalias attitude seemed to have changed if the expression on her face was any indication it isnt any of my business kellen told himself firmly he got to his feet glancing from shalkan to idalia uncertainly he wasnt quite certain what to do now and then he started to sway just a little as exhaustion caught him by surprise oh no brother mine idalia said firmly youre not going anywhere until i see whats under those bandages kellen stared around in alarm here now id take you home first but if its something i need to call in extra help for id just have to bring you back through the city again might as well deal with it here idalia said leaning close and speaking softly for kellens ears alone ashaniel gathered up most of the remaining courtiersand all of the women including lairamo who was still clutching sandalon tightlyand prepared to leave andoreniel and morusil stayed along with several others whose names kellen didnt know we look forward to celebrating your triumph before all sentarshadeen once you are properly healed and rested kellen tavadon ashaniel said gravely thank you kellen said simply somehow this didnt seem like the time to complain that he hated parties ashaniel turned and swept away reaching out to take sandalons hand in hers the young elven prince was gazing back at kellen forlornly over lairamos shoulder ill see you again soon kellen called to the child and saw sandalons face light up with pleasure then the queen and her court were gone and two attendants were closing the pavilion awning behind them why dont we get you out of that armor idalia said pragmatically better now than later as deftly as if shed done this a hundred timesand kellen didnt know she hadntshe unbelted his surcoat and lifted it off then pulled out the lockingpins that held the armored collar in place and slipped it free then lifted off the armored breastandbackplate next came the multijointed armored sleeves then the boots then the leggings then kellen stood wearing nothing more than the thin quilted leather undersuit that went beneath the elven armor it was damp from the rain and had shiny worn scars on its surface where the armor had rubbed it kellen felt peculiarly light and unfinished without his armor in the short time since hed first donned it it had grown to be an extension of his self as much as his sword was one of the attendants handed idalia a thick belted robein the same shade of soft green as kellens surcoatand she helped him into it and tied the sash heavy soft overtheknee boots of greendyed sheepskin woolly side in completed the outfit the elves did nothing by halves comfy now idalia asked so far kellen said cautiously idalia snorted eloquently and opened a large box that someone had placed on the table while kellen hadnt been paying attention the box was large but not deepthough still too big for one person to carry comfortablyand made of a satiny golden wood so beautifully crafted that kellen couldnt make out where the pieces were joined when idalia opened it kellen could see that it was lined in padded leather and filled with small glass flasks idalia inspected the contents critically for a moment before choosing one the liquid inside was a lurid violet color she picked up the goblet kellen had used before and poured a generous portion of the violet liquid into itit was thick and syrupybefore filling the cup the rest of the way with wine she lifted the cup to his lips drink it all as fast as you can she ordered i suppose it tastes terrible kellen said resignedly having some experience with healing potions not this one idalia said sounding amused but it needs to start working before i can start working steadying the cup with his bandaged hands kellen complied shed been right it didnt taste that badparticularly in comparison with other potions hed had to drinkbut the violet syrup gave the wine an odd sweetish undertaste that he didnt actually care for like eating candied flowers idalia took the cup back and set it carefully on the table then reached for his hand reflexively kellen drew back i have to see whats under there idalia said gently it wont hurt not once what i put in the wine takes effect anyway tell me what happened i burned them kellen said simply he knew he ought to tell her more but somehow he really couldnt bring himself to talk about what had happened at the top of the cairn not to jermayan not to shalkan not to anyone it was the keystone he finally added reluctantly do they hurt now idalia asked as impersonal as any physician no not much anyway jermayan had some kind of salve in his pack nights daughter shalkan supplied mixed with allheal well idalia seemed surprised and kellen wondered what nights daughter was just as well he came prepared for every occasion and he gave me something horrible and brown to drink every night so i could sleep kellen added it tasted like moldy hay idalia raised her eyebrow evidently she recognized what it was without shalkan telling her its just as well you came back to us so soon then she knelt in front of him and unwrapped his hands slowly alternating hands so that both would be exposed at the same time shalkan stood close his cheek nearly touching kellens kellen could tell that whatever was in the wine was starting to work he felt sleepy and it was hard to concentrate as the outer layers of bandage came away he could see the inner layers sticky and glistening with greenish ointment and the more layers idalia peeled away the more kellen could see that his hands looked wrong they just looked wrong jermayan and vestakia had never let him watch when they tended his dressings on the trail hed gone along with it then he didnt remember why just now but he had maybe hed been asleep when theyd done it maybe it was that brown stuff but he wasnt asleep now dont look shalkan suggested as idalia lifted away the last layer of bandage but kellen couldnt manage to take that good advice he looked and wished he hadnt his hands were warped and charred caricatures of themselves all the flesh was burned away from the palms and kellen thought he could see bone showing toward the edges of the burn puffy moist colorless flesh hung in sloughing rags his fingers were crooked into claws the tendons pulled tight by the burns he tried to flex his fingers and couldnt there was only paindull and distant but there he made a strangled sound and would have risen from his seat if not for andoreniels hands on his shoulders pressing him firmly down even through the effects of the draught idalia had given him kellen could feel a rising tide of panic ill never hold a sword again idalia made a hissing sound of dismay and somehow that turned kellens panic into anger well what did you expect he said harshly struggling with his feelings hed known he was burned hed known the burns were badvery bad but to see them i expected you to die idalia said all the grief she hadnt shown before thick in her voice oh little brother im so glad you came back alive she put her hand over his armabove the burnsand squeezed gently then sat back looking over his shoulder kellen dont look at your hands look at me shalkan demanded now with a great effort kellen pulled his gaze away from his hands and met shalkans gaze the unicorn had beautiful eyesdeep green and fringed by the longest silver lashes kellen had ever seen it will be all right the unicorn said softly youve seen idalia heal worse injuries remember the unicorn colt just look at me and keep breathing let the potion do its work kellen took a deep breath anger was a tool of the knightmage but panic was his enemy he wasnt going to panic he concentrated on shalkan as if from a great distance he heard idalias voice will anyone here share in the price of this healing i will he heard andoreniel say for what kellen has done for my city i stand in his debt forever and i morusil added it is a small repayment for the refreshment kellen has brought to my garden and the saving of the forest and i and i in a few moments all the elves who had remained behind had pledged themselves to share in the price of kellens healing chapter two a healing and a homecoming calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink that will make things easier idalia thought absently she reached out with her small knife and cut a few strands of kellens hair then a few of her own bless the boy he didnt even notice he was staring into shalkans eyes as if hed found his one true love breathing slowly and deeply doing all he could to aid her in her spell for a moment there when hed first seen his hands shed thought she was going to have to waste valuable energy putting him into sleep but hed pulled out of his panic admirably morusil had already gathered strands of hair from everyone else there she added her own and kellens hairs to the bundle then pricked the ball of her thumb with her knife and squeezed out a drop of her own blood holding the nowbloody bundle of hairs under her hand so that the drop of blood fell on it and bound them all together power flared up in the yellow pavilion encircling them all and settling into a dome of protection once it had steadied idalia tossed the hair and the herbs necessary to her spell into the brazier that morusil had also prepared and whispered her spell normally she would not need to do so much work to prepare a healing but kellen was very badly injured and idalia was already laboring under the shadow of an unpaid mageprice incurred when she had cast the spell to bring the rains safely to sentarshadeen though andoreniel morusil and the others would bear much of the cost of kellens healing there was always magedebt to be paid this was the law of the wild magic the weight of the presence filled her and she waited to hear the price but instead a voice seemed to speak within her you have already paid your price in full no her denial was automatic there was no magic without a costthat was the first and most basic tenet of the wild magic what price she had paid was for gifts she had already received not for this but kellen needed healing and it would be foolishness to argue with the presence i accept she said and felt the presence depart just as if she had accepted a normal geas green fire filled her hands as thick and rich as wild honey she tilted her hands and it spilled over splashing onto kellens hands and clinging and where it touched ruined flesh began to heal and reknit as if it had never been burned once that damage had been repaired the green fire spreadup kellens arms across his torso down his legsrepairing all the lesser damage hed sustained at the barrier in moments the healing was over after a moment idalia dismissed the sphere of protection she got stiffly to her feet at least she felt just as tired as if this had been a normal healing and judging from the faces of the elves they all felt the same kellen met her eyes his expression dazed and unfocused with exhaustion he looked down at his hands his eyes opening wide in delight and wonder at the sight of them whole and unmarred he opened his hands wide and then closed them into fists theyre all right he said his voice blurry with the aftereffects of the potion theyre all right of course they are idalia said with an assurance she hadnt felt until that moment and with affection and love flowing over into her voice and now well go home ill help shalkan said im not sure kellen remembers where it is and even if he does im not sure he could get there without deciding to lie down on the path for a nap which would severely inconvenience anyone else who needed to walk there kellen grinned tiredly but did not contradict his friend idalia brought kellens cloak then kellen swung his leg over shalkans bare back and the three of them made their way to the small house kellen shared with idalia morusil accompanied them for part of the distance until his path diverged from their own this time kellen didnt even mind the rain no one seemed to take any particular notice of them elves were tactful in that way here we are kellen was nearly asleep by the time they reached their door he blinked at it in surprise everything looked differentfamiliar and strange at the same time while hed been gone sentarshadeen had taken on something of the aspect of a dreamworld in his mind something too good to be true but here it was again as real as the rocks in the road he took a deep breath and swung his leg over shalkans back ill see you later shalkan said get some sleep when the unicorn was sure kellen was steady on his feet he turned neatly on the path before the door and trotted delicately away idalia opened the door and kellen hurried to get in out of the rain rain its been raining since we started back its raining now doesnt it ever stop he asked yawning as he walked inside everything was just as hed left it with the addition of a cloaktree and drippan just inside the door kellen hung his sodden cloak on the highest peg stretching and yawning again eventually idalia promised normally id suggest a hot bath before bed but frankly i dont think youll stay awake through itand id hate for you to drown after all my hard work why dont you get out of those damp leathers and into your nice dry bed youll need to sleep off that healing and then we can talk kellen nodded heading toward his room bed his own bed and it would be dry and warm and he would not have to drag himself out of it at first light for sword practice or another long day in the saddle with a mumbled thanks to idalia he slid back the door and walked inside the bed was turned down and waiting for him everything had been changed to autumn colors there was a new bedrobe laid out andkellen grinned to himselftowels as well he sat down on the bench beneath the window and pulled off his clothes toweling himself thoroughly dry afterward even in the exhaustion that was the aftermath of the healing spell every time he used his hands he felt an enormous pang of relief just to pick something up to close his hands to look down and see not numb bandagecovered lumps but ten healthy responsive pink fingers was almost enough to rouse him to wakefulness againalmost hed lived with the fear for so long thatbecause of the way theyd been burned by magicthered be nothing idalia would be able to do to heal him but now that was all over he was fine better than fine healed time to move on to the next crisis kellen told himself stumbling toward the bed he was asleep before hed pulled the covers up over himself a few minutes after kellen disappeared into his room idalia looked in she found kellens clothing strewn all over the floor and kellen asleep like a hibernating bear she smiled faintly to herself and went to brew tea she was tired but not tired enough to seek her own bed there had been several present to share the cost of the healing and so the physical cost to her had been minimal normally she would have also had a price to pay but not this time apparently idalia frowned shed never heard of such a thing before but wildmages didnt run to libraries of books setting down the accumulated lore of wildmages past for one thing the wild magic itself was fluid and everchanging and the way things had happened in the past wasnt the way things would necessarily happen in the future as it seems ive just proven ah well if there are explanations to be had i suppose ill find them in the books of the wild magic once the water was hot and her tea was steeping she went to her room and got out her three books the book of moon the book of sun and the book of stars were the three books every wildmage possessed the books were magical in themselves and once they had found their wildmage they could not be separated from him or her by any means save the death of the wildmage nor could they be destroyed in them was everything a wildmage needed to know in order to set their feet on the path of the wild magic and a lifetime was not enough time to master their contents idalia sat in the front room and read drinking tea and listening to the rain though she found comfort in the familiar pages she found very little in the way of enlightenment about what had happened when shed healed kellen there was no giftno magicwithout payment that was the way the world worked all magicwhether the wild magic the high magick of armethalieh or the shadow magic of the endarkenedhad to be paid for either in advance with stored personal energy or afterward with a magepriceor sometimes both any attempt to subvert that balance led to disastrous consequences it was just such a temptation that the endarkened had offered to the wildmages during the great wara temptation to which some of them had succumbed that of power without price so why had she not been asked for payment if the question bothers you enough ask she told herself putting down the book of stars she picked up her cup of nowcold tea frowning down into its bowl subconsciously she realized she had been waiting for something no not something someone jermayan surely he ought to have been here by now fool idalia muttered under her breath shed been sitting here like a maiden in a wondertale expecting jermayan to come to her just because shed changed her mindbut after the thorough job shed done of driving him away when she and kellen had first come to sentarshadeen if there was to be a reconciliation the first move in that dance would have to be hers she retreated to her room again opened her desk and penned a brief message there were times when it was distinctly advantageous to be a wildmage and this was one of them she went out into her garden and sent out a silent call shed expected a bird to come to her call but it was raining and birds did not fly in the rain unless they must to her surprise a sleek white hound appeared cocking his head alertly and regarding her curiously tail wagging slowly he was no masterless animalhis smooth coat and the collar about his neck told her that muchbut was apparently willing to take time from his own pursuits to do her a favor and his price was easy enough to meet a slice of meatpie from her larder satisfied him she tucked her note into his collar and secured it with a ribbon and then she sat down to wait jermayan arrived with admirable promptness he was dressed in blue and silver his waistlength hair elaborately braided with long silver cords that had a tiny teardrop of midnightblue lapis at the end of each they matched the larger drops of lapis that hung from each ear his cloakbrooches his rings and the lustrous bloom of the deeppiled silkvelvet breeches tucked into buttersoft highheeled boots that swept extravagantly all the way to midthigh his tunic was a pale grey heavy silk brocade oversewn with thousands of beads of crystal and moonstone in a seeminglyrandom pattern meant to mimic a shower of raindrops the latest fashion among the elves was clothing that looked as if it was wet when it wasnt idalia was impressedthe man had barely been here half a day and was already leading the style be welcome in my home and at my hearth she said meaning the words as she had never meant them before jermayan shook out his cloakwet with real raindropsand hung it on the cloaktree and set his rainshadeblue and silver of coursebeside it well met idalia it is good to be welcome in the home of friends kellen is asleep idalia said decoding the unspoken question with the ease of long practice the healing went well and he is restored to complete health a good long sleep and a few decent meals will complete the healing leaving him as hale as when he left here that makes good hearing jermayan said then he will be ready to resume his lessons soon there is much yet for him to learn in the ways of a knightmage and so little time for any of us i would offer you tea idalia said in a faintlystrangled voice turning toward the stove that stood tucked neatly into one corner of the room and it would be interesting to know how vestakia finds sentarshadeen as well but jermayan did not answer and the silence stretched as idalia set the kettle on the stove to heat and rinsed and filled the elvenware teapot with several measures of autumn rain tea why didnt he say anything if he were angry with her for any reason he would not have come so that could not be the reason could something have happened to vestakia darkness damn all notions of elven propriety if he didnt explain himself soon she was going to break down and ask him idalia turned aroundwhy was it so hard to face him now of all times and found that jermayan had not moved away from his position near the door he was standing watching her with that utter elven stillness his face expressionless she forced herself to meet his eyes idalia you once played our courtly games far better than this now you are as awkward in our ways as kellen is jermayan said very gently you have changed your mind perhaps you would show kindness to one who is your brothers friend and who has always meant you well she forced herself to take one step away from the table then another noting with a distant measuring part of herself that her legs trembled why was this so hard there was no place in a wildmages life for dishonesty and false pride she had abandoned those thingsshe thought she hadyears before and because that was true she knew the reason now shed taken risks that mattered before shed hazarded her life and her safety but not her heart before shed only offered up her life or a wildmages honor not something that if everything went wrong would leave her whole in body able to mourn and suffer without even the chill consolation that shed done it all in the name of service because she was doing this for herself idalia jermayan asked a question she felt her face quirk in an uncertain smile she held out her hand his fingers closed over hers warm when his touch had always been so cool before becausewhen you were gonei realized that were all going to die jermayans fingers tightened over hers no it isnt magic not a vision dont worry just common sense youre an elven knight she felt him relax looking up idalia could see that he smiled she let him draw her closer my heart i have been an elven knight since before your grandparents met jermayan said and i am a wildmage idalia agreed and never in either of our lifetimes has shadow mountain begun moving so actively against our peoples you know and i know were going to war kellen destroyed the barrier shadow mountain wont stop because of that if anything it will speed their plans of all of the creatures of light that the shadow hates the most the wildmages and elven knights are at the top of the list of those first to be destroyed yes jermayan said meeting her gaze steadily i fear that you are correct and so you think i will die before you and for this reason you are at last willing to hear the counsel of my heart no idalia thought closing her eyes for a moment but i think you will not survive me long enough to grieve overmuch i think i have been foolish to throw away the chance for joy idalia said softly and i thank the gods that i have been given a second chance she went into his arms willingly as she had not since the day she had first realized he loved her and such felt a sense of peace and joy well up as she had never experienced outside of the wild magic then let it be so idalia jermayan said and if i do not share your optimism at the length of my life it is no matteri shall surrender upon any terms you set now be merciful in your victory and grant one concession more name the day upon which we may be wed idalia only barely managed to keep from recoiling in horror from jermayans words taking jermayan as her lover was one thing but marriage elves had given up their share in the greater magics long ago in exchange for peace and long lives but they had had many many years in which to learn to use the small magics they yet possessed in the most effective way possible and some of them were very potent elves mated for life none of the elvenkind would offer marriage to someone that they did not recognize a soulbond with and when they wed one of the purposes of the ceremony was to strengthen that soulbond with those small magics binding the partners together body mind heart and soul if she married himperhaps if she did so much as accept his betrothal pendantthey would be linked it was not impossible that jermayan would have a certain amount of access to her thoughtsincluding possibly knowledge of the price she had accepted to bring the weather down safely to sentarshadeen and that was something she didnt dare allow not yet idalia said firmly a proper wedding takes time to plan jermayan she added making her voice light you are no lowly herbtender to expect to leap a broom with your chosen goosegirl and call it done you have an obligation to sentarshadeen and to your liege to create an occasion that all may treasure in memory this time she blessed elven custom for its intricacies jermayan would have to ask permission of the king and queen who would in turn have to debate thisfor idalia was human and while such marriages were not unknown they were rare he would have to arrange for the appropriate sort of wedding and it would have to be a very public occasion and by the time even half of that was accomplished sentarshadeen might well be a city under siege and such considerations as weddings would be forgotten timeand perhaps fair weather and dry jermayan teased and i do not doubt that we will find other things to beguile us during the moonturns of waiting hed thought hed heard voices kellen awoke disoriented by the unfamiliar sensation of sleeping in a warm dry bed for a moment he couldnt remember where he was or how hed gotten here but then the memories slipped into place sentarshadeen home he felt better than he had in sennights no bruises no torn halfhealed muscles and his handshis hands he stretched luxuriating in the feeling that there was nothing whatsoever wrong hed definitely heard voices and he was hungry hungry enough to eatif not valdien then something of approximately the same size as jermayans warhorse and he wouldnt really care how thoroughly it was cooked either he knew it was the aftereffect of the healing idalia had performed on him but that didnt make him any less hungry he only hoped the larder was well stocked he belted on the heavy overtunic hed worn home too hungry to stop and look for the bedrobe he remembered seeing and slid back the door into the common room jermayan and idalia were there both of them together and from the look of things they had definitely settled their differences kellen retreated quickly feeling his cheeks flush and slid the door shut a shade too forcefully leaning against it his hunger was momentarily forgotten he felt himself growing hot with embarrassment he stared around the room and as he did he saw a bowl of fruit and a carafe on the bedside table he walked over to it discovering that there was not only fruit but a plate of cheese pastries covered by a cloth the carafe contained cider see kellen told himself sitting down on the edge of the bed and biting into a pastry theres food in here you dont need to go out there in fact he thought he might not ever go out there again there was a faint rattle as the door slid open again you can come out now idalia said stifled laughter in her voice its safe i promise and we wouldnt want you to starve to death in here kellen got to his feet setting the remaining half of the second pastry back on the plate and brushing crumbs from the front of his robe he thought of all the things he could possibly say and decided not to say any of them they were all simply too horribly embarrassing especially with idalia looking at him that way and obviously trying so hard not to laugh i wish both of you all happiness kellen said instead he was surprised both to find that he meant it and that it was exactly the right thing to say the following evening a formal banquet was held to officially welcome kellen and jermayan home to sentarshadeen kellen spent the day preceding it indoors he had a choice or so idalia told him that morning he could stay inside by elven standards of etiquette that would mean he was not officially here and no one would bother him or he could go out but once he crossed his doorstep hed be fair game and though the elves were notoriouslyand unfailinglypolite they also lived to gossip and he would probably be the center of more attention than he liked what about vestakia kellen asked hed just as soon avoid the attention but he didnt want to abandon vestakia on her first day in sentarshadeen vestakia idalia had answered with a wicked smirk will be spending the morningthe entire morning and possibly most of the afternoonreceiving a new wardrobe from tengitir who announced that she has waited her entire life for such a challenge as vestakia represents you know i do believe that if the prince of shadow mountain were to appear before her tengitir would demand that he take off his clothes and step into the light so that she could best determine what colors and fabrics suited his skin idalia added bemusedly kellen laughed having been dressed by the elven seamstress himselftengitirs specialty was in designing clothing for the nonelvenhe thought that was almost possible afterwardif theres time before the banquetjermayan and i will take her around sentarshadeen a little to show her the cityand to show her to the city as well of course the sooner everyone sees that there is nothing to fear from her the better idalia added and if there is anything wrong in the city shell find it kellen said yes idalia said id thought of that as well so with one thing and another kellen spent the day at home mostly by himself idalia seemed to have a great many errands to run going in and out all day returning more often than not with mysterious parcels which she wouldnt let him unwrap time enough for that later little brother was all she would say she seemed cheerful enough and kellen was glad of that when theyd first arrived in sentarshadeen shed seemed so grave he preferred this idalia better it made it easier to pretend that in destroying the barrier theyd solved all their problems though kellen knew they hadnt theyd only bought themselves and the elves some timethough how much time and what form the next attack would take was something he doubted even idalia could guess to distract himself from the unavoidable banquetthough the son of the archmage of armethalieh had a certain amount of experience with formal banquets this would be the first such event kellen had attended among the elveskellen spent the day cleaning and polishing his sword and armor having found that his gear had been delivered to the house the previous day not that it really needed doingsomeone had obviously been at it before himbut it gave his hands something to do and settled his mind when hed finished that he got out his books and turned to the book of stars the book of stars was the most esoteric and puzzling of the three books the book of moon was the simplest containing basic cantrips and the building blocks of spells a budding wildmage could begin working wildmagery within minutes of opening the book of moon the book of sun contained some information about spells as well but was more occupied with why spells should be cast than how and often with whether they should be cast at all since the wild magic was a magic of balance and often things tended to slip back into balance without the wildmages help the book of stars seemed to be about the underlying principles of the wild magic idalia had once told kellen that studying it helped the wildmage become a better wildmage although kellen had never been able to see how as nothing hed read in it had ever really made a lot of sense to him shed said he should study it anyway so kellen had it seemed to make a lot more sense now that kellen knew he was a knightmage instead of a regular wildmage the book of stars said that the knightmage is the active agent of the principle of the wild magic the wildmage who chooses to become a warrior or who is born with the instinct for the way of the sword who acts in battle without mindful thought and thus brings primary causative forces into manifestation by direct action when they had discovered that this was what kellen was jermayan had told him that a wildmage and a knightmages gifts lay in opposite directions that while a wildmage reached out to all the world a knightmages gifts turned inward so that he could not be turned away from his course once he had chosen it because of that kellens abilities in wildmagery would never be as strong as idalias but jermayan also said that a knightmage could withstand forces that would destroy a regular wildmage for the knightmages true power lay in endurance and the alliance of his knightly skills with his wildmagery it all sounded very fine but kind of unsettling and while kellen had a lot more confidence in his wildmage skillsespecially now that he wasnt measuring them against idaliashe knew he still had a lot to learn about this knight business and hed better learn fast fortunately he had jermayan to teach him he wasnt surprised to find that the book of stars seemed to make a lot more sense now that he knew what he really was for the first time the words in the tiny handwritten book seemed to be speaking directly to him as if the longgone wildmage who had copied it out from his or her own bookswhy kellen still sometimes wondered and as part of what magepricewere here and speaking directly to him only when you cease to try will you achieve only when you cease to seek will you find only when you are emptied will you be filled if that wasnt exactly what finding the way of the knightmage was like hed eat his boots it gave him a kind of comfort to know that whatever might come to pass it was somehow within the sphere of the wild magic and for the first time he wondered if all copies of the three books were the same oh probably the book of moon was and maybe the book of sunbut what about the book of stars because what was in his book certainly wouldnt apply to idalia would it was every copy of the book of stars suited only to the wildmage who was supposed to read it kellen come back to the world little brother kellen startled at the sound of idalias voice disturbing greymalkin who had insinuated herself into his lap as he read the cat yawned and stretched stalking slowly from his lap kellen blinked up at his sister surprised to see how far the light had failed hed been sure he was still reading but now he saw that it was too dark to make out the words on the page which book she asked kellen closed the worn leather volume and brandished it in explanation the small gold star glinted faintly on the spine idalia raised an eyebrow and smiled saying nothing time to have a bath and get dressed its going to take you a while to climb into all your finery she said teasingly kellen sighed getting reluctantly to his feet his experiences with formal dress when he had lived in his fathers house had not been pleasant ones and he doubted hed show to advantage in a roomful of costumeobsessed elves one of the oldest histories in armethalieh said that the elves have elevated mere living into a form of art and that included clothing of course even if his own outfit for tonight had been designed to take into account the shortcomings of clumsy shortlived humansand since tengitir had certainly made it it undoubtedly hadamong the elves hed look like a turnip in a rose garden just as out of place as he had back in armethalieh bath idalia said firmly taking him by the shoulders and turning him in that direction ill lay out your clothes while you do that and hurry up because i still have to wash and change myself kellen headed for the bathroomhe could get his robe while the tub filled he felt a little better knowing that idalia was going to be there and just as overdressed as he was he could hardly imagine what shed look like in high elven finery and by dusk he knew idalia was wearing a dresskellens first reaction was to laugh but he didnt she would have slain him on the spotwhose main color was the same violet as her eyes on second look there was no reason to laugh hed never seen idalia in a dress before in fact after what little shed told him about her childhood hed thought she wouldnt be caught dead in one but somehow it didnt look unsuitable there was nothing ornate or frivolous about it just clean simple practical lines as businesslike as a good sword but it wasnt plain any more than an elvenware bowl was plain the shimmering violet silk glowed like glass as if it were somehow lit from within and was accented by insets of dark barkbrown velvet almost the color of her hair velvet that somehow had a furtive iridescent glimmer of the same violet rippling along the surface of it wherever the light struck it there were insets along the collar at the shoulders and inside the full outer sleeves she lookedelegant he hadnt known she could look elegant ill be tripping over my skirts all night idalia muttered stalking across the room to glare into a mirror but kellen knew she wouldnt they only seemed to touch the floor but that was a clever illusion the hem was actually uneven it didnt touch the floor at all and was several inches shorter in front than in back youll be fine kellen said soothingly and you lookhe sought for a word that would convey what he thoughtdignified amazing actually so do you idalia said she slid a pair of ebony and elvensilver combs into her hairher only jewelryand turned to regard kellen critically hed been relieved to find that he hadnt needed help dressing after all his costume he really couldnt think of it any other way was not very much more elaborate than idaliasand fortunately the sheer bodyhugging styles that the elves favored for themselves were nowhere in evidence in kellens own garb there were a few notes of the same seagreen that was the accent color for his armorhe guessed hed better get used to the idea that the elves thought of it as his official color nowin the very plain heavy silk trousers and longsleeved tunic that were the bottom layer of his outfit but over those went a long sleeveless vest that fell to midthigh closed all the way to its high neck by a double row of tiny silver buttons that had taken him ages to do up it was made of a sheered velvet in a leafpatternparts were sheer and parts were thick velvet and kellen couldnt quite decide what the color was silver gold brown all of them eventually he gave up it looked okay over the green anyway making the silk undertunic where it showed through shimmer in a silverydefinitely silveryway over that came a long fullsleeved robe that fell to midcalf in a green so dark it was almost black it was a kind of cloth hed never seen before soft like wool and smooth but faintly iridescent it was lined in dull gold satin and belted with a wideand very longsash in a slightly brighter shade of green than the overrobe that had nearly been his undoing until idalia had taken pity on him and showed him how to wrap and tie the sash properly low boots of a reassuringly normallooking pale gold calfskin completed his outfit i dont look bad kellen agreed and i dont feel silly he realized with relief nobody was asking him to wear earrings braid jewels into his hair paint his face or do any of the other things the elves did when they got themselves done up for some festive occasion now just as long as nobody asked him to make a speech except for your hair idalia agreed come over here a few minutes with a comb and idalia had pulled kellens mop of lightbrown curls back into a short twisted braid at the nape of his neck it felt reassuringly normalit was the way he wore his hair under his helmet after all there presentable she craned around and kissed him lightly on the forehead youll definitely do ill just get our raincapes and rainshades and we can be off dont worrytheyre bespelled to keep the rain offand i actually think its slackening a bit this evening not stopping of course which is just as well idalia said where are we going kellen asked thinking to ask for the first time the gardens at the house of leaf and star theres no other place large enough to accommodate the guest listand the unicorns will want to be able to listenfrom a distance of course outside in the rain idalia snickered at kellens expression under canvasor silk actually relax everything that should be dry will be dry you look like youre being sent to an execution not to a banquet all things considered kellen would rather have gone to an execution the formal gardens of the house of leaf and star were subtly beautiful like all the creations of the elves the natural world raised to an impossible pitch of perfection hed never seen the gardens but then he hadnt been in sentarshadeen long and had gotten most of his tour of it courtesy of sandalon whod shown him the things that sandalon thought would interest a human stranger which had not obviously included his parents gardens kellen looked down realizing that at some point without noticing he and idalia had gone from the streets of sentarshadeen to a wideslatted wooden path laid across the meadow to a path of white gravel this must be the garden then tonight it was filled with more lanterns than kellen would once have been willing to bet were in the entire city of sentarshadeen before the rains came it had been necessary to keep the lights of evening from starting any accidental fires in a city made tinderdry by drought now it was only necessary to keep the flames from being drowned by the rain but the elveswho accomplished far more through clever engineering than humans had ever done through magic made it look effortless some of the lanterns shone through tall gauzy windbreaks set up to blunt the force of the blustering rainheavy winds turning them into tall softlygleaming rectangles of color though they seemed as insubstantial as kites kellen doubted theyd fall if the wind blew ten times as hard though they quivered when the wind struck them kellen suspected they were meant to inside the curving walls of windbreaks the air was nearly still and the flames inside the artfullyscattered lanternssome suspended on tall posts some nearer the groundburned steadily but the towering windbreaks were walls only not roofs and kellen was still glad to have his rainshade and cloak for protection hed gotten his fill of being wet on his return from the barrier but the other purpose for the windbreaks besides sheltering the lanterns was obviously to protect the dining pavilions unlike the place in which he jermayan and vestakia had first been receivedif not entirely welcomedthese were little more than canopies suspended on poles even in the rain the entire garden was lit as brightly as the common room of kellens house and very little of it was really open to the falling rain their cloaks were taken from them as they arrived at the edge of the garden leaving them their light and elegant rainshades the garden was already filled with elves their rainshades making them look like fabulous flowers like it idalia said gesturing around everyones already here kellen said uneasily are we late no the honored guests arrive last and of course having spent all day putting this together they certainly expect you to take some time to admire it before the banquet begins lets look around idalia put her free hand on his arm and led kellen forward he didnt see much of the garden as it normally wasbut he did see a lot of dining pavilions and oiledpaper lanterns and people he knew all of sentarshadeen was here tonight indeed and he and idalia stopped several times to speak politely to people that kellen knew from the time hed spent on the work crews watering the forest and to several of idalias friends as well all the time his sense of dread grew everything seemed so quiet so formal he wouldnt be able to get through this evening without making some terrible error he knew it well be sitting over there under that green awning idalia said when their slow meander finally brought them within range of the canopies in the back of his mind kellen had been wondering where everyone was going to sit under the tents obviously but surely there werent enough tables and chairsnot to mention plates and cupsin the city to host a banquet for its entire populace unless the elves had built them allbut in two days he sort of thought that would take greater magic than they claimed to possess he glanced around he was surprised to see that what was under the awnings wasnt large long banquet tablessuch as he would have seen in armethaliehbut instead an assortment of tables in various shapes sizes and woods all harmonious of course in the elven fashion but certainly not giving the impression theyd all been built for the occasion in fact he was sure he recognized some of the furnishings surely that table under the rosecolored canopy was from the house of leaf and star yes he was sure of it hed eaten dinner at it his first night in sentarshadeen alone with ashaniel lairamo and sandalon suddenly kellen realized why the tables and chairsand the tableware as wellwere a harmonious assortment instead of an harmonious whole it might be held in the gardens of the house of leaf and star but the tables and chairs were from nearly every home in sentarshadeen andoreniel and ashaniel werent giving this banquet the entire city was kellen felt himself relax at last he realized hed been thinking of tonight in armethaliehan termsof this banquet as an event meant to crush spectators and participants with its magnificence and to inspire them with thoughts of their own unworthiness to attend it but if elves thought that way the house of leaf and star would be a cold and forbidding palace terrible in its majesty no when the elves said that this was a welcoming banquet that was exactly what it was their ways might be strange and their code of etiquette difficult for a human to understand or to follow but that was what they meant for all the gardens daunting and ethereal beauty tonight had far more in common with the party the centaurs and farmers had held back in the wildwood to bid him and idalia farewell than it did with anything that might ever occur in the golden city the elves are like no other people in the world idalia said quietly watching his face you read the histories back in the city where they talk about the other races do you remember what they say about the elves that they make living into art kellen asked oh theres that idalia said shrugging but it also says they lie kellen turned to face her outraged i was surprised idalia said so i went to an older unexpurgated version the one in the locked case in fathers library there it says that elves never lie and never tell the truth not much better kellen muttered but then he thought about it never liedhe couldnt remember jermayan or any of the other elves hed met ever lying to him but told him the truth the whole truth the way he thought he wanted it as fast as he wanted it he had to admit he hadnt gotten that either and maybe still didnt have it even from jermayan who was his friend and teacher maybe fairer kellen said grudgingly not much though elves are different from humans idalia said very different they live much longer they have a different way of looking at the world than humans do i am not saying you shouldnt trust themyoud say id gone crazy and youd be right but dont expect them to think like humans because they just wont she stared off into nothing for a moment when you live as long as they do you take your time about everything and you wait for everything to come in its proper time so for instance an elf will never tell you the whole truth all at once hell wait for the right time to tell you bits of it until in the end youve come to see the shape of it for yourself which is the point for themthat you should come to see and understand a truth for yourself and not have to be told what it is now give that a lot of thought and youll begin to see how they live their entire lives why didnt you tell me all this when we first came here kellen asked curiously surely all this good advice would have been a lot more useful then idalia smiled crookedly you wouldnt have listened we werent going to a formal banquet then and you werent meeting the entire city population on moreorless equal terms oh theres jermayan and vestakia she pointed kellen turned spotting jermayan and vestakia coming up behind them jermayan was dressed pretty much as kellen wasthe long belted robe seemed to be a standard sort of evening fashionthough jermayans robe was practically transparent and so were both undertunics kellen felt his face get a little flushed not that jermayan didnt have the body for such an audacious outfit but still but vestakia there was no possible way to conceal the fact that she looked like a demon so tengitir had obviously decided to make a virtue of what could not be ignored her gown left her neck and shoulders bare and her deep rose skin sparkled as if it had been dusted with gold it probably had been in fact because there had been subtle patterns painted on her forehead in gold in imitation of some of the filigree diadems worn by some of the elven ladies her eyes had been accentuated with lines of black and gold on the lids making them look bigger and somehow more innocent a wide band of gold and red embroidery held her cherryblack hair away from her pointed ears exposing both them and her tiny golden horns and a band of the same material decorated the necklineif you could call it a necklineof her longsleeved dress holding in the folds of shimmering gold brocade that were gathered into a tightlypleated waist before sweeping out into a full skirt that was gathered up at the sides to reveal an underskirt the exact shade of her skin you look amazing kellen said vestakia smiled shyly ducking her head come on idalia said looking at him oddly ill escort vestakia around you and jermayan mingle is shei mean it would please me to know that vestakia is going to be all right kellen said catching himself just in time he barely avoided hitting jermayan with his rainshade but jermayan handled his own with as much grace as if it were a sword idalia will see to her comfort jermayan said and certainly no harm nor insult has come to her yet good kellen said about then his brain caught up with the rest of him and he realized why idalia and jermayan had gotten him away from vestakia so quickly hed been so stunned at the sight of her in that dress that hed just stared but now thinking back no no thinking not about that or anything like that not for a year hed sworn a vow of chastity and celibacy to shalkan in exchange for the unicorns help in getting away from armethalieh and the outlaw hunt and it didnt matter whether or not shalkan was his friend if kellen broke that vow shalkan would have no choice but to exact the penalty for breaking it and kellen didnt want to break his vow but vestakia no kellen tipped back his rainshadejermayan ducked gracefully out of the wayand took a deep breath of the cool moist air it had been easier when hed been sick and drugged a lot easier i need a great favor from you you have to explain for me jermayan kellen said though it was the last thing in the world he wanted to say you have to let her know why i cantspend as much time with her as i want to i dont want her to think im avoiding her although that was exactly what he was going to be doing at least for a while at least until he could get all this straightened out in his own mind maybe shalkan would have some good advice for himnot that hed be seeing shalkan here tonight of course unicorns were notoriously uninterested in the company of the nonchaste and even shalkans tolerance had limits i will jermayan promised and remembershe is not unfamiliar with the obligations a wildmage must undertake as for you you will be far too busy to worry about the matter after the council meeting tomorrow morning come to the house of sword and shield where we will continue your training that will be wait a minute council meeting theres a council meeting and im supposed to go without success kellen attempted to come up with a polite way to indicate he wanted to know more about that it would be most gratifying to hit you now jermayan he finally said the elven knight smiled you may attempt the exercise tomorrow afternoon in the morning i believe you will be accompanying idalia to advise andoreniel and ashaniel upon the best way to deal with the problem the elves almost never spoke the words shadow mountain or demon aloud as if to say them might be to summon the endarkenedand from the very little kellen knew of shadow magic that might even be true so he was going to the council meeting and jermayan was not idalia goes because shes a wildmage and i think shes the only wildmage anywhere around near here and i guess i go because im a knightmage kellen finally said tomorrow perhaps we may know if you are correct jermayan said but these are grim subjects for a night of celebration come and i will bring you to that which will lift your spirits they passed among the canopies and among the lanterns jermayan moved purposefully but not so swiftly that kellen did not have opportunities to appreciate the beauty that surrounded him there was probably no best time to see the garden like every work of the elves it was undoubtedly designed to present a different aspect at every hour and season and even at night and in the rain it caught and held kellens attention but the garden was not what jermayan had brought him to see in a corner of the gardennot quiet precisely because there was a rowdy game of chaseandcatch going on but secludedthere seemed to be a partywithinaparty going on children kellen said quietly stopping at the edge of the smaller garden the children of sentarshadeen jermayan agreed they were not alone of course there were other elves thereservants assuming the elves had servants companions older brothers and sisters perhaps even their parents kellen recognized sandalon and a moment later the young prince spotted him and came running over kellen he shouted happily the game stopped instantlykellen had the sense that the others had been entertaining sandalonand everyone looked at him oh this is awkward if dealing with adult elves could be embarrassing the potential problems in dealing with elven childrenfar more direct than their elderscould be mindboggling uh hi kellen said weve been waiting for you everybody wants to meet you this is alkandoran sandalon said pulling kellen firmly into the midst of the group hes nearly as old as you are kellen kellen found himself facetoface with a boy whoand he saw no reason to assume sandalon was mistakenmust be about his own age alkandoran was dressed in a tunic and leggings and sleeveless vest but without the long robe and belt of his elders he was willowy and slender androgynously pretty and almost painfully determined not to gawk at the human stranger i see you alkandoran kellen said bowing slightly he was pretty sure he knew just how alkandoran felt i see you kellen knightmage alkandoran said bowing in return and this is tredianala sandalon continued tredianala didnt just look uncomfortable she looked terrified as only the very shy could be in the presence of strangers she was much younger than alkandoranmaybe ten twelveand dressed in a kneelength tunic over full trousers kellen was reminded of some of the shyest otherfolk the ones you might share a forest with for years but never see i see you tredianala kellen said softly carefully not looking directly at her it pleases me to meet a friend of my friend i see you kellen knightmage another girl boldly said without waiting for sandalon to make the introduction i see you merisashendiel sandalon supplied cheerfully kellen turned toward the child feeling as much as seeing tredianala make her escape back behind the adults merisashendiel looked enough like tredianala to be her twin sisterthey were dressed in similar costumesbut there all resemblance ended merisashendiel regarded him with frank interest as if she was bursting with questions that she intended to ask then and there but she was enough older than sandalon to know better than to do that at least in front of strangers i see you merisashendiel kellen said bowing very low she giggled regarding him with speculative approval then swept into a full low curtsy watching him all the time kellen grinned that one was going to provide her parents with more than a few sleepless nights in a few years at least if elven ways were anything like human ones the byplay was entirely lost on sandalon of course and would be for some years yet and here is vendalton when kellen had first arrived in sentarshadeen hed found sandalon playing alone along the dry riverbed and ashaniel had said that sandalon was often lonely kellen had assumed at the time that that was because sandalon was the only child in sentarshadeen but it made just as much sense if these were all the children in sentarshadeen he wasnt all that good at judging the ages of elven children but vendalton seemed to be easily twice sandalons age a fiveyear difference in age might not matter later but it was a huge gap now i see you vendalton kellen said i see you kellen knightmage vendalton said sandalon said that you slew a something evil with the help of my friends i destroyed the barrier that was keeping the rain from falling on sentarshadeen kellen said choosing his words with care everyone helped and even so it was very hard it also could not have been done without the magic of my sister in which all of sentarshadeen participated so you see it was all of us together as a whole and not any one individual that broke the bonds of evil i was only the channel through which all of our effort flowed sandalon and vendalton stared hard at each other and kellen wondered what longrunning argument hed just resolvedor made worse jermayan cleared his throat significantly regarding sandalon but she cant talk sandalon protested nevertheless i am sure she will wish to meet kellen if her nurse will permit jermayan said gravely of course i shall jermayan a new voice said a woman stepped into the light holding a bundle in her arms she stopped a few feet away from kellen and set it down on the grass a lady a very young lady quite the most enchanting young lady kellen had ever seen in his life he fell instantly under her spell and went down on one knee to greet her properly adult elves were stunningly beautiful elven children had all their elders beauty plus the natural appeal of the young of any species the combination was enchanting and this is kalania jermayan said a smile in his voice kellen didnt know how old kalania was but it was obvious that walking was a skill she had only lately begun to master the tiny elven child regarded him out of grave dark eyes firmly clutching the hand of the slender woman dressed in rose velvet who knelt behind her come to me sweeting he coaxed you can do it in the city hed seen few childrenbut still far more than any of his peers had for kellen had spent as much of his time as he could on the streets of the low city the youngsters hed seen playing in the streets there had never known how much hed wished he could change his life for theirs now he wondered what it would be like to grow up in sentarshadeen with unicorns for playfellows he held out his hand to the baby kalania seemed to study him carefully before making up her mind she released her nurses hand and came staggering toward him her chubby arms flailing the other childreneven sandalonwatched in fascination as kalania made her uncertain way across the few feet of space toward kellen if she showed any sign of falling he was prepared to swoop her up before she did but she made it grabbing his outstretched hand in a surprisingly strong grip to steady herself oh well done bright heart kellen said scooping the baby up into his arms and getting to his feet kalania crowed with delight at the ride into the sky kellen crossed the little distance and returned her to her nurse knowing hed been given a great gift tonight jermayan had been right seeing the elven children had made him stop brooding after a few minutes morekellen found himself answering quite a number of artfully indirect notquestions about his journey to the barrier and about vestakiathey left the little garden again he was very careful to edit his answers too there were things that these children did not need to know it was enough to tell them that the man he had rescued vestakia from was trying to steal her goats and not any of the rest of it telling them that she was shalkans great and good friend now told them that no matter what she looked like she was not to be feared once they were away from the others he found jermayan regarding him curiously idalia told me you didnt know the old tongue i dont kellen said puzzled there were days when he felt that getting along in the common speech of the citywhich the elves now used as well was enough trouble he knew that there were other languages in the worldspoken over the sea and therefore anathema in the city probably there had once been other languages spoken on this side of the ocean as well before the great war had destroyed most of civilization the elves had probably learned the commonest human language in order to communicate with their allies and then never abandoned it yet you knew what kalanias name meant jermayan pointed out reasonably you called her bright heart kala means heart and ania means bright in the old tongue coincidence my nurse used to call me that kellen said uncomfortably only hed never had a nurse he remembered a nursequite a succession of them in factbut those memories were at least partially false implanted through magic by his father the archmage lycaelon to conceal the fact that hed been cared for as a child by his sister idalia banished from the city as a wildmage when kellen was six and whom lycaelon had not wanted kellen to remember but it was far too pleasant an evening to think of old troubles undoubtedly a coincidence jermayan said sounding unconvinced really kellen said if id suddenly developed the ability to understand old elvish id tell you jermayan said something liquid and incomprehensible kellen gazed at him expectantly i said that all elven names come from the old tongue jermayan kellen suddenly realized positively enjoyed making leading remarksof the sort that in any human society would cause the hearer to respond with a question and knowing perfectly well that kellens first impulse would be to ask that question i am almost sure i didnt need to find out what passes for a sense of humor among the elves i am very nearly certain that idalia knows what your name means and will tell me if i ask her kellen said with a wicked grin jermayan smiled faintly acknowledging that kellen had won this round it means strong shield he said a mayn is a shield and now i believe we are bidden to take our places for the banquet is about to begin suddenly kellen realized that for the last few minutes hed been hearing musica music that blended into the rainchimes and raindrums but music nonetheless he bowed elaborately to jermayan be my guide o elven knight chapter three the banquet in the garden of leaf and star calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink after jermayan and kellen left idalia tucked her arm reassuringly through vestakias and drew her firmly along beside her from what vestakia had told her about her childhood the poor girl probably had never seen so many people gathered together in one place in her entire life kellen certainly left us very quickly vestakia said id been hoping to talk to him she added wistfully maybe later idalia said she wondered how much to tell vestakia from the way kellen had looked at her when shed showed up in the festiveand very flatteringgown someone should and it was a good bet vestakia didnt know the details of kellens vow or possibly even that it existed well no time like the present and one advantage to escorting vestakia around was that it gave idalia rather more privacy than shed have otherwise while everyone in sentarshadeen knew that vestakia wouldnt be here at all if she were tainted she still looked like a demon and elven memories were long even if none of the elves now living had fought on the battlefields of the great war the fathers and grandfathers of many of those here tonight had you know that kellen is a wildmageas your mother was idalia began slowly and you know the price we pay for our magicthe vows and obligations we offer up to the gods oh blessed lady vestakia gasped stopping dead and clutching idalias arm hes not going to die no nonothing like that idalia said hastily remembering suddenly that idalias mother had given up twenty years of her lifespan in exchange for vestakias human spirit quickly she explained kellens obligationand the reason why kellen was able to spend so very much time in the company of a unicorn not many people know she finished most of the time it doesnt impinge to her surpriseand secret delightvestakia gave a great whoop of laughter startling the elves walking nearby oh oh my the girl said she sobered quickly glancing around then looked back at idalia does that mean ihe and iwont see each other at all i dont know idalia said honestly but if you dont see him try not to mind too much it wont be because he doesnt like you or care about you rather too much the reverse perhaps i know he wants you to be happy here he is very very concerned that you are comfortable with waterand hot water tooavailable for the turning of a handle and every kind of foodfruit toothere when i reach out my hand and such a warm soft bed that i dont think i shall ever be cold again how can he wonder vestakia asked in bafflement i think he is worried that the people may be unkind idalia said gently trying not to smile vestakia sniffed shaking her head it isnt important now that they know in their heads that i want to help and i know that eventually their hearts will understand yes they stareand point at me when they think i am not looking but no one will try to kill me here for what i am and there are goats here too i can herd them and milk them and make curds and cheese i can deliver a kid if the nanny has trouble i can be useful even beyond making sure that they do not come here the elves will see that too with time she smiled shyly you know and they surely know that you cannot lie to an animal they know when someone is good or bad sooner or later most people here will understand in their hearts and until then there are so many wonderful things to see and to doand not everyone turns and runs you know some talk to me and vestakias eyes grew wide and she lowered her voice as if about to confide a great wonder there are books here idalia oh hundreds of them i do not read very wellwe only had one or two that mama traded forbeyond her three books and those of course i could not readso i learned my letters out of them and memorized them long ago but with all the books here to practice on soon i shall read so much better than before vestakia was quite right about being able to make a place for herself in sentarshadeen idalia thought shed probably been a very good goatherd back in the lost landscalm cheerful and patient all qualities one needed when dealing with goats idalia tried to imagine one of the spoiled daughters of the city in vestakias situationwrenched away from everything she knew and dropped among a strange people who despised her no matter how luxurious the surroundings idalia knew that the armethaliehan girl would be weeping and complaining demanding that things be adjusted to her liking but vestakia had not complained once she sounded so happyand so determined to be happythat idalia kept her fears of the future to herself if war camewhen war camethere would be no room in it for the quiet gentle future vestakia spoke of so easily and yet and yet vestakia surely knew that too or guessed it at least she was the daughter of a demon she knew what the endarkened did and wanted so the quiet gentle future she was envisioning was one she must know could not last for long she and idalia were very much more alike than idalia had thought for vestakia was seizing her own chance for peace and joy while it was there and would live every moment that had been granted her to the fullest and when trouble came as it wouldwell idalia had the feeling that vestakia would meet it headon one thing about the evening did match kellens expectations of how a formal banquet would go and that was that he was seated at the same table as the king and queen idalia and jermayan were there as well and vestakia and sandalon with lairamo he was glad to see both vestakia and sandalon and surprised to see both of them together though sandalon was next to him and vestakia was at the far end of the table he supposed that andoreniel and ashaniel were making a point and vestakia deserved to be here as much as he and jermayan did sandalon was gleefully delighted to be among the adults and painfully conscious of his manners you wont go away again will you kelleni mean it would be interesting to know if you contemplated a journey soon wouldnt it he said looking up at lairamo for approval i dont know if ill have to go away again sandalon kellen said gently i hope i wont ill tell you as soon as i know i can promise that good the boy said i hope you wont have to go away either idalia was sad while you were gone she stayed in her house and wouldnt talk to anyone the banquet went on until quite late there were moreand more elaborate dishes offered than kellen had yet seen but fortunately he quickly realized he didnt have to try everything offered and stuck to the things he could identify or so he thought the elven love of illusion extended even to their culinary artsthe slice of venison in sauce he took turned out to be made of mushrooms and the roast goose was not fowl but fish still both were perfectly edible even delicious and a roast turnip could look like few other thingsthough he was a little surprised to find it had been hollowed out and stuffed with apple at one point kellen looked up to find vestakia gone and realized that she must have slipped out sometime after the main courses were servedat least he didnt see her again during the evening he wished he could do the same though the banquet was entertaining in an exotic fashion it was tiring and kellen couldnt help feeling that there were more important things to be doing than throwing a big party right now while he tried to keep from worrying about tomorrows council meeting he was a human not an elf and he didnt have their seeming ability to let tomorrow take care of itself and he did know what was proper good manners in this situation having checked with jermayan to make sure so despite the fact that hed rather have been out in the meadow with the unicornsdespite the rainor back in his own home he stayed at the banquet through the long dessert courseiced cakes candied fruits flavored ices custards and even xocalatldid his best to make polite conversation with dozens of people whose names he was sure he wouldnt remember in the morning and entertained himself with thinking how horrified his peers back in armethalieh would be if they could only see him now eventually the last round of fruit cordials had been poured and drunk fortunately there didnt seem to be very much alcohol at all in elven wines and cordials but since custom required everyone to change tables for every course of the dessertsand there were a lot of courseskellen was just about as confused as to just where in the garden he was as if hed been drinking strong armathaliehan ale but now the hour grows late and we do not wish to weary those whom we also honor ashaniel said rising gracefully to her feet and so we give grace to the night and to the season and bid you all fair rest and refreshment in the name of leaf and star at that signal the guests began to prepare to depart kellen was already on his feet he looked around but couldnt see jermayan or idalia anywhere it didnt matter he could catch up with idalia at home but when he reached the house once more idalia wasnt there no reason to wait up for her kellen told himself hanging up his cloak and shaking out his rainshade before setting it in its tray to finish drying shed probably stopped to talk to friends hed just make sure to leave a few lamps burning for her and make sure the stove had plenty of fuel all in all his first elven banquet hadnt been all that bad he decided folding his new finery neatly and climbing into bed since the rains had returnedwith a vengeancethe brooks and streams that crisscrossed sentarshadeen had refilled and in some cases done more than that it was not the ruinous flooding that could have occurred if the rains had been let to reach the elven lands unchecked but it could have been messy and inconvenient so the banks of some of the shallower tributaries had been shored up and reinforced since the work had been done by elves it had been done beautifully with walls of brick and stone and tile edging the rivulets until they took on much the look of canals whoever had been looking after jermayans house while he was gone was apparently someone with a lot of free time to make certain that jermayan never be inconvenienced by the flooding of his home this highly industrious individual had built the restraining walls especially high higher in fact than the footbridge to the front door which fitted as neatly into it as if they had always been meant to be together in one way that was a good thing because the little stream that flowed around the cottage was running very high however this conscientious person had not been particularly good at imagining what would happen if the stream actually did get that high because that little footbridge should have been raised along with the walls when he and idalia reached it jermayan cleared his throat uncomfortably regarding the bridge generally it is ah drier idalia suggested mischievously yes drier in the sense that the bridge is not quite so wet it would of course be drier if it were not raining idalia said agreeably watching the river foam over the planks of the bridge to be fair the bridge was not so very much underwater it would be churlish of me to expect an honored guest to ruin her dancing shoes because of my unruly stream jermayan said decisively he advanced upon idalia and swooped her up into his arms before she could protest idalia was not a small woman but shed felt in no danger of being dropped as jermayan carried her across the bridge and up the walk managing both their rainshades with elegant ease in fact it was a remarkably pleasant experience there was something significant in allowing someone else to take charge of her safety for once even in so small a thing as keeping her feet from being soaked as jermayan carried her over the stream she had the rather lightheaded sensation of crossing something more important than just a bit of running water the bridge was hung with pale blue lanterns and there were more at the door the ones at the door were in the shape of seashells a watery motif particularly suited to the weather and their surfaces were starred and speckled with flecks of green jermayan thrust the door open and set her down inside we arrive without incident he observed be welcome idalia in my home and at my hearth i am welcome idalia said removing her raincape and furling her rainshade and its quite dry and perhaps the stream will subside by morning though i do doubt it there is tea of course or if you prefer i might warm some cordial tea i think idalia said there has been quite enough cordial this evening jermayan went off to prepare the tea after setting his cloak aside the cottage was larger than the guesthouses and had a separate kitchen while he was gone she looked around it much resembled his home in ondoladeshiron where she had once been a frequent guest there were several familiar tapestries hung upon the walls and between them on small shelves exquisite pieces of elvenware meant for display and not for use a low table was pulled up to one of the long padded benches that lined the room it was heaped with booksboth conventional bound books and the older scrolls that some elves still preferred a xaqiue board with a halffinished game took up about half the table in an open case on the bench was jermayans harp it was a small instrument that could be held in the crook of one arm suitable for carrying into the field the wood was black with age and polished smooth by the caress of countless hands over the centuries and it was strung with silver an elven knight was expected to learn to master at least one of the gentler arts as well as those of war and warfare most chose something like carving mosaicsetting or gardening all things where beauty could be achieved in the laying out of mathematical designs according to established rules a slightly smaller number became musicians but were players rather than composers very few chose the more challenging realms of music composition poetry or the creative visual arts but jermayan being jermayan could never do anything by halves he had taken up and mastered several instruments the harp becoming his favoriteand he wrote music for it or at least he had done so when idalia had last known him she did not touch the harp herself for she was feeling unwontedly sensitive and was afraid she might pick up far more than she wanted or he intended if she did so instead she settled herself beside the fire to wait he came in with tea set out on a footed tray the ones like it in her home were of carved wood but this one was actually more practical if you were going to carry liquid about being made of sculpted metal with an inlay of glass mosaic she made a mental note to commission one like it but knew better than to admire itbecause jermayan would immediately try to give it to her instead when he put it down carefully between them and settled himself she poured tea for both of them and nodded toward the harp id been wondering if you still played shed said in order to keep the stillness from deepening into the uncomfortable i was hoping nothing had happened to make you lose interest then she smiled or worse decide that the harp wasnt challenging enough and move on to the pandehorn ah the ill woodwind that never blows good he replied with a rare chuckle no indeed i have found a great deal of comfort in music and i have continued to compose as well and without waiting for her to ask he set down his tea and reached for the harp and began to play it was not a piece with which she was familiar and within moments she fell under the spell of it if this was one of jermayans own works he had improved out of all expectation as a composer and he had been good to begin with but it was not a comfortable piece nor could it be described as pretty though it was so very powerful that before long idalia had found her eyes stinging with unshed tears it was full of a deep sadness and inarticulate longing there was a sense of things left unfinished not because they had been abandoned willingly but because abandonment had been forced even the ending cried out with emptiness that yearned to be filled idalia swallowed down the lump in her throat and said thickly its very beautiful jermayan set the harp aside and replied almost casually i wrote it about you and for you after you left ondoladeshiron but then before she could manage to stammer anything in reply to that astonishing statement he turned and the gentle smile he graced her with took her breath away i shall have to write something happier now the next thing kellen knew was that someone was shaking him and watery morning light was streaming through his windows sometimes i think youd sleep through a unicorn stampede wake up slugabed idalia groggily kellen sat up and stared at his sister she was still wearing the dress shed worn last night hadnt she been home council meeting in less than an hour youve barely got time to get up and dressedand ive got to change too kellen abandoned the question of where idalia had spent the night in favor of more pressing issues he really didnt want to go to the meeting why do i he began but idalia seeing him awake was already leaving the room if he wanted to argue his point kellen realized he was going to have to be up and dressed to do it he flung back the covers shuddering at the chill of the air and grabbed for his bedrobe wrapping it firmly around himand wondering where his house boots had gotten to this timehe hurried over to the clothespress grabbing the first things that came to handit really didnt matter much since all his elven clothing was suitable and becominghe dressed quickly dragged a comb through his now almost shoulderlength hair thankful that hed taken the time to unbraid it last night before going to bed and hurried into the outer room boots in hand when he came out of the bathroom idalia was ready she was wearing elven clothing today instead of her usual wildwood buckskins boots and tunic and a kneelength coat in several shades of violet ready good she said but i havent had breakfast kellen complained then you should have gotten up earlier idalia said implacably and i dont really see why i have to go at all kellen added mutinously i dont know anything about whatever the council is going to talk about then its time you learned idalia said reaching into the cupboard and handing him a chunk of yellow cheese a small loaf of bread and an apple the council will be discussing its plans attending meetings like this is something knightmages do so youd better get used to it besides you might even be helpful she reached up and patted him on the shoulder kellen made a rude noise and bit into the cheese since he could hardly say he wasnt a knightmage he supposed hed better go along to the council meeting at least the afternoon promised to be more interesting hed be meeting jermayan for his first formal lessons in knightly practice then jermayan had taught kellen all he could on the way to the barrier and the fact that kellens wildmage gifts lay in that direction helped a great deal but that was no substitute for training and practicea lot of practiceunder conditions that jermayan simply hadnt been able to reproduce on the trail kellen was looking forward to continuing his education and meanwhile he guessed he was pretty sure he knew where idalia had been last night and he was happy for both her and jermayan he just hoped that neither one of them would start quoting poetry at him one concession that had been made to the eternal rain was that a slatted wooden pathway had now been laid across the meadow to the door of the house so that one arrived on the doorstep if not quite dryshod at least not covered in mud just as on the previous occasion on which kellen had been brought to a meeting of the council he and idalia were met on the doorstep and conducted deep within the house to a windowless circular chamber deep within the center of the palace hanging from its walls were thirteen narrow banners of brightly colored silk each bearing a single elaborate symbol worked upon it in shining silver the last time theyd been a complete mystery to kellen but he knew a little more about the elves now nine for the nine cities probably but that leaves four that one symbol almost looks like the great seal of armethalieh could the other four be for the other races men centaurs and but that doesnt work either because there are more other races than four arent there fauns and selkies and dryads and unicorns and despite idalias insistence that they were going to be late she and kellen had been the first to arrive now his musings were interrupted by the arrival of the others ashaniel and andoreniel morusil ainalundore tyendimarquen and two others hed met and learned the names of the night before dargainon and sorvare six of the seven elves took their seats around the large round table of gleaming pale woodtyendimarquen remained standing in the tables center the inlay of the symbol of the royal house gleamed as brightly as if it were aflame reflecting the illumination of the mirrored lamps which hung above it though kellen and idalia were by far the most plainlydressed of the group kellen found he felt no sense of awkwardness and idalia obviously felt perfectly at ease he supposed that though the elves could make someone feel uncomfortable and outofplace if they chose they obviously werent choosing to do so on this occasion or perhaps what he was wearing was perfectly suitable for the situation as before the doors swung shut behind them seemingly of their own volition and tyendimarquen slid several bolts into place locking it securely as she slid the last of the bolts home andoreniel raised his hand and sketched a small shape in the air and once again kellen felt a brief sense of pressure as the room was magically sealed against all manner of intrusion and eavesdropping both magical and mundane now we may begin andoreniel said when tyendimarquen had taken her seat we call this meeting to discuss what provision we have made thus far in dealing with the enemy and what provision we have yet to make ainalundore was the first to speak he rose gracefully to his feetas if the elves ever did anything awkwardlyand began to speak in measured tones kellen discovered that a report on the drought had been sent to the viceroys of the other eight elven cities ondoladeshiron lerkalpoldara windalorianan deskethomaynel thultafoniseen valwendigorean realthataladon and ysterialpoerin to explain that it had been discovered to be the work of the enemy a further report had been sent when the barrier had fallen explaining that with the destruction of the enemys first ploy further attacks could be expected response from the other cities according to ainalundore had been gratifying andoreniel could be assured of their vigilance and could expect regular reports thats it kellen thought in disbelief thats all shadow mountain is waking up againthe biggest threat in a thousand yearsand all the elves are going to do about it is wrlte reports dargainon was next to speak and before he did so he glanced aside at kellen and idalia particularly at kellen the enemy is longlived as are we it is my assumption which i know is shared by others on this council that as this last attack upon sentarshadeen was a subtle one long in the planning and execution so is the next move in this campaign likely to be the enemy has learned from his mistakes we believe that he is unlikely to make any sudden or overt attacks rather this war is likely to be a slow and drawnout campaign of attrition this would have had a great likelihood of success had it not been for the efforts of idalia wildmage we probably would not have known it for an attack until it was too late he bowed a little to idalia who in her turn bowed back nevertheless there are other considerations we cannot be sure of what the next move may be it has been suggested since idalia wildmage is unable to advise us from what direction the next attack of the enemy may come nor are the woman vestakias abilities reliable in that regard it is an important consideration to look to the safety of our children therefore a plan is presented for the approval of the council to secure their safety by conveying all of our children to the crowned horns of the moon kellen looked questioningly at idalia a fortress high in the mystral mountains that was never taken during the war a good choice she said in an undertone a good choice it might be but that hardly prevented a number of comments from being made on it even though kellen got the impression that this was old business that had been hashed out pretty thoroughly before the council met today at last it was decided by andoreniel that the plan would go forward as it stood convoys from each of the nine cities would begin stocking the fortress immediately in a few weeks once winter had made travel in the higher elevations a bit dryer parties of elven knights would begin taking groups of children to the fortress a few at a time where they would remain with their protectors and guardians until the situation with the enemy had changed or until theyve all grown up kellen thought wryly he didnt know how long that would take but if demons were immortal and elves were very longlived neither side might be in a real hurry about going to war inevitable as it might seem sandalon of course being the heir would be the greatest prize for any enemy to capture and for that reason the young prince would be sent at some point in the middle of this migrationas neither the first nor the lastto avoid drawing attention to him hell hate that kellen thought ruefully but maybe among all those kids from the other cities hell find some his own age to play with he hoped something like that would happen for the boys sake and he was just as glad not to be the one to have to tell sandalon he was being sent away from the people and things hed known all his life let it be done andoreniel said ending the discussion and now ashaniel said sounding almost reluctant there is the matter of the others if the enemy walks again in the end its foe is all the children of the light not merely the children of leaf and star there was a moment of silence around the council table certainly they must be told tyendimarquen said unwillingly yet to waste good counsel on those who would not believe it when such telling might make matters worse is the action of a fool the high hills will listen idalia said they too have felt some of the effect of the barrier and its fall you still trade with the high hills after all and as for the otherfolk the creatures of forest and woodlandthe unicorns can carry your warning there and be believed tyendimarquen seemed relieved yes there is a good solution idalia we will warn the high hills and the other folk and let both of them spread the warning as they will the out islands may well listen said ashaniel thoughtfully let the unicorns also take word to the people of the water for the merfolk and the out islanders are allies still but what about armethalieh kellen said asking the question before he could stop himself i mean the mountain traders dont trade with armethalieh not directly and not at this season they wont pass a warning on or if they do the city wont believe it the city needs to be warned about the endarkened there was another long moment of silence as all the elves looked at each other seeming to share a moment of unspoken communication surely it would grieve us to see any of the children of the light fall to the great enemy even those who inhabit the golden city kellen knightmage sorvare said slowly but as one who has lately lived within her walls you more than most will understand that it is no light matter for one of the children of leaf and star to attempt to carry a warning there perhaps such a warning would be believed perhapsand you may search your own heart for the truth of my conjectureit would be seen as a form of attack and gain us instead of an ally a new enemy at a time when we can ill afford one and so i must counsel caution in any attempt to deal with armethalieh directly lest intended good become unimagined harm it is not impossible that we will find an ally of the proper sort to carry our message to armethalieh kellen morusil added kindly perhaps an out island captain for instance but neither you nor idalia can return there under pain of death and our kind is now similarly barred from setting foot upon city lands still knowing the enemys ways we will do what we can the proper sort being human kellen thought in dismayed realization both morusil and sorvare were rightneither he nor idalia could act as the elves envoy and if the elves couldnt go themselves what did that leave and if the high mages saw the elves warning not as a help but as an attack he couldnt fault their logic but all the same his mind did go back to the words the demon had taunted him with back at the barrier that when war came the elves would look to their own first wasnt that just what they were doing now and if someone did manage to warn armethalieh now would it do any good was there anyone who would be believed the meeting ended with plans having been made to remove the elven children to the fortress of the crowned horns and to send a messagesoonto those lands bordering on those of the elves that shadow mountain was once more spreading its blight across the face of the land once more andoreniel dismissed the seal that sequestered the council chamber and the elves departed to their tasks ashaniel stopped kellen as he was about to leave perhaps you do not think we act with sufficient haste kellen knightmage ashaniel suggested placing her hand upon his arm kellen glanced wildly around for idalia trying to locate her without seeming rude but she was nowhere to be seen lady ashaniel im really sorry if i offended anybody today kellen said its just that i he tried to think of how to phrase his thought politely and gave up if theres going to be a war we should be preparing for it thats all yet to say what form our preparations must take when the enemy has not yet declared the shape of his own intention might be to doom us all ashaniel said gently we have met the enemy upon the battlefield twice before and by the grace of leaf and star we prevailed fear not for your friends they will be warned in good time she turned away theyre not my friends kellen thought with a sigh he couldnt think of one person back in armethalieh that he could reasonably call a friend but that hardly meant he wanted the city to fall to a demon attack there were hundreds thousands of perfectly innocent people there people who were harming no one leading contented lives trying to be good to each other and if they were unreasonably prejudiced about outsiders well those prejudices had been carefully taught and carefully nurtured he left the council chamber an elf was waiting for him in the hallway to conduct him back down the labyrinth of passageways that led to the front door of the house of leaf and star kellen was fairly good at not getting lost but he was glad of the guide he was willing to bet that he hadnt taken the same route to or from the council chamber twice idalia was waiting for him on the portico ready to head over to the house of sword and shield you look like you could stand to hit something she said kellen groaned faintly ashaniel was just telling me not to worry because the elves have everything under control and the moment they make a move the elves will make the appropriate response but what if its something else like the barrier they already know that they are a threat and out there why dont they just gather up the biggest army they can and go get them idalia pulled up the hood of her raincape and stepped off the portico unfurling her rainshade as she did kellen followed copying her gestures for a minute or two they walked down the wooden path through the rain in silence those are reasonable questions considering how little you actually know about the enemyand the elves dont really know all that much more for instance they dont really know how strong the enemy is either in terms of numbers or magicbut they do know that if they can call in as many allies and slaves as they could in the last war they can probably put a larger army into the field than the nine cities can and this time the elves cant count on having much in the way of human allies next the elves dont have any magic while the enemy are the strongest mages there are im not even sure that if we got all the wildmages and all the high mages and all the good otherfolk to work together thered be as much magic on our side as there is on the enemy side not after the great war and the death of the dragons thats comfortingi dont think kellen said uneasily especially since the high mages wont fight on the same side as wildmages or elves idalia shrugged they might eventually but it doesnt really matter because you cant attack what you cant find and no ones exactly sure where shadow mountain is it might not even be entirely in this world north of here thats all i know thats all anyone knows and wellenough shielded that all the seeking spells in the world arent going to find it so we cant find the enemy stronghold and if we could find it we dont have the strength to attack it and win so what are we going to do kellen asked what ashaniel said wait and hope idalia said i know it sounds like a recipe for disaster but the elves have fought the enemy before and won and once we see what they are going to do we might be able to think of something creative now she smiled a little that is one of the strongest weapons we have actually no creature of the enemy can match our creativity and imagination the ancient saying is the endarkened cannot make they can only mar no matter what else has happened to the endarkened i doubt that has changed the world without sun was changeless and eternal not for its inhabitants the ceaseless erosion and decay of the seasons of the bright world theirs was a world of stone and darkness utterly suited to their nature the endarkened did not change let the elves dwindle and fade becoming a mockery of what they once were let the humans pass from savagery to senescence without ever reaching true civilization the endarkened would remain just as they had been at the moment that he who is had first created them an unchanging tribute to his foresight and wisdom and in the end they would triumph because of their unchanging nature because in all the millennia of their existence they had never forgotten that they had one goal and one goal only the utter destruction of all who walked in the light upon her risingfor though adult endarkened did not sleep they regularly entered a sort of deep trancequeen savilla summoned her slaves and as they groomed her she heard as was her custom the petitions of the grooming chamber these were usuallythough not alwaystrivial matters of a personal nature suited to the surroundings but today though she was careful to give no sign of it to her courtiers and attendants her thoughts were not upon the endless details of her court but elsewhere for the news from the bright world was good things were going especially well in armethalieh conditions were deteriorating in the city even as her human agent moved upward in influence and position and soonvery soon as the endarkened reckoned thingshe would be in a position to influence if not dictate policy on the high council itself then she could move on to the next step in her plans to bring the golden city over to the endarkened side its resources intact its people ripe to feed the endarkened need for ever more power savilla smiled inwardly in a thousand generations of the endarkened such an audacious coup had never been attempted the single largest enclave of humans in the land an inexhaustible supply of power slaves and foodallying itself with the endarkened willingly because they would have convinced themselves that all the rest of the brightworlders were their implacable foes and only the endarkenedthe poor misunderstood endarkenedcould save them with armethalieh as their vassal the endarkened would be invincible and all it would require would be the subjugation of the high councila handful of foolish humans the high council had turned everyone else in the golden city into witless sheep long ago the armethaliehans would do whatever their magemasters told them to and ask no questions once the business of the grooming chamber had been dealt with savilla dismissed her attendants and headed for her stone garden a lovely private monument to her past triumphs in the endarkeneds greatest art that of torture the stone garden belonged to her alone and her subjects knew that she was never to be disturbed there but today was different prince zyperis stood at the gateway to the garden obviously waiting for her i wondered if i might walk with you today he said deferentially furling his great scarlet wings tight to his body submissively of course savilla said graciously so her son and lover wanted something did he she was not entirely displeased it was the way of their kind he was a promising youngster but the greater the promise the greater the threat she offered him her arm he took it and the two of them passed into the garden for a while zyperis made idle conversation speaking with knowledgeable pleasure about the history of her trophies for he had been present at the collection of some of them within each colored crystal savilla had trapped some moment of agony of one of her special victims so that she could treasure it forever as she and zyperis strolled along the paths where nothing grew she would stop occasionally to waken a stone into life with a touch of her power here the death of the last of the bearwards they had been formidable enemies to many of uralesses slaveraces strong as giants and utterly committed to the light their inroads had weakened uralesse to the point where it had been possible for her to destroy him and take the shadow throne yet flay them of their bearskins strip them of their magic and they were as weak and vulnerable as any human she had killed his mate and his cubs before his eyes savoring their blended agony there the death of a nest of firesprites they were difficult to torture it had required all her creativity but water or better yet ice oh yes that had served her very well the minds and souls represented here were long expended gone to fuel her magic but the trophies of her past triumphs remained zyperis was silent for some time conscious of the honor of being invited into savillas private garden but at last as she had known he would he raised the true reason for his visit how goes the war my sweet crown of pain i know the destruction of the barrier was only the merest and most minor of setbacks but since the moment when it fell you have told me nothing he said pouting prettily i languish in ignorance that only you can remove you will be pleased savilla said allowing her long ivory fangs to gleam in a smile of pleasure our agent in armethalieh rises higher in the confidence of the archmage and will soon gain a seat on the high council itself from there it should be a simple task for him to convince lycaelon and the rest that we are not the true enemy and that someone elseit hardly matters whohas misled them all these centuries for his own fell purposes i suspect they will pounce upon some longdead archmage whose progeny they wish to discredit as the source of their misinformation and proceed to purge their own histories of anything they believe to be tainted by his hand and thoughts zyperis preened with delight then they shallso they thinkbecome our allies when in fact they will become our slaves i have an idea my liegemother you must convince them that there is a vast conspiracy of wildmages ready to destroy their city allied with the elves they already loathe both the elves and the wild magic and the archmage will not soon forget that his own son was banished for dabbling in it the combination should drive them absolutely wild that way we can save them from the two things they hate and fear the most elves and wildmages i do not think my agent will find that very difficult savilla said reluctant approval in her voice it was a good ideaa clever ideaone more proof if she needed it that inevitably zyperis would someday make a try for the shadow throne so the longer she could keep him offbalance uncertain of his ability the longer it would take for that day to come but it will take time to get him onto the council and time for him to eliminate his rivals she said as if the idea had just occurred to her until his position is secure we have to keep the elves securely occupied with their own problems we must keep them from managing to warn armethalieh how do you propose to do that she stopped strolling and gazed demandingly into his eyes zyperiss wings unfurled and drooped slightly and savilla felt a hot spark of triumph obviously the boy hadnt thought that far ahead we could carry off their messengers he suggested doubtfully but we dont want to act openly yet savilla said and direct opposition only strengthens the foes will to resist no the elves have no real interest in warning armethalieh so we will make it easy for them to avoid it we will provide a diversion that will occupy all their energy the sacrifice of a pawn oh dont tease me so zyperis begged youve had a plan all alongyou know you have tell me what it is no savilla said archly i dont think i shall you have not yet impressed me with your sufficiently sincere desire to know the house of shield and sword was located on the southern edge of the city from his rambles with sandalon kellen had gotten the impression he knew the city fairly well but somehow this was one of the places that had never been included on their walks it was out beyond the firing kilns separated from the city proper by a dense plantation of balsambough trees there was no pathway through the forest nothing to indicate that anything lay beyond the evergreens but more woodland if idalia had not been with him kellen might well have turned back at the forests edge here you are idalia said stopping at the far side of the trees think you can find your way from here i oh a whole pocket canyon spread out before him its floor rich with tall grass the forest he realized had been plantedand carefully tendedto screen its opening horses grazed loose in the meadow their coats shiny with rain about halfway down the canyon floor was the house of sword and shield like all elven architecture it blended in to its surroundings so harmoniously it seemed to have grown there instead of being built unlike the house of leaf and star it was all of simple golden stone except for the roof one story and with the highpeaked roof making it look even lower and wider why is it out here in the middle of nowhere kellen asked youll have to ask jermayan idalia said amused i think hes coming now she pointed a rider was coming toward them jermayan and valdien today the elven knight wore no armor at all merely a simple tunic and leggings in green beneath his raincape with soft boots to match and valdien wore only a simple halter elf and destrier moved as one being and kellen wondered absently if he could learn to ride a horse and if he could ever manage to equal jermayans easy grace the student approaches jermayan observed i promise idalia that he will be returned to you reasonably unscathed oh dont bother on my account idalia said cheerfully as the book of stars tells us there is nothing worth knowing that is not bought without effort or pain ill see you later she turned away walking back through the pines jermayan dismounted from valdien and slipped the halter from valdiens head come jermayan said to kellen beginning to walk back toward the house of sword and shield it is time for your proper training to begin valdien followed kellen and jermayan like a hopeful pet occasionally nudging jermayan in the back kellen felt a flutter of nervousness at the pit of his stomach it wasnt that he doubted his own skillhe didnt he was a knightmage after all but all of his experience with formal training of any kind had been disastrous and all of a sudden he was afraid that this was going to turn out the same way jermayan he said stopping his friend looked at him questioningly im well im not very good at some things kellen said awkwardly that said jermayan is why you are here the house of sword and shield has trained knightmages in the past the house remembers but i there just wasnt any good way to say this i dont want to make trouble or get into trouble i just dont i asked the council a question this morning he admitted dolefully that surprised a startled laugh from jermayan no doubt certain members of the council were surprised by your boldness and were instantly forthcoming he commented not really kellen said with a sigh but to allay your fears there will be times within the house when questions will be encouraged for war manners are taught here along with all the other arts of war you will learn all that we can teach you my word on that kellen by now they had reached the doors of the house jermayan turned to valdien and dismissed the stallion firmly with a pat on the shoulder the stallion lingered for a moment for all the world as if hoping to be invited inside then turned and trotted off with a reluctant sigh kellen realized that the building was taller than hed thought the height of the indoor riding rings back in armethalieh the doors added to that impression they were tall enough to admit two mounted knights riding sidebyside but they were not constructed like the doors back home these seemed designed to fold back in four panels rather than just open jermayan opened one tall narrow panel and the two of them stepped inside be welcome in the house of sword and shield home to all who bear the sword for the nine cities jermayan said formally kellen looked around the first thing that caught his attention was the ring of steel on steel in the center of the room four armored knights whirled and danced around one another swords flashing in a deadly pattern of light and motion kellen studied them his attention caught were three attacking the one was it two against two it was impossible for him to tell they moved so fast then a fifth man unarmored wearing dark green robes his hair the silverblue of great age walked into the midst of them all four immediately put up their swords the man began talking too low for kellen to hear belesharon is one of our greatest teachers of the sword jermayan said quietly his father once trained a knightmage he looks forward to meeting you kellen blinked slowly reasoning it out if belesharons father had trained a knightmage that meant that belesharons father had fought in the great war since that was the last time thered been any knightmages he looked away from the armored knights unwilling to draw belesharons attention to him any earlier than he had to although if he could actually ask belesharon questions kellen looked around as he pulled off his sopping raincape and hung it next to jermayans on one of the row of hooks beside the door having seen on the night of the banquet how few elven children there were he didnt expect this place to be actually crowded even if as jermayan implied all the elven knights from all the nine cities were trained here so he wasnt terribly surprised but if were going to war and this is all we can put into the field including the four in armor there were about twenty knights in the room some of them to kellens vague surprise seemed to be female though he supposed there was no reason they shouldnt be he didnt really know enough about the way elves did things to know whether they cared about things like that or not armethalieh certainly did but the way armethalieh did things wasnt the way kellen wanted to run his life none of the other groups of elves were in armor they were all dressed just as jermayan wasloose tunics pants and soft boots though the colors varied from pale green to deep yellow to red the ones in pale green were sitting in a corner apparently listening to a lecturekellen recognized alkandoran in that group pale green for the youngest students then those in yellow were practicing simple forms and stancesas kellen remembered doing a few times himselfwith wooden practice blades under the guidance of a few of the redtunicd students the few remaining redtunics were sparring against each other also with wooden swords under the watchful eyes of other elven knights all of whom seemed to be wearing some shade of darker green though none was wearing quite the same shade that belesharon was kellen already knew that the elves could distinguish a much wider range of colors than humans could and he imagined all those colors meant something very particular he only hoped he wouldnt be expected to be able to tell what it washe suspected that in comparison to the elves humans were practically colorblind kellen turned his attention from the students to the building itself the interior was the largest single room hed ever seen the ceiling was highthe building was actually closer to two stories in height than oneand a gallery ran around three walls of the room with open stone staircases leading up to them on the two long sides of the building long windows without glass pierced the walls at regular intervals they could be closed with heavy wooden shutters but today the shutters were folded back despite that kellen wasnt in the least cold and after a moment he realized why heat radiated up through the brick floor of the room a gentle pervasive warmth that filled the air there is a furnace in the chamber below this that heats a network of pipes that warms the floor it is one of the apprentices duties to keep it stokeda duty that you will be spared jermayan said with a faint smile kellen grinned back hed chopped enough wood in the wildwood not to be afraid of chopping more it is a marvelous thing he said teasingly to have seen the elven armies in their flower you think we are few jermayan said shrewdly but most are in the field and winterespecially this winteris not a time when you will see the house heavily frequented you worry too much kellen you worry too little kellen said stung to sudden honesty you didnt see herthe demon queenyou didnt talk to her the endarkened mean to kill you all and you sit here worrying about your clothes and the proper time to let everybody else know theyve got a problem then teach us to worry jermayan said gently and meanwhile hone the skills you will need when the battle comes as we both know it must and learn what i could not teach you alone he took kellens arm and led him out of the entryway onto the stone floor of the hall belesharon had concluded his instructions to the armored knights and turned to face jermayan i see you jermayan he said bowing i see you belesharon jermayan said bowing in return i bring you kellen knightmage who comes from the lands of men to learn what you can teach him i see you kellen knightmage belesharon said he did not bow but studied kellen with cold black eyes whats going on but this wasnt the time to wonder about it kellen bowed deeply i see you belesharon he rose from his bow and studied the elven swordmaster in return hed thought morusil was old and until this moment morusil had been the oldest elf kellen had ever seen but next to belesharon morusil was a mere child up close belesharons bonepale skin was spiderwebbed with the fine lines of age his eyebrows nearly white perhaps elves had run shorter centuries ago or perhaps age had shrunk him belesharon was as small as a child making kellen feel lumpish and ungainly as he had not since his days in armethalieh but no matter how old he was there was nothing of infirmity about the ancient swordmaster his eyes sparkled with alert intelligence and his movementsas kellen had seen previouslywere lithe and swift well belesharon said after a moment staring gains only so much bring practice swords ciradhel one of the greentunicd teachers hurried off i dont understand kellen said always a safe enough statement when dealing with elves belesharon snorted when one undertakes to teach a student young kellen one begins by judging his quality we will spar you will attempt to strike me holding nothing back if you fail in this i will know and you will no longer be welcome in my house but kellen glanced at jermayan with indecision bordering on agony but jermayans face was unreadable he remembered facing jermayan at their streambed camp and nearly killing his mentor and friend by accident simply because neither of them had been prepared for the scope of kellens newlyawakened knightmage powers and kellen still didnt know their full extent if jermayan had expected this he would have warned kellenif that was allowed by the strict rules of etiquette that governed every aspect of elven daily life kellen bit his lip thinking very hard he did not doubt for a minute that belesharon was speaking the simple truth but killingor injuringthe master wouldnt be a very good start either he bowed master belesharon the fool speaks come take your weapon and face me choose either ciradhel had returned carrying two practice swords similar to the ones hed seen the yellowgarbed students working out with they were the length and shape of kellens own sword but made entirely of wood but even a length of wood could be deadly in the hands of a knightmage kellen bowed again if you like i am a fool and you have trained fools and children for a very long time so you will understand when i say that there is a saying among my people that nothing is foolproof because fools have too much ingenuity i do not wish to hurt you he waited holding his breath now belesharon bowed his eyes twinkling with amusement such courtesy such respect for age you rascals would do well to heed it and have more consideration for an old man who is nearly on his deathbed young kellen your honesty and thoughtfulness do you credit and i honor the truth of your words therefore our contest will be closely watched and if i am in danger my students will intervene you however must look to yourself kellen bowed again and reluctantly took the sword that ciradhel held out to him hed hoped to avoid the match altogether but it was a good compromise he hoped belesharon took up his own practice sword and strode to a practice circle marked out on the stone floor kellen recognized the dimensions as being equal to the ones jermayan had marked out on the ground when his training was just beginning the rules were simple stay inside the circle at all costs for a moment kellen considered simply letting belesharon push him outside the circle then dismissed the notion if he didnt do his best the swordmaster would know he had no doubt of that the only thing he could do was to pull his blows as much as possible surely thered be no objection to that reluctantly he took his own place in the circle the four armored knights swords drawn took their places just outside it they didnt seem at all worried jermayan was the only one who seemed concernedbut then jermayan was the only one whod seen him fight kellen realized with resigned dismay that all other activity in the hall had stopped everyone was watching grand either i end up looking like an uncouth barbarian or else i do something like i did to jermayan and either way im in trouble now we shall begin your education belesharon said he raised the wooden practice sword in a fluid salute kellen copied the gesture at the same time summoning up his spellsight at once there were two separate belesharons the living man overlaid with a web of glowing red showing kellen how he must strike and a glowing ghost indicating how belesharon might move thats never happened befo whack kellen yelped and jumped back jarred entirely out of battledmind in time to see belesharon step back into ready position there was a stinging welt on his upper thigh too slow knightmage the swordmaster commented mildly perhaps you still think to spare my old bones not any more old man resolving to ignore the peculiar doubling of his spellsight kellen summoned it once again no matter what else it showed him it still showed him where to hit this time he struck without warningthe match was already begun after allbut somehow instead of a clean hit he missed entirely belesharon swayed out of the way at the last moment kellen paid no attention moving on to the next target and the next but instead of one clear possibility his spellsight showed him a dozen forcing him to think to choose forcing him out of battlemind forcing him to be only kellen each time he summoned it anew only to have it stolen away again he realized as the match wore on that belesharon could have hit him a dozen times he realized everyone in the hall knew it too the best hed been able to manage had been to stay in the circle he began to feel a dull desperate anger im better than this i have to be because if he couldnt be good enough people were going to die focus he fed his anger into his magic making it his tool the enemys confidence was also a weapon he could use once more he summoned up his spellsight once again the patterns before his eyes were as confusing as before kellen ignored them he reached beyond them to their source to the gods that made the patterns the gods who sent both knightmage and wildmage into the world and struck there was a gasp and a hiss of steel from outside the practice ring kellen realized he had closed his eyes he opened them his wooden blade was pressed against belesharons ribs the swordmasters blade rested gently against the side of his neck the swordmaster withdrew his practice blade kellen stepped back shakily lowering his own blade he only hoped he hadnt struck very hard a most instructive bout young kellen belesharon said bowing with no evidence of discomfort of course you would have been dead as well but i think time and practice will remedy that defect and now if you will be so good as to don your armor we shall see how you fare against multiple attackers belesharon handed his sword to the nearest master and turned to go kellen barely remembered in time to bow he felt as if hed been running for several leagues uphill carrying shalkan this way jermayan stepped into the circle and led him out through the gathered crowd half of them were staring at him as if he were a demon incarnate and the other half were talking among themselves in excited whispers too low for him to catch how did i do what did i do kellen asked when they were away from the others i mean never mind jermayan said waving away kellens apologies i am merely grateful to have seen such an exhibition of technique and you hit master belesharon i didnt mean to kellen said i mean i did but jermayan slid open a panel in the back wall and ushered kellen inside the room was much smaller than the one outside its walls of wood not stone shallowly carved in an intricate geometric pattern a moment later kellen realized why as jermayan went over to a part of the wall and pulled it out revealing it to be a drawer here is your armor and sword jermayan said lifting out the familiar pieces and handing them to kellen here what if i hadnt passed belesharons test arms full kellen headed toward one of the benches in the center of the room if it had somehow happened that you were not found suitable for the house of sword and shield it would simply have been returned to your home but you will find it is easier to keep it here during your training kellen began removing his clothes surprised to find they were sodden with sweat i hope i didnt hurt him he said pulling on the leather underpadding for his armor jermayan had opened another drawer and was removing his own armor he stopped and looked at kellen quizzically you have no cause for concern but it was startling chapter four in training at the house of sword and shield calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink when both of them were armored they returned to the main hall everyone ignored him so thoroughly that kellen thought hed rather have been stared at the story of the bout was probably going to be all over sentarshadeen by nightfallin fact given the elves penchant for gossip it was probably already making the rounds jermayan led kellen back to the teaching circle where belesharon was waiting with the four armored knights belesharon glanced up when he saw them and his face crumpled into an almost comical frown of disapproval this armor is a disgrace to the house of sword and shield belesharon said i see no enamelwork no gilding no jewels it is the armor of a brigand or a hill bandit not a knight jermayan had said that direct speech even questions were permitted in the house of shield and sword but this was rude speech even for a human and once again it seemed to kellen that the elves were obsessed with something that didnt matter it was true that his armor wasnt as ornate as jermayans but it was still beautiful in its own way forgive him master belesharon but it is the only armor he possesses it was made in a day and there was no time to finish it properly jermayan said then let another suit be made one more suitable belesharon said irritably kellen winced inwardly jermayan looked great in gleaming sapphirecolored armor that looked like expensive jewelry but he didnt think he would suitable perhaps for an elven knight master belesharon kellen said but i am human my people are simple as am please forgive my presumption but as elvenware is simple yet a perfect blend of form and function it seems to me that for a human and for me in particular there should be no more adornments than there are upon a perfect bowl i ammy people call it a virgin knight one who is untested in battle if one wears the map of ones experiences upon the metal he is clad in then mine should be unadorned andforgive me again but i have an emotional attachment to speak of as well this is the armor i was wearing when i found out i was a knightmage i should like to keep it just as it is the human child is bold and stubborn belesharon observed to no one in particular he contradicts me in my own house well perhaps it is for the best kellen had the oddest feeling hed just passed another test now dainelel kayir naeret emessade and jermayan will attempt to kill you just as in a real battle all swords will be in practice sheathes i will award injuries it is not necessary to remain within the circle ciradhel brought kellen and jermayan practicesheathesthe others already had them jermayan showed kellen how to fit the heavy leather sheath over his blade and bind it over the guard so there was no possibility of its coming loose during a practice bout with these in place even the lethallysharp elven swords were safe to use what does he mean award injuries kellen wondered then there was no more time to wonder as the bout had begun his main advantage was thathaving just seen him fight master belesharondainelel kayir naeret and emessade were cautious about engaging but the elves knew how to work together as a team not getting in one anothers way quickly they spread out encircling kellen forcing him to defend himself from every side at once but unlike belesharon the images they presented to his spellsight were clear and precise dainelel naeret you are both dead retire from the field if you please master belesharons voice came to kellen distantly as he whirled to block an attack from behind and turned abouttoo lateto respond to an attack from jermayan kellen you have taken a disabling cut to the thigh drop to your knees if you please what kellen shook his head not understanding the other three had withdrawn swords at rest waiting kayirs blow got through i judge it was quite strong enough to have severed the tendons of the leg you cannot stand but you can still fight drop to your knees if you please master belesharon repeated feeling rather foolish kellen did so fortunately the elven armor was flexible enough to permit the move on his knees unable to maneuver much kellen was easy prey though to his secret delight he was able to kill one more of his attackers before receiving a fatal wound if this had been real id be dead now kellen thought soberly jermayan helped him to his feet perhaps you would share what wisdom you have gained this day in the house of sword and shield belesharon said when kellen was standing before him once more despite aches and pains and the fact he was dripping with the sweat of exhaustion kellen grinned beneath his helmet from the way his head hurt some of his opponents had managed to land more than a few blows though he hadnt felt them at the time kellens adversaries had used their feet fists and shields as well as every part of their swords against him only the protection of his armor had kept kellen from collecting a spectacular set of bruises this afternoon but his muscles were certainly convinced hed given them a splendid workout i have learned that i need to learn a very great deal master kellen said honestly belesharon smiled good jermayan take this callow youth to pick out a horse and come early tomorrow knightmage you have much to learn it would be interesting to know why it is that i am going to pick out a horse kellen said when he and jermayan had left the house managing to wrestle the question into the proper form with only a little effort naturally you expect to ride shalkan for a year at least jermayan agreed but after that circumstances may change and learning to understand the mind of a destrier is part of the training of an elven knight i myself chose valdiens parents and saw him foaled but master belesharon does not expect that of you it is enough that you leam to ride properly and to fight from horseback you may need those skills and if the enemy moves into direct conflict slowlyperhaps it will be that you have ample time to pick your foal and train him before you see true war the rain had settled into a gentle mist not really unpleasant and kellen was quite dry inside his hooded cloak before theyd gone out kellen had followed jermayans example and kilted his surcoat high above the knee so it didnt take on water from the grass as they rounded the side of the house they passed the wooden buildings hed seen before jermayan told him they were bathhouses where students could soak away the pains of the day its all beautiful jermayan but it still doesnt seem very large kellen said trying to sound tactful jermayan smiled the impatience of humans come then and see the rest jermayan led him past the bathhouses through a stand of birches standing stark and leafless now that the winter rains had come just beyond them the ground sloped gently away this is what you wished to see jermayan told him what kellen had thought was a small pocket canyon was anything but it spread out before him its farthest edges lost in the mist from the top of the rise he could look down on a whole complex of buildings almost a second city hidden in plain sight the stables and the blacksmiths forge jermayan said the practice ring there was a wide oval of white sand in the middle of the green flanked by a complex of low buildings that somehow managed to give the impression of belonging there were two bare fixed posts set at opposite ends of the oval a lone horseman moved between them in a figureeight pattern his mount moving with slow deliberate grace beyond the stables and the outbuildings kellen could see more horses scattered across the meadow indifferent to the rain i wouldnt have thought the house of sword and shield would have a lot of spare time to keep horse herds kellen said congratulating himself on making a question seem like an idle observation the breeding of warhorses is the business of others jermayan said absently and that place is not in sentarshadeen the animals here belong to knights some keep mounts too old to ride beneath arms with them here out of affection and to honor an aged comrade instead of sending them back to the fields of vardirvoshan and some of them are bred and trained as teachers it is such a one i have in mind for you for i think it would be just as well if neither one of you grew too fond of the other later perhaps you will come to vardirvoshan and choose a proper mount maybe kellen said doubtfully a time when that might be possible seemed unimaginably far away they walked past the riding ring jermayan saluted the mounted knight but did not speak to him kellen could see that the knight was not using reins at all in fact the reins were tied up to the pommel of the saddle nevertheless as the destrier cantered he was doing changes of lead and of direction without the knight using the reins to direct him kellen could not for a moment imagine how the knight and horse were communicating surely they could not be speaking mind to mind no that couldnt be it in a battle the knight would have every bit of his attention concentrated on fighting no there was some secret there he began to wonder how far they were going to walk but when they had gone only a little distance past the riding ring jermayan stopped and looked around apparently he saw what he was looking for because he stopped raising his arm over his head in a purposeful gesture a few moments later valdien appeared three mares at his heels the four animals stopped a few feet away all of them regarding kellen calmly ah jermayan sounded oddly satisfied you keep exalted company these days my friend he said addressing his mount now kellen choose the lady who will be your companion and teacher while you are here at the house this is our way the experienced mounts teach the young riders and the experienced riders teach the young destriers kellen sighed inwardly he supposed this was like choosing his swordany would do but one was best only the sword had been a piece of metal and the horses were well alive and seemed to be regarding him with the same doubtfully assessing expressions as master belesharon had all three of them were soaking wet and muddy besides so it was hard to tell their true colors one was grey with a darker mane and tail one was a strange pale red a color kellen had never seen before in horse centaur or unicorn the third was a dark brown with a brownflecked saddle of white over her rump long white socks and a wide white blaze all of them were beautiful of course the ladies might be past their prime but kellen suspected they could still run any horse of human breeding into the ground and not raise much of a sweat he was tempted to choose one at random but he knew that would almost be cheating perhaps the wild magic could help him he wasnt sure how since he certainly wasnt planning to hit any of them it is easier of course if one approaches the animals more closely jermayan observed in neutral tones kellen gritted his teeth he suspected jermayan was laughing at him and he knew the horses were cautiously he walked toward them hoping they werent just going to take this as an excuse to run off the only real experience he had with horses was with idalias mare prettyfoot and with valdien valdien followed jermayan around like a large dog but prettyfoot would take any excuse to go larking off and if shalkan wasnt around she could take hours to catch he knew these were elven warhorses but they didnt know him from great queen vielissiar farcarinon and if they were anything like prettyfoot they could decide to lead him a chase just for the sheer mischief of it valdien stepped delicately aside as he approached kellen approached the grey reaching out his armored glove and placing his hand gently on her shoulder she lowered her head and sniffed at him gently kellen smelled grass and wet horse strong but not unpleasant as if that were a signal the red mare and the spotted one crowded in nudging and sniffing at him kellen wished suddenly that hed brought treats for them and stooped carefully to tear up handfuls of the grass at his feet feeding each of them in turn they took the morsels neatly and delicately behind him jermayan cleared his throat meaningfully oh it was time to stop entertaining himself and get to work he summoned up his spellsight wondering whatif anythingit would show him as always the world seemed oddly simplified though kellen could never quite put his finger on just how that was it was almost as if everything that didnt immediately matter disappeared though everything he needed to see was there he could feel jermayan and valdien behind him he could tell that jermayan was leaning against valdiens shoulder and knew he would sense instantly if either of them changed position he ought to find seeing things he couldnt see unsettling but somehow he didnt he guessed it was all part of settling in to being a knightmage now he focused his attention on the elven mares the spellsight overlay was subtle but present he could see the ghosts of old injuries and the faint symbolic presences of things he had no words for help me to make the right choice kellen said without quite knowing whoor what he asked at last as he waited a sense of lightness filled him he reached out and placed his hand against one of the mares shoulders blinking the spellsight away this one he said looking to see that hed chosen the tawny red mare a good choice jermayan said deyishene will serve you well she has trained many a knight come then come my lady kellen said a little selfconsciously deyishene shook herself like a wet doga very large wet dogand took a step forward come jermayan said she will follow jermayan led kellen down to one of the stable blocks that flanked the riding ring there kellen brushed and toweled his new charge dryor at least merely dampbefore going to help jermayan select saddle and armor from the tack room it will not be in your colors of course jermayan said and the colors here are unfortunate he regarded a large shelf of neatly folded caparisons the kneelength saddlecloths worn over or under equestrian armor and the fancy rein decorations that matched kellen saw red gold and two shades of green the pale green wasnt appropriate for himhe wasnt that much of a beginner he wasnt sure whether master belesharon thought he ought to be wearing the gold or not and he didnt think it went that badly with the shade of green of his cloak and surcoat but perhaps master belesharon will be inclined to be merciful jermayan continued real concern in his voice honestly jermayan whatever you think is best kellen said maybe i could just skip this part it is necessary jermayan said in tones that brooked no argument he sighed and dug through the stacks of folded barding obviously searching for something ah i had thought these might be here he pulled out a heavy bundle of white fabric and handed it to kellen unexceptionable a bit daring but no one can quarrel with such a choice whatever thats supposed to mean kellen thought oh well it must be just another example of the elven passion for detail and protocol fortunately jermayan was with him for kellen would have had no idea of how to choose the right sizes of everything from shanfron and peytrel to flanchard and crinet though he had saddled and unsaddled valdien enough times to know exactly what items made up an elven destriers armor and how to put them on though the pieces were surprisingly light they were bulky and it took both of themand two tripsto carry them back to deyishenes stall now let us see if you remember your lessons and afterward a turn about the ring jermayan said implacably while kellen worked his wayslowlythrough saddling and armoring deyishene jermayan made a far brisker job of preparing valdien rubbing the stallion dry saddling him and armoring him long before kellen had the straps and buckles adjusted and the complicated pieces of armor locked into place he knew better than to hurry though haste now could lead to a variety of disasters later from saddle sores to armor that fell to pieces to a loose saddlegirth which could dump its rider from his mounts backwhich could be humiliating or downright disastrous depending on when it happened as he worked kellen talked to deyishene much as he would have talked to shalkan explaining who he was and why he was here he knew she couldnt understand as much as shalkan would but talking made him feel better she kept one ear on him at all times and occasionally uttered a snort that sounded as if she was satisfied with what he was saying at last the job was completed to his satisfaction kellen led his warhorse out into the daylight again jermayan was already mounted waiting in the middle of the ring the other rider was long gone but kellen discovered he was not to be without an audience shalkan had arrived standing nonchalantly at the edge of the stable block decided to replace me have you the unicorn said blandly oh uh hello kellen said uneasily shalkan had an unpredictable sense of humor this is deyishene master belesharon said i needed a horse and jermayan says i need to learn how to ride a destrier shalkan switched his tail well he said after a moment maybe shell teach you to ride better than a sack of turnips afflicted with the gout theres a mounting block over there thanks kellen said glumly hed been reasonably proud of his riding skills considering the fact that shalkan moved more like a deer than like a horseincluding covering ground with great bounding leaps when moving at top speed he walked deyishene over to the mounting block it wasnt that difficult getting into the saddle but once he had the ground seemed awfully far away shalkan was only the size of a small pony kellen had forgotten how far away the ground was when you were sitting on a horses back deyishene took a few shifting uncertain steps as if something worried her automatically kellen leaned forward clutching at the front of the saddle to steady himself deyishene stopped dead sit up straight jermayan called and tuck in your knees shalkan added and your behind rest your weight forward more pretend theres a silk scarf between your leg and her and you darent let it drop so began kellens first riding lesson riding did not come as instinctively to him as swordplay had but his experience with shalkan though very different had built a good foundation no matter what the unicorn said to the contrary and at the end of a couple of hours practice kellen felt a lot more confident in the saddle he was still a long way from mastering the intricate partnership of horse and rider that was ultimately required of knight and destrier and as yet was unable to ask deyishene to perform the more sophisticated maneuvers in her repertoireor to be certain of staying in the saddle if she did after his lesson was over jermayan and valdien demonstrated the things kellen would learn in the future kellen and shalkan watched as jermayan and valdien cantered to the end of the riding ring then galloped back suddenly valdien stopped dead and lashed out with his heels then jumped spun and kicked out hard in the opposite direction he reared up lashing out with gleaming metalshod forehooves then sprang off his hindquarters lithe as a cat vaulting over an imaginary fallen enemy he trotted around in a tight circle then sprang forward again leaping an imaginary obstacle from a standing start i hope you dont expect me to do that shalkan said oh do it if you like kellen said magnanimously just dont expect me to be on your back when you do the unicorn could jump like a frog and climb like a mountain goat but the display kellen had just seen was mindbogglingly impressive for a horseand it certainly explained why the equestrian armor was as flexible and intricate as that of the knights he wondered how long it had taken jermayan to train valdien to do that through all valdiens acrobatics jermayan had remained perfectly composed sitting as comfortably in the saddle as if valdien moved at a gentle walk he cantered valdien around the oval twice and then returned to kellen and shalkan of course jermayan said casually it does take a certain amount of practice to manage lance and sword while ones mount is engaged in such activity his tone was so dry that even kellen recognized he was being ironic but as i do not think the flower wars will concern you overmuch perhaps you will not need to concern yourself with the lance now it is time to see to your horse then to your armor then to soak the stiffness from your limbs by then it will be close upon lamplighting time and you will wish to rest yourself in preparation for the numerous exertions of the morrow and maybe when i get home i can ask idalia if anybodys going to actually do anything about shadow mountain kellen thought suddenly remembering what all this training was for the walls of the mage city of armethalieh called the golden city the city of a thousand bells had stood for a thousand years high magick had built it high magick ruled every detail of its daily life and the high council labored tirelessly to make sure that for its citizens every day was much like every otherand that no one could imagine a time when that would not be so except for a tiny minority among the ruling council of high mages their memories hedged about with wards and spells no one knew the history of armethalieh none of her citizens could imagine a time before her walls had risen a time before wealth poured into her coffers from carefullycontrolled trade with all the worlda world which was nevertheless barred from walking her streets for armethalieh was first and foremost a city for armethaliehans and outsiders were not tolerated her wealth her privileges and her magick were for her citizens alone and in judicious moderation for the home farms those lands just outside the western gate that provided the crops that fed the golden citys teeming multitudes or so matters had stood until recently change had come to the golden city the city was ruled by her mages and the mages were ruled by the high council the high council was ruled by the archmage but the twelve high mages who shared the dignity of a seat on the council all looked to the day when one of them might supplant him and now that archmage lycaelon tavadons son and heir had been banished for practicing the forbidden wild magic lycaelons control over his fellows was less than absolute each of them looked to consolidate his own power to make himself the next archmage of armethalieh and soon usually the archmage had to die before the power passed to anotherbut not always and there were those who thought that it might be no bad thing for lycaelon tavadon to be persuaded to retire of the twelve high mage volpiril was the most ambitious when lycaelons bid to annex the western hills collapsed in disaster volpiril had suggestedin a direct though veiled attack upon lycaelonthat the council withdraw its borders to the walls of armethalieh herself abandoning their claim on not only the western lands but the home farms the council rattled by its mysterious defeat and swayed by volpirils speechmaking had voted its assent lycaelon could not overrule them though he had taken a grim pleasure in casting the lone dissenting vote some of the villagers greeted the news that they were no longer the property of the cityand might set what prices they liked for what had once been armethaliehs by rightwith cheers of delight others more perceptive were quick to see that if armethaliehs control was withdrawn so was her magick there would be no more healing for the villagers no pest control or destruction of blight no preservation for their grain storage no certainty of favorable weather for planting and harvest the petitions piled higher on lycaelons desk each day arriving with each cart of overpriced produce and gaggle of hysterical rustics until with a malicious sense of justice lycaelon had set volpiril to deal with the matter reminding the high mage that it was a violation of armethaliehan law to expend her magick for the benefit of anyone but her citizens or subject peoples and so if the delfier valley farmers no longer belonged to armethalieh it was volpirils duty to explain to them why armethaliehan magick would no longer be employed in their service and in the marketplace the prices rose and kept rising it could not be helped through volpirils vicious bungling the farmers must now be paid for their produce the city could absorb some of the cost but not all and not forever so the prices rose for everything from turnips to sugar biscuits no one knew why of course it was not in the councils interest that they should and this year of all years lycaelon thought with a sigh sliding the latest summary of reports into a drawer in his desk and locking it the winter rains promised to be exceptionally heavy it wouldnt matter within the city itself of course where the mages ensured that rain only fell late at night and only in sufficient quantity to water the gardens and keep the cisterns filled but there would be flooding in the valley this year undoubtedly that would mean a poor crop in the spring he got to his feet cursing the stiffness in his muscles he glanced toward the small office just off his own but no light showed beneath the door as it should be he had stayed late readingand had sent anigrel home bells ago as he left his office waving the magelights to darkness behind him lycaelon could feel the faint hum of power from the council chamber where mages worked tirelessly as they did every night weaving the elaborate and beautiful spells of the high magick for the good of the city he shook his head light grant a spell to preserve us from the maddened ambition of fools like lord volpiril darkness take him master undermage chired anigrelhis abrupt increase in rank a sign of the signal favor in which lycaelon tavadon held himregarded his new accommodations with a satisfaction he was careful not to display before witnesses the suite of rooms on the third floor of house tavadon had had every trace of their former occupant ruthlessly expunged every stick of furniture had been sent into storage in the houses vast attics the walls had been scrubbed down and repainted to an even more marmoreal shade of white suitable furnishings had been acquired to outfit one of the two rooms as a comfortablebut not overluxuriousbedroom the otherthe one with the excellent view of the gardens and the council houseas a workroom and small study and all carefully coordinated to be in the house colors of black and white when the renovations were finished no trace of the former occupancy of lycaelon tavadons banished outlaw son remained and the suite appeared to be another perfectly fitted extension of lycaelons taste there was no sign of anigrels own personality here this was exactly as anigrel wanted it he wished for lycaelon to think of anigrel as an extension of himself anigrel retained his rooms at the magecourts on the college grounds of course it would not do to flaunt openly what everyone knewthat he now lived at tavadon house lycaelons adopted son in all but name and perhaps someday in name as well anigrel thought settling back in his chair lycaelon had no one else both his children had given themselves to the wild magic and been banished from the city and anigrel had taken pains to make himself so very indispensable to the archmage over the past moonturns though he was certain that lycaelonso innocent in his waydid not know the half of what anigrel did for him the mageborn were greedy for power and ruthless in their unending quest for rank and position as lycaelons private secretary anigrel saw many mageborn every day yet was nearly invisible himself one more greyrobed underling doing the work of the city it had been a simple thing to shape the opinion of the mageborn with an innocent comment here a casual observation there and turn it inexorably against lord volpiril so that the mages now saw disaster in the high mages evermoredesperate makeshifts and pronouncements before the council and they saw it before the trouble actually appeared as the situation in the city worsened volpirils position would become even more unstable it was not impossible that he would be voted off the council though such a thing hadnt happened in centuries and if actual shortages began to appear then lord volpirils reign on the council could be numbered in moonturns that would leave a vacancy anigrel meant to have it for himself he was already a master undermage elevated to that rank years ahead of time and there was already talkfor once he hadnt needed to start the rumors himselfthat lord lycaelon would soon sponsor anigrel for the tests to the rank of magisterpractimus if not magisterregnant either rank would be sufficient to allow anigrel to take a seat on the council anigrel had no doubt of his ability to pass the tests the difficulty all these years had been in concealing the extent of his power not passing the tests his mageborn teachers set for anigrels power stemmed from a far different source and his true teachers were far more powerful and far far more dangerous than any high mage could imagine being it was the other reason he retained his rooms in the magecourts for there were things he did there that could not be done within the walls of the house of the archmage of armethalieh there was a faint scratching at the door panel with a gesture anigrel caused the door to dissolve a servant stood in the doorway lord anigrel the archmage arrives the servant said bowing anigrel nodded dismissing the servant as he got to his feet the servant bowed again and backed away the prescribed three steps before turning to go the servants might have treated kellen tavadon with indifference and contempt but it had taken little effort for anigrel to teach them proper manners in his presence and just as he wished them to show him every courtesy so it would not do for him to be remiss in showing lycaelon every evidence of humility deference and respect until the archmage no longer mattered and just now a touch of appropriate distress was in order lord archmage you are weary anigrel arrived in the reception room just as lycaelon entered anigrel i sent you to your bed hours ago lycaelon said lookingyes gratified to see anigrel some trifling matters occupied my attention the younger man said and i was concerned by the burdens you bear for us all lord lycaelon he added softly lycaelon smiled faintly i am accustomed to them my young friend but perhaps of your kindness you will take a glass of wine with me in the library after so many years of laboring in the circle for the good of the city while the common folk dream it still seems odd to sleep at night anigrel followed lycaelon through the panel that led into the large formal library lycaelon seated himself in a chair beside the windowthe long sapphireblue drapes were drawn now since it was nightand anigrel went to the sideboard and collected a decanter and two glasses the decanter shimmered faintly with the preservation spell that kept its contents fresh and unchanged no matter how long it stood untasted and unopened ostentatious and yet frugal ostentatious to use a spell on something like a decanted bottle of wine yet frugal to have the spell to keep the wine from spoiling after it had been opened when one only wanted a glass or two at a time he set the glasses on the small table between the two chairs and poured them both full handing one to lycaelon before taking his own seat he waited for lycaelon to drink then sipped his own wine appreciatively a rare moment and a rare vintage brought by selken ships from ividion isle the only place in the world where the saltmarsh grapes could grow at least the out islands were not affected by volpirils policies this would not be the last such bottle obtainable lycaelon laughed his thoughts on a private joke ah if only the commons could see us now anigrelthey would be shocked they think we live on light and air and pure well waterand we do our part to keep them thinking that way dont we he drained his glass and filled it again before anigrel could do it for him of course lord lycaelon its unthinkable that the common clay should have any reason to criticize their masters theyre happier that way anigrel said far better that they believe there is nothing to envy us for of course they are lycaelon said everything we do is for them and for the good of the city envy is a bitter thing and would only disturb their peace oh yes of course anigrel said making sure his words rang obviously hollow he sipped his wine and waited you must tell me if there is something concerning you anigrel lycaelon said it is not only the commons that i serve but my fellow mages i can conceal nothing from you lord lycaelon anigrel said with a rueful smile but you know it better than i and i do not wish to add to your burden and yet you know that i hear what you do not simply because there are those who will say in front of me what they will not say to the archmage i depend upon it lycaelon said i do not think you can surprise me anigrel and your words may serve the city tell me what worries you do not fear to offend me for i already know that you love the city as much as you know that lord volpiril hasperhapsnot acted entirely in the citys best interests in a certain recent instance at present the circumstances are known only to those of our own class but the effect of that action cannot be concealed many believe that soon these circumstances will become known outside the mageborn the effects of that knowledge could be unfortunate unfortunate disastrous lycaelon nearly groaned there will be famine in the delfier valley in the springand no food available for sale to the city at any price yet that fool blocks any attempt to reverse his policies saying they will bear fruit with time fruit oh yes and the fruit will be a bitter and withered harvest anigrel leaned forward lord lycaelon do not let your merciful and charitable nature keep you from doing what must be done to discredit volpirils policies discredit volpiril first without him to goad them on the council will gladly abandon something so worthless but lycaelon had raised his hand silencing anigrel to force him from the council without the support of my fellow mages would be a greater disaster than riots in the streets of the city i shall seek that support and pray to the light that i find it in time and now i find i am weary anigrel i give you good night rest well lord archmage anigrel got to his feet bowing and left the library he was not wholly dissatisfied with the evenings work he had planted the ideas in lycaelons mind that hed wanted to now lycaelon was thinking about eliminating volpiril before the city was in open rebellion against the mageborn all anigrel had to do was give lycaelon a good excuse and just as lycaelon once had volpiril had a son a most malleable son cilarnen volpiril was a perfect example of mageborn breeding all the mageborn were slender and fineboned their bodies shaped by no physical labor more arduous than lifting a wand or a pen their coloration was vivid black blond or red hair running strongly in particular mage families in this they stood out sharply from the commonborn whose hair color was muddied with brown and whose bodies were stockier than those of the pureblooded mages oh from time to time one with mage talents arose in a common family but such were marked by their very appearance as commonsborn and though it would never be openly acknowledged that appearance would keep them from rising far within the ranks perhaps such a commonsborn mage could find a pureblooded daughter of an insignificant family to marry and his descendants would be of an acceptable appearance but for such a onewell there were limits and properly so the volpiril line had auburn hair cilarnen could inspect the portraits of noteworthy mage ancestors that graced the walls of house volpiril and see his own russet hair and pale blue eyes depicted there with the precision of his bathingroom mirror only the styles changed and that not by a great deal except in the very oldest portraits for was it not armethaliehs greatest boast that she was as unchanging as her walls his familys history had been one of privilege service and high magick for uncounted generations and the niches in the walls of the family chapel in house volpiril were filled with golden alabaster urns containing the ashes of great mages who had brought luster to the family name until last winter cilarnen had been serenely certain that he would follow in their footsteps just as his father had rising quickly and pleasantly through the ranks of adeptshipfor his studies in the high magick had always come easily to himand seeing no other possible future for himself than one spent as a mage of the magecity a privileged post in one of the more important city councils inevitably just as soon as he attained sufficient rank a seat on the high council not impossible and perhaps the archmageship itself for volpirils had held that post in the past nearly as often as the tavadons and lord lycaelon tavadon could not live forever but all that had beenbefore before his mistake before his disgrace cilarnen had two sisters much younger who were being carefully groomed to someday take their places as the pliant dutiful wives of his peers but they scarcely mattered to his carefullyordered life his sisters having been placed under the care of nurses and governessesand cilarnens distant wellbred mageborn motherfrom the time they could walk dialee had been born when he was six and eshavi when he was eight and cilarnen encouraged by his father had already been looking toward the future toward the day when he could pledge himself as a citizen of armethalieh and begin his studies in high magick women had no place in the life of a young mage students did not marry did not court did not admit the existence of women nor did apprentices a journeyman might but only after he had reached his thirtieth year if his patron gave him permission and only if he had decided he did not wish to advance further in the ranks of the art magickal only if one advanced so swiftly that a higher rank than journeyman was in ones grasp did a young mage have cause to think of women before the age of thirty and even then marriage among the mageborn was not a matter of love but of consolidating ones position of repaying past favors or of buying future ones of choosing the best possible mother for future mageborn sons cilarnen knew all that love was a madness that afflicted the ungifted a sickness of the magickless commons who thronged the streets of the city outside the mage quarter his kind were above such things then he saw lady amintia it was quite by accident hed come home unexpectedly in the middle of the daya spell had gone awry during the morning lessons and his tutor had fallen ill and been unable to see him for his afternoons private lesson on a rare whim hed decided to go riding instead and gone home to change his rooms overlooked the gardens of house volpiril hed gone to the windows and opened them stepping out onto the small balcony and as he did he stepped through the silence spell that shielded his rooms and heard peals of laughter coming from the garden below he looked down the garden was filled with females he recognized none of themthough logically two of them must be his sisters there were perhaps two dozen of them all running about in a fashion cilarnen himself had given up a dozen years before playing some sort of elaborate game of touchandrun crying out and laughing as they scored off one another their faces were flushed and shiny with exertion their hair tumbled down around their shoulders their citytalismansthe golden rectangle of citizenship that every citizen of armethalieh woreflying to the ends of golden throatchains and colored neckribbons as they played shawls and scarves were scattered about the grass like strange drifts of brightlycolored mist along one wall of the garden a long table stood severe and correct in white linen its burden of refreshments awaiting the moment when the ladies tired of their fun cilarnen blinked feeling almost as if he had opened one of the forbidden books and read something he was not meant to see he looked away from the others and saw her she did not join in the jostling games of the others but stood watching them her back to the base of the enormous magnolia tree that dominated the volpiril garden her raven hair was bound neatly and suitably at the base of her neck and just as cilarnen looked down she looked up her eyes were such an intense shade of blue he could see their color clearly even across the garden he did not know what he expected her to do like all proper young mageborn youths cilarnen had barely even seen a woman of his own class but she simply regarded him saying nothing and doing nothing to draw unwelcome attention to him amintia come join us one of the others called her name and she looked away shaking her head and smiling gently cilarnen backed into his room blushing in hot confusion as the blessed silence of the shielding spells enfolded him once more he touched his own citytalisman on its jeweled chain pressing the cool metal against his skin what had just happened he didnt know but he liked it he went to the window again taking care to stay well within the spells here he could see out without being seen he stood at the window watching until the garden was empty his plans for the afternoon forgotten it was easy enough to find out who she was his father kept a comprehensive genealogy of the mageborn families in his library and the mageborn did not repeat names within generations she was lady amintia of house amaubale lord amaubale was a mage who served on the council of public safety she had two brothers nathuren and pretarkol who were several years behind cilarnen at the mage college she was someone house volpiril might ally itself withsomeone he might have but not for yearsan unimaginable number of years more years than he had already lived and what if her father bestowed her elsewhere in the interim it was an unbearable thought and one that began to obsess him as the sennights passed his studies sufferedif only a littleby his distraction he even disgraced himself so far as to seek out the amaubale residence and walk past it once and at last he came up with a plan he would seek his fathers agreement to a betrothal that would solve all his problems no one else would marry amintia she would be his waiting for him until the day when he was prepared to claim her it was the perfect solution to his problemhis obsession unfortunately his father did not agree once each sennight cilarnen was accustomed to receive a private audience with his father so that he could make an informal account to lord volpiril of his progress with his studiesthough of course his father received detailed reports from his tutorsand give lord volpiril his own assessment of his current and perhaps future rivals generally these occasions had been relatively pleasant affairs with lord volpiril taking the opportunity to make some small gift to cilarnenof pocket money a book or some newlyfashionable accessoryto indicate his pleasure with cilarnens diligence that audience seemed the perfect time to make his plea and he approached his fathers study fully confident that he would emerge from it with all his troubles smoothed away he opened the door and bowed my lord father as always cilarnen entered his fathers private study precisely at the second afternoon bell of lightday so it had been since he had begun his studies in the art magickal and cilarnen could not imagine a time when it would not be so his interview invariably lasted precisely two chimes he stopped before his fathers desk and bowed a second time as always his father was working even at home and on lights day lord volpiril was a high mage and a member of the high council his duty to the city was neverending this was a credo he had drummed into his son from the day cilarnen could walk talk and perhaps make demands on his fathers time so from that time it had been made very clear to him that the city came first and cilarnen a very distant second ah cilarnen his father looked up as he approached the desk so it is lights day once again what news do you have to bring me for most of a chime cilarnen spoke of ordinary things his progress in his magickal studies and his relationships with his fellow students then quickly he presented the matter nearest to his heart there is another matter sir a matter of a young woman my lord father a daughter of house amaubale her name is amintia i am sure mother knows her i believesubject to your approval of course sirthat this would be an excellent alliance for us when the time comes i know that it is far too soon for me to consider marriagefar too soon i had not thought of such a thing before i saw this young womanbut she isi find herit is a good match i have consulted the genealogy and house volpiril has married into house amaubale in the past so i thought if you would consider it perhaps a precontract intent upon convincing his father of the logic and worth of this plan cilarnen was not watching lord volpirils face then with a scrape of his chair that startled his son the high mage rose to his feet his expression furious a precontract to think that i would hear such words upon the lips of my own son are we merchants or nobles we are mageborn magick flows in our blood it is a sacred calling one that requires the utmost dedication volpirils face was flushed scarlet and cilarnen shrank back involuntarily before his wrath there can be no room in the thoughts of the student or the apprentice for anything but dedication to his art have you gone utterly mad but cilarnen stammered volpirils jaw clenched your tutors had mentioned you were strangely unwilling to apply yourself of late i had meant to ask you the reason today and now now you flaunt it proudly and dare to demand that i aid you in your foolish descent into emotionality where did you come by such a notion why i would have expected this sort of nonsense out of a silly girl not out of a welleducated son shall i remove you from school and dress you in a gown next cilarnen flushed his face and neck growing uncomfortably hot he said nothing he could not bring a single word up out of his constricted throat his father snorted it is fortunate you did not forget yourself entirely and brought this to my attention before you made yourself a public scandal lord volpirils tone was harsh ibutit has been done in the past cilarnen protested weakly greatgrandfather if you need no other lesson in why the companionship of females is forbidden to young mageborn consider your own actions today look what this has brought you to volpiril stormed open rebellion daring to contradict me beneath this very roof i will not have it you sir may consider yourself on notice and be sure that i will speak to lord amaubale and make quite certain his daughter never sets foot in this house again cilarnen felt himself grow as cold as he had been heated a moment before never to see her again but you have displeased me greatly today cilarnen volpiril took a deep breath and stared down at his son very greatly but you still have a chance to make amends apply yourself strictly to your studies reclaim your pride of place in your classes forget this cozening creatureno doubt she merely thought to entrap the son of a high council mage for her own advancement women are manipulative secretive and no matter how sweetly innocent they may seem even the youngest of them is as adept at spinning webs to ensnare an unwary young man as any spider when i speak to her father i shall advise him to see her quickly married that will put an end to her foolishness volpiril said darkly cilarnen stood frozen in shock amintiahis amintiamarried to someone else you may go cilarnen lord volpiril said brusquely sitting down once more and returning his attention to the papers before him from his demeanor his son might as well have ceased to exist all that cilarnen could do was to bow and take himself out his fathers displeasure was bad enough but far worse was the terrible inevitability that amintia was going to be lost to him forever once lord volpiril put his mind to something it was as good as accomplished cilarnen knew that if he was to get back in his fathers good graces he must do as his father instructed and put her from his mind but somehow he did not think that he could manage to do that without telling herjust oncehow much she had meant to him he thought of writing her a letter but after several attempts cilarnen gave up he couldnt find the proper words and anyway if he sent a letter to her house her parents would read it first his father read all of his infrequent correspondence and cilarnen had no doubt the custom was universal but he could write her a poem an anonymous poem that would be best and safest too poetry was one of the classes taught at the magecollege and cilarnen was fairly confident of his ability to write something suitable something that would move her heart and perhaps make her pity him besides ever since hed seen amintia somehow poetry had made so much more sense to him than it ever had before he labored over his work for sennights as winter passed into early spring copying the final result out onto a slender scroll which he tied with a silver ribbon after moonturns of watching the house he knew all of the amaubale servants by sight he would simply arrange to be in the garden market at the same time that one of them was there and give the creature a few coins to pass the scroll on to lady amintia then she would know that someone had loved hernot for her family or her position but for her incomparable eyes rare as blue roses for her grace for her quiet beauty for all that made her the lady amintia the scroll had vanished before he could deliver it and the next time cilarnen had seen it to his utter horror and humiliation it had been in the hands of mage hendassar in his history of the city class mage hendassar had read it out loud to the entire room of students they had laughed laughed at him at his weakness at his foolishness cilarnen would gladly have died he hated mage hendassar hated his classmates hated his fatherthere was no doubt of how the scroll had come into mage hendassars handsand most of all perversely enough he hated the lady amintia as much as he had heretofore loved her this was her fault if he had never seen her none of this would have happened no female was worth such agony his father had been right life might have been utterly unbearable if his father had ever made any reference to the matter but lord volpiril did nothing of the sort of course he had not needed to the tale spread all over the magecollege of course and might have hounded him for the rest of his years if not for the fact that only a fortnight later the archmages only son kellen tavadon was summoned before the high council and after that none of them ever saw kellen tavadon again this was a far more interesting scandal than a simple love poem since not one of the students had the least idea of what farmer kellen might have done and none of them was ever able to find out some swore they had seen kellen working as a laborer down in the low quarteras if that were possible others said he had fought with the archmage and been sent to live in one of the farming villages as a punishment all cilarnen knew was that if people were talking about kellen they werent talking about him and he was profoundly grateful he had learned his lesson and he would work harder than ever before to be the son his father wanted but somehow it did not seem to be possible because from that moment on nothing nothing that he did was ever good enough spring became summer lord volpirils temper was always short these days no matter what cilarnen did his father only told him he must do better in everharsher words of criticism and all of it was so unjust he was trying he was at the top of several of his classes his tutors all voiced themselves satisfied with him yet his father acted as if he was putting forth no effort whatsoever cilarnen seethed with resentment under the unjust critique and he began to wonder if it was not he who was at fault somehow failing but his father the sons of the other council mages whispered fantastic gossip of unrest on the high council of great plans afoot cilarnen did not know what they were of course volpiril did not speak of them and the days when cilarnen might bring the rumors to his father and ask for more information were long gone now if cilarnen had taken second place in his fathers concerns before he now felt as if he had descended to last in priorities he felt oddly lost and somehow cheated if not for his tutors he would have been utterly alone like most young mageborn cilarnens lessons included practice in dance and swordplay as well as in the art magickal he had little practical use for either but both were good exercise and the practice of the art magickal was an arduous business requiring great stamina both mental and physical three times a sennight he went to master kaloss salon at the edge of the mage quarter for his lessons in reedblade the sword he studied there was nothing like the ponderous steel weapons the militia carried and certainly nothing like the wide heavy blades used in high magick the reedblade was an elegant thing smaller than his little finger at its base and tapering to a blunt squaredoff point it was used to touch ones opponent elegantly and in the proper style special talismans worn by each of the combatants ensured that the blades could not go awry and accidentally strike outside the permitted target zones it was incredibly hard to score according to master kaloss exacting specifications and at the end of each bellandahalf lesson cilarnen was as exhausted as if hed spent the entire time running around the inside of the enormous hall instead of standing nearly still attempting to hit a man with a length of metal he could balance on two fingers but master kalos praised lavishly for each improvement and told cilarnen he could have made a fine swordsman if he had not had the misfortune to be born a mage a joke of course and cilarnen had smiled dutifully master kaloss odd sense of humor was well known for one of the sennightly lessons he saw master kalos alone for the other two he was part of a class of about twenty other young mageborn since the classes were grouped by skill not age cilarnen soon found himself among not only some of his fellow students but grouped with some older mageborn as well they treated cilarnen with casual goodfellowship as if he were one of them he found it an odd and interesting experience to be in a place where rank very nearly didnt matter it did of course lord volpirils only son would be a fool to believe otherwise bur the illusion was comforting and for a little while he could pretend that he actually had people around him he could call friend his dancing teacher was lord nendimos a mage who specialized not only in teaching dance but in the history of dance and the magic of dance a series of lectures that one must be a journeymanapprentice to sit for lord nendimos was a journeymanundermage he had been a journeyman undermage since long before cilarnen had been born and would never rise higher in the ranks though his power and his knowledge outstripped many of his betters and if he could only have gained the sponsorship to do so he could have passed a dozen of the qualifying tests with no difficulty whatever gaining such sponsorship might even have been possible though difficult for the same reason that lord nendimos was still a journeyman after four decades lord nendimos liked women he liked them as people he enjoyed their company their fellowship and even claimed that some of them were his friends he made no secret of it when he was not putting the students of the magecollege through their paces he was dancing master to half the mage houses of armethalieh and there he was welcomed by the mageborn women withif he was to be believedas much warmth as if he were a family member his fellow mages regarded his eccentricity with dismay and with resignation but once they were satisfied that he would not pass on his bizarre tastes to their sons they decided to tolerate his peculiarities his family was old and well connected his brothers were perfectly normaland highlyplaced his sisters were married into some of the best families and his talents were too valuable to lose the dances of armethalieh were slow stately and very complicated it took time to learn them welleven more so since it was not to be considered that mageborn sons and mageborn daughters should learn them together that sort of foolishness could be left to the tradesmen the nobles the laborers and all the rest who lived lives of foolish selfindulgence dancing practice was held in the auditorium at the northern end of the quadrangle students were grouped by age not academic rank and drilled endlessly in the set figures of armethaliehan dance taking the roles of the sun or the moon in turn once a student reached his fifteenth year attendance was no longer mandatory but cilarnen had chosen to continue because he found the class interesting and even pleasurable at this point his class was made up of the older students and apprentices and even a few tutors he enjoyed the stately movement like a slower form of swordplay and nendimos drilled this oldest class hardest of all for having had years to master the steps he told them he now looked for perfection of form when the music played and cilarnen concentrated on mirroring his partners moves his mind on nothing beyond the moment sometimes he felt almost as if he were a sort of living wand tracing through the glyphs of a spell hed said as much to lord nendimos one day after practice the old man had regarded him shrewdly i trust you will come to my lectures when you are old enough lord cilarnen i shall save a place for you but of all his teachers cilarnens most important was his private tutor in magick master tocsel had been his tutor in magick since he had been a small child the venerable master undermage knew everything there was to know about the practicalities of high magick from the simplest spell to the most abstruse conjuration he had trained cilarnens father and his grandfather he was certainly not a kindly man but if cilarnen was truly making an effort tocsel was endlessly patient his one concern was to see his pupil do well his feelings had been quite hurt during that period when cilarnen had been unable to pay attention to his lessons but to cilarnens intense relief his renewed efforts had been rewarded with praise and encouragement and master tocsel had been willing to forgive cilarnens dereliction even when it seemed his own father would not mark my words young cilarnen tocsel said one day as cilarnens lesson drew to a close you will soon be a mere apprentice no longer it is in my mind to recommend you for the tests for entered apprentice the next time the board sits no more blue robe for you there were three ranks of apprentice student apprentice which cilarnen had passed long ago apprentice and entered apprentice of the three only the last was entitled to wear the grey robe of magecraft and cast spells for any purpose other than practice entered apprentices still pursued their studies at the college but they also worked elsewhere in the city assisting mages at their work thank you sir i he nearly asked if master tocsel thought he was ready and bit back the question master tocsel would not have made the comment if he did not think cilarnen was ready i only hope my lord father will be pleased he said instead tocsel made a rude noise the privilege of age and why should he not be youve come along splendidly not like the archmages son bad blood there oh everyone knew it but lycaelon wouldnt be told once he set eyes on that ridiculous barbarian woman nothing would do but that he marry her and look what happened learn from his mistake boy and let your father pick your bride when the time comes emotion should never play a part in marriage a bride cilarnen winced inwardly though he was careful to let nothing of his feelings show on his face he hoped he never saw another woman until he was as old as master tocsel chapter five secrets in the city of golden bells calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink when the board sat he passed its tests easily and advanced in rank to entered apprentice lord volpiril seemed to think it was no more than the consideration that house volpiril deserved and was not due to any effort on cilarnens part this hurt but cilarnen was careful not to show it the traditional celebration was heldhouse volpirils consequence demanded no lessbut to cilarnens mind the festivities seemed rather perfunctory and he knew for a fact that every aspect of the event had been handled by volpirils secretary including the gift presented to him in volpirils name a fine silverandebony wandcase once he would have cherished such an item thinking it had come from his father now he could barely bear to look at it though of course he had said everything that was proper at the time whatever his private feelings he would do nothing to diminish the consequence of house volpiril in the world all this would someday be his after all as an entered apprentice in grey robe and soft cap to distinguish him plainly from journeymen who also wore grey robes but hooded ones cilarnen saw far more of the city than he ever had before he worked withor more precisely formages in every aspect of their tending of the city reporting back to the master of apprentices each time a mage released him to be set to a new task cilarnen also began to make friends among his fellow entered apprentices knowing that these would be his colleagues and confederates for the rest of a life spent in service to the city perhaps friend was not the right word emotion didnt enter into the choices he made for his associates allies would be more accurate and the associations felt hollow unsatisfying as one of the puff pastries that looked so delicious and were nothing more than a dusting of sugar over a thin crust that fell to insubstantial bits at the first bite he could not name the day on which he realized that he would never again be readmitted to his fathers favor no matter how hard he worked and what honors he achieved but surely it was a blessing sent by the light for at about this same time rumors began filtering down from the highest levels of mageborn society that lord volpiril had caused the high council to repudiate the citys ancient contracts with the home farms withdrawing the citys boundaries to the walls themselves at first cilarnen gave the matter little thoughtwhat did the farms have to do with the city after all but soon he began to learn no one paid any attention to an apprentice his seniors spoke freely in front of him before long cilarnen soon knew what everyone knew about lord volpiril and none of it was good the lightforgotten fool will be the ruin of us all wand cilarnen lifted the instrument from the insulating cloth and placed it carefully into juvaliras hand the senior journeyman began tracing the complicated pattern of a preservation spell in the air as his assistantanother journeyman cilarnen was far from being allowed to actually assist in a casting as yetdrew a complementary pattern on the stone floor of the warehouse with a sword both patterns flared and settled they were working in one of the cereals warehouses near the market district the buildings spells needed to be constantly reinforced for there were a great many of themnot only spells against vermin of all kinds but spells against fire damp and leaks not only were there spells upon the building itself but there were also a host of spells upon the buildings contentsa separate matter each needing to be worked separately and in a precise order spells against spoilage against rot and against the destruction of any of the myriad containers of the grain for since it had all been brought from the farms or from selken ships it came stored in sacks and barrels some as milled flour some as whole grains this was cilarnens first visit to this particular warehouse but even he could see that it was emptier than it ought to be there were empty spaces upon the shelves stacks of barrels that werent quite even a sense of vacancy that made him faintly uneasy more incense boy thekinalo said curtly cilarnen hurried to dip several carefullymeasured spoonfuls of powder onto the glowing coals chanting the appropriate spell under his breath its hardly a surprise thekinalo said continuing the conversation they see a chance for profit now that they are free and so our warehouses empty and the farmers pockets fill with golden suns and the price of a bakers loaf has doubled in the last moonturn may the light defend us from lord volpiril and his policies juvalira agreed raising his wand again and from the commons should they ever discover the reason bread is so dear his partner simply laughed and lowered the sword to the floor once more someone must do something young lord gillain said earnestly at the end of their daily duties many of the apprentices gathered at a teahouse at the edge of the college the golden bells sold nothing stronger than kaffeyeh teas and fruit juice of course but it was a place where apprentices and the younger journeymen could gather together and socialize free of the constraints of their elders and providing their elders approved of course cilarnen shook his head minutely saying nothing gillain was a fool his rash speech would get him into trouble somedayand soon no matter that his grandfather sat on the high council what do you suggest flohan asked with a touch of sarcasm do we petition the high council my cousin says that half the farmers in the valley are already doing that the council wont change its mind and take them back its tiny mind gillain said and there was laughter from the young men gathered around the tablesome genuine some merely nervous only two didnt join in the general amusement cilarnen and a journeyman named raellan raellan had been coming to the golden bells for several sennights now he was a quiet man having little to say but when he did speak it was always sensible and to the point i think that if someone wanted to change the councils mind about its policies raellan said now looking straight at cilarnen he would have to be very brave and very dedicated to the good of the city this is getting too deep for me another entered apprentice named viance said hastily let us talk of pleasant things who has tried the phastan silvertip that has just come in the talk quickly turned to tea and the moment passed chired anigrelknown in the golden bells and in a few other select establishments in the city as master raellanleft the teashop a few chimes later well pleased with the evenings work few would recognize his face there and elsewhere and to baffle those who might the smallest and most subtle cantrip of misdirection cast over his features before he left his rooms ensured that he would not be recognized if lord lycaelon needed a reason to dispense with volpirils services anigrel would give him one as well as the opportunity to rid himself of all other mages who might prove to beinconvenient if the specter of shadow mountain hadnt been hovering over events kellen would undoubtedly have been happier than hed ever been in his entire life he got up each morning while the dawn mists still filled the valley of sentarshadeen dressed and carrying his breakfast with him walked to the house of sword and shield eating as he walked sometimes shalkan came with him and the two friends talked of nothing in particular the weatherit continued to rain but kellen was getting used to it how vestakia was settling in when kellen arrived at the house he would either change to his working clothes he wore a distinct shade of greennot his signature color eithera hue which had been arrived at after a great deal of debate apparently or into his armor depending on what he was to work at that day kellen was learning things that jermayan had lacked the resources to teach him to attack and to defend himself against multiple attackers and morehe was learning to keep the choices in every combat in his own hands so that he could kill or not as he chose under master belesharons guidance he was learning to trick an attacker to stun or disarm him to simply be elsewhere when the blow fell it was more than simple misdirection far more than the feints and dodges that jermayan had tried to show him it waswell if he had to put a name to it it was a new state of mind part of the battlemind to be sure but a state in which he could choose to be like a fish in the water he could see where the fight was going the way a fish could sense a rock in the stream ahead of him and he could move with the fight or around it when he finally got the trick of it it had all come at once suddenly the sense was there and hed slipped aside from every blow that the four other knights were trying to land on him without needing to counter any of them and the state of mind he had been in was so uncannily peacefulas if it was a kind of meditation it was only when master belesharon had called a halt to the fight and he dropped automatically out of that mental state that the exhaustion hit him i would not toy with that if i were you master belesharon said neutrally and kellen had readily agreed useful that might be if he were surrounded by attackers that he dared not strike at but the effort this state took was greater than actually defending himself with his knightmage gifts to guide him kellen learned fast but there was always more to learn there was the theory of war itself not of knight against knight but of armies in the field and so he was introduced to the two great elven strategy games gan and xaqiue gan was played on a square board divided into tiny squares there were counters divided into six suits and up to six players could play though usually only two or three did the simple object of the game was to be the last person with counters on the board the complex object of the game was to win beautifully and with style an opponents counters could be removed from play either by surrounding them or by forcing them to the edge of the board so far kellen had lost every gan match hed played but he was starting to lose more slowly xaqiue bore a faint resemblance to shamat which was played in armethalieh in shamat there were two armies of playing pieces each of which could move only a certain way and the object was to capture the other players city xaqiue was similarin that one of the points of the game was to capture the opposing players pieces but in xaqiue captured pieces remained on the board in the service of whoever captured them last and the moves each piece could make changed depending on how many moves it had already made and what other pieces were nearby kellen found xaqiue fiendishly complicated it is no more complicated than a battle naeret would say when kellen had been forced to resign yet another game in the middle hopelessly tangled in a welter of moves and countermoves and having managed to forget which pieces still belonged to him yet you would remember that well enough i could get killed in a battle kellen muttered yet all life is war naeret said setting the pieces out once again perhaps it is all worth considering equally seriously between sword exercises and gamesthough kellen suspected that the elves did not think of games in quite the same way he didthere were the lectures though he supposed instructions might be a better word seen simply these were tales of ancient battlesand just what hed wanted to hear ever since hed realized there had been ancient battles seen another way they were histories or chronicles or even guidebooks of a sort filled with instructions and warnings kellen shared these lectures with the novices of course for he had never had the opportunity to hear these stories before he was fascinated to discover that they were not only stories of the great warwhat the elves called among themselves the second warbut the first war as well fought so long ago that humans had not yet been civilized it was oddly sobering to realize that the gentle supremely cultivated elvesso polite that they considered a direct question to be the height of barbarian rudenesshad been a warrior people since before his own folk had discovered fire but perhaps that was the very reason why they placed so high a value on peace and civilization most afternoons were spent with deyishene and kellen was already a much better rider than he had been when he began hed ended up being introduced to the elven lance after all though there was little likelihood kellen would ever use it under combat conditions learning to handle itwithout breaking it taught grace balance and concentration kellen had already broken half a dozen when he wasnt actually busy at the house of sword and shield kellen was mindful of the promise he had made to sandalon and spent as many hours with the young prince as he could he even brought him to visit at the house of sword and shieldafter obtaining master belesharons permission of course and showed him all around there was no reason according to jermayan that sandalon should not someday train as an elven knight if he chose to someday if he ever gets out of that fortress before hes got a long grey beard if elves grow beards that is ashaniel had broken the news to sandalon that he would be going away to the crowned horns with the rest of the elven children not long after the meeting at which the plan was decided and for a few days the boy had been upset and unhappy but sandalon was very young and as the leavetaking didnt happen immediately after a sennight or two the young prince seemed to forget the matter entirely but today when kellen went out to the stables to deyishene he found sandalon and shalkan both there waiting outside her stall the young prince had obviously been crying though his tears were under control now and he smiled dolefully when he saw kellen i am to gothe day after tomorrow sandalon blurted out obviously unable to contain the unhappy news one moment longer than necessary oh there didnt seem to be very much to say but kellen tried but there will be children from all the nine cities thereperhaps you will make new friends i am sure that there will be at least one person who is almost exactly your age and there may be more think sandalon how good it will be when there are several others around you who want to do the same things that you do and play the same games that you like sandalon was too well mannered even at five to contradict kellen but his face plainly said that he found the possibility highly unlikely will you there will be a great many knights riding with us and unicorns too maybe but kellen was already shaking his head im sorry sandalon im just starting to learn all the things a proper knight has to know i still have a lot more to learn before i get to do something that important oddly enough his answermeant in all honestysent sandalon off into a fit of the giggles and even shalkan swiveled his ears and coughed indicating the unicorn was trying very hard not to laugh out loud after a moment kellen realized why and grinned sheepishly a short time ago hed destroyed the black cairn just about singlehandedly and now he was saying that something as simple as convoying a bunch of kids through peaceful territory to a welldefended stronghold was too difficult for him and put that way it did sound ridiculous but a job like that was a lot more complicated than just riding off with jermayan and shalkan into the unknown and kellen couldnt afford to spend the time away from his lessons go ahead laugh at me both of you kellen said goodnaturedly but master belesharon would not think i was a very good student if i asked to be released from my lessons just because something more interesting came along i have a lot to learn right here but i dont think he would mind too much if we took tomorrow off to go exploring just the four of us the four of us sandalon asked doubtfully you and me and shalkan and vestakia i thought id ask vestakia to come with usif you didnt mind of course hed seen very little of vestakia since hed begun training at the house of sword and shieldof course kellen had seen very little of anyone but his fellow students idalia had assured him that vestakia was doing perfectly well and understood the reason for kellens absence but he missed the easy comradeship theyd shared on the road and wanted to see for himself that she was okay a picnic should be the perfect opportunity and nothing could go wrong with shalkan there to play chaperon oh no sandalon said happily vestakias nice and she isnt nearly as bossy as lairamo is then its settled providing your nurse and my master both agree kellen said though he doubted master belesharon would have any objections to kellen spending a day making sandalon feel a little better about being sent away now want to come watch me practice you might be doing this yourself someday after all i will sandalon said enthusiastically im going to become a knight just like you and jermayan and win all the flower wars just like he does later kellen would look back at the day he spent roaming through the hills beyond sentarshadeen with shalkan vestakia and sandalon as the last truly serene day he was to spend for a very long time but at the time he only thought of it as his farewell to sandalon and a way of making the childs departure less painful though idalia had told him that there was to be a break in the weather in fact it had rained most of the day but none of them had minded when vestakia had left him at the end of the day kellen had been unsettled by more than the strain of the thoughts forbidden by his geas though shalkan had kept him from getting into any real difficulty as he took deyishene back to the stables he found himself wondering if and hoping he was going to havea future that included vestakia he found himself simply wanting her company quite apart from anything else she was simply the best friend he had ever had she was clever she was kind she knew how to have fun and how to make it too but with the storm clouds of shadow mountain gathering on the horizon he couldnt quite make himself believe that any kind of future much less a peaceful one with vestakia in it was ever going to exist he wasnt used to thinking that far ahead and he wasnt used to feeling thisgrimabout things idalia was the dour introspective oneand all kellens attempts to try and get a grip on the situation only left him feeling troubled for no reason that he could put his finger on fortunately shalkan interrupted his thoughts before he sank too deeply into depression the caravan will be leaving from the house of leaf and star tomorrow before dawn youll want to be there i dont know kellen said surprised at the suggestion elves arent much on big goingaway ceremonies i thought no shalkan agreed but youll want to see it just the same dont worry ill make sure youre here in plenty of time the next morning the unicorn routed kellen out of his cozy bed in what seemed to be the middle of the night it was still dark when the two of them made their way through the sleeping city back to the house of leaf and star but the convoy was already gathered most of the supplies that the evacuees would need at the fortress of the crowned horns had already been sent on ahead these wagons would only carry supplies for the journey and the people themselves there were two wagons for the children and their attendants to sleep and travel in they looked like houses on wheels down to the softlyglowing colored lanterns hung from each corner and were drawn by four mules each four more wagons carried what kellen supposed must be supplies and camping gear for the rest of the party and each of those had six mules hitched to it kellen assessed the caravan with a newly practiced eye seeming to feel master belesharon standing over his shoulder it was true that a herd of thirtytwo mules was a lot to take care ofand carry feed forand certainly both the carts and the wagons could be drawn by fewer but if some went lame on the road there would be no place to get replacements better kellen supposed to start with more animals than you needed than have to turn back then there was a sudden drumming of hooves and kellen saw the real reason shalkan had brought him here the elven knights had arrived and only some of them were riding horses the unicorns dancedthere was no other word for itas if the earth could not hold them down they sprang forward ahead of the horses circling the wagons once as if to make sure all was well then trotting off to stand in an easy formation a little ways off in the meadow while the equestrian knights distributed themselves closely around the wagons i thought youd like to see that shalkan commented the doors of the house of leaf and star opened kellen was too far away to hear what was saidhed come only to see not to intrudebut he saw andoreniel and ashaniel standing there bidding a last farewell not as sandalons parents kellen realized but as the rulers of the elves slowly the little party exited the portico and climbed into the wagons the drivers climbed onto their seats and the train began to move off the unicorn knights stood watching it for a moment the horns of their mounts gleaming faintly in the first pale rays of dawn then trotted briskly after it quickly passing the wagons and forging on ahead well kellen said with a sigh i guess its time to go to work at the end of her seventh rising following that walk in the stone garden savilla was pleased to see that zyperis had been driven halfmad with curiosity he had wooed her favor with every gift and attention he could think of including the gift of several of his own personal slaves to do with as she wished all this was most satisfactory and in addition proved two things one that he was still submissive enough to be malleable and two that his clandestine sources of information within her personal household were not as welldeveloped as he might wish for if there had been some way for zyperis to discover her intentions on his own he would certainly have done it but having made her point she was prepared to relent before he turned sullen besides it was such a lovely plan that it would be a shame to have no one to share it with that rising she commanded zyperiss attendance and after the business of her courtiers had been dealt with she drew him aside i have a lovely surprise for you my dear she said her voice husky and playful come with me she took him to a small chamber nestled among her private rooms its walls ceiling and floor were made of ivory intricately joined and carved the walls were golden with age for the room was very old a place to summon visions and see what must be seen the floor should perhaps have been the same warm golden hue but it was not instead it was a deep brown like old leather for centuries of shed blood had permanently darkened it a small ebony table stood in the center of the room and on it was a large shallow bowl carved from one piece of black obsidian it gleamed in the light of the shining golden orbs burning overhead a naked human girl knelt beside the table waiting with utter stillness her long blonde hair was elaborately jeweled and coiled on top of her head and every inch of her pale skin had been intricately painted when the two endarkened entered the room she did not move she had been very well trained one of those humans who was taken captive so young she remembered no other world than this and no other way of life than service to her demon masters she had been zyperiss most recent gift to his mother fill the bowl queen savilla said holding out a small ebony and crystal knife to her son he did not hesitate a moment if anything his eyes lit with avidity come here precious zyperis said to the girl he took the knife as the human slave got to her feet and stood as he directed her he positioned her so she was standing in front of the obsidian bowl and he was standing behind her with quick precise movements he bent her forward turned her head to the side and cut into the pulsing vein in the side of her neck the bowl rang faintly as the girls hot blood spurted into it and she gasped and at last began to struggle zyperis held her firmly until she quieted and then lifted her body off the floor so that it would drain more easily it does seem something of a waste he observed watching the blood fill the bowl for it to be over so quickly you know theres very little sport in the tame ones savilla said consideringly and we can enjoy her later filendek does thrive upon a challenge and he has been complaining that i do not tax his culinary skills enough of late but come now i will satisfy your wanton curiosity my son the bowl was full and zyperis tossed the girls body aside leaning eagerly over the bowl of steaming blood savilla joined him show me what i wish to see the queen commanded staring into the bowl of shimmering blood the surface of the bowl shimmered going from dark to pale faint shadows began to swirl mistily beneath its surface then grew brighter as the images in the bowl steadied into mirror sharpness zyperis looked into the bowl and saw a caravan of elves moving through a wintry landscape six wagonsfour obviously carrying nothing but provisions and perhaps twenty outriders at least a third of them mounted on unicorns more elves mother zyperis protested but why show me this when you have decreed that we must let the caravans pass unharmed no matter how tempting the opportunity and elves motherit has been so long since we have had elves to play with oh yes it is true that i have allowed the previous caravans to make their way to that annoying fortress of theirs unmolested but unfortunatelyfor the elves and their little princenothing lasts forever the party from sentarshadeen had been on the road for nearly two sennights and by now they were deep into the mountains although back in sentarshadeen it was no more than early autumn here the hand of winter rested implacably on the land the snowfall had already been heavyonly the unicorns found it easy goingand at the village of girizethiel the party had transferred from wheeled wagons to sledges fortunately the trail had been wellbroken by the previous convoys the day was overcast and it was snowing lightly but steadily though the wagonmaster who had made this trip several times before said that the snow would grow thicker throughout the day visibility was already bad with the prankish wind whipping up veils of powdered snow and carrying them through the air to cloud the sight if they had not been where they were ciradhel would have been more concerned about a possible ambush but the fortress of the crowned horns was well within the borders of the elven lands and all patrols had reported the land secure for moonturns ciradhel was more worried about keeping his young charges from getting into trouble along the way kalania was no more than a babe in arms and hieretsur kept her young charge well under wraps and tredianala was a shy girl who stayed close to her nurse and rarely ventured away from the wagons at any time but her cousin merisashendiel was her opposite in every way always underfoot and into everything wanting to explore at every stop no matter how brief it was she and vendalton were partners in every kind of innocent mischief and wherever the two of them led prince sandalon would inevitably follow ciradhel found it hard to begrudge the youngsters their youthful high spirits for it was hard for them he knew to travel such a long distance to live in a strange place when you were so very young as for alkandoran he had already begun his training as a knight and had argued long and hard that he should be allowed to remain to defend sentarshadeen against possible attack but he was far too younglittle though he thought itso over his protests he had joined the others he continued to let his unhappiness be felt despite ciradhels assurances that his knightly training could continue at the fortress ciradhel clucked to jilka and the elven mare trotted forward over the snow to where rhavelmo sat upon calmeren waiting for the convoy to make its slow way past the unicorns white coat was a perfect match for the snow where it was not covered by the saddle and armor it was fluffed out against the cold giving the little creature a downy appearance that almost made the unicorn seem insubstantial her horn glistened like ice another day and well be rid of them rhavelmo said looking up at him her rosecolored armor and cloak were already powdered with a fresh fall of snow we should reach the crowned horns by midday evening at the latest look you can already see itor you could if not for this blasted weather she pointed automatically ciradhel looked all that was to be seen was white and more white but he had been here many years before and let imagination show him what his eyes could not the fortress of the crowned horns did not occupy the highest peak in the mystral range but as idalia had told kellen it had never been taken by an enemy nor could it be the fortress had been carved out of the living rock thousands of years past in the days when the elves had faced the endarkened for the very first time the surface of the mountain had been made too steep and smooth for a dragon to land upon it and the very top of the fortressthe only level placewas too small and too welldefended to be accessible by darktainted dragons the only access to the fortress was up a long narrow causeway that led to the outer gates the causeway was so narrow that only one cart could travel up it at a time and at need the defenders had a hundred ways of rendering it completely impassable it will be faster going back too if we dont have to wait for the wagons calmeren said hopefully switching her tail to shake it free of snow faster even with the wagons ciradhel pointed out since theyll be all but empty and we cant leave them unprotected even if there arent wait calmeren said the unicorn shifted raising her head and turning into the wind her nostrils flared as she inhaled deeply suddenly there was a faint howl in the distance a single eerie ululating wail it hung alone on the air for a moment and then was joined by others a chilling wolflike chorus but all three of them knew that whatever creature had made that sound it wasnt a wolf we have to run calmeren said now neither of the knights considered doubting the unicorns word there would be time for questions and incredulity later whenifthey were all safe ciradhel cast one despairing glance at the wagons they could not possibly move any faster especially in this weather bring in the unicornsquickly well put the children on them he said calmeren and rhavelmo sprang away and ciradhel turned jilka back to the wagons stop the wagons everyone out bring your cloaks tuikaheneleunhitch the teams as fast as you can cut the harness if you have to naeretemessadeget the children onto the unicorns we have to run for it he swung down off jilkas back and strode forward running tallies in his head seven unicornssix children each of the unicornmounted knights could take one of the childrenkalania could go in her nurses armsand they would send sandalons nurse on the last of them that left thirteen warhorses seven of which would have to carry an extra passenger but no one would be left behind for whatever was making that howling noise this is most unexpected hieretsur protested coming down the steps of the wagon with kalania in her arms there is no time to explain ciradhel snapped calmeren had returned with the others and he seized the nurse and deposited her on the unicorns back run he said like the wind calmeren agreed and bounded off there was another chorus of howlscloserand this time everyone heard it one presumes that is what we are running from naeret said her nervousness showing in her stonelike expression she settled vendalton in front of vikaets rider and the black unicorn took off after the others yes ciradhel said briefly now only sandalon and lairamo were left i will see you again soon lairamo said firmly setting sandalon into the saddle in front of dainelel his unicorn sprang into motion the moment the boy was settled following the others lairamo looked at ciradhel perhaps she began he will need you go lairamo climbed carefully up behind the last of the unicorn knights and it followed the rest getting the children onto the unicorns had been the work of moments and it had taken easily as long to finish unhitching the mules and to get the wagon drivers and the rest of the childrens companions onto horseback now ciradhel sent those carrying double off after the others the mules had caught the scent carried upon the wind and though normally the most docile and wellmannered of creatures they had been terrified the moment they were free they had fled across the ice slipping and skidding in their haste to be away tuika and henele had not been able to properly unhitch the last teams and had simply cut the main traces as the mules fought to be free even the elven destriers were agitated looking to their riders for reassurance what about the rest of us naeret asked falling easily into war manners ciradhel smiled at her swinging up onto jilkas back and loosening his sword in its sheath he looked around at his four remaining companions i thought we might go see what is making that infernal racket were you all so inclined he answered politely they were barely a hundred meters from the wagons when the pack appeared in the distance a shimmering patch of darker silver in the snow beyond it the five could see a small army of moving upright figures the sunlight glittered off their armor and weapons and the elves could see the faint shimmer of the magic protecting those of them for whom sunlight was lethal frostgiantsicetrollsand a pack of coldwarg ciradhel said grimly all ancient allies of the enemy how could they come here without our knowing naeret demanded her voice high with outrage and anger the cold is their element abrodiel eldest of them all said come ciradhel said spurring jilka forward we must buy the others as much time as we can coldwarg had been created by endarkened sorcery during the great war they were nearly the size of a unicorn with enormous jaws capable of ripping out the throat of a horseor a manin one bite in the last war the enemy had needed to spellshield them on the battlefield for coldwarg suffered in the heat and died when the temperature grew too warm but here in the mountains they were in their element ciradhel knew that he and his companions were doomed it was a small packnot much more than a dozen beastsbut five knights could not hope to kill them all and the creatures that followed all they could hope for was to kill some of them and to buy the rest of the party precious time to escape and because they were trying to stop the pack not save themselves they could not use the one maneuver that would give them any hope of survival grouping into a tight pack to protect one another bows first then swords ciradhel said spread out into a line the five elves charged down the slope directly into the coldwarg pack the frostgiants cheered when they saw the elves and their shambling turned into a trot and then into an eager run the battle cries of the elven knights mingled with the howls of the coldwarg they shot until their quivers were empty but the arrows had little effect on the monsters though every shaft found its mark then they drew their swords and the battle was joined the elven destriers fought viciously with teeth and steelshod hooves but one after another they went down beneath the tide of dappled silver bodies then it was the turn of their riders ciradhel saw naeret stagger to her feet over ashtess fallen body the crippled stallion was screaming and thrashing trying to rise as a coldwarg ripped at his belly blood fountained from the stump of naerets swordarm and as she fumbled in the snow for her sword another coldwarg leaped for her throat she went down one of the beasts leaped at jilkas throat jilka danced back and ciradhel struck at the coldwarg with his sword feeling a hot flash of pleasure to see the blade bite deep into the hellbeasts shoulder the coldwarg sprang back jaws gaping wide and pink tongue lolling its yellow eyes danced with a feral amusement its only a matter of time the beasts gaze seemed to say it turned and loped off in the direction of the caravan ashtes had stopped screaming henele was trapped beneath his fallen horse its head was gone two coldwarg were on him one with its jaws clamped around each arm they were pulling shaking their heads and growling like puppies with a toy henele should have been screaming but he made no sound and from that ciradhel knew he was already dead they were all dead all but him why he looked around the surviving coldwarg had broken off their attack to take up the pursuit of the others again and the marauders that had followed the pack had arrived nice puppies to save one for dalak the frostgiant said giggling nastily a highpitched sound that sat ill with the giants size and bulk you go on he said to the others this ones mine ciradhel used those precious moments to assess the enemy on the faint chance he would ever be able to make a report there were a full dozen icetrolls all wearing talismans to protect them against the sun for they were creatures of night and caves their skin was the pale blue of pack ice and they wore nothing more than a narrow loincloth whether male or female for they needednor wantedno protection from the cold around their necks they wore elaborate collars of bones taken from their dead enemies and carried bags which contained their hunting implements their main weapon was a bone atlatl a notched rod with which they could launch polished bone shafts with deadly force and skill there were twice their number of frostgiants in the band and they were formidable foes the shortest of them was twice ciradhels height they had hair the color of frost and pale eyes andunlike some of their cousinsno need of protection from the sun frostgiants were notable smiths and metalworkers and all the giants wore articulated plate armor wellpadded with fur against the cold but despite their ability at crafting swords the frostgiants preferred weapon was the club and it was a club that dalak unlimbered now swinging it back and forth as he smiled at ciradhel the others grumbled at being denied a chance to watch the fun but dalak seemed to be their leader and after a few moments of indecision they complied lumbering off after the coldwarg with stupefying speed come little elf i promise ill be gentle dalak rumbled and you will reach the cold hells long before most of your friends and i shall wish the same for you ciradhel said politely he urged jilka forward dalak had superior reach but ciradhel and jilka were faster they were equally matched and ciradhel began to hope he might win at the very least every moment he could delay dalak left the marauders without their leader but suddenly he felt a rushing presence above him and a burning pain in his shoulders as great talons seized him shearing through his armor as if it were silk something lifted him from his saddle he cried out dalak stepped forward swinging his club with all his strength it hit the side of jilkas head and ciradhel heard her neck snap then dalak reached up and grabbed him by the ankle there was a tearing pain a shrill soundless cry that lanced through ciradhels head and suddenly he lay upon the ground looking up at the frostgiant dalak put his boot on ciradhels chest say goodbye to the light little elf dalak said raising his club again and then ciradhel knew nothing more the seven doubleburdened warhorses ran over the snow in the direction of the crowned horns none of the knights knew what they fled from but no one was foolish enough to disregard calmerens warning and all of them had heard the howling the unicorns were far ahead springing over the snow at their fastest pace one that no horse could match athonere hoped they and their precious cargo could reach the safety of the fortress he cursed the fell weather if the day had been clear the sentries would have been able to see them they might even have been able to see what lay behind the fleeing party but even if that had been true none of them could have expected assistance from those within the citadel the defenders would not have dared to come out lest this be a trap a ruse to lure them away from the children they guarded just then athonere saw a flash of movement through the veils of blowing snow as a sinuous rill of silver fur flowed over the snow easily passing the galloping horses they seemed to be monstrous misshapen wolves some of them were bleeding from fresh sword cuts and several had the stumps of elven arrows protruding from their necks and shoulders but despite the blood that starred the snow in their wake they moved with terrifying fleetness no not wolves coldwarg athonere risked a glance behind himand saw over his passengers shoulder a host of squat bluish creatures running toward them moving nearly as fast as the galloping horses without slowing they began to hurl objects toward the mounted knights the woman clinging to athoneres back screamed she thrashed frantically for a moment then fell from the saddle before he could catch her one of the horses beside athonere grunted heavily and went down its hind legs tangled in a contraption of stones and leather cord the force of its fall spilled both the knight and his passenger into the snow with stunning force athonere reined in turning back his passenger was lying in the snow three shafts protruding from her back dead screamselven and animaltold him that more icetroll shafts were finding their mark their only safety lay in attack lest more of their charges be slaughtered as they fled he drew his sword and charged into the mob of icetrolls to me to me he shouted but the icetrolls refused to stand and fight they scampered back and forth across the hardpacked snow calling mocking taunts in an unknown tongue trying to lure the knights off the trail and into the drifts and always came the deadly volleys of hardflung arrows though the knights returned fire with their own bowsthose who had not given them to arm the surviving caravan driversthey missed more often than not for the icetrolls were fastmoving and hard to see and to stand still long enough to take aim was to become an attractive target theyre waiting for something luamzir said grimly shed recovered from her fall though perta had not been as fortunate merisashendiels nurse had had no armor to protect her and lay dead in the snow and though luamzir had cut the leathern cords from panoraks legs the animal was dead lame barely able to stand much less run we dare not runand they will not fight athonere said grimly if only it would stop snowing suddenly the ground began to shake a moment more and the frostgiants were upon them at least the children are safe athonere thought neither trolls nor giants could outrun a unicorn the seven unicorns ran steadily through the blowing snow calmeren in the lead suddenly there was a high shrill wailing that made her head hurt she sprang sideways crouching and staggering as something swooped down out of the sky and passed low above her head she heard the sound of claws grate against rhavelmos armor and hieretsur screamed theyre here calmeren cried the stench of the enemy in her nostrils and the other unicorns wheeled and stood searching for the foe there were shadowy shapes in the sky difficult to see through the blowing snow wheeling over them like a flock of carrion birds no rhavelmo vaulted down from the saddle and pushed hieretsur forward go run calmeren gave rhavelmo one agonized glance and sprang forward again rhavelmo unlimbered her bow and shot a dozen arrows into the sky it was a difficult mark but her aim was true one of the creatures fell to eartha monstrous bat its body as large as a mans its fur and its wings as white as the snow itself it thrashed in its death agonies red eyes gleaming with mad hatred all around her the knights were quickly dismounting it was the best chance they could give the unicorns carrying the children and lairamo because the children must be saved at all costs you must be strong now prince sandalon hold tight to queverians saddle and dont let go whatever you do dainelel said quickly the boy nodded too frightened to speak take care of him my love he said to queverian a tremor in his voice i will the unicorn said and sandalon had no time to say anything more for she was off speeding across the snow with death flying ever nearer overhead calmeren had barely hit her stride again when more of the batthings began to dive upon her slashing at her face and worse at the precious burden she carried they stank of taint and carrion and try as she might she could not escape them she found herself turning away from the crowned horns fighting to keep from being driven into the deep snow away from the trail none of the others fared any better the younger children cried out in fear as the monstrous bats swooped down through the storm snatching at them she had nearly made up her mind to make a dash back the way she had come when the coldwarg pack arrived and they were not alone appearing out of the storm like ghosts were a host of cloaked and hooded figures their white garb rendering them nearly invisible against the snow at first she thought they were elves come to their rescue then she knew they were not all carried long spears do what you must she cried to the others but run a coldwarg leaped at her she reared to meet its charge praying that hieretsur could hold on she thrust her horn into the wolfthings belly and shook her head savagely flinging its dying body aside teeth raked her unarmored flank and she spun and kicked at the new foe a yelp told her that her sharp hooves had connected then leathery wings enfolded her head blinding her enormous wings battered at her with punishing force and she felt hieretsurs weight leave her saddle she could hear baby kalania wailing in terror and pain she felt sharp claws scrabbling at her throat and chest shearing through her armored collar and raking into the flesh beneath she shook her head savagely and felt her horn slide into the leather of its wing but these were not creatures of dark magic to die at the touch of a unicorns horn blindly and desperately she fought hearing screams all around her and the yelps and howls of the coldwarg at last she managed to drag the monster beneath her hooves to trample it the childrenwhere are the children she heard faint screams overhead looking up she saw two of the batcreatures soaring away bodies struggling in their claws the snow was red with blood the other unicorns some dead some mortally wounded lay on the snow the coldwarg were quarreling over the bodies the cloaked figures moved through the carnage checking for survivors and gathering up fallen weapons at the moment no one was looking at her calmeren moved silently as only a unicorn could away from the battlefield when she was sure she was concealed by the storm she began to run with utter determination agony lancing through her with every step sentarshadeen must be warned whatever the cost when idalia had brought the rains safely to the elven lands with the wild magic there had been as always a price it had been a high one and a hard one to accept but she had weighed the cost in lives and pain if she did not and made her bargain the price for the power to save the nine cities had been her lifebut it seemed that the gods were slow to collect she had been surprised to awaken from her working trance at all and had spent a sennight in the house of leaf and star recovering from the heavy demands the magic had placed upon her body each day had been a gift and an odd surprise but she had come to realize that gods time was not the same as mortals they had accepted her bargain and would collect upon it in their own good time but she knew that every hour she lived now was borrowed when kellen had returned from the barrier and she had healed him idalia had almost grown used to that but then she received another unsettling reminder of how much things had changed when she summoned up the power to heal her brother no personal price was asked of her and there was always a price to the wildmage over and above the personal power expended but no longer wildmagery still drained her personal energy just as it always had but now no additional obligation was set upon her when she did her work as if all prices had already been paid perhaps they had perhaps accepting the greatest price she could pay had negated the need to pay any other ever as much as possible she tried to forget the choice she had made trying to live in the present moment as the elves did when she was not with jermayan she went where she was needed in sentarshadeen or worked steadily at creating a store of items that would be useful later when shadow mountain showed its hand at last tarnkappa were the most obvious of these cloaks that would conceal all sight sound and scent of the wearer from enemy detection such things would be useful for spies and scouts but each one took sennights to complete and she had other things to do as well the distillation of medicines that only a wildmage could make the elves were master herbalists and she had learned many of the recipes she used from them but even their most potent cures for taint and shadowed poison were stronger when infused with a wildmages power no one questioned the obsessive haste with which she worked the elves thought all humans rushed around anyway only kellen would have noticed anything out of the ordinary in her behavior and he was away from dawn until well after dusk these days engrossed in learning all that his elven masters could teach him about the way of the sword gone was the gawky unsure boy who had ridden into her forest clearing half a year ago on shalkans back halfdead of his wounds gone even was the uncertain halftrained young wildmage who had set out with jermayan to destroy the barrier no one would ever call kellen tavadon clumsy again in or out of armor and now that he had accepted his knightmage gifts there was an assurance a maturity to him that simply hadnt been there before and had he stayed in armethalieh there never would have been that assurance not with the way lycaehn tavadon tried to break his spirit idalia thought with a rare flash of spitefulness idalias happiest hours of all were spent with jermayan in his home every hourevery momentwas a gift that might not come again and certainly would not last the temperature had been dropping for the last sennight and the morning frosts and fogs had been growing heavier to complicate matters though the rain had lessened recently it had never really stopped it had turned to sleet instead so that everything became covered with an increasinglythick shell of ice beautiful but treacherous even the simplest journey became fraught with unexpected peril and the newest article of outdoor wear was cleatbottomed sabatons to strap over ones boots for the navigation of the icecovered streets crews went out at intervals day and night to use simple minor magics to break the ice from the tree branches lest the branches themselves snap under the weight of the ice with all the ice it was no longer possible for kellen to work with deyishene in the afternoons as the practiceground had become a solid sheet of ice too slippery to use master belesharon said he would be able to resume his practice once the snows came for snow provided a less treacherous footing than ice but at the moment kellens afternoons were spent with extra sword practice it had also become necessary to begin laying out fodder for the horses since the meadow grass was fast being covered by the ice but neither activity took as much of his time as working with deyishene had it gave him a lot of time to think about other things one afternoon he left the house of sword and shield early and went home to change into his best clothes he intended to go to the house of leaf and star and ask a favor of ashanielif she would see him and since he was going to ask a favor it only made sense to look as if he really meant to approach the queen with the greatest of respect when he opened the doorhaving stopped on the porch to shake frozen sludge from his heavy hooded cloakhe saw idalia leaning over a large bowl on the table peering into it intently she glanced up when she saw him startled kellen i wasnt expecting you this early ive got an errand to run and i thought id change first what are you doing he asked coming over and peering down at the bowl it was a large blueglazed bowl of heavy pottery filled to the brim with water scryingor trying to normally id try this at one of the springs but id rather not freeze solid and i havent been having any luck anyway she sighed ive been trying to see whats been going on back in the wildwood after the scouring hunt went through there ive been trying to find out for moonturns actually but my scrying wont show me anything reliable its supposed to show you what you need to see not what you want to see kellen reminded her yes idalia agreed and nothing ive seen makes any sense from that point of view either really just a lot of flowers want me to try kellen offered well a change is as good as a rest so they say idalia said if you wouldnt mind i would be glad of your help she sighed perhaps im just trying too hard the ingredientsfern leaf dried at this time of year and winewere ready beside the bowl kellen cast four drops of the wine into the bowl and then floated a bit of the fern leaf on the water you who travel between earth and sky show me what you see he said he remembered the first time hed scryed in the spring behind idalias cabin in the wildwood how reluctant and resentful hed been at having to try and how sure hed been it wouldnt work now it seemed an obvious and natural thing to do the vision came immediately the water in the bowl turned white snowstorm idalia said since she could see what kellen saw not really helpful kellen said peering into the bowl unless this just means theres a really really big blizzard going on somewhereor coming straight at us which it is i cant tell even if theres something there i ought to see i cant see it as if taking exception to his comments the snowstorm faded and was replaced with the image of a face it was a young man about kellens age his face bore the unmistakable stamp of magebreeding he had auburn hair and pale blue eyes and looked angryor possibly scared or both kellen knew that feeling only too well he was wearing the pale grey caprobeandtabard of the entered apprentice wherever he was it was dark for kellen and idalia could see nothing more than his head and shoulders then that image too faded and the bowl held nothing but water once more kellen frowned i think i know himor knew him but i dont remember his name why show me that though its not as if im going back to armethaliehor an apprentice is ever going to leave it who knows idalia asked what i do know is that if i cant get any sense out of this pesky bowl of water i think im going to have to take a trip over the border to see for myself how things are in the wild lands that will serve a double purpose as i can warn the crofters and the high hills that the enemy is on the move again maybe i can convince jermayan to go with me i dont think youll have much of a problem there kellen said grinning i think youd have a lot harder time keeping him from coming with you he picked up the heavy bowl carefully and walked over to the sink to pour out its contents chapter six the room of fire and water calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink an hour later suitably dressed kellen presented himself at the house of leaf and star ice had turned the entire building into something magical and the elves connoisseurs of natural beauty had left it as it was every surface was covered with a thick sheet of nearly transparent ice so that the house took on the unreality of a structure cast out of colored glass long icicles hung down from the eaves and each one was filled with rainbows from the watery sunlight kellen knocked at the front door and when it was opened asked if the lady ashaniel would receive himor to be more precise he suggested to the august personage who answered his knock that it would give him very great pleasure to attend upon the lady ashaniel if she happened to be at home and was willing to take time from her busy day to allow him to do so be welcome within our house kellen wildmage the august personage told him bowing kellen bowed backhis bows were much improved after a few fortnights under master belesharons tutelageand he followed the elf into a small side parlor i will see to your refreshment the august personage said closing the doors behind him as he departed it was only after hed left that kellen realized the man hadnt said hed tell ashaniel that kellen was here but he supposed shed find out eventually he doubted there was much that went on beneath her roof that the lady ashaniel didnt know about even if he had to wait a long time there was much here to keep his attention at one end of the room was an enormous fireplace its elaborate hearth stretching all the way to the ceiling it was designed after the fashion of a dragonthe hearth being in the bellyand the outswept wings were carried out in tiles that covered the entire wall of the room a cheerful fire leaped and crackled on the hearth it was an astonishingly cheerfullooking dragon quite friendly in fact more like a winged cat with scales than a dragon the artist had managed to convey the impression that this dragon not only did not mind that its belly was being used to warm the room but positively welcomed the idea at the opposite end of the room a fountain played a column of water bubbled high into the air falling back into itself and down into its catchbasin there were glittering motes of color caught within the water coming closer and inspecting it kellen realized they were tiny shapes of colored glass but they were moving too fast for him to be able to tell quite what they were meant to represent i see that the fireandwater room pleases you ashaniel observed from behind him kellen turned around while hed been studying the fountain ashaniel had entered the room morusil with her a servant entered behind them bringing a wheeled cart with teathings yes it does very much kellen answered honestly looking aroundnow that he was not so thoroughly distracted by the fountainhe could see that the end of the room with the dragon fireplace was decorated in reds and oranges and fire motifs while the other end where the fountain was ran to greens and violets and the walls were covered not with tiles but with seashells in every shape and size it should have looked garish or busy but somehow it managed to be a harmonious whole and morusil he said bowing i am happy to see you again and i to see you and to have the opportunity to thank you for bringing me such an eager student morusil replied i am glad that vestakia has found a friend in you kellen said as sincerely as he could manage your wisdom inspires her and your encouragement heartens her it is always a privilege to hear the words of the young morusil said but you will have come to visit with ashaniel and i do not wish to intrude i dont wish to interfere with your plans but i would welcome your company as well kellen said hopefully then we shall all take tea ashaniel said decisively they settled themselves around the fire and the servant set out the teapot the cups and a plate of assorted cakes on a small table between them when she had left ashaniel and morusil began discussing the weather and the prospects for the winter running dance which would be held on the first full moon after the first snowfall which was expected any day now perhaps you will not wish to participate in the dance young kellennot everyone does you knowbut it is quite beautiful and few humans have seen it morusil said i am quite certain it is worthy of seeing kellen agreed politely elves do not rush he reminded himself and it would be nice to finally know what a winter running dance was since people had been mentioning it one way and another since hed gotten here but though we find your company agreeable of course and it has been too long since you visited the house of leaf and star i think perhaps you did not come to talk upon these subjects ashaniel said with a teasing smile kellen found himself smiling in return halfdazzled as always by her beauty i am afraid ive come for something else and perhaps to raise a subject that you will find tiresome for i have probably spoken of it far too much for your comfort morusil and ashaniel exchanged a look one that kellen was unable to interpret it is to be hoped that you will always feel free to speak your heart here in the house of leaf and star morusil said after a pause even if the ways of humans are not our ways there is often much wisdom to be gained from listening to the words of those who are unlike ourselves the two elves regarded kellen expectantly kellen took a deep breath trying to get everything he was about to say organized in his mind i know im not going to get this all right but at the council meeting i know you really didnt want to send someone to tell armethalieh about thethe enemy because well you didnt think it would do any good and you thought it might make matters worse and you might be right but well what ifi mean that might not be true and they need to know they hate dethe enemy there really they do the reason i was cast out was that they believe that the wildmages are allied withthe other side if they knew the enemy were active again they might not help usthey probably wouldntbut theyd at least protect themselves and thats important too so is theremaybe theres some way to get a message to armethalieh that theyd listen to because i think its important to try at least he swallowed his mouth gone dry despite his tea feeling as if he must have sounded as clumsy as an untutored bumpkin and i think we ought to try as soon as possible i cant tell you why i feel this way because i dont know and even though ive tried scrying it hasnt told me anything but i still do thats all kellen sat back in his seat trying not to look as agitated and anxious as he felt some diplomat he turned out to be but maybe he hadnt been as persuasive as he could have been maybe secretly he didnt want armethalieh to be warned because he still resented the golden city but he wanted to be able to sayassuming anyone ever asked that hed done everything he could to save it maybe he should go himself or try to perhaps with a suitable disguise i think perhaps that you are right kellen knightmage ashaniel said after a very long pause perhaps we have been overhasty in dismissing the threat the enemy poses in human lands certainly a timely word of warning would not go amiss could the golden city be persuaded to accept it yet the selection of a proper envoy is a delicate matter i would say that it must be either bevar or hyandur morusil said consideringly both have been to the golden city in the pastthough not for many years of courseand both are familiar with the ways of humans i shall speak to each of them within the moonturn to see if he is willing to go i believe that one of them will be and if he is he will leave before the heavy snows rest assured young kellen warning of the enemys intentions will be carried to the human city in a timely fashion though whether it may be successfully delivered is something which only the gods themselves may say thank you both kellen said feelingly i know it doesnt seem like a very important matter to you ashaniel raised her hand silencing him in the tapestry of the weaving of the gods of leaf and star none who are living may see the whole pattern and know its completion ashaniel said gently perhaps the threads of your spinning are as important as the rest perhaps so kellen only hoped the gods thought soand that they could make someone in armethalieh listen to whoever ashaniel and morusil sent about a sennight and a half after the caravan left the first snowfall came to sentarshadeen and a few days after he went to the house of leaf and star kellen awoke to find sentarshadeen transformed once more snow had begun to fall during the night making the whole city silent and white as a result he slept later than usual only to be awakened by a messenger from the house of sword and shield who had come to tell him that master belesharon had decreed that there would be no classes today so that all could honor the first fall of snow kellen stood in the doorway wrapped in his house robe watching the messenger leave he stared up at the sky then looked away quickly blinking and shaking his head snow was dusty and cold he brushed his face clean and stepped back inside closing the door and frowning suspiciously idalia had described snow of course it was fluffy frozen water that fell from the sky in winter whenever it felt like it but theyd barely had rain in the city and the only snow kellen had ever seen was either already on the ground in the city parkssince the mages in charge of the weather made sure it fell only on the parks and only at nightor sold in the city markets in preservationspelled containers it had not been coming down from the sky as if it would fall forever he wasnt sure he liked it was there someone at the door idalia slid open the door of her sleeping room and poked her head out her sleepingbraids hanging loose about her face its snowing she added unnecessarily vinshan came to tell me that there are no classes today were to honor the snow kellen said hoping he didnt sound too grumpy about it he didnt know why but the snow made him feel uneasy as if there were something bad about it then i guess you should do that at least it will be warmer now that its started snowing idalia said which certainly didnt make any sense she retreated back into her room and came out a few moments later her braids secured on top of her head with a few bone pins and wrapped in her favorite winter house robe she moved immediately to the stove and began building up the fire kellen went over to the window and stared gloomily out at the snow it sifted down steadily making everything white even the pines in the forest opposite had turned a pale silvery grey the only spot of color in the landscape was the surface of the swiftlymoving river below will you stop pacing please idalia said a few minutes later youre acting like a caged bear kellen came to himself with a start realizing hed been doing exactly that the teas ready go get dressed have something to eat maybe that will settle you down sheepishly kellen retreated to his room dressing in warm working clothes a halfformed notion brewing in his mind master belesharon had said it would be safe to ride again once the snow had started after all and vinshan hadnt said kellen couldnt go down to the house of sword and shield only that there were going to be no lessons today maybe a workout with deyishene was just what he needed to take the fidgets out and that would be honoring the snow wouldnt it he came back out and accepted a cup of tea from idalia but when she offered him the plate of breakfast pastries kellen found that he wasnt really hungry he tucked a couple of the dried fruit ones into his pockets for laterif he didnt want them deyishene would relish the treat are you feeling all right idalia asked sounding worried im fine kellen said forcing himself to sound as if her question didnt make him want to scream its just well snow takes some getting used to you know it doesnt seem natural maybe thats whats getting on my nerves idalia smiled i keep forgetting you havent seen very much wild weather and the snows going to be especially heavy this winter because the weather patterns are still settling back to normal but youll soon get used to it and its quite beautiful really and warmer kellen said sardonically warmer than bright clear days where everythings covered in ice really youll see idalia said not a lot warmer ill grant you that but even a little can seem like a lot in winter and snow is easier to walk inand overthan ice now that its finally come we can trade our sabatons for snowshoes and the going will be a lot easier if you say so kellen said doubtfully he set down his empty teacup i think ill get going he rubbed his head headache idalia asked not really everything just feels tight ill feel better with a little fresh air and exercise but the feeling didnt go away on the walk down to the stables and by the time kellen reached them he felt definitely unsettled it wasnt anything like the feeling hed had when hed faced the endarkened barriernothing in the world could compare to thatbut it was almost like remembering that feeling he felt touchy and outofsorts and was glad there was no one around to see him but the horses the stable was fuller than hed ever seen it with a number of the animals having come in to seek shelter from the snow an equal number of course were reveling in it romping and rolling in the icy stuff kicking up great plumes of white all of them were in full winter coat by now their heavy coats making them look round and shaggy not at all the sleek gleaming creatures they were at high summer deyishene was glad to see him of course but the elven mare seemed to catch some of his mood as soon as kellen put his hands on her though shed let him groom her and was happy to eat both his breakfast pastries every time he tried to put a saddle on her back she made it clear in no uncertain terms that she wasnt having any and at last he gave up not only the weather but his lady was playing him false today when he finally put the tack away she followed him to the tack room nuzzling at his neck and shoulder as if to try to apologize for something she couldnt explain kellen patted her shoulder resignedly never mind deyishene i guess im just not having any luck today id better go find some place quiet to drown myself he said with a halfhearted grin that is if i dont have to break the ice to do it someplace where i wont make trouble for myself that i just have to clean up later when im feeling better the unicorn meadow and the flower forest beyond was the obvious destination if he was lucky he might run into shalkan who might be able to talk him out of this peculiar mood or at least provide a counterirritantsince shalkan could be very irritating when he tried and the flower forest was beautiful enough to make anyone feel better and it was always warm in there maybe he just missed sandalon more than he thought he would even though sending the elven children to the crowned horns had been a sensible decision their leaving had cast a pall over all of sentarshadeen yes the unicorn meadow was a good choice but he needed to stop at home firstfor a dry cloak and boots a cup of tea and to see if there was anything in the pantry that might serve as unicornbribes if he was lucky idalia might be out honoring the snow herself he had no doubt and he wouldnt inflict his sour mood on her but when he got home not only was idalia there vestakia was with her idalia had been relieved to see kellen leave that morning he was radiating distress like a beaconfinally strong enough to notice it himself though idalia had known there was something notquiteright for a sennight but that wasnt really it it wasnt that something was notquiteright it was that kellen felt there was something notquiteright and that even he didnt feel it strongly enough to notice it consciously she only sensed him sensing it because she knew him so well and finally it was starting to come toward the surface of his conscious attention she didnt want to say anything lest she disrupt the fragile process of his magicassuming it was knightmagery at work and not just growing pains and cause him to lose the intuition completely so she kept quiet although if there were going to be many more days like today she might just settle for burying him in the nearest snowbank and see if hed figured the matter out by spring thaw shed spent a soothing and solitary morning preparing a batch of drawing salvea similar sort to the one jermayan had used on kellens hands and a delicate process because many of the herbs and oils involved were poisonous in the wrong quantitiesand was just preparing to charge it when there was a knock at the door she opened the door to find vestakia standing there bundled in a violet and mulberry cloak crusted with snow looking as bedraggled and woebegone as a halfdrowned kitten vestakia idalia said surprised whats wrong oh i dont know vestakia burst out sounding frustrated irritable and apologetic all at the same time i just i theres just something not right is all i didnt want to be alone and i wasnt quite sure where else to go well come in and have some tea you look halffrozen and tell me what seems to be the problem idalia said resigning herself to the fact that no more work would get done today but friends came first and the poor child looked half out of her mind with worry it isntthe enemy vestakia said immediately stepping inside and hanging up her cloak to dry you know i would have warned everyone if id felt anything like that i just woke up with the worst headache and nothing i can do will make it go away i even tried snowpacks the way i did in the mountains i was hoping there was something you could do to help perhaps a little willowbark syrup idalia suggested but i tried that vestakia cried pettishly nothing works i just feel as if im about to fly into a thousand pieces well come and sit down and have a cup of tea ill see if i can make something up that will help idalia said soothingly now this was puzzling first kellen now vestakiaand vestakia was normally the most well grounded of people with no particular magical gift other than her ability to sense the nearness of demons or strong demonic taint yet idalia felt nothing at all vestakia said that her headache had nothing to do with demonic activity and she should know if anyone did yet if willowbark syrup hadnt had any effect on it idalia hesitated to offer her anything stronger still a little something to calm her nerves wouldnt come amiss and do no harm while the tea was brewing she went to her shelf of tinctures and syrupsit was much easier to work with a number of medicinal herbs when they had been refined this waytook down an elvenware cup from the shelf and prepared a quick mixture including a healthy dose of strong syrup of chamomile she diluted it with a measure of white brandy and stirred it thoroughly then brought it over to vestakia here drink this it should help vestakia took a deep breath and gulped it down quicklyherbal medicines were not noted for tasting good she choked only slightly and took a deep breath afterward thank you i hate to be so much trouble idalia smiled oh dont be silly its a positive relief to have someone come in and ask me straight out for what they want for a change you know i do love the elves but even when they think theyre being direct every conversation always starts with half an hours prattle about clothing and the weatherthe weather is obvious and im not that interested in clothes you know she was relieved to see that shed won a faint smile from vestakia though it was impossible to tell whether vestakia was looking palesince her skin was always a deep cherryredidalia could tell that the lines of tension were starting to fade from around her eyes and mouth though the girl was still very keyedup and now i think the tea is ready they were just finishing their first cupidalia had had little success in getting any more information out of vestakia about her unsettled conditionwhen kellen showed up again if anything he looked even more rattled than when hed left several hours before hed obviously been out in the snow for most of that time because his cloak and boots were crusted heavily with snow in the process of turning to ice he looked sheepish and disgruntled and not very pleased to find people there oh hi he said ungraciously hi yourself idalia said you look like a soggy halffrozen snowrat go change into some dry things then come say hello to vestakia shes got the same headache you have kellen looked rather thunderstruck by the idea that he had a headache at all but meekly went and did as he was bidden he went off to his room coming back a few minutes later in fresh clothes his other cloak bundled under his arm he managed to smile at both of them though idalia could see he was making a real effort to do so im not really fit company for anyone todayhuman or otherwise so deyishene tells meso i thought id take a walk up to the unicorn meadow and let shalkan tell me off i thought id stop back here and see if i could find any suitable bribes first though as luck would have it i have a few things idalia said smiling though with the drought the sugaring certainly isnt what it ought to be this year have some tea while i make you up a package have you eaten kellen winced shaking his head ill eat later he poured himself a large mug of tea though and dropped in several of the crystallized honeydisks that were the usual form of sweetening why dont you take vestakia with you idalia said suddenly im sure shed like to see shalkan again and if the source of vestakias unease was the same as kellens maybe throwing the two of them together would bring it to light more quickly she saw kellen frown then his face abruptly cleared as if the notion suddenly struck him as a good one as well oh no vestakia said quickly you said you wanted to be alone i said i was horrible company kellen corrected her if you dont mind that youre more than welcome to come alongif you dont mind a hike through a blizzard and maybe shalkan wont beat me up as much if he has an audience though i doubt it blizzard vestakia scoffed this little bit of snow in the lost lands we call this autumn id love to go with you if you dont mind then its settled idalia said quickly only youd better take my cloak vestakia i dont think yours is dry yet ill spread it out in front of the stove while youre gone and it should be dry by the time you get back kellen found he was actually glad of vestakias company as they walked through sentarshadeen in the direction of the unicorn meadow everyone seemed to be taking a holiday from their regular tasks today kellen saw a number of elves with brooms out in front of their houses sweeping the paths clear of snowa fruitless task it seemed to him as the stuff was still falling larger horsedrawn brooms were going through the streets making sure that only an inch or two of snow stayed atop the ice everyone worked to clear the snow away but this being sentarshadeenit was not simply being left in piles at the edges of the road certainly not everywhere there was space and raw material fantastic shapes were risinghalf sculpture half structureso that a second city marmoreal and evanescent seemed to be rising in the interstices of the true sentarshadeen kellen and vestakia moved slowly through the streets admiring the display it was strange and beautiful and it made him feel better than he had all morning i just hate all this waiting he said to vestakia as they reached the edge of the city and left the snow sculptures behind i know that it isnt really waitingim training to be a knight and learning so much i need to knowbut at the same time were all just waiting to see what theyre going to do next and that just doesnt feel right when i think about it too much it starts to drive me crazy but its not that i want there to be a war i know vestakia said mournfully its stupid but i keep having this horrible feeling that somethings happeningor has happenedthat i ought to know about that i just cant sense but i wouldnt be able to sense it would i unless it was them or their magic and that cant happen anywhere near here can it so andoreniel and ashaniel say kellen said broodingly his dark mood returning full force but they didnt know about the barrier either until idalia found it so i just dont know you didnt always have the ability to sense them maybe youre developing new abilities now oh i hope not vestakia burst out feelingly not if it means im going to be sick all the time and not know why she rubbed her head and heaved a deep sigh well maybe shalkan will be able to give you some good advice look theres songmairie he should be around here somewhere well just but suddenly vestakia sank to her knees groaning she pointed wordlessly off in the direction of the hills shaking her head in pain kellen didnt stop to question he drew his swordhe wore it everywhere these days as a matter of habitand took off running in the direction shed pointed the snow gave him good traction it was deep but not so deep that it slowed him down very muchnot a knight who had survived the worst master belesharon had managed to throw at him so far as he ran he summoned up his spellsight the world shifted subtly he could see exactly where he must go though he couldnt see his destination yet his magic lent strength and speed to his muscles and kellen fled over the snow with the speed of a running hare he topped the rise that led to the road out of sentarshadeen and stopped his battletrance broken by the sight he saw before him the snow was dappled with blood lying in the snow was a unicorn mare her fur had been white once now it was streaked with blood some old and brown some red and fresh all hers kneeling beside her were an elven border guard and his unicorn mount the fallen unicorns ribs heaved as she gasped for breath kellen ran down to join them get idalia now he ordered the elf stared at him for a moment in shock as if he could not imagine where kellen had sprung from then swayed to his feetalmost ungracefully and mounted his unicorn the two of them sprang off in the direction of sentarshadeen kellen knelt down beside the fallen unicorn set his sword within easy reach and gently eased her head into his lap easy girl easy he said soothingly help is coming he only hoped she could hear him he wished he could heal her himself but healing didnt come easily to himnot like it did to idalia he needed herbs and tools that he didnt have with him to summon that particular aspect of the wild magic her body was painfully thin and wasted as if she hadnt eaten for days and there were deep claw marks covering her shoulders and haunches kellen wasnt sure what kind of animal could leave those marks maybe a bear but bears should all be asleep at this season and most animals in nature wouldnt attack a unicorn to begin with at least her horn was intact shalkan arrived leaning down to nuzzle gently at her face the unicorn whimpered painfully but did not open her eyes hush darling hush shalkan said in a voice unlike any kellen had ever heard him use before it will be better soon i promise i sent for idalia kellen said yes shalkan said i passed sharmet on the way into the city he seemed to gather himself to impart bad news and gazed steadily into kellens eyes her name is calmeren she was with the party sent to the crowned horns with sandalon kellen had the sense all at once of a pattern no more than a pattern a picture or perhaps a diagram orwell whatever it was he knew he knew what this meant and why hed been feeling ready to kill something and why vestakia was feeling the same way it formed like a crystal exploding into place around him all of its lattice forming a whole he could at long last read they were attacked by the enemy kellen said vestakia sensed it somehow she was feeling awful today and when calmeren got close enough she got sick taint shalkan said calmly it will be gone once calmerens been healed the two of them stayed with the wounded unicorn kellen gently brushing snow from her head others of the herd arrived forming a protective circle around them all gazing down at calmeren in worried silence it seemed a very long time until idalia arrived though kellen knew she would have come as fast as she could she arrived on horseback sharmet and his rider running ahead idalia rode one of the horses that kellen had seen plowing the city streetsobviously the quickest form of transportation she could grab the unicorns scattered as she approached bunching up into a small herd several yards distant see if you can get her to drink this idalia said handing kellen a waterskin and you she said to sharmets rider go and see if vestakias all right shes back by the spring kellen gently eased calmerens mouth open and squeezed some of the contents of the waterskin onto her tongue as idalia began to unpack her equipment even in the cold he could smell a green minty scent it wasnt just water then calmeren swallowed convulsively as the liquid trickled over her tongue and then began to suck greedily at the waterskin her eyelids flickered but she still didnt rouse kellen smelled a whiff of burning as idalia called the charcoal to light she handed kellen a large pot of salve put this on her injuries but dont try to turn her just slop it on its sovereign for taint and will make it easier to heal her kellen pulled off his gauntlets and scooped up large handfuls of the stuff it was a bright violet color and even in the cold it was as thin and drippy as honey he wiped it on as gently as he couldcalmeren seemed to sigh with relief as soon as it touched heremptying the jar and then scrubbed his hands clean in the snow by then idalia was ready to begin who will share the price of this healing she asked we willall of us a black unicorn mare who seemed to be the little groups leader stepped forward and spoke shalkan shook his head mutely stepping back from calmeren im sorry he whispered so low that only kellen could hear me too ill share kellen said if shalkan couldnt help calmerenhe didnt understand but this was no time to ask questionshed take his friends place that should be more than enough to make this easy idalia said she handed kellen a knife and at her direction he gathered strands of hair from each of the waiting unicorns manes then presented the bundle to idalia she reached out and cut a few bloodsoaked hairs from calmerens mane added a few strands of her own hair and pricked her finger to add her own blood to the mix then tossed the little knot of hair onto the brazier once again kellen felt the sheltering weight of presence reach out to enfold them allhim idalia calmeren all the other unicorns except shalkan but this time there was a difference calmerens body sizzled and smoked when the protective dome came down over it as if there were something about her that could not survive within it a dark oily smoke seemed to rise out of her coat and especially out of her wounds in a few moments it was gone kellen felt lightheaded as if there had been a cost to do that much but calmerens wounds still remained stark and ugly against her matted fur now i can begin idalia said she reached her hands out and held them over the unicorn and green fire spilled out of them like water striking the unicorns coat and making it glow as if calmeren were filled with the sun in a few momentskellen was always surprised at how quickly something so miraculous could run its coursecalmerens wounds were healed it was as if they simply melted away sinking back beneath the surface of her coat as the flesh knitted together though the salve and the streaks and clots of blood remained matting the white fur kellen didnt hear the mageprice that the powers asked of idalia of coursethat was between her and her magic though she might tell him if she chose whatever it was he hoped it was something small and easy to pay she was doing so much for sentarshadeen these days that it hardly seemed fair that much more should be asked of her kellen felt the protective shield disperse and the presence depart once the healing spell had run its course idalia was already dousing the brazier scattering the coals in the snow and packing her things away in her bag then moving back because her nearness would be uncomfortable for calmeren and the rest of the herd is she going to be all right vestakia asked coming up behind kellen her cloak was covered in snow where shed fallen to the ground but the pain in her voice was gone yes now kellen said idalia healed her the unicorn mare was already struggling toward consciousness she opened her eyesthey were as green as shalkansand gazed wildly around breathing a shaky snort of relief at the sight of the unicorns home she gasped she rolled onto her stomach trying to get her legs under her to stand but was obviously still very weak kellen and vestakia hurried over to her lifting and steadying her she leaned heavily against kellen and he could feel that she was nothing more than skin and bones thank you calmeren said huskily i must see andoreniel and ashaniel at once coldwargothers i have no name forthey attacked us within sight of the crowned horns they carried off the children all the rest are dead her head drooped in despair ciradhel naeret dainelel emessade kayir hed trained with all of them in the house of sword and shield naeret had taught him xaqiue ciradhel had helped to teach him to ride hed practiced with dainelel a hundred times theyd all gone with the convoy and calmeren said they were all dead killed by shadow mountain i fought and foughtbut they took the children and killed the rest all the restall goneall gone her head hung down to her knees and her sides heaved unicorns couldnt weep or at least if they could kellen had never seen it happen but the sorrow and despair in her voice was enough to bring tears to his eyes there was nothing i could do you brought us warning shalkan said quietly that is a very great deal i should have known vestakia burst out i should have known that was why i felt so strange we should all have known that they wouldnt just leave us in peace kellen said bitterly but we didnt do you think you can walk as far as the house of leaf and star idalia asked ive healed you but youre still very weak youll need rest and care and food but the unicorns head came up again at that i have to go back calmeren said sounding frantic i have to save the children no kellen said his voice hard you have done your duty and more than your duty calmeren you arent strong enough even healed now your duty is to pass the task on to someone else you only have to tell me where to go ill save them thats my job less than an hour later the elven council had gathered again this time vestakia was present as well so that they could hear what she could tell them about what she had sensed that morning on the way to the house of leaf and star kellen had heard the rest of what calmeren had to tell him not the enemy calmeren shuddered and not elves but enemies she shook her head so hard she staggered and shalkan walking beside her leaned into her to steady her shed managed to slip away as the hooded ones moved among the wounded knights and unicorns finishing off any who still lived she knewshe knew that she was only one wounded unicorn and that to stay would be to die but to run would be to bring help so she had run as hard as she could stopping for nothing back along her trail to bring warning to sentarshadeen along the way shed seen the slain bodies of the rest of her friendsevery knight every servant every destrier that had ridden out from sentarshadeen a fortnight ago was dead but they did not die alone calmeren said with grim satisfaction they were able to take some of their attackers with them and so i could see what else had been hunting us icetrolls and frostgiants a small warband but enough both creatures of the dark longtime allies of shadow mountain shalkan said and they knew exactly where to strike and when kellen said and how to sneak right up on the caravan without being seen how with help shalkan answered the question is whose now kellen stood before the elven council and told them everything that calmeren had told him calmeren said they were careful to take sandalon and the other children alive he finished that isnt good but its better than it could be it means we have a chance of getting them back first we need to find them and i think we have a way of doing that tell us andoreniel said simply vestakia can track them you know she can sense when they are nearby or when theyre working strong magic he glanced at vestakia she bowed her head a little yes i could sense the presence of the demontaint on calmeren when she came close enoughi think my powers are growing stronger if there is demontaint near the crowned horns i should be able to follow the trail it leaves she brought her head up again and now her eyes shone with tears and with anger as well as justifiable fear i will gladly do all i can to rescue the children kellen patted her shoulder knowing what those brave words had cost her if vestakia fell into demonic clutches her fate would be too terrible to contemplate while of course we all appreciate vestakias kind offer in the light in which it has been extended councilor sorvare said it might be in the best interests of the children to consider matters carefully at this delicate pass certainly as no one will deny our ancient enemy seeks to weaken us by striking at our most vulnerable point we must analyze the situation carefully from all possible aspects before moving forward lest we overlook an avenue of possible threat kellen wasnt sure what sorvare was getting at but from the looks on andoreniels and ashaniels faces theyd had no trouble at all unraveling his little speech i say againand for the last timethat i repose all trust in vestakia andoreniel said an edge of true anger in his voice she is a citizen of sentarshadeen as much as any of us here and gladly and willingly do i place the life of my son in her hands oh oh now that hed had it translated for him kellen felt angry as well sorvare had as good as called vestakia a traitor saying shed probably lead the rest of them into a demontrap there is going to be a rescue party kellen said cutting off dargainon as he began to speak and you might as well resign yourselves to the fact that it is going whether or not you like it debate all you want in our absence but we are going and going now i am not going to leave the children in enemy hands for a single moment longer than it takes to reach them idalia jermayan shalkan vestakia and i have already agreed you can send anyone else you like but it leaves at first light tomorrow morning and anyone who goes had better be able to keep up i would say that you handed some of the counselors a rather stinging rebuke idalia said sounding surprisingly calm as the three of them walked back toward the house a little while later i think you shocked them how could he say something like that about vestakia kellen burst out its all right vestakia said i do know what i look like kellen its the councils business to be cautious idalia added not just to agree with everything andoreniel and ashaniel want to do but not to be idiots kellen countered angrily for the lights sake idalia the enemy has the children and one of them is sandalon how could they stand there and even think about debating when every moment that passes could mean well you won idalia said and i dont think half the council will ever get over the shock now she smiled though grimly thats the price of having wildmages around and i think that theyd forgotten that now vestakia and i both have a lot of packing to do before morningand shouldnt you get over to the house of sword and shield and see what knights you want to take with you for tomorrow me kellen said stopping and staring at her in confusion you idalia said giving him a little push in the right direction youre the only knightmage weve gotand unless im very much mistaken youve just appointed yourself the leader of this rescue party the cellar was damp and cold located at the edge of the low quarter of armethalieh it was however well lit balls of magelight hovered near the ceiling illuminating every corner with a spectral azure glow before hed become an entered apprentice cilarnen would not have been able to imagine that such a place could exist that he had come to enter it at all however had little to do with that and much to do with his new friend master raellan in master raellan cilarnen had found an ally and confidant who did much to fill the aching void left by his fathers continuing displeasure master raellan shared cilarnens love for the cityand more his fear that all was not as it should be now that his eyes had been opened cilarnen could see the signs oh not everywhere there was no change in the lives of the mageborn but among the people they served there were subtle indications everywhere he looked not of unrest of course but of confusion all was not as it had always been in the golden city and the change was not for the better despite the best efforts of the provenders councils prices were rising and wages were not rising to match some foodstuffs had simply disappeared from the regular markets and all because the high councilpushed by lord volpiril had removed armethaliehan protection from the home farms so far as cilarnen knew there was not actual hunger in the city yet but the day was not far off when there would be the sellers of small luxuries that did not happen to be edible were looking anxious when bread cost twice what it had in the summer people had to stop buying other things to afford it something must be done and if the high council would notor could notset things right then the mageborn themselves must act for the good of the city it was a terrifying thought one that would have paralyzed him completely without master raellans support but master raellan seemed to know his thoughts almost before he voiced them it was master raellan who assured him that many of the high council felt just as he did they merely needed to be brought to see that it was safein fact vitalthat they speak openly someone had to be brave enough to make the first move to begin saying aloud what others only thought someone young but known for his good sense and devotion to the city and his duty someone charismatic enough to lead someone like cilarnen thus supported cilarnen began making cautious overtures among his fellow entered apprentices to see whichif any of themmight have the wit and the stomach to do more than grumble around a table in the golden bells gillain he dismissed at once the young lord was far too reckless and could not keep his mouth shut to save his life besides he was notoriously scatterbrainedhed actually managed to lose his city talisman on more than one occasion viance and flohan were too timidwhile they were more sensible than gillain neither of them would be willing to do what it would take to save the city he would certainly have despaired had not master raellan steered him gently toward a different group of mageborn jorade isas was the greatgreatgrandnephew of the isas who sat upon the council geont pentres was the youngest son of house pentres a minor mageborn house which was distantly allied to the breulin line and thus much at odds with the volpirils at the moment kermis lalkmairs family had the rare and odd distinction of never having held a city office or a council seat the lalkmair line produced scholars exclusively and it was said that lord lalkmair would rather burn the gift out of one of his sons than see him hold a seat on any of the city councils tiedor rolfort was the son of a tradesman his gift had appeared early and he had been fostered with house arcable he had repaid the houses kindness with utter loyalty and complete devotion to his new class margon ogregance was the son of high mage epalin ogregance who oversaw the merchants and provenders council more than any of the others he knew exactly what was going on with the citys food supply and knew just how bad things were we shall starve by spring he said bluntly the other five stared at him in shock unused to such plain speaking well margon said impatiently isnt that what you wanted to know isnt that why were all here joradecilarnentiedorkermisgeontwe didnt all slip away from our families and hide out in this drafty cellar to take tea but tiedor began starve margon repeated flatly the home farms cantor wontsupply us with what we need at any price i suspect the answer is that they cant without us to control the weather and the pests they have only enough to feed themselves the council has already authorized father to contract with the selkens for grain but thats not to say it will get here in time and one cant depend on foreigners you know besides jorade said slowly working it out to ask them to bring in food and so much foodthat tells them were weak doesnt it theyll attack us not help us geont said looking at cilarnen and its all your fathers fault the peace of the light be between you kermis said firmly raising his hand if not for lord cilarnen none of us would have the least idea how bad things really were let alone that there might be something we could do about it but what tiedor asked and that indeed was the question the six young men looked at each other finding one another and daring to meetand openly criticize the high mageshad been hard enough both to imagine and to do to actually go from words to deeds master raellan will know cilarnen said firmly we must try to come up with a plan and im sure he will have an idea of how to implement it but though they talked until second night bells rang out none of them was able to come up with any practical notion of how they might cause the high council to realize the gravity of the situation or to avert the danger to armethalieh that they all saw so clearly they did manage to agree to meet here again in three days time with cilarnen to bring master raellan if he could chapter seven discord in the city of a thousand bells calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink a girls sewingcircle would make more efficient conspirators anigrel decided entering the nowdeserted cellar a chime later and triggering the spell that would release the stored memory of the boys conversation into his consciousness an evenings worth of pretty speeches and not one sensibleor useful from his point of view suggestion among them the young idiots could talk from now until the city walls crumbled around them and do nothing more treasonous than flout curfew that would hardly be enough for anigrels purposes with a sigh he dismissed the globes of magelight that the boys had forgetfully left burning it would hardly do for anyone to wonder why mageborn had been lurking here not just yet anyway and it seemed he would have to take a more active hand in this conspiracy than he had first intended it was just as his late father had said if you wanted something done right you had best do it yourself in the sennights that followed cilarnen found himself split into three people and none of them got much sleep there was cilarnen the dutiful son and student who attended lectures at the mage college and ate his meals at house volpiril that role was easy to play hed been doing it all his life and if it was harder now it was only because he now knew there was so much more to life than he had once thought but he dutifully went through the motions studying hardfor the high magick obsessed him now more than everand being all that was polite to the father he saw ever more infrequently then there was cilarnen the entered apprentice who went about his tasks throughout the city with ears open wide listening closely for any scrap of gossip or careless word from the mages he served for anything he heard might come in useful later in this role he practiced effacing himself completely gone were the lordly airs and mannerisms suitable to a son of house volpiril this cilarnen made himself meek and humble and as invisible as the lowliest entered apprentice from the lowestranked house in all armethalieh he was no one of importance he was only cilarnen a pair of hands to be called upon at need and ignored when not actually being ordered about last of all there was cilarnen the conspirator who had learned a hundred ways of slipping out of house volpiril by night of stealing a few chimes here halfabell there for errands that served the city in ways that would horrify the city if it knew but all would come right in the end he was sure of it are you sure this works jorade asked curiously looking down at the small lump of silverygrey stone in his palm of course it works havent you ever seen umbrastone before here ill show you kermis said he took the lump of stone from jorades hand and set it down on the table whos got a lantern several of them didthe back streets were dark at night and it wouldnt do to advertise their mageborn status by walking the streets lit by balls of magelight after all margon produced his and kermis set it on the table beside the lump of umbrastone now light it a fire spells simple right jorade simply glared at him the spell to summon fire was the first one every student of the high magick learned he concentrated on the lantern nothing happened youve warded it he accused i swear by the lighti havent kermis said try any spell you know it wont work umbrastone eats magic the only reason the magelights are still glowing is because they were already lit when i brought this piece in we couldnt cast them now and if this were a bigger piece of umbrastone it would put them out how much magic can it eat tiedor asked with interest im not sure kermis admitted a lot when it gets full it crumbles away though i know that much from the books in my fathers library so well need a lot more cilarnen said thoughtfully for the guards for the stone golems enough to absorb all the spells the high council will throw at us where are we going to get that much geont demanded youre talking pounds of this stuff and it took all our allowances together to bribe that selken to bring in this much if i might make a suggestion master raellan said the boys turned and looked at him hopefully now that we have a sample to work withand have proven that it will meet our needswouldnt it just be simpler to make it here i grant you that its a delicate process and proscribed of course but i am not without certain resources myself and among you certainly you have the knowledge to oversee the work surely the recipe is to be found in one of your fathers libraries anigrel waited with barelyconcealed impatience wondering if he was going to have to bring them the book from lycaelons library himself he took care to stay well away from the small piece of umbrastone on the table for if it touched him it would dispell the small glamouries of misdirection that disguised his true self and even if rolfort isas pentres and lalkmair werent close enough to the seats of power to recognize him both the volpiril brat and young ogregance would certainly recognize archmage lycaelons soeffacing private secretary at last kermis spoke i think i can find it in my fathers library he never notices when i go in there or what i do anigrel breathed a faint inward sigh of relief once the manufactory for the umbrastone was in placewell that was treason pure and simple and easy enough to hang high mage volpiril himself with it yes and any other members of the high council he chose to implicate how long will it take geont asked to make enough i mean does it matter margon answered the problem isnt going to go away or get better white flours being rationed in the market now and even the commons are starting to wonder why fathers been in meetings every day for the past moonturn trying to figure out what to do about it and the only thing possible is to get the council to reverse its decree and take the home farms back but why cant they just see that jorade said miserably the high council will never reverse itself cilarnen said bitterly not when it means doing so publicly by now everyonehe meant as his listeners knew all the magebornknows about the decree to draw back the borders to the city walls lycaelon tavadon was the only one who voted against the decree that means that reversing the decree is endorsing the archmage so theyll never do it so the city suffers for petty politics kermis said grimly unless young men like yourselveswho love the city and who set themselves above such thingswill save her master raellan said the six young entered apprentices regarded each other what theyd done so far was serious but if it came to light they could expect no worse than a severe scoldingat the worst a censure from the council what they were contemplating now each of them knew had far graver consequences well meet here again on lights day kermis said i should be able to get the book we need by then we can study it to figure out what materials and equipment we need to buyor steal he looked at cilarnen if anyone wants to back out do it now cilarnen warned because once we start making umbrastone well theres no going back im in jorade said you know i am kermis said light blast all politicians and i tiedor said for the cityand the mages i know what the stakes are better than any of you margon said i wont back out now if youre in house volpiril so am i geont said gruffly youre twice the man your lightdamned father is thank you all cilarnen said warmly then well meet back here on the day and the light go with you all all was proceeding perfectly anigrel thought to himself as he walked back toward house tavadon he was careful to take a more circuitous route than the boys for they believed that master raellan was a younger son of a minor mage house and it would not do to have their illusions shattered he might well wish to play this game again someday soon with new players and what a splendid game it was lycaelon would certainly be furious to discover additional plots against him among the mages and the foiling of this one would provide him with all the leverage he needed to take back control of the council from that eternal pest volpiril and to further anigrels ambitions as well he reached the mage quarter where no one would think it odd to find undermage anigrel upon the streets even at this late hour and a wave of his hand dispelled the glamourie restoring his own natural appearance and that of his clothing at length he achieved his ownor rather lord lycaelonsdoorstep passing between the stone mastiffs without incident and a waiting servant hurried to open the door for him good evening undermage anigrel the butler said bowing deferentially as he hastened to receive anigrels cloak good evening is the archmage at home archmage lycaelon is still at the council house undermage anigrel the butler said bowing again in that case have a tray with a light supper brought up to my rooms in two chimes see that i am not disturbed until then anigrel passed through the panel and ascended the staircase his immediate thoughts on a hot bath and one of the exquisite meals served up by lycaelons talented cook beyond that there was much to do to ensure that the plot against the high magessuch as it wasturned out satisfactorily for some people at least to create a measure of umbrastone took approximately three moonturns once all conditions were right and for all conditions to be right as cilarnen had discovered that lightday was one of the reasons that umbrastone was expensive in addition to being proscribed there were a lot of ingredients that went into its manufacture some of them were rare and difficult to acquirecertain herbs and flowerswhile others such as gold and seapearls were merely expensive and some were just peculiar like fresh chicken eggs it seemed a lot more like cooking than like any branch of the art magickal than cilarnen had yet studied strangest of all no spells seemed to be involved at any stage of the stones manufacture thats because this is the art khemitic kermis had explained when cilarnen had questioned him its proscribed of course but its essential doctrine holds that the objects of the natural world have an elemental nature possessed of innate qualities which when combined in specific amounts can create objects with certain powers sounds dangerous geont had said with a look of distaste it is kermis answered with a thin smile there are more warnings in this book than spells looks like fun though if you dont mind getting blown up what do we do after we put all the things together cilarnen had asked trying to head off what had promised to be a lengthy debate they have to be kept in total darkness at a constant temperature for three moonturns in a sealed container inside a special brazier the khemiticists call it an athanor an athanor margon had said in surprise thats a magickal tool its just an oven the bakers guild uses them to extract oils from spicebark and finish delicate pastry i can get one theyre kind of big though how big cilarnen had asked warily margon sketched a shape in the air with his hands not too bad tiedor said with relief my birthfather is a carter hell let me borrow one of the carts and teams and he wont ask any questions if i tell him its magebusiness i can drive a cart and team too he regarded the rest of them a faint smirk on his features and cilarnen felt a faint pang of guilt relief hed always looked down on tiedorwho hadntbecause of his common blood but it was just thatthe fact that he came from the commons and remembered what hed learned therethat would make their plan work now thats good then and tiedorthank you i dont think this would work without you he turned to the others we seem to have a plan margon will get us the athanor tiedor will get the cart to transport it here kermis will write out the list of materials that we need to make the umbrastone and well all work on getting them we can work out the rest of our plan while were actually making the umbrastone it was a good plancilarnen had discovered over the last several moonturns that he had a talent for planningand the first part of it went exactly as he intended the athanor was acquired installed tested and seasonedboth margon and kermis agreed on the necessity for that obtaining the ingredients for the recipe took far more ingenuity though the six of them were wealthy by any standards but those of the mageborn but finally almost two moonturns later they were ready to begin it had not been an easy time for cilarnen he had the disturbing feeling that his father was watching him more closely than he had for a long time and the gossip he overheard in his work as an entered apprentice was not encouraging though the city was protected from inclement weather the delfier valley was not and outside the city the autumn storms had been ferociously hard cilarnen did not precisely understand the details or the logic but apparently because of the bad weather the farmers were withholding the rest of their food just as margon had warned would happen and what was the council doing engaging in screaming debates so it was rumored as to whetherand if so howto continue its trade with the high hills now that it no longer had a trading outpost available in nerendale would the caravans even be willing to come into armethalieh as they had a generation ago and if they were would the council be willing to allow them in well they wont have to by spring this will all be settled i hope cilarnen told himself uneasily he still wasnt sure what they were going to do once they had the umbrastone the making of the stuff had turned out to be so complicated that none of them had even begun to discuss the next phase deep down in his heart he just hoped that the council would see how serious things were and understand that they had to take the home farms back perhaps he was going about this all wrong maybe he should just petition for a private audience with the archmage lycaelon it was every mageborns righta right rarely invoked but still the law of the city he could ask the archmage what to do tonight hed been the first to arrive at their secret meeting place and his train of thought was interrupted by the arrival of the others ive brought wine geont said i think well need it kermis shuddered faintly well ive brought teaand decent water he flourished a packet and a large flask phastan silvertip i hope the pots clean and ive brought the mixing bowl jorade said lifting a huge shallow container of pure gold from beneath his cloak and setting it on the shabby wooden table with a grunt the rickety table creaked and shifted beneath the weight i borrowed it from the family chapel nobody will miss itso long as its back before morning devotions of course it will be kermis said and tiedor one dozen hens eggs fresh from the hen and this mornings market the young entered apprentice said the ways of mages are mysterious he added with a grin the silly woman had no idea why id want to be down in the fowl market buying my own eggs she fluttered as much as one of her own geese women cilarnen agreed dropping his own contribution into the bowl eight ounces of white roses heads only the recipe had specified that they had to be cut precisely at sunrise without the use of metal so cilarnen had been unable to simply buy them in the flower market rather hed had to slip out of bed at an unspeakably early hour make his way across the city to the park charm his way into one of the greenhouses with a tale of a youthful dare and bribe one of the gardeners heavily to allow him to cut them with an ivory letter opener hed sharpened for the purpose and hope that nobodylike his father or his tutorschecked up on his story because it would be a little awkward to explain though not nearly as awkward as the truth the eggs and the roses were the only fresh ingredients the others they had been able to gather and store here over the last several sennights as tiedor carefully broke the eggs into the bowlthey werent sure from the recipe whether to break them or not but as kermis pointed out if they didnt break them what they would have would be chickensthe others added the rest of the ingredients last of all kermis added several ounces of fluidand rather poisonous quicksilver and then dropped in the original piece of umbrastone it would form the raw materials in its own image making the creation of new umbrastone more certain it instantly sank to the bottom all of them stared down at the golden bowl full of peculiar and unappetizing varicolored slime the quicksilver floated on the top eddying around the broken eggshells and the roseheads it smelled odd well it isnt going to do anything yet kermis said sounding irritable and nervous help me pour it into the containment vessel then well light the athanor then we wait it took four of them to pick up the bowl now that it was full and it hadnt been light to start with the room was dark lit only by entirely mundane lanterns for kermis was worried that any use of the art magickal would interfere with the delicate operation of the art khemitic they would be using ordinary wood and coal to heat the oven which meant that one of them would have to be here every day to make sure it stayed at the proper temperature cilarnen locked eyes with master raellan across the lip of the bowl as the four of them lifted it in unison master raellan gave him a small smile of triumph halt in the name of the high council suddenly the cellar blazed bright with magelight cilarnen heard the clatter of stone golem feet on the steps leading down into the cellar he didnt know who dropped the bowl first only that it slipped from his hands to strike the floor with a ringing clang spattering its noisome contents everywhere spellfed panic gripped him and despite the magelight glare it was suddenly hard to see cilarnen backed away from the mess on the floor until the wall jarred hard against his back run someone shouted but there was nowhere to run to there was only one entrance to the cellar and it was filled with stone golems and greyclad journeyman mages their wands tracing glowing glyphs of containment in the air this has all gone terribly wrong it was a ridiculously understated thing to think and it was the last conscious thought cilarnen had before one of the floating glyphs touched his face it seemed to burst stealing his senses from him anigrel watched with grave approval as the stone golems carried the last of the unconscious conspirators from the cellar it had been the work of an instant for master raellan to vanish and undermage anigrel here on the archmages orders to take his place and though the children might speak of master raellan all they liked no one would ever be able to locate the fellow no matter how hard they searchedwhich would only add to the high mages paranoia once the full extent of this nights work was disclosed it would be obvious that the children were merely the spearhead of a conspiracy to destroy the very fabric of life as the city knew it at least it would be once he was through explaining things to lycaelon the conspirators have been secured my lord anigrel stepped into lycaelons private office in the council house outside the single carillon of midnight bells rang through the night air good a flame of triumph kindled in lycaelons grey eyes and their fathers remainso farin ignorance that their activities have been discovered anigrel said smoothly you feel they were involved as well lycaelon said sharply my lord how could they not be anigrel said feigning surprise young men of good families how could they mount a conspiracy of this magnitude without assistance from their families could young lalkmair have gained access to the information he needed to create umbrastone without his fathers assistance for example and im sure you will find when you question them that there are others involved as well assuming their memories have not already been erased by magick to protect their fellow conspirators of course there that should do much to explain the inconvenient fact that cilarnen and the others would insist they were alone in their plans he watched as lycaelon contemplated the prospect there must be trials he said at last there can be no accusations without evidence of guilt but it is a time for the testing of fealty anigrel yes and a time to reward loyalty trials of course anigrel said smoothly but you will wish to proceed with the utmost caution naturally it seems obvious that this is yet another attempt by the wildmages to subvert our ranks for who else would need to weaken our magick in order to replace it with their own further it now seems clear that lord volpiril has been involved all along and that his insistence on reducing the borders of our influence is in fact another aspect of this very conspiracy he will have to resign his council seat at the very leastand as for cilarnen i imagine the council will recommend banishment dont you lycaelon smiled indeed banishment for cilarnen and for the tradesmans whelpand that means the reenlargement of our borders to make that punishment more than a meaningless reprimand volpiril isas and breulinat the very leastwill lose their council seats over this nights work anigrel merely nodded and schooled his face into an expression of humility and that leaves vacancies on the council lycaelon continued and i know precisely whom i intend to appoint to one of those places oh it hasnt been done for centuries but there is precedent for it i have the power i shall raise you my loyal aide to the rank of high mage at once and you shall take volpirils place to serve me loyally as he never did anigrel waited a beat as if the news had not actually penetrated then assumed a look of mingled pleasure and surprise not shock shock would be a little too much my lord he said gazing at the archmage ii hardly know what to say and i do not think i shall fill the other vacancies at all lycaelon went on with grim satisfaction let those seats stand empty rather than being occupied with those who would only become my enemies the next few bells were full of feverish activity messages sent and received certain mageborn notified certain of them kept in ignorance and through it all anigrel worked quietly at lycaelons elbow as if nothing had changed which was exactly what lycaelon wanted of course so now he would be a member of the high council anigrel thought to himself and afterwardlittle though lycaelon might suspect it at the momentthey would go on winnowing the ranks of the council of those who were not perfectly loyal to the archmage the archmage and his sodevoted acolyte they were somewhere underground that much lairamo knew for certain despite her best intentions she had lost consciousness several times during that frightful aerial journey when she had dangled far above the surface of the ground halffrozen and battered by the winds of the storm when she had regained consciousness it was dark she could smell damp stone and knew by the stillness of the air that she was somewhere far beneath the earths surface in a tunnel or a cave she was being carried in some kind of sling by beings who did not need light to see by and had not known whether to pray that the children were with her or not she knew that if they were not with her they were surely dead but perhaps death was better than her own eventual fate but as they traveled each step making her sway nauseatingly back and forth in her sling faint sobs and whimpers told her that at least some of the children still lived at last their journey ended there was a break in the darkness a patch of eldritch purple light almost blinding after the unrelieved darkness having a point of reference in the blackness made lairamo feel even more ill she had no choice but to close her eyes tightly she opened them again as the sling was being set down the source of the violet light was now visible a thick encrustation of luminous lichen high on the walls of the small grotto her captors forms were concealed in deep hooded cloaks they moved with silent efficiency and even though she knew she ought to try to find out why they had been brought here lairamo was afraid to speak to them there was something about these silent creatures that horrified her somehoweven though they were completely muffled in shapeless cloakslairamo could tell that there was something about them that was so deeply poisonously wrong that it revolted her very nature they quickly deposited their burdens and departed as silently as they had done everything else the moment they were gone she raised her head and counted the slings six she got to her feet pushing the enveloping folds of her sling aside and hurried among the bundles she began unfurling them wrinkling her nose at the odd fusty odor they exuded all the children were there and safesome unconscious some merely terrified into unblinking immobility she caught up sandalon and kalania in her arms unable to think of what to do next the children were groggy from cold and shock sandalon clung to her wordlessly and tiny kalania trembled too terrified to cry lairamo looked around clutching the youngest children to her apparently they were to be kept alive for a while for the edges of the cavern were piled with boxes and bundles some bearing the marks of great age alkandoran she said calling out his name until the boy roused the teenager sat up slowly looking around groggily and then with increasing apprehension look through those bundles get the others to help you we need to find a brazier or something that will serve as one and some way to start a fire it is cold in here we need lightand heat yes nurse lairamo alkandoran was not so many years away from having had a nurse of his own and from his expression lairamo could see that it was far easier for him at the moment to take orders than to think about where he was tredianala merisashendiel and vendalton had freed themselves from their hammocks at the sound of familiar voices and were looking around with a growing curiosity lairamo didnt think it had occurred to the younger children yet that the others were dead and if the gods of leaf and star were kind it might not occur to them for a long time to come come on alkandoran said sturdily we need to look for useful things merisashendiel and vendalton were eager to help tredianala the more timid of the cousins came and curled up next to lairamo will we be going home soon she asked trustingly leaning her head against lairamos shoulder soon i hope lairamo said since it would hardly do to tell the child the truth that they might be going home to the gods but they would almost certainly never see sentarshadeen again she doubted anyone at all had survived the massacre creatures that could outrun unicornsand kill them as she had seen to her horrormust certainly have destroyed everyone else in the caravan first there would be no one left to warn sentarshadeen that they had been taken and though the fortress of the crowned horns would know they had not arrived on schedule it would be sennights before they could send word to sentarshadeen to warn ashaniel and andoreniel of the disaster and by then whatever fate was planned for them would surely have befallen them and where could their rescuers begin to look for them i found a brazier alkandoran cried delightedly tipping the pieces out of their bag with a clatter and peering at them in the dimness further discoveries followed lanterns and oil some odd ambercolored waxy cylinders that lairamo identified as candlessomething the elves did not useand thankfully enough charcoal to keep the two braziers alkandoran had found burning for quite some time though they would have to be careful of the toxic fumes still the air seemed fresh enough now that lairamo thought they probably had more to worry about from the cold than from suffocating down here the air was always cold and there was the danger of falling into a bodychilled lethargy that could end in death though perhaps that might not be a bad end most of the looted goods that had been left for them were of elven manufacture but there was enough of peculiar and unfamiliar designand therefore probably of human originto suggest that their captors had plundered human tradecaravans as well as elven ones there were no blanketsat least theyd found none so far though there were many more bundles to search through and searching should keep the children occupied for at least a while lairamo sighed perhaps the peculiar slings could be used as blankets light two of the lanterns first alkandoran well feel better with some light the boy hurried to complyhis hands shook only a littleand the shadows rushed back as the welcoming golden light blossomed in the stronger illumination the fungal glow disappeared the lichen becoming merely a greyish encrustation on the cavern walls the walls glitter merisashendiel cried pointing it was true beyond the reach of the lichen the pale walls and ceiling of the cave glittered in the lantern light like a snowfield in the sun crystals vendalton said sometimes they grow a lot bigger than that they look like eyes tredianala whispered burrowing in closer to lairamo they are not eyes the nurse said firmly as vendalton said they are crystals which are often found in caves now merisashendiel you may light one of the braziers after which it will be a great deal more comfortable in here and tredianala you may fold up those slings tidily now and be sure not to tangle them i dont want to touch them nurse lairamo the girl whimpered we all do a great many things we do not wish to do in life lairamo said firmly the child was all set for a nasty bout of hysterics and if she gave vent to them she would certainly set the others off and they could not afford that you will oblige me now her firmness worked tredianala gave her a look equally compounded of hurt and resentment and went off to fold up the peculiar hammocklike slings the rest of you go through all the bundles and sort the contents neatly i wish to know everything that is here and how much there is of everything tredianala may help you when she has finished her task a ragged chorus of yes nurse lairamo greeted her latest order and the childrenall but kalania and sandalonset to work once some of the lanterns were filled and lit and the lit brazier began radiating heat everything seemed less nightmarish but no less terrifying lairamo only hoped the children didnt really realize the extent of their danger though she suspected from the look on alkandorans face that the youngster knew perfectly well that they were in deep trouble he said nothing though simply taking charge of the others in sorting out the stockpiles lairamo tucked her cloak more tightly around kalania and sandalon at the movement sandalon raised his head its my fault he whispered so low that only she could hear were here because of me there was an unchildlike bitterness in his voice my heartno lairamo said hugging him tightly but he shook his head for the first time contradicting her yes i am the prince and my father is king we are here because of me the rescue party from sentarshadeen left at first light the following morning kellen shalkan jermayan vestakia idalia and six elven knights all that could be gathered at such short notice a second party was being assembled which would follow with additional supplies and as many knights as andoreniel could call up quickly calmeren would be able to lead them as far as the place from which the children had been taken but it would be at least a sennight before the larger rescue party was ready and it would only be able to travel at wagonspeed kellen had no intention of waiting for anything or anyone elven palfreys had been found for idalia and vestakia though the two women could certainly have ridden pillion with jermayan and kellen shalkan and valdien might need to be able to carry other passengers later and every rider was burdened with their own supplies journeyfood of course but they must also carry supplies and medicines for those they hoped to rescue the caravan had taken nearly two sennights to reach the icemeadows below the crowned horns and die calmeren wounded running flatout at a unicorns top speed had covered the same distancein the opposite directionin a little over two days though it had cost her dearly it was five days before kellens party reached the spot rising before dawn and riding long after sunset and pausing only when neither man nor beast could place one foot in front of the other the first thing they encountered was the place where the guard of elven knights had faced the coldwarg pack the remains of the dismembered bodies of elves and horses still remained after a sennight halfburied in new snow and strangely undisturbed by the natural predators known to inhabit these mountains no natural beast will feed from a coldwarg kill jermayan said rising to his feet and brushing his gauntlets free of snow they had stopped long enough to uncover one or two of the bodies for as important as it was to rescue the captive children they dared not rush to that rescue blindly we cannot tarry now to send you to your final rest my friends he said looking around at the snow but do not fear we shall return for you you will not lie in the dark earth but return to the wind and the stars the caravan road lies in that direction idalia said pointing i flew over it often enough when i was a silver eagle they must have heard the wargs coming and split the party half of them riding toward the pack the rest fleeing toward the crowned horns and safety or so they hoped they wanted to slow the pack to give the unicorns as much of a head start as they could shalkan said he put his head down sniffing at a drift of snow and then beginning to paw at it but the coldwarg werent hunting alone he nudged his prize free whats that kellen asked walking over and picking it up he stood it on end and regarded it curiously it was a clubhe could see that muchblack and polished with use and very nearly as tall as he was but that really didnt answer the question of what it was frostgiantsjust as calmeren said a knight named artaliar spoke up the pack was traveling with frostgiants his voice was a mixture of disgust and despair jermayan sighed shaking his head it should not have been possible vestakia kellen asked she shook her head nothing here then lets go on they stopped at the wagons only long enough to make certain that no survivors had taken refuge therea slim hope but one they had to make sure of something had been at them after the party had abandoned them they had been lootedor vandalized or searched by now it wasnt quite clear and whatever had done it had left traces that made shalkan and the other two unicorns wrinkle their muzzles in disgust and made vestakia look distinctly uncomfortable but there was no one alive and no clues that would help them in their search so the party rode on finally they reached the killing ground where all but calmeren had died some freak of weather had swept the area free of new snow and the bodies of the elven knights and the unicorns in their armor glittered starkly against the field of ice like savagely disjointed dolls they smelled the battlefield before they saw it even in the cold something here was decaying and the smell was worse than anything kellen had ever encounteredworse than cleaning out perulans cesspit back in armethalieh worse than the sensory derangement at the black cairn the elven destriers welltrained and battletried as they were balked at approaching it and rather than force them the party left them with the unicorns to guard them and approached the site on foot today the air was still the weather was clear and bright the harsh mountain light showed every detail clearly the dryness of the air had leached all moisture from the bodies and not even birds had come to despoil what little the coldwarg and their allies had left behind every detail was starkly terribly clear the source of the stench was quickly apparent kellen gazed down at the gruesome remains of something that lay entangled with the remains of one of the unicorns long delicate wings covered with greyish membrane were spread across the snowit had the proportions of a bat but a bat the size of a small sailing ship and its head was shaped more like a wolfs than a bats with a long muzzle and yellow carnivorous teeth its body rotting swiftly even in this cold was covered in a thick white fur he looked around then off into the distance the fortress of the crowned horns was clearly visible a tiny dolls castle a few hours ride away so very near to safety and then to be taken by demons on their very doorstep within sight of their greatest stronghold their enemy was mocking them telling them how helpless they were telling them that they could be struck down anywhere at any time by the forces that shadow mountain could deploy against them but how kellen frowned andoreniel was no fool and idalia had certainly warned him that shadow mountain was active once more the barrier had been ample proof of that and kellen knew that elven knights were patrolling all the elven lands even more thoroughly than before and half a dozen parties before sandalons had come this wayall well guardedand none of them had reported anything suspicious yet coldwarg and frostgiantsand idalia had said it looked like icetrolls as wellall creatures of darkness all predators of the high coldhad slipped into the heart of elven lands undetected to mount a raid and kidnap the young prince how he looked back down at the remains of death on the wing it stinks of taint shalkan said coming up behind him well it stinks anyway kellen said gloomily youd think someone would have noticed you would the unicorn said noncommittally in the sky these things would be visible for leagues and frostgiants dont move all that fast on the ground it would take them some time to get here which means that they knew our plans all alongand picked this caravan to attack specifically kellen said not that wed leave any child in the hands of demons shalkan observed or anyone else for that matter but you know what the basis of endarkened magic is and sandalon is the heir kellen took a deep breath endarkened magic drew its power from blood and pain and deathfrom torture and the death by torture of the royal heir would undoubtedly be a source of greater power than any other sacrifice the demons could marshal as well as being a great blow to the elves kellen gazed around the battlefield again the others were walking among the deadsaying prayers kellen supposed or trying to identify fallen friends he glanced over his shoulder vestakia had stayed with the horses she was standing beside her mare leaning against the saddle the hood of her cloak pulled well up over her face kellen turned back to the battlefield it was almost as if the bodieswhere they lay how theyd fallentold a story and it was one he needed to disentangle none of the children were here calmeren had said theyd been taken by things that flew but the only reason shed survived was because shed fled before the battle was over he needed to know more than she could tell him could his magic help him here it was worth a try tell me what i need to know kellen said silently summoning up his battlesight there was a shimmer a faint doubling of vision as the battlesight rose up peopling the icy battlefield with the silent silvery ghosts of the dead he watched as the battle replayed itself before his eyes the moment when the unicorns realized that flight would not save their precious charges when they turned desperately to fight theyd been facing the coldwarg packthe icegiants would not have been fast enough to keep up with the packand something kellen glanced up at the sky empty now yes when the unicorns had turned to face the coldwarg the flying creatures had attacked as well forcing the unicorns back into the lethal jaws of the pack and then carrying off the children and lairamo he watched the deathwings as they attacked agile and deadly the long razorsharp talons on their feet clawing and grasping at the unicorns heads and shoulders snatching knights into the air with a fell swoop only to drop them to the ground once more with a stunning impact but the coldwarg had possessed other allies as well kellen watched as the last of the unicorns and their riders were pulled down and saw with distant surprise a party of cloaked figures move onto the field calmeren had said it had been snowing heavily that day the cloaked figures would have been concealed by the snow until the last instant the silvery visionghosts moved among the dead and dying without fear of the feeding coldwarg allies then and too heavily cowled for kellen to be sure of what they might be perhaps even men the vision faded and kellen blinked seeing only the battlefield once more what did you see shalkan asked quietly the battle kellen said simply calmeren was right those batthings deathwingscarried the children off somewhere but where jermayans voice was tight with frustration i dont know kellen said feeling a moment of utter despair to come so far and to fall just short of success i can find them vestakia said shed come up behind him while kellen was watching the past unfold shed pushed the hood of her cloak back and kellen could see that her face was set with a mixture of horror and determination if her skin hadnt been the color of ripe cherries kellen would have bet she would have been pale as it was she looked as if she might be sick at any moment and not just from the ugliness of the sight before her shalkan said the killing ground reeked of taint as much as the stench kellens physical senses could perceive and vestakias gift and curse was that she was peculiarly able to perceive demonic taint and more than any other creature of the light she found it debilitating sickening perhaps even painful kellen didnt know for certain she had never elaborated and he could only guess shalkan took a step sideways to press his shoulder against her hip they were taken by demonsor for demons vestakia said in a small determined voice they were taken by things like that she indicated the deathwing with a shudder i think i can track them jermayan regarded vestakia with warm approval by now the others had gathered around as well theres something more you need to know kellen said when i saw the battlehe shrugged not sure how else to say itthere were others helping the coldwarg and the deathwings not giants and not endarkened figures in cloaks mansized i dont think i could have seen them clearly even if id been there in the flesh but that means we have another enemy to worry about not elves trotaliath exclaimed elves would never betray their own to the enemy men yet it would be desirable to know how men could come so far into our lands without our knowing debarniekel said eyeing kellen with disfavor as well wonder how came the frostgiants or the icetrolls or any of our misfortunes jermayan said grimly and we do not know yet that they were men debarniekel i guess well find out when we catch them kellen said he knew from what vestakia had told him that demons could change their shape and appear in almost any form but he couldnt imagine why theyd bother to disguise themselves to come here they couldnt have expected to be seen after all and hadnt the whole point been to have the caravan disappear without a trace a few more sennightsanother big blizzard or twoand there wouldnt have been any traces at all left for them to find only the charred remains of the wagons if that the deathwing would have been completely rotted away come on he said turning and walking back toward the waiting mounts vestakia what do you need us to do it felt odd to be taking charge and giving orders like thisespecially since he was pretty sure he was the youngest one here vestakia includedbut idalia had been right this was his rescue party he was the leader and even while it felt odd it felt right the wind rose while they walked and the air cleared all of them breathed easier vestakia had obviously been thinking as they moved i think we need to get away from here to where i cant feel that thing kellen you said you saw the battle which way did the creatures fly kellen thought for a moment then pointed into the sky but you know that doesnt mean anything he added conscientiously once they were in the air they might have circled around gone in any direction i know vestakia said but it gives us a place to start doesnt it well get out of range of this and then ill see what i can sense and well follow it i know ill be able to pick up the trail when were clear of that dead thing she said determination in her voice they thought going by air would leave no traces to track but they were wrong i even think i feel it now but i want to be sure they mounted up again and rode away from the battlefield a few minutes later they stopped the destriers were calm again and even kellen felt better as if an annoying sound just below the threshold of audibility had stopped vestakia dismounted and walked away from the animals she paced back and forth for a few minutes kellen could see the steam of her breath being whipped away by the wind and hear the crunch her boots made as they broke through the crust of the hardfrozen snow it all depended on her and on her using her gifts in a way shed never used them before jermayan was a fine tracker but there was no physical trail to follow idalia might cast a finding spell with the wild magic or kellen might but for either of them to do that would be to incur magedebt and there would be no guarantee that it would work the endarkened were powerful magicians easily able to cast greater spells than any either he or idalia could summon they could certainly shield their stronghold just as they must have shielded the presence of the attackers within the elven borders the one thing they could not conceal was the presence of their magic and that was what vestakia could follow after a nervewracking interval vestakia returned that way she said with certainty im sorry i dont know if its the children but its taint and its within elven borders jermayan finished grimly so we must investigate it and pray that it leads to what we hope to find several times vestakia stopped to reassure herself they were continuing in the right direction kellen was relieved to see that though she seemed to be uncomfortable at sensing the presence of demontaint it was not draining her as badly as it had when she had approached the black cairn the trail led them deeper into the mountains back below the edge of the tree line where there was more shelter from the wind soon as vestakia became more assured in following the trail they became able to move at the fastest prudent speed over the snow with the unicorns breaking the trail for the heavier destriers it had been noon when they had left the battlefield the short winter day was drawing to a close by the time they reached their destination and their destination looked exactly like everywhere they had already been the granite mountain rising up out of the pine forest cold and silent and forbidding it was silent here it had been silent in most of the forest as they had backtracked the trail of the mysterious flyers evidently it wasnt only vestakia who could sense the taint the birds at least did not want to be anywhere near where the deathwings had passed there should at least be crows sparrows somethingand there was nothing not a sign not a call empty sky empty trees the snowwaistdeep in some placeshad impeded every step it would have shown the signs of any life and there were none there vestakia said pointing to a cave opening in the rock the trail leads in there it was impossible to tell in the reddish sunset light whether the opening was natural or manmade the riders had stopped down the slope near the edge of the trees and watched it warily alert for sentries though there didnt seem to be any there were no tracks in the smooth mantle of snow that led up to the narrow dark opening in the stone wall but it had been snowing heavily and almost steadily in these mountains for the past sennight and even the meanest outlaws knew enough to use brooms on the snow to conceal their tracks vestakia looked tiredfar wearier than even a days hard riding could account forand pressed her hand to her forehead as if trying to rub away a pounding headache this close to the source of the taint it was obvious she was feeling its draining effects well set up camp here kellen decided gesturing toward the pines it was closer to the cavern mouth than he likedand too close for vestakias comfort he knewbut they were losing the light and to travel through snow this deep by night would be a bad idea besides they were all cold and tired they needed hot tea hot food and a breathing space to plan their next move the elves moved beneath the trees found a clearing and began setting up camp with quiet efficiency clearing a space for the braziers and setting snow to melt for tea and soup kellen unsaddled shalkan and gave him a quick rubdown sweat would quickly turn to ice at this temperatureand then saw to vestakias mount as well shed already done more than her share of work today by the time he was finished the tea was ready he collected two cups and brought one over to her she was leaning against a tree at the edge of the clearing staring broodingly back the way theyd come how bad is it he asked not too vestakia said bravely more like a sore tooth than anything else so it isnt demons in there just something theyve touched she shuddered as if that isnt bad enough kellen held out the steaming cup of tea vestakia took it and sipped do you want some of that stuff i know idalia brought some you know the thing that shuts down your magical senses that way you wouldnt be able to feel it kellen offered vestakia opened her eyes very wide oh good goddess no she exclaimed almost sputtering kellen id rather feel something a thousand times worse than this than have them be able to sneak up on me and not know she reached out and patted his arm awkwardly ill be fine well not fine exactly but ill be all right its those children you should be worrying about what are you going to do now im not kellen began and by leaf and star i say you will not jermayan declared he had not shoutednot quitebut he had certainly spoken loudly enough to catch kellens attention kellens head whipped around jermayan and idalia were facing each other in the center of the clearing idalia held a small bundle in her arms i will idalia said quietly its the best chance they have and you know it jermayan kellen hurried over um whats going on he asked your sister has this foolish notion jermayan began jermayan thinks idalia shot back no kellen held up his hand both of them stopped looking at him in surprise youre arguing i can see that arguing wastes time and energy lets find another way it was one of master belesharons favorite sayings idalia what are you holding a a tarnkappa she said reluctantly and what were you going to do with it he had a sinking feeling he already knew but master belesharon always said it was better to know than to guess im going to put it on and go in after the children ill be safe she said sounding defiant madness jermayan protested vehemently it will work nothing in there will be able to sense me while im wearing itand ive added a spell to this one to give me darksight ill be able to see even if theres no light we cant just go rushing in thereit might be a trap of course its a trap jermayan and kellen said almost in chorus then you see why i have to be the one to spring it idalia said inexorably andwith luck and skillcome away with the baitor at the very least find out that it isnt there so vestakia can cast about for a fresh trail no jermayan said again a note of desperation in his voice its my tarnkappa idalia said i am not only the most expendable member of the party im the logical one to go if there are any traps of dark magic down there i can sense them and avoid themcan you jermayan and im a much better tracker than you are kellen if theres a trail to be found ill find it she was right kellen realized it even as he hated the fact it was a trap so the safest the most logical thing to do was to send one person to spring it and the person in the party with the best combination of skills to get intoand out ofthe trap alive was idalia both idalia and jermayan were looking at him she might go no matter what he said but they were waiting for his decision so you can find your way in he said but how are you going to find your way back idalia opened one hand to reveal a thick stick of chalk why ill blazon my way brother dear just as i would in an unfamiliar forest and ill use the marks to lead me home again shed answered every objection all right he said feeling suddenly old and weary but what was he going to say be careful dont take too many chances if its a trap they might not be there at all idalia laughed dont worry brother dear im in no hurry to die she hugged him quickly the tarnkappa a bulky softness between them then turned back to jermayan kellen moved quickly away to give the two of them a little privacy you did well shalkan said moving up to stand beside him even through his armor kellen could feel the heat of the unicorns body as if shalkan carried his own private summer with him kellen grinned without mirth i just pretended i was master belesharon besides i knew shed go anyway and there was no point to wasting the time that would be spent as she and jermayan shouted at each other ah shalkan said dryly the beginning of wisdom idalia moved over the snow in the direction of the cavern mouth the tarnkappa wrapped tightly around her only the footprints she left in the snow betrayed any hint that someone moved here while wearing the magical cloak she could not be seen or heard or scented she hoped it would be enough to keep her safe once she entered the darknessboth figurative and literalahead she was not quite as confident as she had let on to jermayan and kellen everything that shed told them was trueshe was the logical candidate to explore the trapbut she wasnt sure that getting in and out again would be as simple as shed made it sound especially if that was a natural cave idalia had a little bit of experience with natural caves and knew that they could stretch on for leagues twisting and turning more elaborately than any elvencrafted labyrinth despite her tracking skills she might well get lost and if she needed to cast a spell of the wild magic to find her way out it might very well bring the enemy right down on top of her idalia shrugged beneath the tarnkappa there was no use borrowing trouble before it came to call her life was already forfeit to the greater powers when they chose to claim their price was their business hers was getting the children out of danger if they were even there when she reached the mouth of the cavern idalia pulled the hood of the tarnkappa well forward she could see through the fabric as if it wasnt there at all and through the magics aid everything became sharp and clear the dim twilight vanishing to be replaced by a bright clearthough monochromaticlandscape she took a deep breath touching the long knife at her belt and stepped inside she walked a few feet down the passageit was narrow and except for the levelness of the floor looked very much like a natural cavemoving carefully and listening intently for sounds from within except for the sound of the wind whistling over the cavern opening she heard nothing and as she moved deeper into the mountain even that sound stopped at first the path was simple to follow for there was only one possible way to go but soon the passageway opened out she quickly took the chalk and made a small arrow low on the stone pointing back the way shed come she stood for a long moment gazing out into the daybright darkness passages opened out to the left and the right both bearing recent marks of use the one to the right seemed to have been more heavily trafficked though and taking a few steps along it idalia could see traces of scrapemarks along the walls as if something large and heavy had been brought this way fairly recently good enough she went to the right making another mark on the wall to indicate her choice at one point she stopped and lifted her hood utter blackness enveloped her and she could smell no trace of lampoil torchsmoke in the air of the cave whatever lived here did not need light to move through the darkness she lowered her hood relieved to be able to see once more at intervals she paused to mark her way for if the signs were too far apart there was a danger of missing one as she moved deeper into the caves she saw signs that natures work had been improved uponstone had been crudely cut away paths had been widened and leveled all these things were signs not of a temporary hiding place or even a carefullyconstructed trap but of a place where something made its home and that should not benot if what lived here was darktainted enough for vestakia to be able to track it by now she had penetrated quite far into the cave system and though she was on the trail of whatever lived here she wasnt sure she was any closer to finding the children suddenly she became aware that there were faint sounds coming from somewhere aheadthough the direction of sounds could be misleading underground they were barely louder than her own breathing but she wasnt making them idalia moved faster the path led to the edge of a cliff here the cave opened out into the largest space idalia had yet encountered crude stairs were cut into the cliff face leading down to the space below below lay a sort of village and idalia got her first good look at what must be the mysterious hooded figures that kellen had described from where she stood she counted about twenty of them they were gathered around a central cooking fire where some indeterminate carcass smoked and sizzled over a bed of coals when idalia risked another peek without the tarnkappa she could see it was a bed of carefully banked charcoal giving as little light as possible and none of them looked at it directly she pulled her hood back down and continued watching their garments were primitive consisting of little more than a crude loinwrap for males and females both the halfdozen children that she could see wore no clothing at all they were no race that idalia knew or had ever heard described their skin was a dull fishbelly white save for a long dark stripe down their spines and a matching one that covered their lower face and extended down their stomachs their hands and feet seemed to be a darker color as well though whether that was natural pigmentation or just dirt and callus idalia wasnt sure their bodies were entirely hairless but shaggy dark hair left long and untended grew from their scalps from everything she could see they existed at the most primitive tribal level their faces were the most unsettling as if someone had taken something familiar and cruelly distorted it their eyes were large round and bulging they were practically chinless upper and lower jaws pushed forward in a muzzlelike fashion and when one of them opened his mouth to speak a few words in a curious low barking language idalia could see that the mouth was filled with long discolored fangs and their ears were pointed when she saw that the nagging sense of almostfamiliarity idalia had felt when shed seen the creatures settled into place with a sense of almost physical force it was as if it was as if someone somehow had managed to breed elves and goblins together and this was the result oh that isnt possible idalia thought with a wave of nauseated faintness but she knew it was the endarkened delighted in perverting any of the creatures of the light that fell into their hands and they were masters of dark magic the creatures they had created to fight their battles in the great war still plagued the world todaythe coldwarg were just one sample why not these shadowed elves and it would explain how they could be here undetected she told herself with brutal pragmatism if these debased creatures possessed elven blood it was more than likely they could circumvent the ancient wards against intruders placed upon the elven lands they would after all be elves in a sense able to come and go within andoreniels domain as they wished the could have brought the icetrolls and the frostgiants over the border through their own caves no wonder no one had seen them until it was too late idalia stared down into the shadowed elf village with cold horror how many of them were there it had been centuries since the endarkened had possessed elven captives to experiment upon and more importantwhere were they this couldnt be the only encampment of them she hesitated on the verge of turning back right now to warn the others this was a greater threat than the missing childrena darkshadowed race living undetected within the borders of the elven realm itself suddenly a chorus of furious barking down below drew her attention back to the village an argument had broken out at the central firepit several of the shadowed elves were standing in front of it one had a large basket at his feet filled with what looked from this distance like large mushroom caps or flat loaves of bread he was gesturing at the roasting carcass and speaking urgently the other facing himthe chiefwas speaking equally imperatively underscoring his words with gestures that idalia had no trouble in interpreting as a refusal no meat then but for who the argument concluded and the first shadowed elf picked up the basket and walked away his companiona femalefollowed idalia watched as they paused to don long hooded cloaks that covered them all the way to the ankles and for the female to pick up a large jar of the sort that might contain wine or water from the way she moved it was heavy that was curious they obviously werent going outsidethey hadnt put on boots or gloves or any undergarments the cloaks were plainly for concealment feeding prisoners on bread and water prisoners that they didnt want to see them idalias heart began to beat faster once they were cloaked and provisioned the two shadowed elves began ascending the steps idalia moved quickly back along the rim looking frantically around for a niche to hide in they couldnt see or hear her but nothing would save her from discovery if they walked right into her she found nothing and was forced to retreat back the way she came hoping that wouldnt be the direction they ended up coming but luck was with her and when the two shadowed elves reached the top of the steps they headed away from her idalia chalked a quick trailsign and followed them fortunatelybecause the waterjug was heavy and fragilethey moved slowly and idalia was able to follow them at a prudent distance making marks along the way the only danger was that they might hear the sound of the chalk against the stone but she was well behind them and apparently it did not occur to the shadowed elves that there might be any interlopers within their stronghold without them to follow idalia wasnt sure she would ever have found the prisoners for the path they took involved a number of twists and turns but at last they reached their goal a pocket cavern deep within the bowels of the mountain the doorway to the cave stood open the shadowed elves had trustedand rightly soto the darkness outside to serve as a more perfect jailer than any doors or locks only the truly desperate would try to find their way through that blackness and if the captives did not fall to their deaths over an unseen precipice they would be easily recaptured before they ever found their way to the surface chapter eight prisoners of darkness calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink lairamo did not know how long they had been here it was hard to measure time even by sleeping and waking their cloaked captors had fed them seven times since they had arrivedbaskets of flat tasteless fungus and jars of stale waterand so she had scratched seven marks upon the wall but the meals such as they were might not be coming at regular intervals or if they were those intervals might not be the same as a day she kept her thoughts to herself there was no point in adding fresh terrors to a situation that had already grown beyond horror at first she had been grateful that they were left together that no atrocities were visited upon her charges it had been peculiar that the door to the cavern was left unbarred and unguarded and it had been alkandoran who had first suggested that they must try to escape he had persuaded her to let him take one of the lanterns and see if he could find the way out and at last reluctantly she had let him have his way he was gone a very long time at last he had returnedin the hands of two of their hooded captors his face was white and strained and the lantern was gone they had shoved him back into the cavern then entered selecting one of the remaining lanterns and smashing it carefully the lamp oil had kindled in a bright brief flare as it burned away into darkness the silent message was clear escape was impossible further attempts would be punished by the removal of more of the lanterns lairamo did not think any of them could stand this captivity in the darkness and the hooded ones might take one or both of the braziers as well and the children surely could not survive the cold so they huddled together in the wan light of the two remaining lanterns keeping their spirits up as best they could all of them were cold and filthy especially the babyand slept huddled together beneath a pile of their cloaks and the strange hammocks in which theyd been carried here lairamo encouraged the children to sleep as much as they could and did everything she could think of to keep them from talking or thinking of what the future might hold among the items left behind here by their captors had been a gan set alkandoran had taught the younger children to play and bullied them into it constantly no one was very good at it but it kept their minds off where they were at least a little the only thing they could do was wait alkandoran had told her of what little hed managed to see before hed been recapturedhed wandered for what seemed like hours through cave passages that all looked alike and hed been pretty sure hed been going in circles the hooded ones had waited until his lantern ran out of oil before taking him so he was fairly sure theyd been following him the whole time a faint scuffling in the outer darkness heralded the return of their captors once more reflexively lairamo drew the children to her and scuttled back against the farthest wall of the cave they huddled against her skirts and she put her arms around as many of them as she could a few moments later the two cloaked and hooded figures appeared faint ghosts in the dimness as always one carried a wide shallow basket and the other carried a water jar they set their burdens down just inside the doorway where the shadows were thickest then one of them moved to collect the empty jar in moments the two were gone again lairamo made them all wait for several minutes before they approached the food and water though they were hungry all the time these days and thirsty as well she rationed their supplies as best she could but they were entirely at the mercy of their jailers and without constant supplies they would die of thirst long before they starved just as she was getting stiffly to her feet kalania balanced on her hip there was a sudden blur of motion and a figure appeared out of nowhere standing in the middle of the chamber tredianala gave a hoarse cry of alarm and alkandoran jerked the slender girl behind him but after a moments pang of terror lairamo recognized the intruder idalia praise to the gods of leaf and star ive come to get you out of here theres a rescue party waiting nearby idalia had followed the two shadowed elves to their destination she waited until they were well out of sight before advancing on the cave she didnt know what prisoners it might contain but she meant to rescue them whoever they wereshe would leave no one in the hands of these creatures she edged closer wrinkling her nose the cavern smelled of longand unsanitaryoccupancy when she rounded the corner and looked inside her heart leaped lairamo and the childrenand as far as she could see they were all alive and whole though filthy and haggard she stepped into the cave and flung off her tarnkappa instantly the world became dimthough by some whim the shadowed elves had left their elven prisoners a lantern or two to see by they will catch you the oldest boy said grimly i tried to get away once they followed me for a long time then they brought me back here ah idalia said lightly hoping to rally their spirits but i have magic this cloak conceals me from sight and soundand anything i have under it as well ive marked the way to the surface and with the hood down i can see in the dark as well as they can i can carry you all to safety and no one will suspect a thing but it will take several trips sandalon and kalania will go first lairamo said calmly they are the youngest and the smallest the rest of us will wait here theres something moving out there the unicorns had excellent nightsightbetter even than the elvesand the three unicorns in the party had volunteered to keep watch on the cave mouth from the edge of the trees shalkan had the first watch kellen was standing with himnot because he could be at all useful the darkness was nothing but dark to him and the moon was too new to give any proper light the merest fingernail crescent in the sky sennights from fullbut because this was in a sense his plan or at least his responsibility he was too keyedup to sit at the warmth of the brazier with the others waiting for idalia to come back his fidgeting would do more harm than good to their spirits he was wise enough to know that much what is it what do you see kellen fought to keep his voice low and level footprints in the snow shalkan said coming this way kellen loosened his sword in its scabbard he hoped it was idalia in the tarnkappa but other beings possessed the secret of invisibility as well or someone might have taken it from her but vestakia had given no warning so kellen was merely alert not preparing for battle a few yards away from where shalkan stood the air seemed to shimmer suddenly kellen could see idalia clearly she was holding a bundle in her arms there was a wriggle of movement and sandalon dropped from her back and ran to kellen kellen dropped to one knee to receive the elven prince who buried his face in kellens shoulder the boy was trembling but did not make a sound ive got to go back idalia said without preamble the rest of them are still therealive and safe for now but im the only one who can get them out and it has to be done quickly theres more news and worsethat cavern is home to a whole race of darktainted creatures that seem to be some kind of elvengoblin hybrid she thrust the bundlethe baby kalaniaat kellen swirled the tarnkappa around herself again and vanished come on kellen said picking up sandalon and trying not to drop the toddler lets go back and find the others jermayan and vestakia are here theyll be glad to see you you know youre safe now sandalon began to tremble even harder and kellen felt the warmth of soundless tears against his cheek kellen was able to hand kalania to vestakia when he reached the others sandalon flatly refused to let go of him everyone had leaped to their feet when he approached taking in the sight of the two children and understanding what it meant where is idalia jermayan demanded the normal courtly speech of elvenkind subsumed beneath war manners gone back for the others kellen answered briefly she says theyre all alive and well and that she can get them all out everyone on your guard and ready to ride jermayan said we need to move as soon as everyone has been recovered the knights moved briskly about the campsite saddling horses and unicorns and checking equipment evanor the elven healer took kalania from vestakia and laid her down on a blanket near the brazier and peeled off the layers of sodden foul garments to examine her though the toddler was thin and filthy and obviously stunned with terror evanor was able to apply soothing salves to the worst of her rashes swaddle her in clean cloths and get her to drink a little broth with a soothing potion mixed in after which the child fell immediately asleep it would be well if i were to examine young sandalon as well evanor said when he was finished with kalania im fine sandalon said sharply his voice high with fear his hands were wrapped around a cup of broth and he was sitting on kellens lap at evanors words he recoiled of course you are vestakia said coming to kneel beside kellen she smoothed back sandalons hair it was greasy and matted after so long without washing or combing i can tell that i know about these things we found you because i can sense them you know thats the trail we followed but i couldnt sense any of you at all we didnt even know for sure you were in there until idalia went in to look so thats how i know youre all right youre sure sandalon asked his voice torn between pleading and suspicion poor little fellow kellen well remembered his own agonized fears of being demontaintedand he hadnt been a fiveyearold child whod seen all his friends horribly slaughtered then been held prisoner by monsters down in the dark no wonder the boy didnt want to be examined too closely im sure vestakia said firmly sandalon looked at kellen shed know kellen assured him and you should let evanor make sure youre not hurt or going to become ill and give you clean dry clothes to change to were going to have a long way to ride tonight if idalia gets the others out safely and what if she doesnt what are we going to do then reluctantly sandalon allowed himself to be examined by evanor who pronounced him to be in better shape than kalania and dosed him with a strengthening cordial just then two of the unicorns trotted off as if summoned by a voice only they could hear and shalkan walked into the clearing with tredianala clinging to his mane the girl was crying and quivering with terrorkellen recalled that she had been particularly timidand evanor quickly took charge of her speaking soothingly to her and leading her over to the brazier four more to go shalkan said coming over to kellen four more trips kellen didnt ask the question that was uppermost in all of their minds how long can idalias luck hold out lairamo had sent the oldest girl on the second trip because tredianala was the most fearful of the remaining children and idalia had blessed the soundcloaking properties of the tarnkappa with every step she took as the child had cried the entire way just as if she were not on her way to rescue and safety the second inandout went much faster than the first and she was able to deposit tredianala within sight of shalkan and turn back to the cavern by now her tracks were a deep rut in the snow the sight of them gave her a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach but there wasnt much she could do about them if the shadowed elves came outside the proverbial goose was cooked anyway they just had to hope they could get the captives out and make it to the fortress of the crowned horns with them before the enemy could come up with any more deathwings or coldwarg down into the dark again and the caverns began to seem like an old friend this time she took vendalton now only alkandoran merisashendiel and lairamo were left the boy rode piggyback his arms clutched about her throat her back was starting to hurt this was different from carrying a pack all day in the wildwood a pack didnt squirm around trying to get comfortable and occasionally kick you in the stomach by accident she reached the cave opening and stepped outside she looked around wary of ambush i will take the child idalia coethare materialized silently out of nowhere with a grateful sigh idalia set vendalton into the unicorns saddle and turned back into the cave merisashendiel was next the girl regarded her with bigeyed fear suddenly unwilling to leave the others lairamo had to scold and bully her before she would take her place on idalias shoulders but what if they die merisashendiel said what if the others come while youre gone and take them hush idalia said brusquely talking cant change what will be and if they havent come yet they probably wont come at all i hope did the shadowed elves check on their captives between feedings thered be no real reason to and theyd just been fed she tried to put from her mind what alkandoran had said about how hed been tracked and tormented on his one escape attempt as shed told the child talking couldnt change what would be up through the twisting maze of tunnels that led to the village cavern along the rim back through the maze of tunnels that led to the surface and safety she could no longer remember for how many hours shed been doing this how far shed walked through this underground world the surface once again and another waiting unicorn merisashendiel wanted to argue with her to suggest that she should be the one to go back down idalia dumped her rudely into the unicorns saddle and turned away lairamo should go first alkandoran said when idalia arrived certainly not lairamo said calmly you will heed me in this child go with idalia lairamo looked up at idalia their eyes met and idalia knew that they were both thinking the same thing she couldnt carry alkandoran but he was small and slender she could fit him under the tarnkappa with her if he put his arms around her waist and pressed very close to her and they moved slowly she could not fit lairamo under the tarnkappa with her at all i will find a way idalia vowed silently but alkandoran began well do it her way idalia said now this is going to be awkward and slow ill need your help and your full cooperation if we are to get out of here alive alkandoran swallowed hard doing his best not to look as frightened as idalia knew he felt the sooner i have you out of here the sooner i can come back for lairamo idalia said calmly alkandoran nodded this trip to the surface was agonizingly slow as the two of them shuffled along beneath idalias cloak over and over idalia blessed lairamos practical nononsense calmnessafter a sennight in the hands of the shadowed elves the captives could all have been completely hysterical too terrified to cooperate in their own rescue she wasnt sure what she would have done if that had been the casethe younger ones she could have bespelled into unconsciousness perhaps and hope that using the wild magic didnt draw their captors to them immediately but she would never have gotten alkandoran to the surface without his intelligent cooperation shalkan was waiting at the cave mouth you were gone a long time this time slow going idalia said untangling the cloak from herself and alkandoran the youngster stepped away from her drawing a shaky breath just lairamo now well be waiting for you come lad shalkan said idalia took a moment to stretch wrapping the cloak firmly around her before stepping back into the cave once more shed already made up her mind what to do about getting lairamo out she suspected that shalkan had guessed her plan lairamo wasnt going to like it but it was the only way and she only hoped shed be around so that jermayan could scold her for it later no lairamo said when idalia told her yes idalia said just as firmly ive been over the route several times by now and besides ill be right behind you i know how to move silently just follow the marks ive left and theyll lead you straight to the surface i will not buy my life at the expense of yours and what of the prince idalia was fighting dirty and she knew it but she intended to win this argument and swiftly he has seen his friends killed and goes now to live among strangers at the fortress of the crowned horns do i tell him i have left you behind to die he needs you and the nine cities need him you will take the tarnkappa lairamos shoulders slumped as idalias arguments hit home best done quickly then the elven nursemaid muttered but i do not forgive you this debt you place upon me idalia wildmage i do not expect it i carry too many unpaid debts these days she quickly flung the cloak over lairamos shoulders and pulled the hood down over her face showing herby touch since lairamo was now invisiblehow to hold the cloak to keep herself concealed then with her hand on the shoulder of the nowinvisible presence before her idalia and lairamo made their way out of the cave they moved more slowly than idalia would have liked for lairamo had to stop and look for the marks that idalia had left but they gradually made their way toward the surface and freedom all along idalia worried more for those waiting than for herself they were pressing their luck every moment the party waited outside the cavern mouthif this were her home she would certainly post a watch over its entrance but perhaps the shadowed elves did not think like elves or like men or perhaps letting the captives escape was just another aspect of the trap all went smoothlythough with agonizing slownessuntil they reached the path around the underground village idalia recognized it by the feeling of space and by the faint glow of the firepit belownot enough for human eyes to see by but enough to mark the place since she had passed it so many times already this evening she only hoped the creatures were all asleep but thought that was too much to hope forthe meat she had seen roasting earlier argued that they were hunters and probably hunted at night she strained her ears for sounds from below suddenly she heard what she had feared and dreadedthe stealthy approach of bare feet on rock there was a faint clickas of a spear butt hitting rockand a flurry of muttered whispers she felt invisible hands plucking at her frantically perhaps lairamo had tried to shout a warning not realizing that the tarnkappa would muffle all sounds go lairamo idalia shouted go on for sandalons sake praying the woman would heed her she turned and fled back in the opposite direction her eyes tightly shut hoping desperately that she remembered the tunnels as well as shed claimed a chorus of guttural cries greeted her flightno more need for silence now that the prey was wise to the huntand idalia heard the sound of bare feet slapping against stone as the creatures ran after her lairamo stood frozen in horror as five creatures out of nightmare ran after idalia none of them so much as paused to glance at her so strong was the wildmagery of idalias cloak a choking sensation rose in lairamos throat as she realized that idalia had given up her life to draw the hunters away so that lairamo could gain the surface alive for the young prince lairamo thought her heart stoneheavy grimly she turned away to look for the marks that would lead her to the surface pacing wont get them here any faster kellen said to jermayan the elven knight shot him a dark look and did not reply everyone was standing to saddle ready to ride the moment idalia and lairamo appeared it was better than tempting fortune by lingering here a moment longer than they had to vestakia was standing watch now at the edge of the trees adding her own magical senses to that of the unicorns alert for trouble if the creatures idalia had named shadowed elves came near to the surface vestakia would know kellen had been dearly tempted to send the others on ahead but he did not want to split the party into two small groups if there were an ambush laid along the way they needed to be at their full strength so they waited suddenly sandalon gave a high scream of terror and a moment later lairamo appeared kneeling beside him and clutching him to her chest stroking his hair and gabbling apologies for having frightened him the tarnkappa was pooled at her feet it was the cloak my heart i forgot the cloak oh forgive me my darling sandalon clung to her sobbing in relief jermayan snatched up the cloak and shook it as if its empty folds might somehow produce idalia idalia was all he said lairamo looked up at him her face filled with grief and misery she looked at the tarnkappa as if she wished to burn it on the spot only one could wear it she was seen she ran deeper into the cavern lestlest i be discovered come on kellen barely recognized the voice as his own weve got to get you out of here im staying jermayan said wadding the tarnkappa in his hands and probably charging right in there after her if no one stops you kellen thought vestakia you go with them kellen said continuing as if jermayan hadnt spoken youll need to keep watch along the road to let them know if there are any traps along the way jermayan and i will keep watch here and bring idalia along when she comes the way he said it it almost seemed as if it were possible and if he were to think of it logically they should all leave now together but idalia was a wildmage of great power and kellen wasnt ready to give up on her quite yet as for jermayan well the world would fall apart around him before anyone could make him leave leaf and star be with you evanor said quietly vestakia and the knights quickly mounted taking lairamo and the children up with them and rode off in the direction of the crowned horns the unicorns leading the way in moments the clearing was deserted except for jermayan valdien kellen shalkan and idalias palfrey im going in after her jermayan said no youre not kellen said snatching the tarnkappa out of the elven knights hands not if i have to knock you senseless to keep you from doing it as if you could knightmage jermayan said but there was a grudging willingness to listen in his voice kellen might be able to convince his friend if he spoke quickly one we both know idalia can take care of herself two neither of us knows where she is three she hasnt been gone that longnot if shes leading pursuit away deeper into the mountain what were going to do is wait for herhere where she knows to find us if she hasnt come back in a reasonable time then ill do a finding spell and based on what that tells us well come up with a plan but i dont know whether those things can sense wild magic so i dont want to do one before its absolutely necessary very well jermayan said grudgingly i will wait for a while but do not try my patience for long idalia ran through the darkness her hands outstretched in front of her to keep herself from running fulltilt into a wall she dared not slow her headlong pace for she could hear the sounds of pursuit close behind she no longer knew where she was in the cave system a flung spear made her flinch aside then another and suddenly there was no rock beneath her feet only air idalia fell cilarnen awoke lying on the floor in a tiny room that could only be described as a cell it was a cubicle a bit less than eight feet squarethough at least three times that in heightwith a stone bench at one end the only light came through a small grille set in the door when he ran to the door and looked out he could see that the corridor was as featureless as his cell though it was lit to blinding brightness by globes of hovering magelight he wrapped his arms around himself and shivered gulping several times to try to banish his fear when they had begun this adventureand he now realized with the clarity of despair that in some sense it had been an adventure for all of themit had never occurred to any of them that it could end like this he had no idea of where he might be though he knew he was in the hands of the high council somehow they had discovered what they were doing and arrested them all he hoped the others were all right all right cilarnens mouth twisted in a bitter smile he wasnt sure what was going to happen to them but he doubted any of them was going to be all right he walked stiffly over to the bench and sat down leaning back against the wall whatever the council decided he knew his own fate his father would burn the magegift from his mind and disinherit him what in the name of the light was he supposed to do with the rest of his life he was a mage that was all he was that was all hed ever wanted to be to study the intricacies of the high artto use his power for the good of the cityto perhaps someday create a refinement of one of the spells in the great book and to gain his fathers seat on the high council or even to serve beside him and now it was all over he wasnt even nineteen yet what in the name of the light did you think you were doing it was like awakening from a beautiful dream only to discover that it had been a nightmare all along everything had seemed so plausible with the umbrastone they could convince the high council to listen to them before the city was in ruins idiot idiot whatever made you think theyd listen to you when they wouldnt listen to half the mages in the city all youve done is bring disgrace on house volpiril and ruination on your friends farmer kellen couldnt have done better with the thought of kellen tavadon a new thought struck him if the high council made lycaelon tavadons son disappear maybe theyll send me to the same place strangely the thought brought comfort at the same time cilarnen was awakening in his cell below the council house setarion volpiril was being escorted into lycaelons private offices as the chorus of second night bells echoed through the city he had not of course been asleep the high mages were by necessity creatures of the hours of darkness since the quiet night hours were best for the elaborate workings of the high magick he had been called from the grand circlewhich was by day the council chamberby the archmages personal authority and escorted to lycaelons office by six stone golems and the archmages personal private secretary anigrel stood aside to let him pass then followed lord volpiril into the office he kept his face carefully neutral betraying no hint of the exultation he felt tonight was the culmination of plans carefullynurtured for yearsplans that would deliver such a blow to the golden city that would weaken it past all ability to defend itself he had seen lord volpiril beforealmost daily in factbut for the first time it struck anigrel how very much cilarnen resembled his fatherthe same russet hair the same pale blue eyes proper mageborn breeding saw to that of course among the sons of the mageborn only kellen outlaw had not taken after his father in more ways than one what is the meaning of this volpiril demanded before lycaelon had a chance to speak you interrupt the working upon the citywardswe shall have to begin again from the beginningall that time all that preparation wasted this had better be worth my time another will take your place lycaelon said calmly be seated lord volpiril and calm yourself because of your long service to the cityhowever misguidedi have brought you here tonight to offer you a choice whatever volpiril might have been expecting to hear obviously it was not this he turned sideways glancing back at anigrel who was still standing beside the door i repose all confidence and trust in anigrel and what you will hear from him has every bearing on the decision you will make here lycaelon said decision what decision volpiril demanded sweeping his robes about himself and settling into the seat opposite the archmages desk his pale eyes glittered with exasperation whether to give up your seat on the council and retire utterly into private life i am willing in that case to accept your oath and parole providing you do nothing to interfere with cilarnens trial and banishment cilarnen lord volpiril halfrose from his seat thought better of it and settled slowly back again what has the boy to do with anything he is at home asleep in his bed he was arrested not two bells agofor treason lycaelon said he smiled gazing fully into his enemys eyes treason volpiril leaned back in the low chair visibly shaken i do not believe it i will not believe it a dozen mages saw himand the cabal he had formedpreparing to make umbrastone anigrel said speaking for the first time there can be no doubt where would he have gotten such a notion lycaelon demanded his grey eyes hard where would he have gotten the materialsthe information there is only one place oh he has not been questioned yet whether he is questioned that is up to you but i am innocent i knew nothing of this question me under truthspell and by the light i will give you your proof volpiril demanded his face the ashy grey of shock my dear setarion lycaelon said shaking his head ruefully i am certain that you no longer remember your part in this no truthspell would implicate you as you well know and i doubt young cilarnen remembers who it was that set his foot upon the path to treason but your recent actions in council speak for themselves about your oftprofessed love for the city myrecentactions suddenly volpiril grew even paler if that had been possible seen in the light of this his demands to remove the protection of the city from the farmlands outside it and the subsequent results would look like the beginning of a plan to destroy armethalieh no there is no profit to be had from this setarion and the best you can hope for is to escape with your own skin intact said lycaelon either resign your seat and retire utterly from public affairs or i shall see you tried for treason beside your son and when you are banished with himas you shall bei shall see house volpiril brought down to ruin and all who bear your name shall live out their days in poverty and shame anigrels face was impassive lycaelons was almost as expressionless but there was perhaps the trace of a gleam in his eye choose lord volpiril got to his feet trembling with rage and perhapsat last even with fear this is a plot he said his voice hoarse with anger indeed lycaelon said and your son was its instigator you leave me no choice there is always a choice the archmage said dispassionately there was a moment of tension then volpiril bowed his head very well he said in a low voice i resign and i have your oath that you will work no further treason lycaelon asked silkily volpirils head snapped up and he took a quick step toward lycaelon fists clenched for a moment anigrel watching thought that volpiril might actually attempt to strike the archmage and regretted leaving the stone golems outside the door but lycaelon had judged the character of his enemy well you have my oath volpiril said his voice a groan i shall work no treason against the high council against the city or against the archmage as he spoke the words lycaelon lifted his wand from his desk and sketched a glyph in the air keying the prepared spells each one drifted outward from the walls and settled over volpirils body binding him more firmly and eternally than golden chains very good lord volpiril lycaelon said a note of patronizing approval in his voice now go home anigrel opened the door for lord volpiril and closed it quietly behind him he wondered in a disinterested fashion if the man would still be alive by morning or would contrive to end his life in some spectacular fashion certainly he no longer had anything to live for come sit lycaelon said to anigrel indicating the chair beside him now we have made a place for you on the council but i am not finished yet breulin and isas must gothey are implicated as well are they not jorade isas is the greatgreatgrandnephew of lord isas his heir i believe as lord isas has never married geont pentres is the youngest son of house pentres which is allied to house breulin i believe a case can be made for both lords involvement anigrel said smoothly youre certain cilarnen was the ringleaderat lord volpirils instigation lycaelon demanded eagerly absolutely his magickal abilities were rated by his teachers at the mage college as exceptional i would not be at all surprised to learn that there were spells of compulsion involved on at least some of the others lycaelon smiled very good a little judicious mindhealing and pentres and young isas wont remember their parts in this terrible matter i will offer that to lord breulin and lord isas as an inducement to see reason if they will not of course there is no reason to believe that their dependents have the proper character to wield the high magick now is there anigrel certainly not lord lycaelon anigrel said gravely and the other three lycaelon asked moving on one is tradeborn with your permission we can burn the gift out of him tomorrow and banish him tomorrow evening or the day after once the boundaries have been extended over the central valley once again he is being fostered by house arcable fines and restrictions there id suggest very good ill see a proposed schedule for that on my desk by the end of the sennight ah i must remember to stop giving you such orders anigrel you must instruct my new secretary to be as efficient as you have been i will see to it lord lycaelon anigrel said with a smile the last two conspirators present unique difficulties each in his own way one is kermis lalkmairyou will recall the family lycaelon sighed an eternal thorn in my side anigrel permitted himself another smile dyren lalkmair was an eccentric scholar devoted to study and research the family shunned politics utterly it is said that lord lalkmair would rather burn the gift out of one of his sons than see him hold a seat on a city council he would view treason even more harshly you will be seen as both merciful and just if you simply hand kermis lalkmair over to his family for judgment and i do not think he will ever be a problem to us again an excellent notion anigrel lycaelon said warmly you will be a formidable asset to the high council and the last you said there were two problems margon ogregance he is the son of the high mage epalin ogregance who oversees the merchants and provenders council lycaelon sighed and lord ogregance has been telling me since before the rains came that volpirils decree would be the ruin of us allas if i didnt know it he frowned anigrel regarded the archmage with faint curiosity hed never thought that either charity or disinterested kindness were a part of lycaelons emotional makeup such hesitancy over young margons fate was most unlike him or perhaps this was the considered rumination of a consummate political gameplayer weighing all the possibilities before coming to a decision the high mage ogregance was an important figure in the cityespecially nowand to alienate him at this delicate juncture could be disastrous it was ogregance who dealt most directly with the home farms and kept the skittish and quarrelsome merchants in line it is of course a transgression worth banishment lycaelon said at last or at the very least the removal of young margons magegift butas i will make plain to lord ogregancehouse volpiril has been at the root of all of this from the attempt to starve the city by the ruinous and illconsidered reduction of our borders to this latest attempt to overthrow us utterly his son was but a pawn there will be punishment of course margon ogregances advancement in rank will not be as swift as it might have otherwise been we must be certain that this cankerous growth was entirely of house volpirils instigation but once these inconvenient memories have been pruned from his mindi shall do that myselfperhaps the young tree will grow straight once more and mage ogregance will be your devoted partisan and supporter for as long as he lives lest you suddenly discover evidence that margon was in fact a willing participant in cilarnen volpirils plot anigrel thought admiringly lycaelon tavadon might be foolish in many ways but the man was a master manipulator of his fellow mages and even anigrel stood in awe of his grasp of politics all for the good of the city of course as defined by the archmage lycaelon tavadon an excellent solution archmage anigrel said allowing his voice to fill with the warmth of admiration and if you will permit i will take care of the preparations for rolfort and young cilarnen after all he smiled coldly it need not be elegant indeed an answering wolflight kindled in lycaelons eyes but i know that your work could never be anything less than perfection anigrel you are you are the son i should have had anigrel bowed his pale head modestly casting his eyes downward lord archmage i and why should you not be lycaelon said struck by a sudden inspiration i have no childrenyou have no family you have been my son in all but body it is not right that the name of tavadon which has served this great city so well and so long should die with me i shall adopt youmake you my heirand you will serve the city after me in the name of tavadon my lord i this was going even better than he had dreamed as the archmages heir anigrel would be in an unassailable position of power and influence no one would dare speak against him such adoptions were not common but they werent entirely unheardof either especially in the light of lycaelons personal history both his children banished and both halfbreeds hed never actually had a true mageborn son i shall serve you more faithfully than you can imagine my son lycaelon seemed to savor the words as if they were some rare delicacy my true son come lights day i shall have you entered on the rolls of the temple of the light as my true son and heir you shall take volpirils seat in council and i shall see you raised from master undermage to the ranks of the high mages themselves my lord anigrel said a faint modest note of protest in his voice his present rank was master undermage his elevation to that rank from journeyman undermage had been unwontedly swift and a signal mark of lycaelons favor to go from there to high mage was normally the work of decades of study many mageborn never reached the higher ranks of magery at all what do you not think my son is worthy of such an honor lycaelon demanded with heavyhanded humor i know you are more than capable in the art i think my lord anigrel said practically that it will cause jealously and bad feeling among your fellows and that will work to my advantage in time bah the petty quibbles of petty fools i swore i would bring the council to heel when volpiril forced his madness upon me and so i shall this is but the beginning we shall do great things together anigrel indeed we shall lord archmage indeed we shall he must have sleptthough cilarnen had no memory of dozing offbut the hard click of stoneonstone roused cilarnen to heartpounding wakefulness footsteps in the corridor outside stone golem footsteps he was on his feet before he realized hed moved his back pressed against the wall of his cell as if he could somehow transport himself through the unyielding stone they were coming for him his hands clenched and unclenched without his conscious volition he made a hundred plans and discarded them in an instantnot for escape he knew that was impossible but to somehow save the others surely the high council would give him a chance to explain to tell them that this had all been his idea the cell door opened cilarnen blinked as light flooded the cell a globe of magelight floated in over the mans head and rose toward the ceiling and in the new brightness cilarnen could see that his visitor was a blond man who wore the plain grey robes and tabard of a master undermage behind him stood a pair of stone golems cilarnen volpiril you are in a great deal of trouble the stranger said pleasantly i am undermage anigrel i am here to explain matters to you anigrel but the archmages private secretary here one of the stone golems stepped into the cell and set down a large basket beside the door the necessities of your imprisonment undermage anigrel said cilarnen did not bother to glance toward the basket his whole being was focused on the undermage imprisonment for how long forever what what about the others it was the hardest thing cilarnen had ever done to get the sentence out his mouth was dry and his tongue seemed to have grown unbearably clumsy he stumbled over the words as if he had forgotten how to speak undermage anigrel raised his eyebrows in mild reproof the other traitors they will be dealt with appropriately you should consider your own fate theyit was my idea all of it words came easier now and it seemed terribly important to make undermage anigrel believe him oh we know that all a plot of house volpiril to seize power in the city for itself but you have failed cilarnen stared at the undermage in dawning horror it had never occurred to himneverthat no matter what he did anyone would think his father was involved in it no he my father lord volpiril no he took a step forward though he had no idea why the ingrained habit of submission to lawful authority held even now undermage anigrel raised a slender hand do not try to protect him he has already confessed everything and resigned his seat on the high council preparing to await his fate now there is only your fate to consider cilarnen staggered backward again leaning now against the wall of the cell for support the cell seemed suddenly airless its atmosphere stifling his father had confessed to what i dont understand cilarnen whispered i told him nothing but it was he who first planted these ideas in your mind then erased the memory of the conversationthough not the seeds of treasonby magecraft undermage anigrel said kindly how else could you have come by such foolish notions what could you have been thinking of i dont knowi dont know cilarnen moaned he staggered the few steps to the stone bench and flung himself down covering his face with his hands could that truly be what had happened he didnt know he didnt remember i want to talk to my father cilarnen said raising his face from his hands he would confront lord volpiril demand an explanationor at least the truth alas that is no longer possible undermage anigrel said he did not sound sorry at all it will never be possible again and now you must pay for your part in these events as well for even if your father planted the compulsions in your mind had you been a true son of the city and loyal first to her welfare you would have thrown off those compulsions recognizing them as treasonable he shook his head sadly no i fear that the fruit does not fall far from the tree and treasonous blood breeds treasonous blood cilarnen simply stared at anigrel stunned now to numbness hed thought the plan was all his own idea now the undermage was saying that it wasntbut he was saying that cilarnen was still to be punished for it oh come master cilarnen anigrel said chidingly sounding in that moment so much like one of cilarnens magecollege tutors that for a moment he had the surreal feeling he was back in school but anigrels next words returned him to reality with a chilling jolt it does not matter where the foul notion of overthrowing the high council came from you were still free to reject itto go about the lawful business of serving the city but you did not but webut ibut we never we only wanted the council to listen to us cilarnen said in a very small voice and so you chose to create a weapon that destroys magick what an odd way to make someone listen to be sure undermage anigrel answered caustically you dabbled in the proscribed arts master cilarnen and for that crime you are to be stripped of your gift and banished from the city just as soon as her bounds are restored at sunset three days hence you will be set outside the delfier gate garbed in the saffron cloak of felony from that moment you are outlaw forbidden sanctuary anywhere within armethaliehan lands you will be provided with a days supply of bread and water after that is gone you must find sustenance on your own at dawn the outlaw hunt will pass through those same gates and if you are still within the bounds of armethaliehan lands they will rend you limb from limb so you would be well advised to spend the night getting as far away from the city as you can you may not go to the villages by tomorrows dawn they will once more belong to the city do you understand banished cilarnen stared at undermage anigrel stunned from the city but no one is banished not any more not for centuries it was a tale to frighten children withlike demons surely anigrel smiled believe what you wish for as long as you can in two days time rolfort will know the truth in three so will you but where will i go cilarnen asked blankly undermage anigrel shook his head in exasperation boy it does not matter to us from the moment you don the felons cloakfrom the moment you are set outside the city gatesyou are no longer a citizen of armethalieh you are dead to the city and to everyone you ever knew just as your father is you will never return here you are banished now do you understand even in the azure magelight anigrel could see that the boy was deathly pale his face sheened with the sweat of terror and growing despair anigrel felt a warm glow of satisfaction let the pampered highborn brat think his father was dead he would never know otherwise i understand cilarnen said at last his voice trembled very good and since we cannot have mages wandering around outside the cityespecially rebellious halftrained magesyou would do well to heed me now the keyphrase triggered the prepared spell and cilarnens eyelids fluttered closed as he slipped quickly into the spellfed trance he barely struggled the stronger the gift the more susceptible the subject to certain forms of magick anigrel moved closer catching cilarnen as he slumped and laying him out on the stone bench he felt the pulse of cilarnens magick hot and strong and when he entered cilarnens mind he could see that the parts of the boys brain that sensed and handled mageenergy glowed as bright as a furnace cilarnen was a strong mage with a strong welltrained gift it took anigrel nearly two bells to do what needed to be donelycaelon was quite right his work was never less than perfectionand there were few other mages in the city of any rank who could have equaled it and none who could have detected it when he had finished anigrel felt the weight of weariness pulling at him perhaps he should sleep and rest himself before dealing with young rolfort though the work he would do there would be much simpler he considered the matter for a moment and decided against it no to wait might raise questions he could pass off the length of time hed spent here by saying he was questioning the boys but not the need to rest between excisions and if his work on rolfort was less than elegant well the boy wasnt going to live long enough to show evidence of the fact now was he unlike young lord cilarnen anigrel had plans for cilarnen he gazed down at the sleeping mageborn with the fondness of a craftsman for a tool that would yet give good service to anyone who might think to look it would seem that cilarnens gift had been burned from his mind just as was proper for any of the higher ranks of magery who were banished it would seem that way to cilarnen himself for a time but anigrel had other plans cilarnen volpiril was far too valuable a pawn to cast away simply because he had been useful once and if he were to be useful again anigrel wanted him intact and at the height of his powers it was possible for the first time in recent memory to survive the hunt enlarging the citys boundaries to their old limits would be the work of moonturns and when cilarnen was turned out of the delfter gate the city lands would only extend over the central valley a determined mana man who had the wit to steal a horsemight actually escape the city lands in a night rolfort of course would not be so fortunate anigrel would make certain of that but when cilarnen escapedand a desire to escape was only one of the compulsions anigrel had laid upon him in his long workingthere was only one place he could go to the wild lands where the outlaw kellen lived like would surely call to like fellow outlaws fellow victims of misfortune surely they would become as brothers and then anigrel would spring his trap taking a deep breath and marshaling his strength anigrel summoned the globe of magelight and walked from the cell preparing to pay a call upon his other victim at dawn bells lycaelon was given the exquisite pleasure of entertaining lords isas and breulin in his council chambers both mages of course already knew most of the details of the plot and the arrests that had occurred at midnight bells if servants gossip ran swiftly in the city of a thousand bells then gossip among the mageborn ran swifter and lycaelon had seen no reason to stifle it he had known that within a bell at most the undermages who had arrested the boys would have seen to it that the details of the matter would reach their families whether out of spite or from a hope of currying later favor he had entertained himself with imagining the petitions that must be flying back and forth between the families involved and their high mage headsisas and breulinas everyone scrabbled for information that simply wasnt available isas had always been something of an ally to him but even isas had not voted with him against volpiril in the end and he would pay for that now and breulin had always opposed his policies it would be well to be rid of both of them he saw isas first the aged high mage was escorted into lycaelons chambers by the same stone golems who had summoned him from his house the old man was quivering with such indignation that for a moment lycaelon was sure isas was going to drop dead on the spot and save him a great deal of trouble lord isas he said cordially do sit down you really dont look well light forgive him but he was enjoying this lord lycaelonwhat is the meaning of this isas demanded oh i think you already know lycaelon said almost purring the question is what are you prepared to do about it the meeting went very much as lycaelon intended it to jorade was lord isass only possible heir to keep the boy whole and unmarred isas was willing to give up his seat on the council and take the same oath lord volpiril had he was in fact absurdly grateful to do so my dear lord lycaeloni had no ideano idea he quavered the elderly lord isas seemed to have aged a decade from the moment he had entered lycaelons chambers his skin had taken on a greyish tinge and his breathing was harsh did i not warn youall of youwhat volpiril was time and again lycaelons voice was stern yet none of you listenedeven you lawell and i thought you my friend i wasi meant to be isas protested butafter kellenall of us thought lycaelons face froze at the mention of the forbidden name yet he consoled himself he had a new son now a better son a son who would be all to him that the outlaw had never been you thought i had let my emotions overmaster me lycaelon said heavily and now you see that i actedthen as alwaysfor the good of the city yes lord isas said bowing his head humbly i see that now lycaelon go home lawell lycaelon said almost kindly i will send jorade to you when the mindhealers have finished with him treat him well a true son is a precious gift he reached for the bellpull let me summon a servant to escort you home you really dont look at all well the meeting with lord breulin went a bit more awkwardly breulin had always been his opponent in council he was a man in the vigor of his prime ambitious enough to wish to become archmage himself someday but lycaelon was firm my lord if you wish to see the matter come to a public trial before the council that is of course your right but i and many others find it very difficult to imagine how a handful of children conceived of a plan of this nature by themselves the question that must be askedand will be asked frequently in the moonturns to come should you force me to put the matter of young geont before the councilis not only where they came by their peculiar notions and the means to carry them out but who would benefit from a shall we say radical rearrangement of the council lycaelon said lord breulin regarded him warily obviously not liking the note of confidence he heard in lord lycaelons voice may i direct your attention to the names of the conspirators the archmage continued isaspentreslalkmairrolfortogregancevolpiril isas lalkmair rolfort and ogregance we can dismiss at once three of them have no council ties and all the world knows that isas iswasmy supporter he could hardly be expected to see benefit from the overthrow of the council this leaves volpiril and pentres and house pentres is a breulin supporter its fortunes tied to those of your house my lord breulin how odd the world believes volpiril and breulin to be at odds certainly the two of you seemed to be in opposition in councilexcept when you were opposing me how singular to find volpirils heir and breulins dependent so closely linked perhaps you believed you could share the spoils or perhaps you intended a further betrayal of one another lord breulins face had turned a deep shade of maroon making his stiff silver beard stand out even more brightly against his skin you have no proof of that he said through gritted teeth i have lord volpirils resignation from the council lycaelon said simply lord isas has also resigned breulins eyes narrowed resignationfor a man as ambitious as lord volpirilwas as good as a confession of guilt yet how could it be otherwise when volpirils heir was the acknowledged ringleader of the young conspirators lycaelon needed no spell of mindhearing to know lord breulins thoughts they were plain upon the mans face as at last he awoke to his own peril what will be done with the boys breulin asked after a long pause for some banishment lycaelon said as soon as the hunt has space to run free once more and geont breulin said when lycaelon said nothing further in the end his fate is in your hands lord breulin lycaelon answered as is my understanding of the degree of your involvement though the matter was an open secret it was not yet a public scandaland perhaps lord breulins conscience was not quite as clear as he wished it to be certainly if he allowed geont pentress gift to be taken from him lord breulin would make enemies of those who had been his allies and supporters and in the end whether the hearings proved him culpable or innocent he would still be tainted by the shadow of conspiracy so to avoid the shame and publicity of a council inquiryand incidentally to save himself from the humiliation of giving up a kinsman to the excision of his magegiftlord breulin too resigned his position on the council and gave his binding oath before the second bells of day rang out through the city chapter nine the council of fear calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink at first morning bells the high council convened in special session the council chamber was one of the most imposing rooms in all the golden city though few but mages and outlanders ever saw it it had been built by magecraft as had been the whole of the council house and its unadorned walls of white marble gleamed polished to mirrorperfection their flawless curves unrelieved by any ornament save two golden doors opposite sides of the circular chamber each door was wrought with the symbol of the eternal light in gleaming high relief so that the planes and angles of their exquisite surfaces glittered as if they were aflame if the walls were stark and unornamented the floor was their opposite it held a complex pattern of black and white marble though it might seem to be nothing more than an overelaborate decorative pattern it was in fact a series of keys that allowed adepts to keep their proper places during the nighttime workings for the council chamber was also the temple where the great circles were held for the mages nighttime workings at one end of the council chamber stood a curved judicial bench twice the height of a tall man as black as the wall behind it was white it was here that the high council sat to pass judgment upon every aspect of life in armethalieh the room had been designed by the ancient mages who had wrought it to overawe the mind and numb the spirit even the mages who worked here daily were not immune to its effects and that was as it should be let all who entered here know that the individual was as nothing and the city was all the archmages thronelike chair was in the center of the bench with six lesser seats on either side until today every seat had always been filled the remaining magesmeron perizel lorins arance ganaret nagid vilmos dagan and harithentered the chamber where lycaelon was already seated when the nine of them had taken their places they looked with various degrees of consternation at the three empty seats breulin isas and volpiril have resigned from the council for reasons of which i think all of you are aware lycaelon said his voice filled the chamber resonating from the polished marble walls this special session will be devoted to dealing with the matter of the traitors discovering the extent of the corruption and repairing the harm that they have done to the city but first there is the matter of filling the vacancies created there was a stir of anticipation in the room vacancies on the high council were rare for there to be three at once was unprecedented and every man in the room had his own candidates to fill the vacant chairs but lycaelon was not finished speaking i propose to you my own candidate chired anigrel who is to become my son and the heir of my house this lights day many of you will know him as my private secretary but in these past moonturns he has done far more for the good of the city than scribing mere paperwork it was through undermage anigrels tireless work that the traitors were uncovered and the conspiracy disarmed before the threat could grow he has demonstrated an uncommon devotion and loyalty to the city as well as a mastery of the art that much exceeds his rank i open the matter now for discussion before i call the vote discussion but archmage surely you do not expect us to vote upon the matter today lord dagan asked almost timidly my lords lycaelon said ponderously i wish from the bottom of my heart that we had the leisure to consider the matter in our usual deliberate fashion but the empty seats among us are proof enough that this cannot be for the other vacancies yes of course we shall take as much time as you like but in light of the service he has already rendered to the city i do not wish to deprive us of anigrels sapient counsel for another moment providing always that we are all in agreement my lord lycaelon may i be the first to offer you congratulations upon your heir may the light defend him in all his works it is heartening to hear good news when the shadows seem to gather on every side lord harith said i shall convey your congratulations to my son lycaelon said bowing his head we are both gratified he smiled inwardly harith had obviously decided which way the hare would jump and was anxious to assure lycaelon that he would continue to support him perizel leaned forward signaling his intention to speak next the man was a consummate political animal and cloaked his ambition in a punctilious insistence on the observance of proper form if lord perizel disliked an idea he could delay it for sennights by debating every detail of the form of its presentation my lord archmage without in any way speaking to undermage anigrels character or other qualifications to join our council i must raise a point of order regarding his possible appointment as you yourself have remarked his rank is but that of undermage yet one must be of the rank of high mage to serve upon the council is that not so there was a murmur of agreementnot unmixed with relief in a few casesas the remaining members of the council conferred among themselves whispering and nodding their heads lycaelon allowed it to continue for a few moments before speaking again my lords i believe you will find there is precedent for a mage of lesser rank serving upon the high council should his other qualifications be exceptional i direct your attention to the case of undermage camorin in the th year of the cityand your ancestor lord arance who served with distinction upon the council beginning in year though he had not yet attained the distinction of high mage and should lord anigrel be permitted to test for advancement upon an accelerated schedule then this consideration would certainly be set at rest lord perizel regarded the archmage for a moment then smiled faintly and nodded settling back in his chair you are correct lord archmage there is precedent i withdraw my objection lycaelon glanced around at the other mages their faces were studiously blank but there was no way they could argue with facts both mage camorin and arances ancestor had been of lesser rank when they served upon the councilnot only had anigrel found the citations for him to strengthen his argument but every man here should recall the cases from history of the city under mage hendassar though the mages continued to debatewith lycaelon and with each otherlycaelon could tell that their words were merely a cloak for the furious debate each mage was having with himself what was lycaelons real motive in proposing anigrel for the council was there more to be gained by supporting anigrels nomination or by blocking it every mage here knew about the arrests and the resignations that had followed them of course all of them were shockedas lycaelon had beenthat such a thing could happen and fearful of how far the treasonous taint might have spread if mageborn could conspire against mageborn then no one was safe further each one of themnone better in all the cityhad seen what disaster their illconsidered support of lord volpirils plans had led them into now it seemed that lycaelonand anigrelwere poised to lead them out of it to undo as much of the damage as could be repaired and take steps to ensure that the rest was handled suitably how did lord anigrel discover the traitors lord ganaret asked after a full bell of debate lycaelon smiled sadly and spread his hands wide my lord it is with regret that i cannot disclose lord anigrels methods as yet you see i am not entirely certain that the entire cabal has been uprooted that got their attention nine pairs of eyes focused on lycaelons face and the council chamber was suddenly silent but they were arrested lord ganaret gasped boys making umbrastone lycaelon said scoffing terrible in itselfbut my lords who told them to make it who put that idea into their unformed minds who nurtured them in rebellion and then covered his tracks so flawlessly could mere boys have come up with such notions on their own could they have known where to find the proscribed instructions so easily had they not had experienced help i have prayedi have hopedthere was another answer but i can find none because there is none ancient lord vilmos spoke his quavering voice cracking with certainty lord lycaelon you are right this conspiracy touches us all we must have lord anigrel on the council yesappoint anigrel to the council and make the city safe again harith said discover the traitors and banish them lycaelon allowed himself a small nod of approval clever of harith not to be the first to suggest anigrels appointment that would look too pointed my lords do you wish time for further discussion lycaelon asked or will you vote now one by one the assembled high mages placed both hands palm down upon the table before them each signifying his readiness to vote then i call the vote lycaelon said admission of undermage anigrel to the high council he raised his hand palm out assent one by one the nine remaining high mages copied his gesture the vote was unanimous anigrel was to be admitted to the high council in the antechamber anigrel waited it took all of his skill at concealing his true nature to disguise his nervousness now lycaelon was a master of manipulation and after the events of the night before the council was a pack of nervous frightened old men begging for decisive leadership whether they knew it or not but it was still far from certain which way the vote would go either way would serve hisand his dark ladysultimate goal of course if the council accepted him he would have a direct voice in the ruling of armethalieh he would be able to put forward his ideas himself and not have to manipulate lycaelon into coming up with them if the council rejected him it would enrage lycaelon and make the archmage that much easier for anigrel to manipulate but the son of torbet anigrel himself the son of a tradesmantorbet anigrel who had died in obscurity spurned with contempt by the highborn pureblooded magebornwould burn with hatred and humiliation at the rejection not even his adoption into house tavadon would salve that wound and either way he must go before the council and hear their verdict to his face at lastit seemed as if eons had passed though noon bells had not yet runga journeyman came to conduct him to the chamber anigrel passed through the golden door and crossed the vast expanse of black and white floor he reached the white marble square that marked the center of the chamber turned to face the judicial bench and bowed the ten men looking down upon him might have been carved of the same material as the walls and floor and for a moment anigrels heart beat faster had it gone as badly as that then lycaelon smiled welcome welcome lord anigrel to the high council of armethalieh may you serve the city long and well anigrel bowedmore deeply this time and for once he did not have to disguise his expression as he rose an expression of joy was not at all amiss on such an occasion what mage worth his robes would not be overjoyed to hear such a pronouncement and if his voice trembled with emotion well that was not amiss either my lord archmagemy lord mages i vow to you that i shall render to armethalieh such service as she has never seen in all her long and glorious history this i do swear from the bottom of my heart then come join us there is much to do lycaelon said anigrel came forward and mounted the three steps he had ascended so often in the past on some errand for the archmage but this time he was not an errandboy he was a member of the high council he glanced around quickly found volpirils chair and seated himself our first order of business the boundaries of the city lands lycaelon said i think we can safely agree that we must take the home farms back at least lord meron said smoothly certainly we must do more than that anigrel said promptly but lord meron is quite right to remind us that we have a number of calls upon our resources at the moment we must begin with the delfier valley of course so that the banishings on our calendar proceed as scheduled no difficulty in outrunning a hunt if the bounds extend no further than the city walls eh meron lord nagid pointed out and there was general if slightly nervous laughter from the assembled mages and meanwhile in the light of the current emergencythough i understand this is only a formalityi propose that we immediately sever all ties both explicit and implicit with all lesser races anigrel added in my work for the archmage i noted that there were still active trade agreements in our records with the elves which is an intolerable threat to our security need i remind any of you that the elvenborn have long maintained cordial relations with the wildmages i do not say that they are the source of the umbrastone that lately plagued us but now more than ever we must be strong in our loyalties to our blood and our race he knew from his contacts with the dark lady that the elves might attempt to warn the city that the endarkened were active once again though there was little chance that the mages would pay any attention to the words of one of the lesser racesor even allow them within the city wallswhy take the chance these matters must be voted upon as separate items lord perizel pointed out irritably first we must vote upon remaking the boundaries then we must vote to sever all agreements with the lesser races and what of the mountain traders they trade with the elves as well you are an example to us all lord perizel lycaelon said gravely very well let us first settle the matter of the boundaries the debateand the voteis upon the matter of extending them once more over the central valley discussion but no man there wished to be seen as supporting lord volpirils policies there was no discussion and the vote was unanimous in favor of extending the boundaries back over the entire valley once more so voted lycaelon said his voice rich with satisfaction tonight we will work to extend the borders once more and at tomorrow dusk we will begin to cleanse armethalieh of her traitors we will resume at first afternoon bell to debate the second matter upon our agenda when the council resumed after luncheon at first it seemed that the matter that anigrel had raised would occupy the mages for the rest of the day no one was in favor of trading with the elves of course but the question of precisely what to do about it seemedwith lord perizels helpto become more tangled the longer it was debated were elvenmade goods also to be excluded what of those humans known to deal with elves such as the mountain traders even though they no longer traded directly with the city and should the ban be extended to those such as the selken traders who might be trading without any regard to proscriptionswho in fact might well be trading with anyone and anything that approached them lycaelon might have been forced to table the debatein the name of getting other necessary work doneif auronwy hadnt chosen that opportune moment to enter with a message your pardon archmage the young journeyman said leaning over to place a single sheet of velum in front of lycaelon but there is a person outside the gates requesting an audience with the high council lycaelon glanced up at the odd note in the council pages voice the boy looked positively terrified what sort of person auronwy he said gently a an archmage it is an elf auronwy whispered heithe asked for an audience with the high council lycaelon glanced down at the paper in front of him it was the standard report from the guard tower on any who approached the delfier gate unexpectedly listing the numbers of the party and the general description the creature had come alone very good auronwy now go rest we will deal with this he waited until the journeyman had left the chamber my lords he said raising his voice to cut across the discussion we no longer have the leisure for debate at this very moment one of the proud and haughty elvenborn stands outside the delfier gate demanding admission to this very chamber by our ancient laws and treaties we must admit him but what purpose can he have here is it not suspicious that he chooses this moment to arrive yes lord vilmos shouted it is the elvesthe elves are behind it all they must be send the creature away send it away at once lord vilmos lycaelon thought would definitely be the next to go he had obviously reached that time of life at which the stress of council business was proving far too much for him but for now the mans willingness to jump at shadows was proving useful his hysteria stampeded the council as nothing else could perizel suggested that they call the vote at once but confine it entirely to the matter of the elves and the lesser races lycaelon graciously acceded it was unanimous ties with the lesser races would be severed immediately lycaelon summoned another page he scribbled a few lines on the gatecaptains report and sealed it with his council ring take this to the head of the city guard tell him that the creature waiting outside the delfier gate is to be turned away tell him he is authorized to use supreme force if necessary cilarnen had no idea how long he spent in the gloomy cell when he awoke lord anigrel was gone and his head ached terribly he felt dull and ill this must be the way the ungifted felt all the time he knew he had been stripped of his magegift the thing that made him a member of the ruling classes of armethalieh city of mages eventually hunger and thirst drove him to investigate the basket the stone golems had left it proved to contain several loaves of penancebread a large jug of water a small tin cup and a larger tin utensil whose purpose was not hard to guess though the water was flat and warm thirst made it bearable but he hadnt the stomach to try the bread just yet he still felt too sick drinking cleared his headenough to worry about his friends and his family what would happen to his mother and his sisters now that lord volpiril was dead would his mothers family take her back with such an awful disgrace hovering over her he vaguely recalled that his elder sister dialee had been betrothed but could not remember to whomwould her suitor call off the match undoubtedly and poor eshavi would certainly never find a husband now at all unless some commonborn fellow deigned to take either of them he groaned at the thought but such matters could not occupy him for long when he had his friends to worry about were they all to be banished as well or was there some more terrible fate in store for them he shuddered what could be more terrible than being stripped of ones gift and being turned out of the golden city to face an unknown future orwere the rest of them to be spared and only he to be banished he would never know unless somehow by the mercy of the lightand cilarnen wasnt entirely sure it would be a mercyhe managed to evade the outlaw hunt and they did too and he met them upon the road cilarnens conception of the world outside the city walls was hazy at best and his mind rebelled from contemplating it now he would know soon enough whether he wanted to or not eventually hunger drove him to try the penancebread it was like no food he had ever encountered in his life the bread was coarse and unpalatable very strongtasting and required a great deal of chewing before he could choke it down he supposed dourly that he should be grateful that an outlawtobe was given any bread at all considering the state of food supplies in the city he ate it all but no one came to bring him any more in fact no one came back at all for a very long time the water in the jugby now sour and brackishwas nearly gone when cilarnen heard footsteps in the hall again not stone golems this time the softer footsteps of leather boots on stone when the cell door opened he could almost have cried with reliefhe had nearly convinced himself that undermage anigrel had lied that he was not to be banished at all but left in this tiny cell to starve and die of thirst but he caught his breath in dismay at the sight of two city constables in the deep scarlet uniform of the city watch they were fully armed with truncheon and halberd and regarded cilarnen with expressions of disgust and contempt time to leave outlaw one of them said he tossed a bundle to the floor it skidded across the stone and stopped at cilarnens feet he reached down and picked it up some kind of a pack and a felons cloak he had seen felons paraded in the city square of course social unfortunates condemned to wear the lurid yellow cloak with its black felons mark for a sennight or a moonturn for some infraction of the citys laws but never neverhad he thought that the day would come when he a volpiril would be forced to handle such an object though the cloak was thick and warmmade of heavy feltthe fabric was harsh to the touch and stank of cheap dye he wondered who had worn it last put it on outlaw and give me your talisman you dont belong to the city any longer the constable said cilarnen touched the talisman he wore around his neck though they might wear it on a leather cord or a cotton string or a silver chain or one of gold and jewels every citizen of armethalieh wore the same gold rectangle marking them as a citizen of armethalieh now it was to be stripped from him with shaking fingersfeeling more lightheaded than either hunger or panic could account forcilarnen unlaced his tunic and drew out his talisman on its jeweled golden chain the sapphires were colorless in the dimness it took him a long time to undo the catch to work the talisman to the end of the chain and slip it off and when he got to his feet and walked over to the constable golden rectangle in hand the man wouldnt take it cilarnen stood there for a long moment before realizing that the man would not touch him then bent and set the talisman carefully on the floor hed thought nothing could make him feel worse than waking up and knowing hed been stripped of his gift but losing his talismanhis last tie to the citywas somehow worse he clasped the chain again carefully and tucked it back into his tunic now put on the cloak pick up your pack and lets go the constable said drumming his halberdbutt on the floor of the cell to emphasize his point quickly cilarnen picked up the cloak as he did the constable picked up his discarded talisman and put it into the pouch on his belt put it on outlaw the man barked apparently having used up what little patience he possessed thoroughly cowed cilarnen quickly put on the cloak and pulled the hood up over his face it tied at the throat with a drawstring but his hands were shaking too hard for him to manage that and he settled for wrapping it around himself he picked up the leather pack and held it in his arms uncertain of what to do with it one of the constables stepped outside the door the otherthe one who had done all the speakinggestured with his halberd for cilarnen to follow cilarnen staggered after him wincing at the brightness of the corridor after so long in the dimness of his cell he wanted to cry to scream to run but there was nowhere to run to he followed the constable up a flight of stairs wishing now only that the nightmare would end as swiftly as possible as he neared the top of the stairs he heard the first notes of evensong begin and discovered with sick surprise that he was in the western courtyard ahead lay the delfier gate with the lesser gates within the great gate standing open waiting for him it was sunsetof what day a foolish part of his mind wonderedand the day had been bright and clear he hesitated shivering as he breathed in the cold winter air and was rewarded with a sharp poke in the back from the constables halberd it registered only dimly through the thick fabric of the cloak but that the man had dared to do it was shock enough keep moving outlaw the golden bell of the council house joined the evensong its booming ring so close that cilarnen winced as he staggered forward constant proddings in the back urged him to quicken his pace and soon he was almost running toward the open gate he stopped in shock the moment his feet touched dirt he was outside the walls behind him the lesser gates boomed shut cilarnen stood there in numb shock as evensong slowly faded into silence he clutched the cloak around himself shivering with coldback in the cell he would never have thought hed be happy to have it and it was not nearly as warm as any of his own warm winter cloaks but it was far better than nothing at all he took the time now to tie the drawstrings at the throat closed but the cold made him clumsy and he dropped the bag hed been holding it hit the ground at his feet as he picked it up he remembered undermage anigrels words the bag contained bread and water food he tore open the sack revealing another penanceloaf and a full waterskin he tossed the sack away and drained half the waterskin in a few gulps then tore into the loaf wolfing it down hungrily it did much to still the growling in his belly but when it was gone he was still outside the gates of the city it was darktwilightand growing darker quickly he was colder than hed ever been in his lifeas much because he knew there was no welcoming hearth and hot cider at the end of his journey as because of the temperature he ought to just sit down right here and wait for dawn but some strange impulse of restlessness made him head down the rutted cart track that led away from the city once he might have summoned magelight to light his way cilarnen thought bitterly as he stumbled along in the dark or at the very least he might have called fire to warm him now all he could do was grope his way from tree to tree unable to understand why he didnt simply lie down in the middle of the road and wait for it all to be over but something deep inside wouldnt let him he startled at every unfamiliar soundand there were many the very bushes seemed to be alive with unnameable creatures and moonturns of neglect had left the road crusted with ice and hardpacked snow cilarnen fell several times before he learned to walk upon the treacherous surface at leastonce the moon rosethe whiteness of the snow made it a little easier to see where he was going how far was it to nerendale that was the nearest village to armethalieh he knew that much of the world beyond the city walls he would reach it somehowbefore dawnforce them to give him food shelter no he would take a horse they must have horses with a horse he could outpace the outlaw hunt and be beyond the bounds of the city lands before it reached him he could not quite remember when it had become so important to outrun the hunt it hadnt been anything like a conscious decision if hed had anything approaching a plan for his future it had been to face the hunt surely there would be a mage with it to control it perhaps he could ask for more time to make his way out of city lands or perhaps the hunt would escort him the rest of the way that must be it all that talk of undermage anigrels about the hunt tearing him to bits had only been to frighten him it must have been how was he supposed to know where the boundaries of city lands lay it wasnt a subject studied at the mage college after all the night spent outside the walls must only be a punishment and the hunt sent to escort the outlaw to the boundaries of the city lands in the morning the more he thought about it the more sense it made but now hed abandoned all notion of awaiting the hunt the only thing that mattered was getting as far away as he could as fast as possible then he saw the light here in the darkness among the winterbare trees it was easy to see a bright spark burning steadily for a moment cilarnen wondered if his eyes deceived him he blinked hard but it was still there somewhere tauntingly ahead with renewed purpose he moved toward it i see you human child the cool voice came out of the darkness when cilarnen was still too distant from the light to make out anything but that it burned he stifled a yelp and froze where he stood though he strained his eyes against the darkness he could not see the speaker though from the voice whoever had spoken must be very near you have seen my lantern this time the voice came from nearer yet though hed seen no sign of movement cilarnen ground his teeth shut on a moan of terror i see by your raiment that you have been cast out by the golden city this time the disembodied voice actually seemed to expect some reply cilarnen took a deep breath mustered all his courage and answered iyes i was cast out banished his voice was hoarse but steady speaking reminded him of how thirsty he was and he wished he hadnt thrown away his waterskin when it was empty but what good had it been to him then come warm yourself at my fire the night is cold cilarnen took a shaky step forward and immediately tripped over a stone an iron grip just under his left elbow steadied him he yelped aloud at the contact forgive me i had forgotten what poor vision you humans have i will conduct you if you will permit cilarnen nodded not trusting himself to speak even this close his rescuer was still no more than a shadowy cloaked and hooded figure to him although he was standing right next to him and could apparently see quite well for at cilarnens nod he began to move forward leading the young outlaw through the darkness toward the unwavering light as they approached cilarnen could see that it was a small lantern by the light it gave he could make out a tidy campsite there was a brazier such as the mages used in making magick and beside it a bedroll spread out upon the ground with a pack set at its head some sort of traveling merchant then a horse and a packmule were tethered nearby and regarded him incuriously even in cilarnens distracted state he could see that they were animals of great quality the brazier radiated a surprising amount of heat cilarnen moved toward it gratefully holding out his icy hands toward its warmth only then did he turn and look back toward his companion the man was wearing a dark grey cloak with a deep hood lined in silver fur as cilarnen watched he raised gloved hands and pushed the hood back affording cilarnen his most profound shock of the last several days it was not a man at all but awell it wasnt a human creature skin nearly as pale as snow dark slanted eyes long pointed ears that rose up through the sleek black hair elaborately coiled at the base of the neck with a jarring sense of unreality cilarnen realized he was gazing upon a member of one of the lesser races an elf an elf within city lands for a moment he felt a spasm of indignation and righteous wrath before he realized it simply didnt matter to him anymore hed been banished his momentary fury vanished to be replaced by numb weariness he simply stared at the elf unable to think of anything else to do so you have been banished and ihave been barred from your gates it seems we have something in common then and i suspect that it would be best if we took ourselves elsewhere we will drink tea and then we will prepare for the journey i think it would be well if we were both out of the lands claimed by the golden city before dawn the elf said regarding cilarnen calmly the elf was going to take him outside the city lands ahead of the hunt at the moment that was all cilarnen cared about with a sigh of exhaustion he sat down next to the brazier anigrels formal investiture as a member of the high council took place at the chapel of the light at the mage college that lights day it directly followed his formal adoption into house tavadon and it was hard to say which ceremony was the more significant of the two though one had been overseen by as many people as could cram themselves into the great temple in armethaliehs central square and the other was attended by only a select group of the highestranked mages of the city in the first ceremony anigrel now and forever anigrel tavadon having chosen that as his new name knelt before lycaelon and the archpriest of the light as he swore his oath of adoption he rose was divested of his plain grey tabard and given a new one embroidered in the tavadon colorsblack and whitemaking his new status plain for all to read he then gave his new father a formal sons kiss then the city rolls were brought outthe great record in which every citizens birth and occupation marriage and death were recorded and with the whole city to witness the archpriest altered them adding anigrels name beneath lycaelons own and so it was done the chapel of the light was smaller and the oath he swore there was more complicated than the one he had sworn in the great temple but anigrel meant it as littleand as muchas he had the other it was that which kept the mages who administered it from detecting any deception on his part he suspected anigrel sincerely intended to serve the city and bringing it under the rule of the endarkened would surely be best for all in the end there he exchanged his new tabard for yet anotherthis one with additional embroideries marking him as a member of the high council this time in his own newlychosen colors red and gold he received his staff and his ring of office and the second ceremony was complete normally the day would end with festivities at lycaelons house a party such as had marked his first sons naming or lycaelons own ascension to the dignity of archmage but these were troubled times and there was much work to be done instead after a brief flurry of congratulations to the newest member of the high council the mages returned to the council houseeven though it was lights dayto debate anigrels latest proposal as this was a more complicated matter than either of the others anigrel had gone to the trouble of drafting a formal written proposal which had been circulated to the council earlier in the day he was fairly confident it would be accepted at least eventually after all there was still the matter of the other conspirators to run to earthand with jorade isass margon ogregances kermis lalkmairs and geont pentress memories thoroughly edited and tiedor rolfort and cilarnen volpiril banishedand rolfort certainly deadthe council had destroyed any possibility of tracing the true genesis and scope of the problem he wondered if any of them realized that hed had to move fast to get his hands on kermis lalkmair before the boy was returned to his fathernot wanting to risk the possibility that lord lalkmair might choose to be merciful anigrel had wished to remove all memory of master raellan from the boys mindbut the man had reacted entirely as expected young kermis was now living upon the charity of distant relatives while he recovered from the excision of his magegift and the destruction of all memories related to his magetraining and to the conspiracy frankly anigrel did not expect the boy to live very long but though the actual conspiracy was quite dead anigrel had no intention of allowing it to seem so its success had not been his purpose for starting it in the first place even his seat on the council had only been a welcome dividend no his intention had been to create a climate of fear among the mageborn fearful men were easy to manipulate in the council chamber lord lycaelon called the council to order we are gathered in this special session of the high council of armethalieh to consider lord anigrels proposal for the good of the city you have all had an opportunity to review a copy of his proposal as is our custom now lord anigrel will make his formal presentation anigrel allowed the silence to gather for a moment before speaking he knew that the members of the council would already have discussed the matter among themselves but this was his chance to sway them further harith would back him of course once he saw that the archmage approved vilmos was ready to start at shadows and would vote in favor of anything that held out the faintest hope of security four sure votes out of elevenonly two more would give him a sufficient majority to pass his measure fear that was his best ally now fear killed thought and the more fearful men were the more they were ready to give up in exchange for the promise that the source of their fears would be dealt with lord archmagemy fellow councilorsin this past sennight we have been led to the shocking and unwelcome revelation that our fellow mageborn whom we thought above corruption above reproachcan be led to conspire against their fellow mages and against the city let me assure you all that i will not rest until i have rooted out every last tendril of corruption and exposed it to the healing fire of the light there was a murmur of reluctant approval from the men seated around him butas we are all unfortunately awarethat is not enough we face a time of great trial where there was one assault upon our security and the safety of our city there may be more and as you my august brethren have pointed out so many times our enemies are many and so i propose to you that we be vigilant inwardly as well as out i propose a council of magewardens its members to be drawn from the ranks of both journeymen and high mages who can move freely among the mageborn seeking out trouble before it starts no longer will we be forced to bear the burden of such tragedies as have so recently befallen us we can be warned against them before they have a chance to happenand more we will know the names and the faces of our enemies whether within or without before they have the opportunity to steal the hearts and minds of our innocent children as they slumber peacefully in their beds so far there was no sign that any of the council members found this to be an outrageous notion that was good he pitched his voice to sound reasonable reasoning and calm such a vast undertaking is not without its mundane costs and i know as well as you all what a heavy burden our precious city labors under at this momenta burden that it will be the work not of moonturns but perhaps of years to redress and so i propose two further measuresnot only that there be an organization similar in nature to the magewardens to move among the common people of the city actively seeking out those who might wish to change things for the worse but also i propose a tax upon magick to fund both wardencies some puzzled looks perhaps but no outright objection the second wardency upon the commons i can understand said harith sounding as puzzled as he looked and it is more than reasonablethe commons are so easily led and manipulated after all that i am surprised we had not instituted such a thing before but why a tax upon magick anigrel gave him a look of empathy as if to say that there was every reason to be puzzled my lords magick is a great gift we mages tirelessly labor for the good of the city expending our lives and our art like water poured out upon the sandand our work is as little regarded by the average armethaliehan i assure you they take the privileges we exhaust ourselves to provide as no more than their rightful due this must change if the common people wish to profit from the wisdom we have spent so many painful years laboring to acquire they should pay a price for the benefits we bestow and if they doubt those benefits well it would be no bad thing to permit the farmers from the delfier valley to be allowed some free gossip so that our own citizens understand the calamities that can befall when those benefits are withdrawn he sat back indicating he had finished this is as you well know lord anigrel three separate matters perizel said sounding bored let us settle the matter of howand ifyou are to fund your grand plan before deciding whether it is to go forward shall we very well lord lycaelon said with a faint sigh we will consider the matter of the tax firstand separately continue but the commons already pay for our services lord lorins pointed out after a moment they pay for the spell yes anigrel said but do they pay for the privilege of being allowed to have the spell at all and so many spells are not actually paid forthose that control the weather for instance or those that keep buildings in repair i am suggesting a tax not an increase in fees theyll never accept it lord arance said dryly then let them do without lycaelon suggested naturally this would not apply to matters affecting the city as a wholeat least not at first simply to private individual mattersthe ones we all find so tiresome or simple things that do not truly affect much except minor comfort weather spells for instance those that prevent snow from falling within the walls those that keep rain from falling except at night a few days of slogging through wet streets might change some minds but a new tax lord lorins asked hesitantly to anigrels surprise and delight here he had an ally and an entirely unexpected one actually lord perizel drawled it is a very old tax it merely has not been assessed in the last few hundred years but you will find it still on the tax rolls lorins if you take the trouble to look i see no reason we should not reinstate it we can always use the money for something and light knows we have spent enough golden suns on the selkens this past quarter to leave the treasury in need of replenishment anigrel should have known that perizel that peruser of ancient records would know there had once been such a tax that made things much simpler something newwell that would be resisted but something oldoh that was to be embraced after a bit more discussion the measure to instituteor reinstitutethe tax on the privilege of calling upon the mages for magick was passed the discussion over the formation of the magewardens and the commons wardens took far longer everyone was in favor of keeping a closer eye on the commons of course but no one was completely comfortable with the idea of spyingfor that was what it amounted toupon their own kind only when anigrel promised that he would head the magewardens council himself and make full and detailed reports of everything it discovered was lycaelon able to at last call the vote the measure passed nine to two perizel and arance abstained you take too much work upon yourself anigrel lycaelon said afterward as the two of them walked toward tavadon house through the winter evening you will burn yourself out and end up a doddering friendless old manlike me spirits of darkness the archmage was making a joke anigrel smiled dear archmage that will never happennot while i am alive but you must see it was the only way to gain a majority in council i confess i was surprised at how the vote went at the end who would have thought that so many of the witless sheep could be stampeded so easily hed have to keep an eye on perizel and arance though as am for a moment the archmages expression went hard and distant then it softened again but we shall soon bring those doubters to heel and now we shall go home my son lycaelons voice was fond was it at all possible that the archmage was growing senile it was too much to hope forthough anigrel knew spells that could help the process alongand certainly the man had received enough shocks recently to drive a lesser man to a state of catatonia home it has a good sound lord archmage but i thinkif you will permitthat i will keep my rooms at the college as well he smiled there are those whom in my capacity as chief magewarden i should not like to bring into our house besides which those heavilywarded rooms were where he made his communion with his dark lady something anigrel did not think he could manage unnoticed within the walls of tavadon house of course my son you must do just as you think is best and anigrel you must call me father yes father he would serve the city with as much devotion as lycaelon could wish and if he served it to a different purpose and a different end it was entirely possible that lycaelon tavadon would die without ever knowing idalia did not know how long she lay unconscious before the pain roused her she was disoriented and terribly thirsty and lay in darkness so absolute that for a moment she thought she must be blind her head spinning her mind blank at first she wasnt quite sure what was going on where was she where were the children then unwarily she tried to move and savage pain shocked her hammering her senses with nausea and vertigo and the agony brought her fully to consciousness she relaxed as far as she could waiting for the pain to subside she was deep within the caves and safe well safer than she would be if she were in the hands of the shadowed elves anyway the children and lairamo gods grantwere also safe and far away from here with the rescue party she knew she could count on that much kellen was in charge and he would make sure that the children were safe away she wondered how far shed fallen knowing even as she wondered that her mind was wanderinga symptom of concussion how peculiar that she was alive to be wondering that at all her life had been forfeit to the gods from the moment she had done the weatherworking that saved the elven lands from flood her life had been the cost of that spell and idalia had paid it if not gladly then willingly and freely but though the gods of the wild magic might ask for her life suicide was no part of her mageprice she had the right and duty to preserve her life for as long as possible even now escape on her ownwell that was impossible for certain no walking out with two broken legs a shattered collarbone and worse she could not heal herselfthe pain and her injuries made her magic too hard to control but she could call for help she had control enough for that she thought call for help call for help oh fool you should have agreed to marry jermayan when he askedhed know right where you were now yes and come charging right into a trap against any odds to save you and then you could be dead together your lives just the same length just as you came to realize in the end she came to with a start and realized shed been drifting only halfaware she must do what she could now before her strength ebbed any further she shifted position slightlykindling a new bright flare of pain that brought tears of furious pain to her eyesand closed her eyes tightly though closed or open made no difference here in the stygian darkness of the cave with all her remaining strength idalia focused her will on calling a friendan allysomeone to carry my message to anyone who can hear and will help so long a time passed that idalia began to wonder if there was anything at all within range of her call or if perhaps the power of the wild magic had deserted her utterly but at last she felt a faint disturbance in the air and a substantial weight landed on her chest making her gasp and cough with her uninjured hand she reached out toward it she could feel the heat of its body and her fingertips brushed leathery wings as it moved suspiciously away from her touch a snowbat whitefurred nocturnal the size of chickens they fed on mice small birds even fish and were dormant through deepest winter there was a certain justice in her aid coming from the distantvery distantcousin of the creatures that had carried off the elves in the first place she extended her magical senses and felt the spark of the bats life a small consciousness occupied mostly with thoughts of food and flight but there was room there to imprint the snowbats mind with her cry for help and with the last of her strength idalia added her call giving the little creature a new desire stronger than any natural desire it possessed find an ally deliver the message she felt the wild magic well up in her and flow through her and into the snowbat and when the power had crested and ebbed away idalias consciousness ebbed with it the pulse of magic washed over the bat like a pulse of the strongest moonlight it had ever imagined sending it hopping awkwardly away from the strangewarmthing scurrying and flapping across the floor of the canyon until it could manage to take flight its new need was strong sending it soaring through familiar territory toward the opening that led to its hunting fields its keen predators senses told it that the weather outside was still and clear perfect for hunting but as it neared the outer tunnels the light drove it back too bright too bright now is a time for sleep not flight it veered back into the welcoming darkness and would have resumed its interrupted slumbers if it could have but the need planted in it by strangewarmthing drove it onward it would have approached the cavemothers if it couldeven though they often hunted its kind for foodbut the need told it that they were not the allies it sought and so it flew onward deeper into the darkness singing the highpitched song that created the world around it in pulses of form deeper it flew far from the sleeping places of its sept into territory unknown its wings grew tired and many times it stopped to rest but each time the need drove it on again at lastthere belowthe need touched a suitable mind ancaladar dozed dreaming of centuries past they werent terribly pleasant dreams but they were his they were all he had left something landed on his nose with a thud ancaladar went from halfsleep to wakefulness in an eyeblink he reared back dislodging the small weight which flittered around his head crying out in a high irritating voice a snowbat ancaladar relaxed for a moment hed thought but for some reason the bat wouldnt go away it circled his head like a maddened wasp landing on his head again and this time ancaladar caught the scent of magic his nostrils flared nearly sucking the bat inside magicwild magic it was a scent ancaladar had fled from all his life for it posed a unique danger to his kind but the bat was a messenger someonesome wildmageneeded something very badly if the sense of urgency ancaladar could read coming off the little creature was any guide he sniffedmore gently this timebut could detect no more to the message apparently the bat had been sent to guide whoever found it back to the wildmage ancaladar sat back with a sigh if he had any sense hed stay right here he could ignore the bat or eat it he was safe where he was but a wildmage here it was an odd place for a wildmage these caverns were overrun with stinking tainted mockelves theyd come burrowing in to ancaladars nice safe retreatoh he couldnt really remember how long ago sometime after the great war anyway theyd started overrunning the caverns scaring off the local game and generally making a mess of things maybe the wildmage had come to fix things and ancaladar didnt have to get involved not really he could go give the wildmage whatever hesheit wanted and then go back to sleep so long as what it wanted was something small and insignificant hed be careful with a grunt he levered himself to his feet careful not to dislodge his furry guest show me he rumbled softly the pain pulled her toward consciousness and pushed her away from it at the same time until idalia floated in a dazed state only halfaware of her surroundings knowing that death was only daysperhaps hoursaway her painfevered body was wracked by shiversit was cold here in the caveand the cold and shivering stole what little strength she had left sometimes she forgot entirely where she was sometimes she thought she was back in ondoladeshiron where she had first met jermayan walking with him beneath cloudless skies sometimes she was still a silver eagle soaring through those same skies sometimesthose fantasies were the worstshe was a girl in armethalieh again living in her fathers house her horizons no wider than the walls of tavadon house and the short walk to the ladies academy where the daughters of the mageborn received their lessons in dancing and painting and other ornamental arts suitable to ornamental females prison and torment all in one knowing she was scorned and shunned by the other girls as a halfbreed knowing there was so much more in the world than she a mere girl was allowed to see and be and knowing that nothing bar a miracle was going to give her access to that wider world suddenly she was conscious the nightmare vision of the ladies academy dissolved and the tinkling laughter of the other girlshow shed always hated itbecame a scraping sound as of somethingsomething heavybeing dragged over the rock her heart beat wildly and she strained her eyes in the darkness turning her head cautiously as she tried to locate the source of the sound two glowing lights hung somewhere in the darkness their size and distance impossible to judge eyes lanterns idalia didnt know she only knew that the sudden strength she felt came from the presence of anothers magic not her own strength it was a brief gift she could tell that much and she dared not waste it wildmage you called for me a deep soft voice said help me idalia whispered the endarkened rise against the elves to speak aloud had taken all the strength the strangers magic had lent her and idalia fell into a deep and final unconsciousness ancaladar regarded the wildmage he wondered what her name was not that it mattered to him the endarkened now that was another matter hed known they were active againtheyd been hunting dragons lately which was one of the reasons hed taken such pains to hide himself so carefully but if they were going to war against the elves then the wildmages would want the dragons to fight for them again he reached out one taloned claw toward the woman and drew back he could not help her himself he was a creature of magic but he could not use his magic himselfonly his bondmate could and ancaladar had no bondmate oh yes hed been so clever ancaladar thought in disgust hed watched his brothers and friends die in the great warnot only in battle but from linking their immortal span of years to the brief mortal span of their bondmates lives for a bonded dragon died when his bondmate did he hadnt been able to bear the thought of that and so hed hidden making himself safe from meeting the one magewhoever he or she might bewho could be his bondmate what could one dragon do to tip the balance anyway but there were worse horrors he discovered than dying in service to the light dragons had fallen to the dark when their bondmates had been corrupted by the endarkened with the promise of immortality now he was safe one of the last of the dragons he ought to congratulate himself on his prudence at surviving this long but more and more these days it felt as if hed cheated or been cheated or both at the same time it certainly felt as if he hadnt been clever at all that hed shirked his duty he was a creature of the light wasnt he he was bound to help the cause of the light except that he hadnt hed been a coward done as little as he could and run away as soon as possible maybe what he felt like was a failure maybe this was a chance to make things right he regarded the wildmage with faint suspicion at least he felt no hint of a possible bond with her ancaladar made up his mind hed help the wildmage and perhaps the elves would be willing to provide him with something in the way of steady meals in return in the old days his kind had been able to bargain for nice tasty domestic cattle or sheep and having to hunt for himselfand hide while he did itjust was getting to be too hard was this what getting old felt like or was it only that he was becoming less he raised his head and looked around extending his senses as far as they would go he didnt sense any of the mockelves anywhere around it was daytime anywayeven far underground ancaladar could sense the position of the suntheyd all be securely asleep for some time yet shed be safe enough while he went to look for her friends he didnt really want to expose himself in daylight but if he actually intended to help he had no choice humans were fragile things and this one looked badly broken if she was going to be fixed it would have to be soon chapter ten the return of the dragons calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink kellen had managed to convince jermayan not to go charging in after idalia during the nightthough it took every bit of diplomacy that he hadbut when dawn came and idalia still hadnt come backhe was starting to run out of ideas he knew she wasnt dead but what if she was a prisoner or trapped somewhere or hurt or just lost somewhere down in the cave system jermayan had suggested all those possibilities and more in the past hours any of those things might be true the one thing kellen knew for sure was that there was only one tarnkappa and that if anybody was going down into the caves after idalia it had better be him the question was how to convince jermayan of that theres no way theres absolutely no way look i agree youre right kellen said about two hours past dawn two hours of intermittent polite elven arguing weve got to go after her finally jermayan said making a grab for the tarnkappa but we have to do this right kellen said holding on to the bundle of fabric firmly we need to find a more secure place to leave the horses than right in front of the cave and id kind of like to know if theres anything out there looking for us before we go in if idalia if shes hurt were going to have to spend the night right here and its going to have to be a place we can defend if we have to also maybe you can find another way in they might be watching this one please please let him decide hes the best one to do this because his woods skills are better than mine jermayan studied him for a long moment then nodded very well you can break camp be ready to ride out the moment i get back i wont be long just be long enough kellen thought he watched as jermayan saddled valdien and rode away over the snow he hated running out on jermayan this waynot that the elven knight would hesitate to do the same if their positions were reversedbut one man alone had a better chance than two down there in the caverns between the tarnkappa and the fact that kellen was going to risk a finding spell kellen was pretty sure he could get to idalia wherever she was he shook out the tarnkappa and looked at shalkan i hope you can kellen began shalkan cleared his throat the unicorn was looking over kellens shoulder with a very odd expression on his long equine face kellen whirled dropping the tarnkappa to the snow his hand going to his sword and stared he was facetoface with a dragon a very large very black dragon its head shimmered iridescently in the strong sunlight the blackness of its armored plates sparkling with all the shades of a midnight opal blue and gold and firered hed seen dragons before but only in visions and then only from a distance they had seemed vaguely lizardlike but borne as much resemblance to the lizards of the forest as shalkan did to a horse and as little long sinuous necks tails twice the length of their bodies ending in a broad flat barb to help the creatures steer in the currents of the upper airfor most of all dragons had wings this one was only a few feet away its head alone was the size of a boat and took up so much of kellens field of vision that he couldnt see any of the details he remembered from his visions it blinked golden pupilless eyes the size of large melons at him how had it gotten so close without him knowing why hadnt he at least heard it the thing was the size of a buildingand not a little cottage eitherit should make some noise and now what was he going to do he certainly didnt dare attack it wildmage you are a friend to the other wildmage it was not a question its voice was deep and surprisingly soft for its size he hadnt known they could talk idalia do you know where she is kellen demanded eagerly yes she is hurt and needs help the eyes blinked i will take you to her the way will not be easy the tainted mockelves that infest the caverns were roused by my exit and search for me now to reach your wildmage we must return the way i came they may discover us and they are eager to take me prisoner leave them to me kellen said touching his sword for a moment he would have been willing to swear the dragon smiled it hesitated for a moment my name is ancaladar im kellen idalias my sister wed better go quickly he glanced at shalkan ill wait here the unicorn said somebody needs to explain things to jermayanand sit on him if necessary kellen nodded and scooped up the tarnkappa hed need its spells to see once they got into the caveshed have to explain the cloak to ancaladar so the dragon didnt worry that kellen had deserted him a dragon come then ancaladar said the dragon spread his wingsblotting out the sun for a momentand launched himself into the sky in an eerie silence he flew low obviously intending kellen to follow better wear that shalkan said nodding at the tarnkappa just in case you run into jermayan on the way kellen nodded swirled the cloak around himself and took off after ancaladar at a run his training under master belesharon served him wellbefore he had entered the house of sword and shield kellen would never have been able to run almost half a league uphill over snow to the foot of a cliff without falling flat on his face at the end of it but though he wasnt able to keep pace with the dragoneven though he could tell that ancaladar was gliding very slowlyhe reached the spot where the dragon circled very quickly and flung back the tarnkappa as ancaladar dropped down to a neatand silentlanding here i am kellen said looking up at ancaladar idalia made this so she could sneak around in the caverns i could see you quite clearly the dragon said now that was interesting ancaladar could see through the tarnkappas spells ill need it to see underground kellen said wrapping it around himself again then it is good that you should wear it ancaladar said humans find these caverns very dark the dragon turned his attention to the cliff face several yards up the icy rock wall kellen could see a wide slit in the stone ancaladar stuck his head into the gap and squirmed in furling his enormous ribbed wings tightly against his sides and that was possibly the strangest thing that kellen had seen inwell a long time the dragon shouldnt have been able to fit in there what could it do disjoint all its bones my turn kellen flexed his gauntleted hands and began to climb elven armor it was said by its makers was flexible enough that its wearer could dance in it and certainly the combat form practiced by the elven knights was very much like dance kellen also knew from previous experience that you could climb in elven armor but hed never tried climbing a vertical icecovered wall in it he managed to get halfway up though before a long blackscaled arm tipped in golden talons appeared out of the darkness and plucked him into the cave you take too long ancaladar said oh um sorry im a lot smaller than you are it takes me longer to get places kellen squirmed past the dragons bodyfortunately this entrance to the cave system was fairly wideand moved forward until he was in front of ancaladars head even though he was technically in front the dragon was so enormous that it was still in the leadit had only to stretch out its long sinuous neck to put its head several yards in front of kellen the passage here was fairly straight without any side passages and the tarnkappas darksight spell ensured that it was as bright as day even though ancaladars body blocked all the light from the outside kellen started forward confidently soon the passage opened out into a cavern it was so large that he could not see the far side of it even with the aid of the tarnkappas magical sight he could feel a faint steady breeze blowing over himfrom deep in the earth toward the outside air the path ended in a dropoff but fortunately it wasnt a sheer drop there was a slopesteep but manageable kellen gritted his teeth and started down it it was steeper than hed thought and he ended up making most of the journey to the bottom on his rump behind him he saw ancaladar step neatly to the cave floorthe dragons size made the dropoff no more than a single step for him kellen was about to ask which way they went now when ancaladars head suddenly shot up he saw the dragons nostrils flarejust like shalkans when he smells something badand then without a word or a sound ancaladar gave a great bound and launched himself at the nearest cave wall climbing quickly and silently until hed vanished into the shadows that was good enough for kellen even though he heard nothing he scrambled quickly to his feet and looked around for a place to get out of the way he saw a niche between the edge of the cliff and the cave wallnot much but it would have to do he quickly moved toward it and pressed himself back into the corner just in time it turned out hed barely settled himself when he began to hear faint noises as of a large group of people moving quietly but not entirely silently a few moments later they came into view there were eight of them six were male the two bringing up the rear were female it was easy to tell because none of them was wearing much more than a hip wrap all were barefoot as well the two females were both carrying large bundles of netting the nets were made of some substance kellen had never seen beforea shiny silverygrey substance that looked something like silk all of the males were armed both with long spears balanced for throwing kellens knightmage gifts told him thatbut also with a variety of looted weapons kellen recognized swords and daggers that had belonged to his friends from the house of sword and shield and felt a dull surge of anger these must be the shadowed elves idalia mentionedwhat ancaladar calls tainted mockelves they were horrible in their own right but to anyone who counted elves as friends they were especially horrible there was no doubt of their elven blood but just as idalia had said somehow it had been mixed with goblins to produce those fanged muzzles receding jaws and pale bulging eyes their hands and feet had talons not nails as well no wonder vestakia had been able to find this place and idalia had said there was a whole colony of these creatures here they were obviously searching for ancaladar every few feet the one in the lead would squat down and sniff the ground then speak to the others in a strange guttural barking language he was not the leader apparently for the leader urged him onward with blows causing a dispute to break out among the hunting party during all of this the females cowered back hissing at last they moved on they passed right by kellens hiding place without stopping to look and kellen blessed the wild magic that had gone into the tarnkappas making even when he could no longer see them he stayed where he was waiting for ancaladar to return at last the dragon reappeared gliding down to the floor of the cavern to land soundlessly even now it did not speak merely swiveled its great head and pointed in the direction they should go ancaladar had told the truth when he said that the shadowed elves were desperate to capture him at any cost they encountered three more patrols as they went each time ancaladar quickly hid giving kellen plenty of advance warning to conceal himself as well they moved through a series of interconnected caverns all of them werent as large as the first one but kellen quickly realized that since they were following ancaladars preferred route in and out of the caves there werent going to be any small passages the only real problem that kellen encounteredother than having to hide from the shadowed elveswas that terrain that ancaladar could cross with ease presented towering obstacles for kellen to climb over or detour around occasionally ancaladar would grow impatient with the delay and pluck him into the air setting him down somewhere several hundred yards distant kellen hadnt quite made up his mind yet but he thought he preferred scrabbling over slabs of basalt to being whisked through the air in the claws of an impatient dragon not that he was feeling terribly patient himself with idalia somewhere ahead trapped and hurt he didnt know of course but he had the sense that ancaladar was being forced to detour by the shadowed elf patrols that wasnt good finally ancaladar stopped he lowered his head so it was right beside kellens this is the last of the ways we can go to reach your sister the dragon said in a whisper so low that kellen barely heard it it could be the safest of the ways we can go or the most dangerousits very narrow and theres nowhere to hide but they may not have thought to look this way yet narrow terrific kellen thought following the dragon as he moved forward again but narrow was a relative term the passage was narrow for ancaladar the dragon had to fold his wings tightly and crouch down on his bellybut there was enough room for kellen and the entire rescue party that had started out from sentarshadeen if theyd been there to ride down the tunnel suddenly the dragon stopped stretching out his neck his nostrils flaring oh no he said in dismay were trapped for the first time kellen fell into battletrance immediately without having to invoke it it fell over him as he cast off the tarnkappa as if it were somehow taking the place of the cloak in a way it was the dualsight allowed him to see in the dark as the cloak spell did he saw the shadowed creatures as they stalked forward out of the darkness just as clearly as if he were still wrapped in its folds he did not however charge instead he drew his sword and waited waited for his doubledsight to show him that they saw him for what he was the aura of threat that surrounded him was unmistakablethat he knew from his lessons in the house of sword and shield he was armed and he was waiting for their attack now it became their choice to fight or flee they saw him for what he wasand they charged one of them threw the net it carried as if it were floating like a puff of down kellen watched it drift toward him and in that odd slowedtime he cut it in half as it started to fly past his head aimed at ancaladar evidently and not him the moment that the steel of his sword touched it the two halves of the net withered and dropped to the ground kellen continued the stroke with a sideways twist of his wrist to take off the head of the unwary creature that was nearest him they were frail these shadowed elves he killed it and the one behind it then let the momentum of his blade carry him around in a spin to cleave another across the spine he made a recovery move blocked the sword of a fourth as he kicked a fifth in the stomach cut under the blocked blade to eviscerate the fourth one and as the fifth staggered backward followed and gutted it as well the sixth and seventh were no real challenge he took them out as they stared at him dumbfounded he whirled ancaladar was frozen in place eyes wide move he snapped ancaladar managed to compress himself against the wall of the tunnel enough to let him squeeze by this time he did charge catching the much larger party that thought it was sneaking up in the rear entirely by surprise for all of the weapons that they carried for all of their superior ability to see in the dark they might just as well have had no defensive ability at all they were absolutely no match for the special advantages of a knightmage not even at fourteentoone the battletrance faded and the world was utterly black once more kellen stood in the darkness feeling a faint regret but nothing more when hed drawn his sword they could have run when hed begun to kill the others they could have run they chose not to if he had not fought he and ancaladar would have been killed or taken prisoner and idalia would die because he had refused to accept that he had chosen to kill that was the way of the knightmage the agent of the active principle of the wild magic he forgave them for attacking him and he forgave himself for killing them just as jermayan had taught him absently he wiped his sword blade dry on his cloakthered be time to give the blade a thorough cleaning laterand worked his way back up to ancaladars any more of them kellen asked stooping to grope for the discarded tarnkappa and don it once more no you eliminated all of them knightmage the dragon moved forward stepping fastidiously over the corpses they moved faster now there didnt seem to be any need to try to conceal their presence any longer not only had the shadowed elves found them but kellen seemed to have killed most of the ones searching for them they must want you really badly kellen said after a few moments has your world wholly forgotten my kind im a dragon ancaladar said with a note of bitterness in his voice and no doubt the endarkened have a mage or two in thrall and an arsenal of spells to try to force a bonding that they ache to try dragons bond with mages kellen said halfremembered scraps of what jermayan had told him about the great war coming back to his mind almost correct each dragon is fated to bond with one magehis bondmate after which that mage becomes incredibly powerfulhaving an endless supply of spellenergy to draw onand the dragons life becomes incredibly short for when his bondmate dies he dies as well oh it didnt seem fair all the advantage seemed to go to the mage all the dragon got out of the deal was dead what about mageprices bonded mages dont pay them not with our power to draw on ancaladar said simply why would a dragon i dont know ancaladar said curtly ending the discussion firmly were nearly there thank sky and fair wind up ahead the tunnel opened out ancaladar stretched his neck out extending it through the opening kellen followed along until he reached the edge of the tunnel hed moved cautiously and was glad he had there was only a narrow ledge at the cave mouth and it extended for only a few feet in either direction before vanishing entirely the tunnel had opened out into another of the huge caverns kellen was growing used to but this one was different from any of the previous ones its floor was crisscrossed with other deep fissuresas though something very hot had cooled hereand littered with enormous boulders as though there had been an explosion as well he could hear a distinct sighing sound as if something even bigger than ancaladar was breathing but it seemed to come from the cave itself he moved quickly to one side as ancaladar flowed past him and down to the floor of the cave then looked around in frustration he couldnt climb down it was much too far to jump and as far as he knew his knightmage abilities didnt include the power of flight after a few seconds ancaladar noticed his plight the dragon turned back and plucked him from the ledge depositing him on the cave floor not far now ancaladar said was it kellens imagination or was there a note of worry in the dragons voice idalia was lying at the foot of a cliff at the far side of the cavern kellens heart twisted in his chest when he saw her he knew the look of broken bones he could seeand smellthe blood how long had she been lying here was she dead then he saw the faint movement of her chest and knew that she was still alive he ran forward and knelt beside her his first impulse was to waken her but he knew that would be no kindness she must be in agony he had to get her out of here but even if ancaladar would consent to carry her he didnt dare move her while she was in this condition broken legs broken arm and collarbone undoubtedly a concussion probably internal bleeding as well ill have to heal her before we can move her kellen said aloud healing was not his strongest skill in the wild magic and hed never tried this major a healing especially without someone around to share the mageprice he looked hopefully at ancaladar but the dragon cringed away you go ahead he said taking a step backward ill wait over here until youre done kellen sighed i guess its all up to me i just hope im good enough he had to be for idalias sake these days he always carried the components for the simplest of the wild magic spells with him and healing was a very simple spell here where everything was stone he didnt even need a brazier he simply unwrapped his disk of charcoal and set it directly on the stone floor and set it alight with a simple word he pulled out the few herbs hed need and set them beside the burning charcoal his stomach twisted as he thought of the only other healing involving broken bones hed ever witnessed when idalia had healed a unicorn colts fractured leg shed worked all the pieces of the break into alignment first he should do that here to give the healing the best chance but the colt had been dosed with a sleeping potion and he had nothing to give his sister if you dont do it shell die do you want your squeamishness to kill her kellen pulled off his armored gauntlets then drew his dagger and cut a few strands of idalias hair then a few of his own he moistened the bundle with idalias blood then pricked his finger and squeezed out a few drops of blood onto the dried leaves of willow ash and yew then he tossed the bundle of herbs and hair onto the coals heal idaliaplease i swear i will pay the price kellen thought fervently he knew he should be centered in a wildmages dispassionate trance but that was something he couldnt manage right now he cared too muchand if that was something really wrong then he supposed the gods wouldnt have let him become a knightmage in the first place the bundle should have smelled horrible while it was burning but it didnt it smelled like spring flowers and freshcut hay kellen saw the shimmer of the protective shields all around him and hoped that protection would extend to keeping idalia from feeling what he was doing first he straightened her legs feeling the bones move and shift under his hands made sweat run down his face in greasy droplets but once hed begun he knew he couldnt stop everything was glowing green next her arm it seemed to him that it ought to be straightened so he did that as gently as he could that led him to her collarbonebroken as he suspected there wasnt a lot he could do about it but he prodded at it until hed shifted the bones about into moreorless the right places and left it at that everything was fire green fire he ran his hands over her head they came away wet with blood though kellen knew that might not mean much even the smallest scalp wounds could bleed a great deal or it might be a concussion without being able to see her eyes he didnt know green all green her breathing was better now which reminded him to check for broken ribs and broken pelvis he ran his hands down over her ribs pressing gently but everything felt solid he found her hip bones and pressed gently relieved to find that everything was solid there too abruptly kellen sat back on his haunches and stared down at his hands they were trailing greenness as if hed dipped them in a vat of liquid emeralds idalia too was green as if shed been soaked in the stuff when hed healed jermayan the healing power had hit him like a hammerblow leaving him in no doubt of when the healing began and ended this time it had snuck up on him apparently hed been healing idalia while he thought hed just been checking the extent of her injuries he wondered why the two healings had been so different perhaps because idalia was such an expert wildmage and had been able to direct the healing in some fashion or was it for some other reason did the wild magic itself want her healed slowly the green fire faded away and kellen waited to hear the price he would have to pay for this healing but to his surpriseand faint alarmthere was nothing no inner voice setting his mageprice only a certainty that somehow the priceeven for this had been paid in advance kellen shook his head he wasnt going to argue and he wasnt going to complain the dome of protection vanishedkellen was always surprised there wasnt an audible pop when it vanishedits work done he felt a sudden rush of dizziness and exhaustion as the price of the casting caught up with him he wasnt going to be good for much for a whilethough he could fight if he absolutely had toand idalia would be utterly exhausted and they still had to get out of here he put his gauntlets back on picked up the burning charcoal and crushed it quickly into dust brushing the mess from his hands he got to his feet idalia was still unconscious but it was a natural sleep now not a deathly coma hed like to wait here for her to wakehe didnt relish carrying her out especially if they ran into more of those creatures on the waybut he didnt want to stay here one moment more than he had to he got to his feet staggering a little with weakness he stood for a moment breathing carefully until his head cleared ancaladar approached carefully is it over the dragon asked cautiously shes going to be all right kellen said he wondered if the odd way the healing had gone had anything to do with the dragons nearness and decided not to ask ancaladar seemed to be a little touchy about being a living storage battery for mages and kellen didnt want to suggest hed tapped the dragons power even accidentally now all we have to do is get out of here do you think the dragon seemed almost hesitant do you think i could come back with you im tired of living in a cave and chasing deer and theyll never stop looking for me now youll have to ask andoreniel and ashaniel if you can live in sentarshadeen kellen said i cant promise that but i dont see why you shouldnt come south with us and see theyve added some unusual citizens to sentarshadeen lately and if were going to have to beware of deathwings it would be a good idea to have someone else around who flies fair enough ancaladar agreed the dragon headed off across the cavern its enormous sable body moving over the boulders like a pool of midnight kellen bent down scooped up idalia and followed halfway across the cavern she began to rouse she reached up and felt his faceor rather the hood of the tarnkappajust as if she couldnt see kellen realized with a shock that she couldnt he could see but everything must be pitchdark to her hed gotten so used to ancaladar being able to see and hear him through the tarnkappa that hed forgotten he was wearing it but idalia wouldnt be able to either hear or see himnot while he wore the tarnkappanot that she could see anything down here at any rate kellen she whispered he nodded knowing she could feel the movement she relaxed with a sigh and kellen knew she was figuring everything out that hed found her somehow and healed her with the wild magic put me down she said a minute later i can walkand you might need to fight she was right it was only common sense even though kellen knew how tired she must be after such a major healing he set her carefully on her feet and led her the rest of the way to where ancaladar was waiting for them their progress was a little slower now that he had to lead idalia but kellen was tired himself and didnt want to risk a fall at the foot of the cliff that led to the tunnels he stopped and pushed back the tarnkappas cowl so that he could speak to idalia instantly the darkness of the cave rushed in it was like no darkness kellen had ever experienced in his life thick and absolute there was no possibility of seeing anything no matter how hard you strained your eyes for a moment he felt a bolt of panic then he realized it didnt matter he didnt need to see he knew at the house of sword and shield the knights practiced blindfighting for it was always possible that you would be forced to defend or attack at night in fog or under other adverse conditions you learned to have an awareness of where your targets were to memorize the positions of your own people and keep them in mind kellen had learned then that he could not only remember where all the people on his own side were in a fight but know where they were going to be in practice sessions hed never hit any of his own side master belesharon had said this was a manifestation of the knightmage gift so was this it seemed it wasnt that he could see in the dark but hed come this way once and apparently part of the knightmage gift was to remember terrain perfectly he wasnt going to need the tarnkappa to get out of here that was going to make things a little easier theres an um dragon here he whispered to idalia hes going to lift both of us up to a tunnel a few yards up the cliff face i remember the dragon idalia said dryly before kellen could raise the hood again he felt ancaladars talons close around his middle and heard idalia give a startled squeak he felt himself swept into the air and deposited very gently just inside the cave he could see ancaladars eyes glowing like dim elven lanterns and could tell from their size that the dragons head must be very close he could even feel the dragons warm breath but he could see absolutely nothing hello idalia said to ancaladar i guess i have you to thank for my rescue it was my pleasure wildmage idalia ancaladar said gravely oh kellen said realizing hed forgotten to introduce them idalia this is ancaladar ancaladar this is my sister idalia it felt very odd making polite introductions in the pitchdarkness when only one of the parties could see the other he swept the hood up for just a moment to see where idalia was and led her a little farther into the cave then he took off the tarnkappa why dont you wear the tarnkappa he suggested i can get by without it oh and ancaladar can see you and hear you even while youre wearing it i wont be able to hear you though dont tell me you can see down here idalia said disbelievingly kellen sensed her reaching for the tarnkappa and pushed it into her hands no but i dont need to i can remember where weve been and im pretty sure were going back the same way yes ancaladar said softly it is not the fastest but it will be sure idalia put on the cloak it was a very odd sensation for kellen one moment he could sense she was there the next moment he couldnt there were a few moments of scraping and slithering while ancaladar turned himself around in the cramped confines of the tunnel and then they continued they moved much faster now that idalia could see though she still leaned against kellen from time to time for support that was probably the strangest part of the whole adventure because the occasional contacts seemed to come out of nowhere kellen had no sense of her presence until he felt her lean against him the absolute darkness wore on his nerves though his internal map of the cave system was still as reliable as when hed first discovered it now that he couldnt see hearing and scent seemed to be magnified to compensate he could hear a faint dripping of water something that sounded like a distant river the constant breathing sound of the cave the faint sound of ancaladars passage over the stone and the louder sounds of his own movements he could smell wet stone blood and damp wool leather and elven steel and armoroil unicorn and horse and a spicy indefinable scent that he eventually decided must be dragon and eventually he could see light it was the faintest hint of light at firstnothing like enough to navigate by but they were in the last long passage that led to the outside world and kellen could smell cold fresh air by now idalia was staggering with exhaustion kellen wasnt feeling much better all he wanted to do was throw himself down in the nearest snowdrift and sleep for a year or two were not going to be able to climb down that cliff kellen said in sudden realization i know ancaladar said gently humans are very fragile whatever that meant at the moment kellen was too tired to care by the time they reached the cave mouth his eyes were watering at the intensity of the light after so long in utter darkness and hed pulled up the hood of his travel cloak to try to shield himself a little he was faintly surprised to note that from the position of the sun it was only early afternoon it seemed as if hed been down in the caves for sennights as soon as theyd neared the opening idalia had taken off the tarnkappa and bundled it across her shoulders like an overlarge towel she looked pale and exhausted and there were deep shadows under her eyes she was filthy with cave dust and dried blood and her clothes were ragged and torn ancaladar had hurried ahead once he saw the two of them could make it as far as the cave mouth under their own power he was already outside only his enormous head poking back into the cave watching them anxiously as they staggered forward finally they reached the cave mouth kellen shivered hed managed to forget how cold it was out here once more the dragon reached out and lifted each of them out of the cave andvery gentlydeposited them on the snow at the foot of the cliff then before either of them could say anything it launched itself into the sky with a bound well i idalia began then her eyes rolled back in her head and her knees buckled she fell forward into the snow kellen lunged for her feeling for her pulse but both her breathing and her pulse were steady shed simply fainted from exhaustionand no wonder after walking who knew how far through the caves right after a major healing at least he was in better shape than she was he looked around warily but he saw no signs of enemies and ancaladar soaring overhead gave no sign that he saw anything amiss kellen picked up idalia againmaking sure his cloak was wrapped warmly around both of them and began the long walk back toward the camp jermayan and shalkan met him halfway and kellen might have been in for a bad time if he hadnt had idalia in his arms jermayan immediately took her up before him on valdien cradling her tenderly in his arms is she all right the elven knight asked sounding closer to terrified than kellen had ever heard him before why does she not wake it was a good thing they were operating under war manners which allowed jermayan to ask direct questions if hed had to use the normal forms of elven polite speech kellen thought he might have exploded shes just had a major healing and had to walk out of the caves on top of it kellen said soothingly putting his arm over shalkans withers shell sleep for at least a day if she can and i wish i could shes fine jermayan held her close looking unconvinced you were fortunate to have found her he said just then ancaladars shadow swept over them jermayan looked up kellen had never seen jermayan look quite so utterly and completely taken by surprise it was rather gratifying whats that jermayan sputtered staring its a dragon kellen said trying to hide a grin hes the one who showed me where idalia was his name is ancaladar he wants to come home with us he followed me home can i keep him jermayan continued to stare in a stunned fashion as ancaladar swept on over the end of the valley wheeled and headed back soaring higher this time then by all means the dragon must be welcome in our homes and at our hearths he said at last i dont know about that part kellen said doubtfully he isnt going to fit in my home anyway unless he can shrink they stopped to collect idalias horse and then rode out of the valley following the route the rest of the party had taken the night before despite kellens tiredness and idalias need for rest this was not a place any of them wanted to linger soon enough the shadowed elves would stop searching the caves and nerve themselves to face the punishing daylight and kellen didnt know how many more of them there might be idalia rode in jermayans arms wrapped in a blanket as they went on kellen told jermayan everything of what hed seen in the caverns particularly about the shadowed elves the more people who knew about them the better idalia mentioned an underground village but i didnt see it they were carrying weapons stolen from the caravan so theyre definitely the hooded figures i saw in my vision which means they are their allies herein elven lands living undetected jermayan said darkly able to pass the landwards at will andoreniel must hear of this without delay they rode through the rest of the day but though they saw traces of the other partys passage it had almost a full days lead and they had not caught up to it by the time jermayan signaled a halt for the night you are nearly falling from your saddle with exhaustion kellen and idalia could use better rest as well the elven knight said in tones that brooked no argument we will certainly catch up to them tomorrowand travel all the faster for a nights rest kellen reluctantly agreed even without vestakia traveling with them to detect any hint of demonic presence ancaladars presence overhead ensured that they were nearly as safe as if they were within sentarshadeen itself although now that he knew that creatures such as the shadowed elves could roam the elven lands at will kellen was no longer sure how safe that was jermayan took most of the work of making camp upon himself leaving kellen to sit at idalias side beside the warmth of the brazier she was awake now but still very weak wheres ancaladar she asked flying around overhead i guess kellen answered unless hes asleep somewhere im not sure where hed sleep though hes much too big to perch in a tree and there arent any more caves around here at least i hope there arent maybe he can sleep on the wing i dont think dragons sleep at all except when theyre bored idalia said seriously she shivered but kellen could tell it wasnt from cold thanks for getting me out of there i mean it she sipped her tea youd do the same for me and ancaladar did all the real work all i had to do was follow him he thought about asking idalia about the odd way the healing had gone and decided to wait it didnt seem to be an urgent problem that needed to be dealt with right now he wants to come and live in sentarshadeen with us well that should give the gossips something new to talk about idalia said though if every time you leave you bring back another odd stray they might decide to confine you to the valley from now on she yawned her eyelids drooping and kellen plucked the teacup from her hand as her fingers relaxed jermayan arrived having settled the horses for the night and stirred the pot of soup that was cooking over the fire kellen had already eaten several trailbars but was looking forward to hot soup it will be ready soon jermayan pronounced then you will both eat and you will sleep i think we can all sleep kellen said idalia said that dragons dont sleep ancaladar can keep watch jermayan glanced up at the sky ancaladar was invisible save as an enormous shadow that blotted out the stars as he passed between them and the ground two sets of eyes are better than one the elven knight said simply there was no point in arguing with jermayan even if kellen had possessed the energy right now if there was one thing he had learned during the time he had spent in sentarshadeen it was that it was not an easy thing to change an elfs mind once he had made it up well if jermayan wanted to keep watch let him no harm could come of it after all they had to awaken idalia so that she could eat jermayan cradled her in his arms while kellen helped her hold the bowl the sight of the two of them together made him faintly uncomfortable but he put it down to exhaustion she was asleep again almost before shed finished and jermayan wrapped her tenderly in her blankets again adding more fuel to the brazier she must have been badly injured he suggested handing kellen his own bowl of soup she was kellen said briefly bending his head over the bowl to inhale the steam jermayan seemed to be waiting for more shed fallen off a cliff ah jermayan was silent for a moment i well remember my own weakness after you healed me this kellen hesitated for a moment wondering how much to tell and how much jermayan would understand jermayan was no wildmage uncounted years ago the elves had sacrificed their part in the greater magics for peace and length of years so their legends told there were no elven mages this was a much more extensive healing he finally said and it went differently shes going to be fine he added quickly seeing the look of alarm in jermayans dark eyes but shes going to need a lot more rest and recovery time than you did he thought of the days after hed first come to live with idalia in the wildwoods when shed healed him of injuries sustained fighting the outlaw hunt maybe as much as a moonturn then there are two reasons to return to sentarshadeen as quickly as we may jermayan said consideringly now i think it is best that you sleep as well when he awoke the following morning kellen felt fully recoveredwhatever gift had been bestowed upon him in the cavern to allow him to heal without mageprice it had granted him a quick recovery as well the morning had dawned damp and foggy clouds had rolled in shrouding the sun and the trees were veiled in mist the temperature had risen slightly with a bite in the heavy air that promised snow before midday the horses were restless sensing the coming snowfall and even idalias placid bay mare cella frisked and played up when it came time to saddle her idalia was still too weak to ride so once more jermayan took her up before him on valdien and tied cellas leadrein to his saddle they caught up to the rest of the party near midday as kellen had expected it had begun to snow and visibility was poor but unicorn senses were keen they know were here shalkan reported and a few moments later a unicornmounted knight came plunging back through the snowdrifts to greet them kellenshalkanjermayanand idalia as well bendirean said thank leaf and star we had thought that misfortune had befallen us jermayan agreed and so it did but as you see we have all slipped free from the shadows grasp we are fortunate to have reached you before you turned off in the direction of the fortress of the crowned horns we do not go there bendirean said reluctantly as if to impart the news pained him he and zanaleth turned and began walking along beside jermayan and the others at a distance that was comfortable for zanaleth vestakia says it is too dangerous we return directly to sentarshadeen too dangerous that doesnt sound good kellen thought that is our destination as well with all possible speed jermayan agreed as calmly as if he were discussing a new fashion or the best way to prepare roast partridge we bring news that andoreniel must have at oncebut we also bring a welcome ally he pointed skyward bendirean looked up as if he could hear themand for all kellen knew he couldancaladar chose that moment to make a low pass over them for a few moments he was plainly visible even through the veils of snow then he tilted the end of one vast wing and rose through the clouds again that was a dragon bendirean said with what kellen thought was commendable calm under the circumstances zanaleth and shalkan exchanged eloquentthough silentlooks yes bendirean that was a dragon jermayan said his voice faintly unsteady his name is ancaladar and he wishes to be our ally the reunion with the larger party was one marked by great relief on both sides sandalon was overjoyed to see kellen again bursting into unexpected tears and clinging to him tightly when lairamo saw that idalia was alivethough far from wellkellen thought she might actually lose her iron composure as it was the haggard lines of fear and despair in her face eased markedly kellen was glad to see that all the children were wellat least in body the scars of their captivity at the hands of the shadowed elves would be long in healing and kellen hoped that the elven healers would be able to do something to ease them to his surprise he found himself thinking with favor about armethalieh something he would have been willing to swear would never happen but the high mages were skilled in manipulating the mind wouldnt it be a good thing if none of the children remembered any of the horrible things that had happened at all or was this a case of good intentions leading to bad results armethalieh as it was now was certainly no paradise but morusil iletel and even idalia had said that the mages had begun with the best of intentions and it was wanting to do good that had allowed the mages bonded to dragons to be corrupted by the endarkened fortunately this problems solution wasnt up to him the stop was necessarily brief while vestakia did not sense pursuers she had the sense that there were more of the shadowed elves in the areaand if they came in force or with the same allies who had proved so disastrous to the first party there might be little kellens people could do to stop them even though they now had ancaladars help with shalkans permission kellen took sandalon up before him on his saddle and they rode on the snow continued to worsen throughout the day and they finally had to stop a few hours later to make camp kellen still felt restless even though vestakia didnt sense any trouble nearby and decided to ride up the trail a ways to scout ahead for the next days travel he unlimbered his bow and kept it ready to hand shielded by his cloak his archery wasnt as strong as his swordwork but he might get lucky and surprise a rabbit or two elven trailfood was both nourishing and palatable but after more than a sennight of eating nothing else some fresh meat would be welcome kellen was a bit surprised at the relief he felt to ride away from the rest of the party the winter silence seemed to envelop him like a soothing cloak and the only sound was the hiss of falling snow i uh didnt ask you if you wanted to come along kellen said after a while you could hardly go without me shalkan said besides i thought youd like to be alone for a while kellen was grateful for his friends understanding since the moment hed realized that the convoy heading for the fortress of the crowned horns had been attacked hed been drawn as tight as a bowstring with tensionfirst to reach the spot then to find the missing children then to rescue idalia then to get away safely and while he knew they hadnt quite accomplished that yet they were close he could relax at least a little its a real mess isnt it he said having colonies of shadowed elves living within the elven lands ready to strike at the nine cities without warning i suppose it depends on your definition of mess shalkan observed i guess were going to have towait whats that there was a sound up ahead but when he listened for it it disappeared into the wind and the hiss of falling snow i dont hear anything shalkan said flicking his delicate ears back and forth that wasnt right shalkans hearing was much more acute than kellens somethings coming i think somethings coming i thought i heard it you probably sensed it knightmages know what they need to know shall we go see yes kellen said shalkan broke into a quick trot kellen hoped that whatever it was it wasnt more trouble than he could handle but when they reached the source of the disturbance kellen had sensed he discovered it wasnt trouble at all kenderk tyban dervasin he greeted the elves he knew best by name i see you and calmereni am glad to see you so well recovered i would not let them come without me the unicorn said simply inclining her head when hed left sentarshadeen it had been with only those he could gather in less than a day but andoreniel and ashaniel had not been sitting idle in his absence from what kellen could see here they had gathered all the rest of the knights they could call up in haste and sent them after kellen as soon as possibleand not only warriors but light supply wagons as well to carry the extra supplies needed to engage in winter travel i see you kellen knightmage dervasin answered one hopes of course that the news you have to tell will make good hearing the children are safe kellen said since that was the extent of the good news weve made camp a way up the trail ill ride back with you theres a lot to tell and not much of it good news as he led dervasins party back to the others kellen provided an abbreviated version of recent events including the details he now knew of the massacre of the party sent to conduct them to the elven fortress the fortress itself is safe but vestakia doesnt think its safe to try to approach it and we need to get idalia and the children back to sentarshadeen as soon as possible as you say dervasin agreed even with the snow and the gathering darkness they were within sight of the camp by now kellen and shalkan rode on ahead to let the others know that the relief party had arrived he wasnt quite sure dervasin believed him about the dragon yet the arrival of supply wagons meant they could make a proper camp with better shelter for idalia lairamo and the children the relief party included several healers as well who quickly went off to consult with evanor to see if there was more they could do for the children and idalia before they reached the city and more people meant they were less likely to be attacked though there had been a substantial guard of sentarshadeens best warriors on the original convoy and it hadnt saved them why so gloomy shalkan asked a few hours later youve done what you set out to do if no one attacked dervasins force on his way to us we shouldnt have much trouble getting back to sentarshadeen so weve won kellen looked at his friend he was fairly sure the unicorn was just being provokingthough he suspected he was right that they wouldnt be attacked on the way back to the city from what vestakia had said the enemy forces were only interested in keeping them away from the crowned horns no he said slowly we havent won this is just the beginning one did not prosper in the world without sun without knowing the pattern of events almost before they were formed and prince zyperis yearned to prosper though he had not known his mothers plans before she had at last unveiled them to him once he knew the direction in which her interests lay it was a simple enough matter to set his own spiesboth magical and mundaneto follow the undertaking and so zyperis knew almost as soon as it happened that sentarshadeen rode out to rescue what queen savilla had taken he waited baffled for her to order the captives removed from the hands of the goblin elves but the cycles of rest and rising passed and she did nothing almostalmosthe seized them himself and carried them away to a place of greater safety but he knew that his dearest mama would see that as a direct challenge to her power and zyperis was not ready to attempt that nor did he ask her openly about her plans for to do so would be to reveal his own sources of information and so he waited frustrated and confused as the accursed elves the wildmages andworst of allhis wayward daughter vestakia forged deep into the mystral range discovering the lair of the goblin elves and carrying away the prize and adding unspeakable insult to unthinkable injury carrying away the dragon as well zyperis had known a dragon laired and hunted somewhere in the mystrals the endarkened knew the spells to force a bond between a human mage and the greatest of the otherfolk and could he only have traced the creature to its lair zyperis could have sent one of his cringing magemen to it and claimed the prize for the endarkened but nowthanks to queen savillas maddening inactionthey had lost both elves and dragon and it would be long cycles of searching before he could locate another of the rare beasts prince zyperis was not happy the loss of the dragon was an unexpected setback casting a faint shadow of misfortune over her victory but the savor of prince zyperiss frustrations at not being able to act upon his secret information nearly made up for that disappointment and the creature had not bonded with either of the wildmagesso savilias spies reportedso there was yet a chance of reclaiming it to the service of he who is and that would be so much easier now that they knew precisely where it was her son really ought to learn to take the long view of things queen savilla was not unhappy with the progression of events and soon official word of her defeat would reach the court and she could savor new pleasures the emissary of the goblin elves reached the dark court a handful of risings later once he had left the elven lands savilla had sent an escortboth to speed him on his journey and to ensure he was not pursued she felt a mild curiosity at the prospect of personally viewing an example of this great and secret triumph over the arrogant and condescending elves its creation had been the work of her father uralesse who had mingled the blood of mindblasted elven captives taken in the great war with that of goblins and lesser endarkened to create a race that would deceive the landwards of the elves by virtue of its elven heritage for centuries as the children of the light reckoned time the goblin elves had been left to go their own way living in the dark places deep beneath the elven landsbut never let to forget to whom they owed their ultimate allegiance the emissarys name was hnn among his own people he was a huntleader cruel and fearless but now he had been brought before his gods and he crouched and cowered drooling in fear savilla had chosen to receive him in her formal audience chamber she was seated upon the shadow throne carved of ebony and inlaid with black pearls it made a striking backdrop for her scarlet skin the walls of the audience chamber were black as wella frieze in darkened silver depicting all the ancient races which the endarkened had destroyed the ceiling of the chamber was paneled in the skin of a black dragon its scales still luminous after all these centuries and the floor was a single polished block of black topaz so smooth and flawless that the ceiling and walls reflected in it as if in a mirror the chamber lent itself to the staging of very effective setpieces and was easy to clean up afterward sweet isnt he savilla murmured to prince zyperis she had allowed him to attendthough this was by no means a public audienceand had even allotted him the signal honor of standing beside her throne barbarian zyperis commented but he sounded intrigued savilla waved a gilded hand indicating that hnn should approach the goblin elf crawled forward on hands and knees kissing her foot before flinging himself facedown at her feet hes going to be difficult to talk to in that position zyperis drawled gazing down at the trembling creature savilla laughed talk to him my dear boy theyre incapable of producing civilized speech and i have no intention of spending half an eternity barking like a coldwarg no a simple mindtouch will tell us all he knows and then kitchens or bedroom zyperis affected to consider the matter for a moment and smiled why not both ah zyperis you always know what will please me best savilla cooed she studied the creature at her feet for a moment morerather attractive really all the more because one could see the remains of his elven heritage spoiled and twisted within himthen gestured to the lesser endarkened that had accompanied him they came forward their hooves clicking on the topaz floor and lifted him to eye level with the queen his pale bulging eyes widened further with terror and awe she reached out one hand to zyperis so that he could share in the spell with the other she gripped hnns chin his fear cascaded over her like sweet perfume kindling the spell delicately she sipped at the images that lay on the surface of his mind taking in the message he had come to bring with him she shared the thrill of the stalk the slaughter of the elves the capture of the strange hot foulsmelling captives the joy at serving the winged ones and the terror the fury the sense of shame and failure when the godoffering vanished from his grasp all that rushed into her mind and prince zyperiss in an instant if the two endarkened had not already been holding hnn upright he would have crumpled to the floor like a doll when she was sure she had all the information he had to give savilla released him hnn whimpered faintly urine ran down his leg and spattered on the floor its musky scent filling the chamber now take him away and bathe himthoroughly savilla said when you are done bring him to my private chambers we shall see what other entertainment our young envoy can provide savilla was pleased to see that zyperis contained himself until the two of them were alone though his barbed tail lashed fretfully with the strength of his emotions to tease him she got to her feet and walked away from the throne carefully avoiding the puddleand walked about the room admiring the designs upon the walls as if shed never seen them before so many races quenched by the cunning of the endarkened and soon the elves would join them mamawhy zyperis burst out when he could contain himself no longer you had them within your graspall those tender morsels and the elven kings brat first among them you could have brought them here before the cursed wildmages and the others got anywhere near them and you ordered the goblin elves not to pursue the party and take them backthat wretched barbarian didnt understand it and neither do i weve failed have we savilla turned to face him why did i send the goblin elves after the children in the first place to take the kings son and you did mama it was beautifully done but there was uncertainty in zyperiss voice as if he was not certain that was the whole truth savilla glowed with prideit had been a subtle plot and it was not his fault that he did not grasp it at once that he realized he did not see all of her plan was to his credit and indicated what a formidable adversary he would be in the years to come if that was what i meant to do do you not think that the puling brat would be weeping in my dungeons even now savilla said gently zyperis frowned hesitating i yes dearest mama but if that was not what you wanted why go after the caravan at all now the elves know about their cousins they will not rest until they have hunted them down every one yes savilla purred and watched zyperiss face light with understanding and delight now come my son she said going to him and putting a hand on his arm there is much we can do to amuse ourselves until our guest is brought to us and with such tender care he will be a savory morsel at the banquet later chapter eleven the road through the border lands calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink cilarnen wasnt quite sure why the elf was helping him for a long timebellshe was simply too numb to care the creature gave him its pack mule to ride doused its peculiar brazier and repacked its gear and within two chimes they were on their way several times the elf tried making conversation with him even going so far as to offer its namehyandurbut cilarnen only gave one or twoword replies and eventually the elf stopped talking cilarnen couldnt think of what to say anyway hed been banished he was leaving the only home hed ever known his gift had been destroyed he was nothing at all eventually it occurred to him he ought to say something he needed to know what the elf knew if nothing else one of my friends was banished too did you i came upon the remains of a body in the woods today it wore a felons cloak and around it were the footprints of dogsheavy marks as if made by creatures of stone perhaps it was he if so i am sorry for your loss the elfs words were barely more than noise to cilarnen he knew that undermage anigrel had said that tiedor was to be banished he knew that the outlaw hunt was comprised of enchanted stone mastiffs like the stone golems thatin other shapesserved so many functions in the city but somehow in his shocked and benumbed state he could not bring any sense out of hyandurs words i dont understand cilarnen said at last the body had been savaged by the outlaw hunt hyandur said patiently the stone hounds kill all who are declared outlaw by the high council if they are still within the citys lands at dawn but no matter how hard cilarnen thought about hyandurs words they still didnt make any sense why would the outlaw hunt kill anyone they were just supposed to escort the outlaw to the borders of course they were the elf had to be lying thats what elves did show me where he is cilarnen demanded if we return to that place we will not reach the edge of the valley by dawn if we do not leave armethaliehan lands by the time your hunt is released we will both meet the same fate as your friend hyandur said calmly cilarnen wanted to pull away to ride off in search of the body elves were dangerouseveryone said soand he was only now beginning to awaken to the fact that he might be in more danger from his companion than from the cold and the wilderness but the mules leadrein was tied fast to the horses saddle and there was nothing cilarnen could do but ride on blindly into the dark he was being kidnapped he vowed to escape at the earliest opportunity as the sky began to lighten hyandur urged the tired animals to a faster pace they were moving now through a gently rising landscape wholly unfamiliar to cilarnena narrow path bordered by bare earth on both sides as if someone had recreated the flower beds of the city gardens on a gigantic scale each enormous tract of earth was edged by a row of trees and they seemed to go on forever cilarnen hoped for the sight of a village where he could get help but he did not see so much as the smoke from a distant hearthfire behind them the sun began to rise cilarnen imagined it striking the gilded roof of the council house with fire heard in memory the sweet high carillon of dawn bells its soft notes ringing out over the city he swallowed hard with homesickness and loss they will be coming soon hyandur said grimly we must hurry now he leaned forward speaking softly to his mare her ears flickered back and forth as if she understood what he was saying to her he untied one of the knots in the leadrope affixed to his saddle lengthening it by several feet and the mare went from a trot to a canter to a floating run the mule lagged behind for a moment pulling the leadrein bowstring tight and for a moment cilarnen hoped it would snap no mule was as fast as a horse anyway but this mule was apparently an exception for after a moment the rein went slack again as the mule followed after the mare at a pounding jarring pace reflexively cilarnen crouched low over the mules neck urging it on if he had been a lesser rider he would have fallen off in the first few moments of their mad flightand deep within a tiny part of him was suddenly convinced of the seriousness of their peril surely no one even an elf would misuse a horse this way without great need they passed the last of the open land and were back among the winterbare trees where patches of ice still covered the ground cilarnen expected them to slow down over such treacherous footing but they didnt and his heart hammered in fearnot for himself but for the splendid chestnut hyandur rode if she slipped if she fell lameness would be the most fortunate outcome she could hope for a broken necka broken leg but she danced over the ice as if she had wings with the mule thundering after the sun was higher now flickering through the branches the light making cilarnens head pound with feverish pain his hands and face were numb with coldit was as if he couldnt remember ever having been warm in the distance the trees thinned out again the road rose in a gentle curve and he could see a gateway of sortsor at least a place where someone had placed a large post at either side of the road what could it possibly mark there was nothing around it and the land looked very much the same on one side as on the other but it must mean something because hyandur was already slowing the mare as they approached it the mule was only too glad to slacken its pace without any urging on cilarnens part and both animals passed between the posts at a dead slow walk it was snowing on the other side or rather it had snowed recently and heavily and the air was sharp with the promise of more far colder than the air on the near side of the posts this is the boundary of the city lands cilarnen said in sudden realization or at least the boundary of the home farms yes hyandur dismounted from the mare and began to walk back and forth with her through the fresh snow speaking gently to her cilarnen dismounted from the mule wincing and staggering with stiffness he rubbed its nose apologetically he wasnt sure what to do with mules but he supposed it couldnt hurt to treat it like a horse and so he coiled up the leadrein that hyandur had released and began to lead it back and forth as he had seen the grooms do with horses in his fathers stables as he did he looked back toward the boundary the snow made it easy to see the snow just stopped as though it had run into an invisible wall as it had of course a wall of magecraft just as undermage anigrel had said the high council must have extended the boundaries of the city to cover the entire valley once more he wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry the high council had reversed its decision the home farms were part of the city lands once more just as he and the others had wanted hed ruined his life caused his fathers death his familys disgrace for nothing you may stop now hyandur told him breaking into cilarnens chaotic thoughts unsaddle the mule and build a fire in the brazier we will rest here before going on cilarnen stared at him too shocked to react the elf was giving him orders hyandur regarded him for a long moment if you cannot do that then go to the well and draw water for the animals they are rested enough to be ready to drink the well lies over there he pointed in the direction of a snowy cylinder of rock cilarnen hesitated but the mule nudged at his shoulder then lowered its head to mouth at the snow obviously wanting water there was no reason for the animals to suffer just because they belonged to an elf reluctantly cilarnen trudged off in that direction tucking his hands into his armpits to warm them he had never seen a well in his life but it was a simple mechanical design with a crank and gears to raise and lower a bucket on a rope and after a few tries he managed to get the cover off find the bucket and fill the trough at the wells foot with water if hed had his magegift and wand he could simply have called the water up out of the well as it was it was at least a chime before he managed to fill the wateringtrough and he was sweating and dampand very irritated with the elfat the end of it if this was servants work then the servants in house volpiril had not had as soft a life as hed imagined but as he turned back to collect the horse and the mule he forgot all his lesser problems racing toward him along the last patch of open ground between the woods and the markerposts was a pack of stone hounds they looked just like the pair outside the archmages house yet these were horribly animate their fanged jaws opening and closing with soundless barking there were almost a dozen of them perfect in every detail from the spiked collars around their necks to the curved nails upon their feet every aspect of their manner spoke of murderous threat there was no mage with them he ran back toward hyandur and the animalsthinking he might be able to save the mare at leastbut before he could reach them the outlaw hunt reached the invisible border between the lands claimed by the city and the world beyond they stopped as if they had run into a wall but even then they did not retreat like any hunting pack frustrated and kept from taking its prey they milled back and forth on the far side of the invisible wall their unblinking gaze fixed on cilarnen some crouched on their haunches barking silently some dug at the frozen ground as if it were possible to dig beneath the magick and reach their intended prey a few of the hounds kept trying to cross the boundary only to be flung back each time they tried as if by some invisible hand the leader of the pack a mastiff carved of white granite simply stood at the far side of the posts and glared fixedly at cilarnen if it were possible for unliving stone to radiate murderous rage the creature did watching the pack go mad with failure a slow cold wisdom settled over cilarnen the elf had not lied anigrel had not lied tiedor was deadany of his friends who might be banished after him would die but banishment was never meant to be a death sentence it was only meant to cast people out of the city not to kill them he did not know why this terrible ancient custom had been revived but now he knew this the outlaw hunt was not meant to conduct outlaws to the borders of city lands but to kill them and if he had not had the great good fortune to run into hyandur last nightif the elf had not aided him for mysterious reasons of its ownhe too would be dead now savaged by stone fangs you may take the animals to drink now take care that they do not drink too much at first hyandur said coming up to cilarnen where he stood still frozen in shock watching the stone hounds flail at what was to them an impassable border yes im sorry cilarnen said though he could not at that moment have said what he was apologizing for they will not break through hyandur said it is however unsettling to watch cilarnen shook his head unable to stop thinking of himself surrounded by the outlaw hunt pulled down beneath those unyielding stone bodies he took the animals leadropeshyandur had unsaddled them while hed been fighting with the welland turned away child of the city and mageborn he might be but cilarnen knew something of caring for horses he was careful to let neither animal drink as much as it wished to and when they were done he brought them back to where hyandur had laid out a ground cloth and the brazier the elf was brewing tea indifferent to the stone hounds that waited beyond the border they had stopped attempting to batter their way through the boundary and now simply stood in a silent row gazing hungrily toward cilarnen eleven unmoving granite formsbut cilarnen had no doubt now that if he took one step back across the border they would rouse terrifyingly into life and the councils decreeits true its secret decreewould be carried out death for cilarnen volpiril but mages do not kill come stranger we will drink tea hyandur said then we will move on cilarnen wrapped the stiff felt of the felons cloak around himself i my name is cilarnen thank you for saving my life hyandur bowed his head slightly the outlaw hunt is a foul thing i would willingly leave no creature to its mercies perhaps someday we will talk of what caused you to leave the city cilarnen just shook his head he didnt want to talk about it or even think about it the farther away the events got the less sense they made to him all he knew was that people were dead and it was somehow his fault he didnt want to ask where the elf was taking him either he wasnt sure whether it was because he didnt care or was afraid of what he might hear the days after that passed in a numb haze for cilarnen they followed what hyandur said was the caravan road the mountain traders used though cilarnen couldnt imagine how the elf could see where the road was in the snow much less follow it he simply assumed it was some vile magic possessed by the lesser races he was always cold though the elf had gifted him with a heavier cloak and a pair of furlined gauntlets from his supplies cilarnen would have happily burned the felons cloak or at the very least abandoned it but hyandur had pointed out that his clothing was not suitable to the weather and the cloak was of sturdy fabric he had taken the cloak and crafted a pair of heavy leggings to lace over cilarnens trousers the heavy felt kept cilarnen dry and if the leggings were ugly he no longer cared what he looked like there was no one around who mattered to see his head hurt all the timea constant stabbing ache that the glare of sun on snow only worsened he kept the hood of the new fur cloak pulled down as far over his face as possible trying to shut out the light but it didnt help just when cilarnen began to think he would be riding through wilderness for the rest of his life they came to signs of civilization at least of a very primitive sort someone had built a wall out here in the middle of nowhere it was like a crude tiny imitation of the city though the wall was made of wood not stone as they approached the gates they swung open and a horseman rode out to meet them no not a horseman cilarnen swallowed hard recognizing the abominable mingling of man and beast as another of the lesser races one mentioned only in passing in his studies a centaur it wore human clothes upon his human half with a short cloak that came to its waist its horse half was shaggy with a heavy winter coat but hyandur greeted it as if it were a sentient being and even roiry and pearl did not shy away from the unnatural creature ho hyandurso the humans did not put you into a cage after all the centaur said switching its tail back and forth no grander they would not see me at all nor would they hear my words yet my journey was not accomplished without bearing some fruit as you see a human coltcityborn ill wager looks halfdead and halffrozen this is no weather for gallivanting grander said disapprovingly nevertheless hyandur said calmly i had no choice nor did cilarnen well stonehearth will see you both warm and fed this night at least grander said come both of youill see you housed in my own home with the best of everything that makes good hearing hyandur said we thank you for your hospitality hyandur dismounted and regarded cilarnen steadily until he had no choice but to do the same the prospect of a hot dinner made his stomach churn he wondered what centaurs ate hay babies when they passed through the gate he saw that there was an entire village crammed within its wallsalmost like one of the poorest quarters of armethalieh but with everything much smaller he expected the streets to be narrower too but they were wide and swept free of snow everyone cilarnen saw on the streets was a centaur all of them dressed much as grander was in tunics and short cloaks and wearing hoods or soft knitted caps it did not make them look more human it made them look as if someone were dressing up an animal for a play but cilarnen had no desire at all to see a naked centaur their horse parts were stocky and heavyboned like no horse he had ever seen some of the creatures had elaborately braided tails with ribbons or jewelry braided into the hair cilarnen tried not to look they reached what must be granders house a younger centaur appeared and led roiry and pearl away hot dinner for them too and a warm stable grander said cheerfully marlen can bring your packs to the house once he has them unsaddled there will be time for a bath before dinner i thinkand we should be able to find you houserobes hyandur smiled at that as if at a private joke the two of them shared granders house was built all on one level there was very little furniture inside though what there wasa few tableswas beautifully though simply made you know the way ill send marlen to you with the hot water as soon as its ready sarlin will bring you mulled ale i thank you for your courtesy to the weary traveler hyandur said come cilarnen the chamber at the back of the house was small by the standards cilarnen was used to it held a stove in one corner a clothespress for storing clothes a table and a washstand with basin and ewer there was no bed at all cilarnen stared around in confusion few who are not centaurs come to stonehearth hyandur said as if that were an explanation he removed his cloak and gloves and set them in the clothespress then turned to the stove as cilarnen stood in the middle of the room hesitating there was a tap at the door before he could make up his mind what to do it opened and another centaur walked in there was no doubt at all that this one was female all she wore was a thin woolen blouse heavily and colorfully embroidered she was as opulently female as the figurehead on a selken traders vessel and her long creamblonde hair exactly matched the color of her horsebody there were bright ribbons braided into her tail their colors matching the embroidery on her shirt in one hand she carried a large brightlycolored earthenware pitcher its contents steaming and in the other two wooden mugs flung across her back was a pile of cloth ah hyandur youll never get that balky thing to light she said cheerfully let meand drink up while the ales hot grander would never forgive me if i let you wait until it went cold then we must not allow you to fall into disgrace sarlin hyandur answered cilarnen realized with a distant sense of surprise that hyandur actually liked these creatures he considered them to be his friends well you could hardly expect better of an elf he supposed doubtfully sarlin walked past cilarnenwho was still staringand set the pitcher and mugs down on the table hyandur straightened up from his crouch before the stove and relieved her of the bundles of cloth tossing one to cilarnen it fell in a heap at his feet sarlin kneltwith more grace than cilarnen would have expectedbefore the stove and began to rummage purposefully about its interior hyandur moved to the table and poured two mugs full of the steaming ale he brought one to cilarnen drink and do not stare at her so shes granders daughter oh i dont mind a bit of staring sarlin said cheerfully over her shoulder but ill kick him into next harvest if he tries anything ive heard about those city sorcerers and their ways tried to drive us off our own lands they did ah thats got it she got to her feet closing the door of the stove and brushing her hands clean of ash im not a sorcerer cilarnen said very quietly he wasnt quite sure what that was but it sounded bad hes been outlawed hyandur said i believe they take away their magic when they do that oh sarlin turned to face cilarnen her broad inhuman features filled with sympathy did they do that to you how horrible if there had been any place to run to cilarnen would have gone there if hed still had his magegift and his wand he would have happily reduced both hyandur and sarlin to a pile of ash the one thing he was certain of was that he wasnt going to accept sympathy from a talking horseor the next best thing to one anyway he pulled off his gauntlets quickly took the mug and drank hed never tasted ale in his life and it was filled with unfamiliar spices but anything was better than having to answer her he gulped it down holding his breath to avoid tasting the foul bitter stuff and felt its heat fill his belly he hoped it poisoned him he doesnt talk much maybe hes simpleminded sarlin suggested perhaps hell talk later hyandur said she tossed her head well father will certainly want to hear all about what theyre planning to do next in the city so i hope he knows with another flirt of her tail she walked out again cilarnen rubbed his eyes with his free hand he felt very much as if he ought to sit down but there werent any chairs and the stove seemed to suddenly be putting out a great deal of heat he undid his cloak and let it fall to the floor as well then walked carefully over to the nearest wall and leaned against it you will find things very different here than your life in armethalieh hyandur said he seemed to be trying to tell cilarnen something but cilarnen wasnt sure what it was cilarnen slid carefully down the wall and sat on the floor he set his mug down on the floor beside him and pressed both hands against his face as hard as he could maybe the ale had poisoned him but his constant headache seemed to be going away just a little there arent any chairs he said it seemed particularly important that hyandur understand that fact you are not accustomed to strong drink the elf observed dispassionately mageborn do not drink cilarnen told him grandly it was what they told the commons after all the commons believed that the mageborn existed on nothing but air pure well water and communion with the light so the saying went but his power had been stripped from him and hed been cast out from the city could he even call himself mageborn any longer hyandur seemed to sigh and went to place cilarnens discarded cloak in the clothespress a few moments later marlen arrived bringing hyandurs packs he was not alone two more centaurs accompanied himone carrying a large copper tub and the other with his arms filled with towels and with two large kegs of steaming water slung across his back they deposited their burdens in front of the stove and left again if theres anything else you need just shout marlen said he glanced at cilarnen and frowned a healer or anything you are most kind as always hyandur said when marlen left hyandur drew the latch and began filling the tub by then cilarnen felt less dizzy in fact he felt better than he had since the city gates had closed behind him he got to his feet and walked over to the pitcher pouring himself a careful halfmug of the ale he knew about getting drunkthough his infrequentand unauthorizedexperiments had been with the wine from his fathers cellars and not with ale which in armethalieh was strictly something in which the commons indulged while he had no intention of getting drunk in the middle of a bunch of talking animals he liked being free of pain you dislike the taste yet you drink more of it hyandur remarked it makes my head stop hurting cilarnen said he didnt know why he felt the need to explain himself to hyandur but the creature had saved his life so he supposed he owed the elf common courtesy and your head has hurt for a long time since i left the city or before that i cant remember cilarnen raised the mug and drank the ale still tasted vile but he supposed hed better get used to it i have no skill in healing but the healer here is excellent perhaps she can craft a potion to ease your pain now we will bathe and eat perhaps that will help as well as he spoke hyandur was removing his clothing setting each piece neatly aside and cilarnen finally realized that hyandur not only intended to bathe but to bathe right in front of him he looked around desperately but there was still nowhere to go if he left the room hed be outside with a bunch of centaurs and that was unthinkable so he did the only thing he could think of he refilled his mug to the very top draining the jug and retreated to the far corner of the room by the time hed finished that mug as well everything had taken on a strange unreality it seemed perfectly reasonable to take off his own clothes at hyandurs insistence and climb into the cramped tub it felt good to be clean again after uncounted days of sleeping and waking in the same clothes and if the soap was harsh and foulsmelling in comparison to what he was used to it did its job when he climbed out again and toweled himself dry in front of the stove he put on the houserobe that sarlin had brought it was furlined and fell past his knees he still had to wear his own boots with it but that didnt seem so bad he was clean and maybe talking animals werent so bad after all cilarnen liked horses hyandur guided him carefully down to dinner afterward the dining table was as immense as anything that might be found in a great house and so high that cilarnen thought it was going to be rather difficult to eat at until he noticed two stools obviously placed for his and hyandurs use the food was what cilarnen supposed coarse peasant food must be like roasts and meatpies and hot bread and dishes of preserved vegetables all served without ceremonyand no one exhibited anything approaching proper table manners the tabletalk among the dozen or so centaurs gathered there was rowdy and entirely impoliteif grander was the patriarch of this peculiar family then he certainly didnt seem to care whether people showed him proper respect or not it only proved cilarnen supposed that the other races simply didnt have the same advantages as the inhabitants of the golden city though they did all seem to be enjoying themselves he felt something that wasnt exactly homesicknessas this was entirely outside his experiencebut he still felt as if hed lost something that he didnt have any words for and was only now discovering it the sensation frightened him but the food was hot and plentiful and grander kept encouraging him to eat more and for the first time since that dreadful night in the cellar when the stone golems had come for him and his friends cilarnen discovered that he actually had an appetite after what sarlin had said back in the room hed expected to be interrogated about the city and its plans but to his relief nobody asked him anything and tomorrow he and hyandur would be gone from this disturbing place after the meal was eaten hyandur suggested he go off to bed and cilarnen was glad enough to get away from the centaurs to accept the elfs suggestion readily even though it still bothered him when the elf gave him orders when he returned to the room he found that the baththings had been cleared away and two large piles of furs and blankets had been carefully laid out on the floor not proper beds but after having slept for so long on the frozen ground a soft pallet out of the wind and the snow seemed like paradise cilarnen chose the one nearest the window rolled himself up in a couple of blankets and was instantly asleep he awoke to the sunlight streaming through the slats of the shuttered windows and sat up groggily he looked around expecting to find hyandur still asleep on the other furs but hyandur was goneas were his packs and everything he had brought with him cilarnens own city clothes were thereclean and neatly folded he dressed quickly and ran from the room the first person he encountered was sarlin she was working on a piece of embroidery at a large standing frame good morrow cilarnen she greeted him cheerfully just as if nothing were wrong i he the elf hyandur where is he cilarnen gasped out sarlin looked faintly puzzled why he left at first light grander urged him to stay of course but he said he had news to carry that would not wait she regarded him for a moment surely you did not expect to go with him cilarnen stared at her in shock realizing that somewhere deep inside hed expected exactly that he left me here he said flatly well you couldnt expect him to take you into the elven lands now could you sarlin said as if it were the most reasonable thing in the world but he made sure that you would have a place in granders house he says you are good with horses you can work in the stables he said you wont know much but dont worry we can teach you come spring you can help with the plowingand at spring fair if you want to go to another village why no one will stop you what could be fairer marlen is even making you a chair hyandur said you like chairs she smiled encouragingly cilarnen took a deep breath as his world crumbled around him once more i can work in the stables in the spring i can help with the plowing he felt like screaming but he was a volpiril even here even now his father had taught him that it was important not to make enemies without cause and to be courteous to ones inferiors because they could not help being inferior of course lord volpiril had not meant those teachings to apply to lesser races but sarlin could not help being a centaur thank you he said though those were the hardest words hed ever had to say his headache was back full force making it hard to see he rubbed at his eyes wishing everything werent so bright come into the kitchen ill get you a bowl of porridgeim sure theres some left over from breakfast then ill take you to the healerhyandur said we should do that too then you can go to the stables and marlen can get you started on your work cilarnen nodded barely hearing her words it hardly mattered what these creatures did to him hyandur had left him here alone and now he truly knew what that word meant as far as vestakia could sense they were no longer even being followed and that made no sense to kellen why would shadow mountain go to so much trouble to kidnap sandalon and the other children and then not even try to recapture them it made no sense at alland that made kellen feel as if he was missing something important the storm blew over after a day or two and the weather cleared again and after that everyone could see ancaladar flying overhead the dragon was an aweinspiring sight kellen never grew tired of watching him as he dipped and swirled through the open sky he wondered what it would be like to ride upon ancaladars back to see the world from that great height he also wondered how much a dragon ate something that size certainly wouldnt be satisfied with a goat or two cows probably lots of cows once they were within a few hours of the city kellen decided it was safe enough to send messengers ahead to let the city know they were coming and that the children were safe and that theyd brought a dragon with them he hoped andoreniel and ashaniel would be willing to have him come and live in sentarshadeen theyd welcomed vestakia after all the caravan was met at the edge of the unicorn meadow by andoreniel ashaniel and many others including the parents of the rescued children the unicorn ridersincluding kellen and also vestakiawaited a little distance away from the main group watching the joyful reunions of parents and children he wanted to share their joyhe truly didbut it was as if there were a veil between him and the glad celebration taking place in front of him he knew that the presence of the shadowed elves was not yet general knowledge but by now everyone in sentarshadeen knew that the caravan taking the children to the fortress of the crowned horns had been attacked why didnt they see that the war had already beguna war of a different kind than any they had ever fought before youre just tired shalkan told him i dont have time to be tired kellen answered with a sigh he dismounted and stood in the snow beside his friend we have to make plansto get ready and dont ask me for what because i dont know that does make it harder to plan shalkan agreed leaning against him maybe thats the whole point kellen said glumly in twos and threes the others departed but kellen remained idalia was transferred to a small sleigh and taken off with vestakia and the two healers but jermayan did not go with her instead he rode over to where kellen and shalkan waited alone now in the snow i have spoken to andoreniel and ashaniel jermayan said without preamble they have said that ancaladar is welcome in sentarshadeen he glanced up at the sky but at the moment the dragon wasnt visible even when theyd reached sentarshadeen ancaladar hadnt landed kellen got the idea he wouldnt come down until he was invited good kellen said it would be nice to know how we can tell him hes coming shalkan said looking eastward both kellen and jermayan looked in the direction shalkan had indicated a tiny black dot was visible on the horizon it swiftly grew larger taking on the by now familiar dragon shape for the first time kellen was actually able to watch ancaladar land for something so large the dragon was surprisingly graceful when he was directly above them he simply spread his great wings as wide as they would go and floated to the ground valdien backed up nervously a few steps but jermayan patted his neck soothingly speaking to him in a low voice and the stallion quieted jermayan dismounted leading the elven destrier a little farther away from the dragon ancaladar settled neatly to the snow and folded his wings across his back so he said so jermayan answered gazing at the dragon and kellen had the odd sense that something was happening it was the elf ancaladar stared enraptured into dark eyes and felt the pull of longdormant instincts rousing here was his match here was the one who would be the conduit for his magic his hearts twin his bondmate to whom his life and his heart would be linked fly away fly away now a small voice inside him screamed there was still time to refuse the bond it could be done if he left now if he never saw jermayan again but he had lived so long alreadyseen his friends and comrades die in the great war and these children said that shadow mountain was rising against the lightfolk again hed seen proof of that he did not think he could bear to hide and cower and save his life while watching others die yet again he had been a coward and a failure once and on the journey here hed had a great deal of time to think about his choices and where they had led him and jermayan was young as the elvenkind reckoned years they would have centuries together no jermayan wrenched his gaze painfully away from the dragons golden eyes it was it was it was impossible he knew what he was feeling the elves had long lives and longer memories the hearttie that told them where true love lay was similar enough in kind so the historians told them to that bond between a dragon and his mage for jermayan to know what was happening he was not in love with ancaladar but they could bond an elf and a dragon impossible elves had no part in the greater magic there had not been an elven mage since the time of great queen vielissiar farcarinon dragons bonded with mageshuman magesbecause only through a mage could a dragon express its innate magic go away jermayan shouted desperately staggering backward jermayan ancaladar said i am useless to you jermayan said how is it that you do not understand that i am an elven knight you who are ancient and wise beyond the dreams of elves it would all be for nothing i am useless without you ancaladar said very softly you can learn i know you can in the first war we fought for you jermayan your magicelven magicwoke us out of the bones of the earth do you remember no jermayan said sounding desperate strange so strange that it would be he who was doing the urging now and not the elfknight he who had been a coward but he knew now that had been a choice rather than what he truly was as this was a choice but this choice led away from failure and toward bravery he would not run anymore war is coming ancaladar said a thousand years ago while i cowered and hid my brothers fought and died i heard them weep as they went with their bonded to serve the demons i felt the others die in the light as their bonded died i cannot watch that again this time i must fight but i cannot fight alone kellen stood beside shalkan watching ancaladar and jermayan in amazement do you know whats going on he whispered to the unicorn ancaladar and jermayan can bond shalkan answered in equally low tones if jermayan accepts hell become the first elven mage sinceoh before the dawn of human civilization oh kellen said but he could refuse theres always a choice shalkan said you had one when you decided to become a knightmage jermayan hesitated clutching the hilt of his sword so tightly his gauntlet creaked with all his heart he yearned to look up to meet ancaladars eyes to let the bond form but to become a mage a wielder of the great magics the golden eyes darkened and jermayan felt the sadness the deep inexpressible sadness he had been the one feeling that sorrow not so long ago when idalia had refused the gift of his heart now it was apparently his turn to inflict that torture on another i will go ancaladar said softly you will not see me again the packed snow beneath his body groaned as he shifted his weight preparing to take off again no no he could not do that to another living creature especially not this one and not now jermayan raised his head and met the dragons golden gaze it was warmth and spring sunlight it was the wind in the trees at high summer and the deep song of life that underlay all things and he knew that even as he looked into ancaladars soul ancaladar was looking into his jermayan took a step forward and then another ancaladar stretched out his long neck and jermayan laid his hand very gently against the side of ancaladars face he is mine and i am his and we shall be one and together for the rest of our life the following day kellen made his report to the elven council it was a frustrating experience since he realized very quickly that nobody wished to hear his assessment of the situation or what it might mean for the future they only wished to know where hed gone what hed done and what hed seen he wished idalia were here to help him figure out what to say but she was still with the healers and they werent letting anyone in to see her yet he would have liked jermayan to be here toobut jermayan was with ancaladar and would be meeting with the council later to explainas well as the matter could be explainedwhat his becoming an elven mage meant to sentarshadeen kellen had never felt more like an errand boy in his life and tried not to show his frustration he knew the elves were capable of quick and decisive action when they felt circumstances warranted it he knew he had friends and allies on the council the elves were not his enemies but the elves did not hurry idalia had told him that over and over and kellen was very much afraid thatthis timea lack of hurry was going to cost them in ways he couldnt yet put a name to the next day he was finally allowed to see idalia the healing house was within the house of leaf and star though to enter it one came and went by a different entrance than the one kellen was used to using when he visited sandalon or his parents it was the most peaceful place he had ever imagined if something could be the utter opposite of the black cairn this was it just walking into the entry hall made all of his everyday worries seem as if they were simple problems that could be easily dealt with an elf in the simple leafgreen robes of a healer appeared almost instantly and brought him to idalias room he saw no one elsethough he knew that all of the children were here he was not surprised to see that jermayan was already here sitting beside idalias bedside she was sitting up propped among a welter of colorful pillows a table with a halffinished xaqiue game stood at the bedside and there was a pot with teacups nearby on another low table idalias cheeks were flushed with color and she no longer looked exhausted to the point of death oh good youre here idalia said as soon as she saw him now you can tell them im fine and im ready to leave kellen glanced at jermayan but the elfs face remained studiously blank im not arguing with elves kellen said sitting down in a chair at the opposite side of her bed from jermayan if youre feeling well enough to leave you can argue with them idalia snorted rudely have you ever tried arguing with the healers kellen laughed not with the healersbut i spent yesterday morning arguing with the councilat least i think thats what i was doingand i didnt get very far you did however make something of an impression jermayan said pouring tea and handing a cup to kellen across the bed thanks to the elven small magics the tea was still hot and kellen sipped it gratefully well id love to know what it was youd have thought i was discussing the weather instead of the fact that shadow mountains managed to stick a whole race of things smack in the middle of the elven lands where they can pretty much do what they like theyre aware of that jermayan said broodingly and they understand it is a grave threat especially since the shadowed elves can grant safe passage into the heart of our realm to creatures who are truly of the shadow as we have learned to our cost though the landwards detect such as they once they walk upon the surface of the land our borders are not secure we must return to the enclave vestakia discovered and destroy it you cant assume its the only one either kellen said it was the first truth of war that master belesharon had taught him never underestimate an enemys strength and resources no jermayan agreed with vestakias help we must search out and destroy them all time that will take time time to find each enclave of the shadowed elves time to fight the battles time to search the whole of the elven lands and we only have vestakia to help us do it and what will the demons be doing while we do that and what then kellen asked when its all done both idalia and jermayan were looking at him as if they didnt understand but to kellen it was as if a story were unfurling itself in his mind almost as if he were remembering one of master belesharons old teaching tales but this wasnt something old this was something new something yet to happen when all the shadowed elves are gone kellen repeated patiently what then he only realized then that hed asked a questionbad manners here and rephrased it tell me what will happen nextand what the true enemy will be doing while we destroy the shadowed elves idalia smiled faintly kellen it will probably take a very long time to be sure weve gotten all of them maybe years but we dont have years kellen said he gestured at the xaqiue board the council thinks we do shadow mountain puts up a barrier to starve the elven lands of water we knock it down we expect them to attack thenthough maybe after a very long time but they dont they show us something we have to attack the shadowed elves im not saying we dont theyre a threat and if we dont destroy them they will be used against us but cant you see it we didnt find out about them by accident they were shown to us its like a xaqiue game well commit our forces well go after them well probably destroy them and then there will be something else their main attack jermayan said but we will have already gathered our army together we will defeat them once again just as we did before though i do not deny that the cost will be high no kellen said he wasnt sure where the sense of certainty came from but hed never been surer of anything in his life dont you get it jermayan theyre never going to attacknot this time thats what you expect because thats what they did the last time thats what andoreniel and ashaniel are going to wait fora big massing of enemy troops a formal declaration of war and it wont happen for a moment he almost thought hed convinced jermayan more than anyone else in sentarshadeen jermayan knew him as a knightmage and knew what he was capable ofthis instinctive understanding of war and how it worked the more he trained with master belesharonthe more actual fighting he sawthe more kellen realized just how his particular wild magic gifts worked but then jermayan shook his head kellen i do not say that you are wrong but no matter what they plan we must eliminate the shadowed elves first even now andoreniel sends word not only to the nine cities but to our allies as well invoking ancient treaties as soon as the children are safeonce i have persuaded ancaladar to take them to the crowned hornswe go to muster at ondoladeshiron to fight in winter is hard but he thought it best not to wait for spring well at least hed convinced the council of that much kellen thought but it wasnt enough he knew that even though he didnt knowyetwhat was enough im going with you idalia said a dangerous note in her voice such an army cannot be gathered overnight jermayan said reassuringly i am certain that the healers will release you by the time we are ready to depart and i will be grateful for the counsel of a fellow mage idalia reached out and clasped his hand i know that bonding with ancaladar wasnt exactly what you expected she said gently nothing about my life has been as i expected it would be jermayan said fervently yet i would change nothing he said gazing deeply into her eyes i think ill see you both later kellen said getting quickly to his feet he set his empty cup down on the nearest flat surface and backed hastily out of the room he doubted either of them noticed the first person he ran into on his way out was vestakia and to his surprise she was also wearing a green healers robe apparently there are things i can do besides herd goats she said cheerfully noticing his startled expression hows idalia she and jermayan are fine kellen said surprised at how disgruntled he sounded and ancaladar vestakia asked apparently not noticing kellens mood at all fine i suppose i havent seen him at all since well you know oh hes found a nice place to live up in the meadows back beyond the house of sword and shield very private so he isnt bothered too much by people who just want to stare at him and much happier he says not having to spend all his time hunting his dinner he says he much prefers the nice fat sheep and cows jermayan is providing for him are you terribly busy right now by any chance i ought to be at the house of sword and shield myself catching up on all the lessons ive missed kellen said cautiously but no then come and see sandalon vestakia said as briskly as as any nurse all the children would like to see you come to thatand to hear about ancaladar the children were gathered together in a bright lightfilled room filled with toys and books sitting quietly in one corner was an elven healer her hair the silveryblue of great age even alkandoran was there the elven boy greeted kellen with a wary smile he looked holloweyed and unhappy and kellen felt a deep pang of sympathy alkandoran was still a child by elven standards but old enough to think of himself as an adult hed known better than any of the other children the true extent of the horrors theyd faced but from what lairamo had said without his calm steadiness during their captivity things might have gone much worse kellen smiled back and reached out and touched him lightly on the shoulder you did well he said quietly you did all there was to do and you did it well the boys troubled expression eased just a little kellen sandalon launched himself at kellen did you see the dragon is jermayani mean one hears that one hears that a dragonhis name is ancaladarhas come to live in sentarshadeen and has bonded to jermayan and so now jermayan is going to become an elven mage just like great queen vielissiar farcarinon perhaps father will not mind if he is not king any longer sandalon said with a small frown what oh no sandalon andoreniel will still be king jermayan will just be a mage i dont think jermayan would like to be king i dont think jermayan wants to be a mage either but he doesnt have much choice there oh sandalons frown cleared thats all right then perhaps you have come to tell us stories vendalton said hopefully sidling closer about jermayan and the dragon of course he has merisashendiel said firmly nobody tells us anything here she dragged over a low stool for kellen to sit on and the other children all picked up cushions and arranged them so that they were all sitting in a circle at kellens feet they all regarded him expectantly for a moment he had no idea what to say but then all the teaching stories he had heard so many times at the house of sword and shield came back to him i will begin by describing dragons and their natures he said feeling for one odd moment as if he were back at the mage college of armethaliehas a teacher this time instead of as a student and then i will tell you how i met ancaladar he spent most of the afternoon telling the children tales letting them guide him in what they wanted to hear he was surprised to find that what they wanted to hear about most was the story of their rescuewho had come for them and how they had been tracked who had actually found them and what it had been like down in the caverns since the healer in the room did nothing to interfere though kellen watched her closely he answered all their questions as well as he couldthough always keeping in mind the ages of his audience but the evil creatures are far away and can never find this place tredianala said no kellen said firmly and soon you are going to the fortressin a safe way a way that nothing bad can possibly happen to you he had no doubt of jermayans ability to eventually persuade ancaladar to carry the children to the fortress of the crowned hornsif stubborn as an elf wasnt a proverb it ought to be but not by caravan merisashendiel said she looked up at him with pleading in her gaze and a hint of a shiver how you will go kellen said firmly is a surpriseand a nice one so im not going to spoil it eventually vestakia came in announcing it was time for the children to take their medicine and their naps kellen feeling quite as tired as if hed spent the last several hours in practice bouts at the house of sword and shield got to his feet and headed for the front door the aged elven healer followed him out that was well done of you knightmage she said simply huh me kellen said surprised turning to look at her she smiled faintly there is nothing children fear so much as the unknown but now there is no longer anything mysterious to them about their ordeal now all their terrors can become nothing more than a strange adventurea frightening one perhaps but the fear will fade with time fare you well kellen knightmage um thanks hed helped it felt very odd almost as if hed done a healing but not quite hed gone through so much of his life trying not to be noticedand trying not to notice everything around him finding the three books had forced him to change it had hurt at first it had driven him out of the city but here it didnt hurt at all in fact it felt good it would make things so much easier jermayan said reasonably reason however did not seem to make as much impression on a dragon as he might have hoped i am not a horse the land beyond the house of sword and shield was a series of pocket canyons similar to those that made up the city of sentarshadeen itself though these had been allowed to remain in their natural state the horses had adjusted to the intruder in their pasturage easily enough ancaladar had agreed not to bother themhis tastes he assured jermayan ran to fat cattle and tasty sheep even pigs and goats in sufficient quantity fortunately jermayan was wealthy enough to provide for ancaladars needsthough the dragon did not need to eat every day he enjoyed doing so when the opportunity was provided so each morning jermayan led or herded ancaladars breakfast up to his new home ancaladar had found a canyon that suited hima relatively small one andwith jermayans helproofed it over using those trees from the forest that had not survived the great drought it was a crude shelter but effective and the dragon said it was comfortable enough come springassuming the time and labor were availablea more permanent and pleasing roof could be added to the canyon and perhaps even a doorway of sorts constructed a new caravan would take a sennightperhaps two in this weatherto reach the fortress of the crowned horns it would be vulnerable to another attack idalia is still recovering from her injuries and tracking the creatures last time took a great toll on vestakia she is still not fully recovered and each time she ventures forth from sentarshadeen she is at risk she is a great prize for them jermayan said i am still not a horse ancaladar said stretching his head out so that jermayan could rub the sensitive places just behind the eye sockets on the massive head jermayan had already learned that ancaladar liked that the children would be frightened jermayan said after several minutes of silence to go again the way they did before spending days upon the road wondering each day if they are to be attacked again to see their friends and companions slain before their eyes by monsters out of nightmare i am afraid that such a journey would only undo what little healing has been accomplished jermayan thought he knew ancaladars weak pointthat he had been slowly deprived of nestmates and companions until he found himself alone those poor childrento know that their friends and their own kin were slain and they were helpless to prevent it and then to wake in the darkness and discover that they were all alone you can be truly annoying sometimes ancaladar grumbled he thought for a while while jermayan walked forward a few steps and transferred his attentions to the soft skin just behind the armored plates at the hinge of ancaladars jaw if i did not know better i would say this was an attempt to distract me from your lessons in magery i would say that i dislike them nearly as much as you dislike my plan jermayan said with a sigh what he learned from ancaladar didnt seem to be very much like the wild magic as kellen and idalia knew it he knew about the obligations and mageprices involved there but in bonding with a dragon all prices were paid by the bond the dragon surrendered its immortality and all prices were paid in full forever nor was it anything like the high magick practiced in armethalieh the elves knew something of that there had been hints gathered over the centuries that the elves had traded with the golden city and jermayan had pieced together a little more from the few disparaging comments hed heard kellen make elaborate incantations complicated equipment no to use ancaladars magic all jermayan needed was his will each spell had a specific shape and color and tastethere was no better way to describe it he had to hold the proper one in his mind and let ancaladars power pour through him like sunlight through a crystal spells for fire for ice for darkness for invisibility for flight thousands upon thousands of them like trays of jewels and all he had to do jermayan thought wearily was remember each unnameable colorshape perfectly and always select the right one at least ancaladar was only putting a few of them into his mind at a time though the dragon insisted he was only helping jermayan remember them according to ancaladar if jermayan hadnt known them already they never could have bonded it was something jermayan preferred not to think about elves were not mages humans were mages demonsleaf and star wither and blast them were mages elves were not elves had given up their magic long ago in the childhood of the world they had done so in order to save the world and the lightbut that was something that was not spoken of outside of the sanctuary of the star humans and other races were not to know of this he was not certain that even a dragon should be told then again he was not certain that a dragon didnt already know then if you will practice i will take your children to the fortress ancaladar said sounding both resigned and amused but you know i cannot land there it was built when your kind had reason to fear dragons andoreniel will send a message we will land at the foot of the causeway i think the children will be safe there for as long as it takes to get them inside with what you have learned certainly andoreniel said and now practice make a flower jermayan stared at the snow doubtfully the canes are there beneath the snow they slumber wake one ancaladar said it will freeze and die jermayan said shaking his head then change them ancaladar said implacably make flowers for the cold as clearly as if a voice had spoken inside his head jermayan could see what to do he reached and out of the snow beneath his feet tender green rosecanes began to shoot up out of the snow growing with unnatural speed but that wasnt enough roses were flowers for summer they would die in the cold he reached into them again and began to change them even as they reached out toward the icecovered walls of the canyon and began to twine and climb the pale green faded to the dark green of the mature plant then faded further into black but not the black of death the black of a different kind of life the green leaves turned pale silver they still had the shape of rose leaves but now were much larger and thicker sized to take in all the pale winter sunlight they could and protect their fragile blossoms from the snow and ice the roses that had bloomed large and deep red a moment before fell from the twining vines in a shower of silken petals replaced by tiny perfect white blossoms the size of jermayans thumbnail they covered the nowdense vines like tiny stars jermayan staggered back leaning into ancaladar as the spell ran its course the jewel shapes faded from his mind and the rapid growth of the ice roses slowed see the dragon said roses in winter when the weather warms they will die back but in the cold season they will bloom again you have shaped a new thing proper magic for a dragon and his bondmate you made me do that jermayan felt like saying but he didnt only the power had come from ancaladar he had made the roses they were beautiful they were harmless there was nothing threatening about them he didnt know why they disturbed him so youll have to wear some sort of harness when you carry the children he said aloud we dont want them to fall off ancaladar blew out a long gusty breath now call fire he said not answering directly its important and useful and you need more practice a lot more practice chapter twelve to the crowned horns of the moon calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink it took a fortnight to make a proper set of harness for ancaladar the dragon grumbled quite a bit about it but seemed in the end actually pleased with the results then again it was elven workmanship which was never less than spectacular he did not look like a pack mule as he claimed as a matter of fact he looked as if he had been fitted for a splendid costume of black leather and shining sapphireenameled metal and there was no doubt in anyones mind that the dragon was inordinately pleased with his appearance idalia left the house of healing after only a few days more but she went to jermayans house to live not back to the home shed shared with kellen it was as if jermayans bond with ancaladar had eased some unshareable burden shed been carryingor perhaps it was only that having come so close to death she now realized that there were things in life that should not be delayed her departure left kellen alone in the house theyd shared but not for long within a day of idalias departure kellen discovered he had mysteriously acquired an assistant one vertai whose business it seemed to be to keep kellens wardrobe in order the larder stocked simple meals available and everything generally as tidyor even more sothan when kellen had shared the place with idalia where this fellow had come from kellen had no idea he was certainly more efficient and a lot more pleasant than any of the tavadon servants had ever been in part this might have been because kellen rarely saw vertai once hed granted the man permission to come and go as he pleasedafter consulting jermayan who seemed to think it was a good ideavertai seemed to do all his work while kellen was at the house of sword and shield it was like having a completely invisible servant and one who managed to anticipate everything kellen could have thought of kellen had thrown himself back into his interrupted training with a vengeance he knew that all around him important things were happeningjermayan was learning magic idalia was creating weapons for the upcoming campaign against the shadowed elves andoreniel was calling up his allies and gathering the elven army for the assault on the first of the enclaves of the shadowed elvesbut nobody was telling him about them directly or even asking him what he thought about them hed just been shunted aside as if his opinion wasnt worth anything was it arrogant of him to think otherwise should he really have a place on the elven council setting policy for the nine cities he knew he didnt want that trying to think like the elvestrying to talk like the elveswould drive him crazy within a sennight maybe less but still it doesnt matter kellen told himself fiercely standing alone in the great hall of the house of sword and shield practicing what master belesharon called the simple forms until his muscles ached and his tunic and leggings were plastered to his body with sweat they wont listen to you whether youre right or not jermayan wouldnt listen to you and the shadowed elves do have to be destroyed its just that we cant be concentrating on nothing except that shadow mountain is being a lot smarter now this is a diversion its an important diversion but its only a diversion i have to find a way to make them listen and i have to figure out what shadow mountains real plan is without thinking he broke form and spun around his sword raised to block master belesharon was standing behind him his teaching staff raised to deliver an admonitory blow to an inattentive student you seemed lost in thought young kellen master belesharon said mildly i was kellen said smiling wolfishly but not so lost in thought that his master could catch him out as if he were a novice master belesharon smiled in turn come bathe take tea when they were both immersed in the deep tub of the bathhousekellen no longer even noticed having to walk through the snow to get to and from it and a younger student had poured them both cups of dark fragrant tea master belesharon broached his point with the unusual directness that kellen had come to believe was a privilege of age among the elvenkind soon you will hear young kellen that hyandur the trader has returned to sentarshadeen as you know it was thought appropriate that he approach the city of a thousand bells to bring them warning that the shadow walks the hills once more kellen considered all the appropriate things he could say considering what he knew about armethalieh and what the high council thought about elves i am pleased to hear that he has returned safely he said at last doubtless this is because he was never permitted to enter the city nor to deliver his message master belesharon said his voice neutral the city of your birth remains unwarned and has promised death to any of our kind that approaches its walls again that makes perfect sense because theyre idiots i thank you for telling me this master kellen said even though the water of the bathhouse tub was as hot as he could standhot enough to soothe away all the aches and bruises of a days hard traininghe felt his muscles tense beneath the scented water any mention of armethalieh was like poking at a sore tooth hyandur said further that the city of a thousand bells begins to expand its borders once more they had reclaimed the delfier valley as he left perhaps they will attempt to reclaim more land he believes there had been unrest in the city before he came and it seemed to be of a serious nature two were banished that he knows of perhaps more he warned those villages he passed on his way here of the citys plans word will spread wonderful kellen said with a sigh he wondered what had changed on the council the last time idalia had scryed and gotten a view of the armethaliehan council chambers lord volpiril had pulled the city boundaries all the way back to the city walls at least it will take them time to reclaim all their old lands time and energy and they hate all the other racesim sorry masterso at least we can be sure theres no way theyll ally themselves with them and i dont think one of them could get into armethalieh anyway even if it made itself look like a human armethaliehs not a very nice place but its still the city of mages there are wards everywhere no one who isnt a citizen can pass them so if they will not aid us at least they will not give aid to the enemy master belesharon said unfortunate but not the worst that could happen i suppose not kellen said but something in his own words made him feel uneasy he ducked his head under the surface of the water dousing himself thoroughly and came up sweeping his hair back out of his eyes i suppose id better go and make sure idalia knows maybe shell be able to guess more of their plans the ice storms were long past and though the winter snows were heavy the streets were kept clear enough so that walkingat least in cleated snow boots wasnt difficult getting off the streets nowthat meant wading through snow that was up to the knees at least and sometimes waistdeep but kellen didnt have to do that nearly as often as jermayan did ancaladar was rather diffident about coming down into sentarshadeen where his appearance still rattled some of the inhabitants by now kellen had been to jermayans house at the forest edge many times he admired it while having no desire to possess anything like it hed grown up in one of the most intimidating mansions in the largest city in the world and even though jermayans cottage could probably have fit comfortably in the suite of rooms kellen had possessed in house tavadon it was still more room than kellen wanted for himself kellen crossed the arching footbridgecarefully as the slatted wood was icy and slickand approached the house it was still too early for lanternlighting time though the lanterns stood ready and waiting and he noted that the seashells that had hung outside the door the last time hed been here had been replaced with a set in the shape of golden flames he wondered why it might be a reflection of the seasons the lanterns outside his own house had also been changed while he was gone and were now pale blue he knocked at the door after a moment idalia opened it home and hearth she said cheerfully the shortened form of the standard elven greeting come in kellenyou look halffrozen though if youve come to see jermayan hes with ancaladar you know i think he has finally met his match in stubbornness kellen grinned faintly at the thought knowing jermayan as he did he doubted it no kellen said stepping inside and immediately sitting down to remove his outdoor boots and heavy cloak i came to see you well here i am ill get you some mulled cider im sure vertai isnt feeding you enough hes doing fine im doing fine he tried to think of a good way to lead into what he wanted to say gave up and just launched into it hyandur got back from armethalieh today he said following idalia into the kitchen oh yes id heard that rescued a banished mageborn boy and dumped him in the first centaur village he came to she looked over her shoulder at him briefly then went on with her work well i cant say ill weep any tears for him whoever he is im sure itll do him good to live among ah lesser races kellen smiled at the small joke trust idalia to have the gossip as fast as anyone why was he banished kellen asked did you hear that i dont think hyandur knew maybe the boy didnt know either you know what the councils like kellen especially now her voice took on a flippant tone he probably didnt return his books to the library on time she took a jug of cider from the stove where it was warming and poured a mug full pushing it toward him theyre extending the boundaries of the city lands again too kellen said drinking back to the old places good news for the home farms anyway theres something to be said for getting their old weather protections back mmm idalia said that probably means a shift in power in the council ill try scrying tomorrow and see if i get anything but you know scrying isnt very reliable ive been hoping to use it to help vestakia find the enclaves of the shadowed elves but im not sure ill have much luck there either maybe jermayan should try kellen suggested with a halfsmile oh dont say that to him idalia begged hes like a bear with a sore tooth on that particular subject and i thought you were a difficult student i wasnt kellen protested stung you were brother mine idalia assured him of course i was trying to teach you all the wrong things in all the wrong waysneither of our faultsbut still still kellen admitted giving in so was that what you came to tell me idalia prompted i suppose kellen admitted and to see if you knew anything more i wish hyandur had brought the boy with him we could have found out what he knew and how much did you know about what was really going on in the city on the day you were banished idalia asked smiling gently to take the sting from her words besidesour presence to the contrarythe elves dont permit just anyone into their realm he wasnt a wildmage kellen if thats what youre thinking hyandur would have known that and wildmages have always had safe passage through the elven lands and the centaurs wont be unkind to him theyll just knock some sense into him i wish i could be there to see that kellen said with a faint grin holding out his mug for a refill i wonder which of the spoiled brats he was i probably knew himor of him i cant think of anyone that id feel sorry to see having to work for his keep in a centaur village actually its the centaurs i feel sorry for anyway weve tried to warn the city and it cant be done idalia said briskly and hyandur carried the message about them to every place he passed its winter so the news wouldnt normally have traveled fastbut now that andoreniel is calling up his levies everyones going to know and soon she looked off over his shoulder for a moment maybeif they havent closed the city to all outsiderswe can get the selken traders to carry them the news once the harbors are open again in the spring if we can spare a messenger he had wondered about that and that made him think of something else everyone keeps talking about levies kellen said but just what are they well we leave for ondoladeshiron in a sennight youll see some of them there though most of those who can gather that quickly are elves but centaurs of course the unicornsnot just the ones that live among elves but the great herds the wildmages will come other wildmages kellen broke in surprised of course idalia said did you think we were the only ones andlet me seethe mountain folk will come early since they have no crops to tend the lost lands folk will come next for they must put their herds in order before they can comebut they will come as fast as they can for as vestakia has told us they have been bearing the brunt of the demon raids the wildlanders will come last for they must get a crop in the ground before they can send troops we will not see them before late spring and such otherfolk as can aid usthey will be with us as well so many kellen marveled i do not know since i havent seen them yet but i suspect that all the humans the elves will be able to call to their banners could be tucked safely behind the walls of armethaliehif it were empty of coursewith plenty of room left over not so very many then after all kellen didnt know how many centaurs there were and though the elves were formidable fighters it had onlyonly been a thousand years since the great war and he knew from things master belesharon had said that the elven population had suffered heavily during the great war and not yet reached its former numbers none of the races had several of them had been wiped out entirely the watersylphs the bearwards the minotaurs the firesprites the dragons were nearly extinctancaladar thought there might be others somewhere who like him had hidden and refused to bond how many though he could not even guess they had avoided even each other only a bonded dragon was fertile kellen had discovered and unless they could somehow coax a female dragonif there were any leftout of hiding and into a bond the dragons might as well be extinct humankind was reduced to a few thousands scattered over the land in farflung villagesand the inhabitants of the golden city home to tens of thousands cowering behind their walls and their tyrannical laws the great centaur tribes were a shadow of what they once had been the allies had spent everything they had to defeat the shadow in the great warhad turned thousands of leagues of fertile fields and forest to stony waste where nothing grew even now and counted themselves lucky because they had defeated the shadow only the shadow hadnt been defeated it has to be enough kellen said bleakly it will be idalia said firmly after all we have a dragon as if that were a summons they heard the outer door open and close ah idalia said the elven mage has returned kellen felt a strange tickle of unfamiliar magicdragon magic made his nose itchand knew that jermayan must have been working with ancaladar again practicing sorcery he set down his halffull mug and went with idalia to greet his friend ah kellen jermayan said seeing that idalia was not alone it is good to find you here jermayan looked both cold and exhausted perhaps things would be easier in the spring but now in the cold of winter it was hard on him you look frozen kellen said with sympathy i am assured thatwith timei can construct a suitable hall for our work once i have mastered the appropriate skills jermayan said wryly noting their concern however by the time i have mastered them the need for such a hall will have passed he sighed and sat down on one of the long padded benches that lined the sitting room meanwhile i call fire to burn upon the ice he gazed down at his hands broodingly fires supposed to be easy kellen said tentatively it was the first spell a student apprentice of the high magick learned back in armethalieh the first spell in the books of the wild magic light a candle call flame to tinder but jermayan was talking about kindling a fire on the ice how was that possible idalia returned from the kitchen and set a cup of tea in his hand you do what you have to jermayan she said and having worked as hard as any apprentice in the house of sword and shield jermayan said smiling faintly i have reconciled ancaladar to necessity tomorrow we fly to the fortress of the crowned horns i would be honored if you would accompany us kellen who me kellen thought wonderingly the children will be reassured by your presence so vestakia assures me jermayan explained and i thought perhaps you would find profit in seeing our greatest fortress elveseven jermayanrarely did anything directly kellen knew that though this was partly meant to reassure him as to the extent of elven military strength it was also meant as a subtle rebuke for his criticism of elven strategy earlier still he wasnt going to turn down the chance to ride a dragon and he did want to see the crowned horns because they say it cant be taken by direct assault and im sure theyre right and im just as sure that whatever shadow mountain is planning it isnt a direct assault i thank you for this great honor kellen said in his best courtly style and i just know that ancaladar will be thrilled at the thought of having another passenger dress warmly jermayan warned him ancaladar says that the skies are colder than snow the following day ancaladar came to the unicorn meadow to take the children to the fortress of the crowned horns the day was raw and overcast but the clouds were high and no storm beckoned as kellen had seen in his vision of the great war when dragon fought dragon in the skies above an endarkened battlefield there was a saddle at the base of ancaladars neck where jermayan would ride kellen would ride behind him there but for the others different arrangements had needed to be made straps affixed a series of baskets to ancaladars massive sides eight of them for the five children lairamo and two companions sand was added to some of the baskets so that each one weighed exactly the same because balanceso ancaladar had explainedwas the most important thing the children were all muffled warmly in furs and then strapped firmly into their baskets so that even if ancaladar chose to fly upsidedown which he assured both kellen and jermayan he had no intention of doing there was no possibility of the children falling out it took ladders to get them into the baskets but at the other end jermayan would simply have to walk down ancaladars back to free them if all went well and a trip that would take sennights on the ground would be compressed into less than a day though for the childrensand their parentssake kellen behaved as though this were the most ordinary thing in the world he couldnt help feeling a sinking sense of apprehension as he climbed up ancaladars side and took his place behind jermayan there was a belt there fastened to ancaladars harness and he saw that jermayan already wore a similar belt buckled tightly around him well if it was good enough for jermayan he strapped himself down and looked over ancaladars shoulder toward the ground it was like sitting on the roof of a threestory house only houses didnt take flight and soar into the sky he knew hed done far more dangerous things in his lifeand more painful ones too but not only did this seem to be unnervingly unnatural it roused the memories of buried ghosts ghosts hundreds of generations in the past but also of one particular ghost who had also borne the name kellen and who had fought for the dark bonded to a dragon before he could follow those bleak thoughts any further ancaladar reared up on his hind legs kellen heard the children squeal in pleased excitement hold on ancaladar said quietly he spread his great wings with a snap like sails filling with wind he sprang into the air slashed downhardwith his wings once then again it reminded kellenalmostof riding shalkan when the unicorn was running allout that bounding gait that involved moments of weightlessness and jarring landings only here there were no landings only moments of weightless falling before the dragons great wings bit into the air again kellen closed his eyes tightly by the time he could bring himself to open them again ancaladar was moving smoothly and the ground was hundreds of feet below he looked back over his shoulder and could barely see the green of the everblooming flower forest the individual buildings of sentarshadeenwell hidden even from the groundwere invisible comfortable jermayan asked kellen realized after a moment that the question was directed to ancaladar nothing binding you anywhere i hope not bad but dont make a habit of this the dragon replied he tilted a wingtip slightly and they began a long curving upward spiral taking them even higher into the sky soon they were in the clouds themselves wet mist covered kellens face and he could barely see anything at all then they were above the clouds flying in the sunlight it was just as cold as ancaladar had promised the mistdroplets turned to ice crystals on kellens facehis only exposed skinand the sheer dry cold took his breath away the clouds below thembelow themlooked as solid as a snowfield shining whitely in the sun and the sunlight itself was bright and harsh there was no sound save the whistling of the wind over ancaladars body and the occasional squeals and outcries of delight from the children kellen was glad they were so firmly strapped in to their carryingbaskets it would be far too tempting for the more audacious of them to try to climb out and take a closer look at this wonderland of sun and clouds his fear of flying was forgotten he didnt even notice the cold he wished this wonderful experience could last forever nownow he envied jermayan if this was the sort of thing that the elven knight was going to get to experience all the time as they continued north and west he could see the peaks of the higher mountains poking up through the clouds the only thing that would make it better would be if he could see the ground below he was mageborn and had lived with magic all of his life but this was the most magical moment of his life too soon ancaladar began to descend flying into snow and buffeting winds as they entered the realm of mountain storms the ride now was much rougher as the dragon glided from side to side riding on the winds and tacking from side to side instead of fighting them directly now kellen could see trees below and had some way to judge their speed and it was faster than anything he could have ever imagined no wonder the elves had wanted to send the children this way almost there jermayan said i am tired of snow ancaladar complained swerving again in response to a particularly prankish gust of wind what it does to the wind and thermals is simply disgusting its winter jermayan said soothingly and a particularly bad one by next year the weather patterns should be back to normal well hope andoreniels message got through then with your weather and all i have no desire to be shot at ancaladar grumbled but kellen could tell his complaining was merely a kind of bantering between the dragon and jermayan the bond between jermayan and ancaladar was something he could not even imaginefar closer than his relationship with shalkanand words seemed almost unnecessary to it even through the snow kellen could see the fortress up ahead at first it seemed merely an unusual outcropping then he recognized the forms of elven buildingand then they seemed to be rushing at it at such a speed that there was no chance they could avoid hitting it then the dragon tilted a wing and suddenly the fortress was passing under them in a dizzying exhilarating panorama ancaladar circled it once and then landed at the foot of the causeway a party of defenders was already waiting there for the children kellen unbuckled the belt and pushed himself free of the saddle surprised at how stiff he felt and immediately slipped off ancaladars back to fall sprawling in the deep denselypacked snow for ancaladars scales were covered in ice jermayan naturally fared much betterno matter how much and how hard kellen trained jermayan was an elf with all the elves natural grace jermayan walked neatly down ancaladars back cutting the straps that buckled the children into the basketsfor unbuckling the straps would take time and everyone knew that here they were vulnerable if the enemy wished to strike but kellen had a hunch they wouldnt at least not today all the elven children of the nine cities were here nowfor as hed heard recently word of the attack on sandalons caravan had not reached the other elven cities in time and the last of the children had been dispatched to the fortress on the original schedule and reached their destination safely more than ever now kellen was sure that the whole point of the attack had been to show them the shadowed elves and nothing else kellen clambered up out of the snow in time to help with the last couple of baskets and then set to work on the other needful task cutting away the basket harness from ancaladars body it had done its work and was no longer necessary now only the saddle on the dragons neck would remain and the riding harness that held it there by the time he looked up from that the children and those who had waited to greet them were gone only one warrior remained i see you shentorris jermayan said i see you jermayan shentorris said bowing slightly in acknowledgment i see you shentorris kellen said in his turn i see you kellen knightmage i would be honored to make you welcome at the fortress of the crowned horns i ancaladar announced am going in search of clear air and sunlight call me when you need me the dragon took a few bounding leaps through the snow and was airborne jermayan and kellen followed shentorris up the causeway into the fortress easily defensible kellen noted on his way up the removal of a few key blocks of stone would take down a substantial part of the causeway isolating the fortress completelyassuming this was the only way in ancaladar had said that dragons couldnt land on the top of itbut kellen suspected that the deathwings that had destroyed the caravan that had originally been supposed to bring sandalon here could and they already knew that the deathwings could carry a person so how many of them were there and who controlled them and were there caves beneath the fortress that the shadowed elves controlledor could reach he sighed inwardly there were things he had to say to shentorrisor whoever was in charge of defense herethat would not make good hearing as the elves would say he hoped that jermayan would take the lead in that but if jermayan wouldnt hed have to they reached the top of the causeway there were massive bronze gates crusted with winters ice in fact the ice was so thick upon them that it was obvious they had not been opened in months shentorris led them around the edgea pathway even narrower than the causeway with a sheer drop to the rocks belowto a smaller door also bronze the walls looked as if they were made of a single piece of stone there was nothing here that would burn or decay the smaller door was barely large enough to admit one person at a time it was closed shentorris knocked and after a pause it was opened kellen entered first then jermayan then last of all shentorris kellen was used to elven architecture being spacious airy and open bringing the outdoors in so artfully that sometimes it was hard to tell where nature ended and elven craft began this was beautiful too as all the work of the elves was but it was beauty of an entirely different sort it was as if hed suddenly stepped back through time to meet a wholly different race of elvesa race of warriors not artisans the corridors were narrow the ceilings low kellen had the sudden sense that this fortress was also a labyrinth designed to confuse any invaders who got this far defenders would hide and attack knowing the territory well while their enemies circled about in confusion and the children who lived here now would find it a perfect playground never realizing as they played that they were learning the skills that would keep them alive in the ultimate extremity leaf and star gods of the wild magic let that day never come kellen thought fervently if the enemy broached this citadel then all hope was truly gone there were no windows of course though the walls were painted with scenes of cities and forests that had not existed in a thousand years and depictions of animals that kellen had no name for a sort of fourlegged eagle and something that looked more like a twohorned unicorn than it looked like anything else a horse with wingsnow surely that was wholly imaginary a kind of a centaur with a cat body instead of a horse body and wings as well kellen stopped trying to decide what was realor might have been real onceand simply followed the others he wasnt lostno knightmage as hed discovered down in the caverns could actually get lostbut unless he spent enough time here to learn the entire layout of the fortress the only route hed be able to take back to the door was the one he was following now and here we come to what hasin times pastbeen the dining hall shentorris said opening a door kellen quickly understood the reason for shentorriss odd phrasing for it was obvious that the room was no longer a dining hall and had not been used as one for quite some time it was now filled with children all the children of the nine citiesexcept kellen supposed for the very youngest like kalania who were off in a nursery somewhere and some of the oldest like alkandoran who were probably continuing their knightly training but all the rest were here it was the largest room in the fortress the floor had been marked with the elaborate patterns of childrens games the walls were lined with large tubs in which green plants grew scenting the air with the perfume of growing things high above hanging from the rafters were ancient war banners an incongruous martial note in these surroundings there were fewer than fifty children here yet kellen knew that these were all the children of all the elven lands but elves lived for centuries and children were rare among them kellen watched as they ran and played together most of them had already been here for sennights long enough to get used to the idea of seeing so many others near their own ages he wondered what kind of a difference it would make to them later the newest arrivals werent here yet still getting settled inand warmed up kellen thought with a longing glance toward the enormous fireplace that filled one end of the great hall shentorris caught the direction of his gaze but come we will take tea you shall meet tyrvin who is the master of the crowned horns he will be eager to hear the news of the outside world shentorris conducted his two guests to a smaller room like every chamber kellen had seen so far here in the fortress it was windowless but it had the look of a place that someone had tried very hard to make resemble home cushioned benches lined the walls and there were low tables carved and inlaid in colored woods set here and there about the room a tiled stove in the corner radiated a pleasant heat but the walls were hung with weapons not weapons for show but weapons that could be grabbed at a moments notice and borne in defense of the precious treasure these walls contained a kettle in the shape of a fatbellied faun stood heating on the stove and from the cabinet beside the stove shentorris took down a pot and a tea canister while he was hesitating among the teacupsfor elves took the selection of the proper teacup nearly as seriously as they did the selection of the proper tea master tyrvin entered the room he was not nearly as old as master belesharon but kellen could instantly see why he had been chosen as the guardian of the fortress of the crowned horns the same aura of absolute mastery of his craft enveloped him like an invisible cloak he was very simply the best andoreniel had to send kellen faced him and bowed the deep bow of respect student to master tyrvin looked surprised they told me you were a knightmage he said i am still learning my craft kellen said honestly you have mastered yours you should at least have learned not to flatter elves in your time among us tyrvin said brusquely moving to take a seat with his back to the door i am not particularly good at flattery kellen answered simply but i have learned that elves honor truth and that respect is due to those who have earned it jermayan and shentorris both laughed the point goes to kellen tyr jermayan said cheerfully and flattery is not the only thing he is bad at i assure you he cannot speak of the weather save to tell you whether it is wet or dry and if his man did not dress him dogs would run howling from the streets whenever he appeared nor can he brew tea that i would use for anything but killing parasites in my garden he does not dance but the children love him master belesharon thinks well of him and he fights like a firesprite whose nest has been burned and he is shalkans rider well indeed tyrvin sounded surprised and somewhat mollified at this odd catalogue of kellens abilitiesor disabilities as for kellen he thought it was a peculiar sort of endorsementespecially coming from his oldest friend among the elves but it was obvious that these three elves were old friends and an old friend among elves was a very old friend indeed so he tried not to take any of jermayans comments to heart since certainly they were trueand probably pretty important from an elven point of view but why should his being shalkans rider be important to anyone but him and shalkan besides he liked the tea he brewed just fine hed just remember not to offer any of it to jermayan anymore or to politely suggest that jermayan might like to brew his own i suppose then that if i wish to hear what has been going on in sentarshadeen these last moonturns it would be well to cast aside all vestige of dignity and manners tyrvin said but there was a twinkle in his eye when he said it indeed jermayan said taking a seat on one of the benches though i am told that his speeches to andoreniels council are memorable things kellen sighed inwardly sitting down as well and shrugging out of his heavy furs he was being teased he recognized that now and resigned himself to it it was bettermuchthan being disliked and he found that he very much wanted master tyrvin to like him i only told them what they needed to hear they didnt like it much kellen said assuming a counterfeit air of innocence that startled another bark of laughter from master tyrvin the council never wishes to hear what it needs to hear and now jermayanperhaps if he annoys me i shall tell you what a difficult pupil he once was to mehas brought you to me so that you can tell me what i need to hear and you think i shall like it as little as the council did kellen inclined his head acknowledging that what master tyrvin said was the truth he took a deep breath he might as well give them the blunt truth they expected from humans and he didnt really know any way that would render it palatable i know that your fortress is not impregnable i know it can be attacked i know how and by who i dont know when or if kellen said but i know how i would do it had i the resources of the enemy that got the full attention of all three elves tell me knightmage tyrvin commanded all business now i dont think it will be soon perhaps not at all but let me go back to the beginning and tell you everything and then you will know all that i know carefully kellen began at the very beginning the attack on the caravan that was to have brought sentarshadeens children to the crowned horns with the frostgiants icetrolls and coldwargand their allies the giant deathwings they can carry a fullgrown elf safely and they follow orders i dont know who ultimately controls them but i know theyre creatures of darkness that can nevertheless fly by day i know ancaladar said he cant land on top of the fortress but i dont know what the top of the fortress looks like so i cant say what could land there you shall see it go on tyrvin said kellen told the whole story from the moment calmeren had arrived at sentarshadeen to the moment the rescue party had returned to it he omitted no detail whether he suspected tyrvin knew it already or not whatever tyrvin knew he did not know the events as kellen had experienced them the shadowed elves werent just using the cavern as a temporary camp either they had a whole city there and ancaladar said theyd been living there for a very long time since they seem to have elven blood the landwards dont react to them there was a long silence jermayan knew all this of course but it was new to shentorris and tyrvin and neither elf was happy to hear it how far do these caves go tyrvin asked at last with blunt war manners no one knowsyet not even ancaladar andoreniel intends to wipe out the shadowed elves hes calling up the levies in ondoladeshiron while kellen had been telling the long tale of the rescue of the children tea had been brewed and poured and now he took a long sip of spicy black winter tea to soothe his raw throat the fortress of the crowned horns is built atop a mountain of solid granite shentorris said speaking at last for the moment jermayan said he needed to say nothing more we will hear them if they dig i will post listeners on the lowest level where the spring that nourishes the fortress isevery hour of every day tyrvin said they will assist ronethil in her work but you say you do not think they mean to attack us kellen wildmage i think their plan was to lure us into a war with the shadowed elvesto make us commit all our resources into a battle to destroy them as we shall if we attack them in their caverns were at a disadvantage if they attack us here in our place of greatest strength theyre the ones at a disadvantage i dont think theyre after the children i dont think that the children were ever their real target he tried to choose his words with utmost care this is why they didnt attack us to get them back once wed rescued them and until we met up with the second rescue party from sentarshadeen we were quite vulnerable nor did they attack any of the caravans that followed sandalons the whole point seems to me to have been to allow us to discover the existence of the shadowed elves in a way that would make us determined to wipe them out he knew he sounded puzzled and he was because he could not imagine what could possibly come next an odd way of running a war tyrvin said still unless they can find a way of coming at us here in force i am confident that if they do attack we can hold them offthough your news is hardly calculated to help me to rest easy at night but come i will show you the rest of our defenses the tour took the next several hours tyrvin showed kellen over what seemed as if it were every inch of the fortressthough he saw no more of the children there were rooms filled with weapons arrows and bows the most fragile and easilyexpended items of their defense spears swords shields enough to arm and rearm every defender of the fortress a dozen times over there were other rooms filled with food grain both fresh and parched dried fruit dried meat herbs and teas spices enough to feed an army for years everyone kellen metand there were female knights as well as male among the defenderswas in good spirits no one here doubted the importance of their task nor was inclined to grow soft and inattentive simply because one day passed seamlessly into another with no sign of overt threat the elves were a patient people tyrvin even took him down to the deepest levels of the fortress where the spring was if kellen had not been so intent upon learning all the citadels secrets it would have been an honor he would gladly have done without for the way was long down a winding stair that seemed to go on forever he had the sense that the lanterns the elves carried to light the way were mostly a courtesy to him this is the lowest level of the fortress shentorris said when they stood in the center of a great room hollowed from the living rock in the center of the floor stood a deep round pool the others had stopped upon the stairs letting kellen go first and now he knew why a unicorn stood beside the pool her coat was the grey of winter storm and her horn was the clear shining brightness of winters ice as he approached she bowed her head and touched her horn to the pool and for a moment the water shone blue yes she said it is a spring called from the depths of the earth by magic in ancient times but nothing of the dark may try these waters and livenot while i ronethil am here or those who guard this place with me without conscious thought kellen shifted to spellsight he looked down into the pool saw where it flowed up through a crack in the stone so narrow that nothing of any size could pass through it nor could it be poisoned or bespelled while ronethil stood guard beneath that was rock nothing but solid rock he reached out to the roots of the whole fortress in the way a man might check his horse for soundness before he mounted but he felt nothing all was untouched nothing had comeyetto try the citadels defenses at least from this direction safe kellen said with relief as his spellsight faded only then did he notice that a sort of conduit led from the spring along the wall up the stairs well he guessed it beat having to walk down all the stairs he was about to walk up again every time you needed water for tea your magegifts have told you this tyrvin said it was not a question no one can truly say what future fruit the blossom of the moment may bear kellen said it was one of morusils favorite sayings idalia said it was the elven way of saying dont press your luck he learns quickly jermayan said a note of pride in his voice quicker than you learned to counter that low attack to your left side when you were in my training tyrvin said ah master i thought those bruises would never heal jermayan agreed ruefully alas that i have been unable to give kellen ones to match them tyrvin glanced at kellen and for a moment there was cold speculation in the elfs dark eyes then he smiled alas that we do not have time this day for sport i will show you the top of the tower and then i think it will be time for you to depart to your duties remember us on the field of battle remember us among the children jermayan answered and kellen had the sense that hed just witnessed one of those sideslips into an almost sacred formality that he guessed youd have to live as long as an elf to understand him he was just kellen a human knightmage who according to jermayan couldnt brew tea and fought like a firespritewhatever that was he wondered if asking jermayan would get him any answers he could understand they stopped back at the room where theyd shared tea to collect their heavy fur cloaks and gloves kellen was sweating by the time theyd climbed yet another several sets of stairs to a room so small the four of them could barely squeeze into it in order to make room for them the two guards who had occupied it needed to retreat down the stairs to the landing below this door tyrvin said opens onto the top of the tower of the fortress of the crowned horns there are always two sentries posted there and as you have seen two inside in this weather their watch is short but the door is barred from this side and can be barred from the other at desperate need should the sentries on watch here lose track of the time or sleep or fail of attentiveness those without will die for should they cry out or hammer at the door it cannot be heard from within trust that was the hidden message in tyrvins words each elfand unicornhere at the fortress trusted every other to hold their lives as dearly as their own that was the crowned horns true defense not sword and stonethe demons could break through that if they came in strength but their greatest weapons were tricks of bribery and persuasion of tainted promises kellen was sure now that any attempt to gain a foothold here by those means would fail tyrvin unbolted the door it thrust inward fiercely pushed on an icy blast of wind hold to the guideropes he shouted over the howl of the wind and stepped out onto the tower roof the guideropes were thick cables of twisted metal kellen grabbed for one instinctively without it he would be pushed along the roof as if he weighed no more than an autumn leaf the rooftop was far too small for a dragon to land upon walls half the height of an elfs body surrounded it and at each corner was a strange fivepronged blossom standing twice that heightone prong sticking straight up two curving outward two curving in from a distance they probably gave the top of the fortress the look of a crown all were sharp the surface of the tower floor was not smooth and open either tall spikes were placed at intervals the cable kellen clung to was strung between them making a virtue of necessity here at the highest exposed point in the icefang mountains the icy wind was punishing it battered at kellen like a living thing making his flesh ache even beneath the heavy furs and his insulating elven armor he saw the two sentries groping carefully along the ropes their gaze turned outward toward the surrounding mountains and the sky tyrvin moved past him going to each of them in turn and sending them inside kellen groped his way to the parapet or as near as he could get without letting go of the guiderope if he let go the wind would take him over the side unless he was quick enough to fling himself flat this was a dangerous place but he was close enough to see the arrowslits in the walls they were clotted with ice now but through them a kneeling elven archer could rain down destruction on an enemy or even stand to fire for the range of elven bows was long he caught tyrvins eye and nodded hed seen what he needed to see though if he wasnt in danger of freezing solid he would have been happy to linger the mountains were spread out below them in a breathtaking vistain spring in sunlight this must be a beautiful place the master of the fortress of the crowned horns led them carefully inside and waited until the next four sentriestwo outside two insidehad taken their places then he brought them all back to what kellen now realized must be his private rooms the posts that you saw are not only for show there are charms of unicorn hair attached to the top renewed every spring so none of them will dare to try us tyrvin said with grim satisfaction kellen thought carefully before he spoke i am not sure the deathwings could land there but they would not need to they could come low enough to drop whoever they carried in their clawsor to carry someone away they are small enough and nimble enough for that and when spring comeswhat are the winds like then are they constant or do they soften or stop altogether the deathwings can fly by day but they will be better still at nightand in a fog or in the clouds would any see them until it was too late tyrvin sighed yet we must keep watch find another way kellen said bluntly every time you open a doorany doorin this fortress you expose a weakness close and bar it confronted with this fortress if i were contemplating an attack i would never even consider a frontal assault i would try treachery i would try stealth and i would try by ones and twos not by thousands one or two can open the door to thousands if they come at the wrong time and place you cannot assume the enemy to be less cunning than i am count your people count them constantly at least here he could be singleminded there was only one duty before these elves this was their posting and it was all they needed to concentrate on whether or not the attack on the children had been part of a ruse was of no moment to them so kellen too could be singleminded in his advice and pray to leaf and star that someday we may open our gates again tyrvin said agreeing it is good counsel kellen wildmage it is a great pity you were not born one of us yet had it been so you would not be what you are and we have need of that sometimes you terrify me jermayan said conversationally as they stood at the foot of the causeway waiting for ancaladar to arrive jermayan said it would only be a matter of a few moments i only said what had to be said kellen said he knew he sounded a little sullen but he couldnt help it even tyrvin seemed to be waiting for the endarkened to show up as a massed army with bannersnot sneak in at the changing of the guard and start slaughtering people which kellen thought was far more likely if they meant to attack the fortress at all someday you will say it to the wrong person jermayan said leaf and star to speak so to master tyrvin he wants to keep those children alive and so do but ancaladar had suddenly made his appearance falling through the clouds like a black thunderbolt fanning his wings wide at the last minute and making a graceful landing in a spray of snow the dragons great weight made him sink deeply into the snow so that the saddle was only a few feet above kellens head i trust that your visit went as you would have it go the dragon said it went as it went jermayan answered dismissively ancaladar didnt linger a moment longer once kellen and jermayan had secured themselves in their seats but bounded quickly into the air he had probably been trying to take things easy back at sentarshadeen for the sake of his young passengers and the air there had certainly been quieter kellen was glad hed had that experience to prepare him for this one because this takeoff was nowhere near as gentle as the one that had preceded it the mountain winds flipped and spun ancaladar through the air as if he were one of sandalons toy boats upon great twovanesata with ancaladar taking expert advantage of every opportunity they granted him to gain height at last they broke through into the sunlight and comparative stillness of the upper air and ancaladar was able to spread his wings wide and level out everyone still there i trust the dragon asked it was fun kellen answered it actually had been in a weird way hed been surefairly sure anywaythat he wasnt going to fall off and if he had he had no doubt at all that ancaladar would catch him before he could hit the ground but all the same he was just as glad it hadnt gone on too long you have the oddest notions of fun jermayan said nevertheless i do not think we will repeat it ancaladar said a note of amusement in his soft deep voice the air over sentarshadeen is calm and cleari can feel it from here so can i jermayan said an odd note in his voice the rest of the journey was almost a mirror of the first though this time the sun was westering treating kellen to a spectacular show as it tinted the clouds with a thousand shades of gold he missed the clouds when they left them behind and was surprised to see that though here they were still in sunlight the land below was already touched with twilight shadows ancaladar landed in the unicorn meadow near the house of leaf and star but only long enough for kellen to dismount with jermayan still in the saddle he launched himself into the sky again heading for his home canyon kellen stamped and stretched working the stiffness out of his cramped muscles it had been a beautiful flight but still a cold one and did you enjoy your day shalkan asked materializing out of nowhere the unicorn was hard to seekellen realized it was almost dark well after lanternlighting time it was instructive kellen said and cold but the children are safe at the fortress now and likely to remain so shalkan asked kellen regarded his friend broodingly unless they try something i cant imagine yes or until they starve to death waiting for us to defeat shadow mountain resupplying the fortress would be an easy matter come springbut each time its doors were opened all who were within were exposed to danger from an attack by treachery and stealth but youre still not happy shalkan said falling into step beside kellen as the young knightmage began the long walk toward home and after you got to ride ancaladar and meet master tyrvin such gratitude kellen made a rude noise i am duly grateful for all the mercies and benefits visited upon me he said quoting one of the sentences of the litany of the light that hed had to recite each lights day back in armethalieh i just think im forgetting something well youll have plenty of time to try to remember it on the ride to ondoladeshiron shalkan said cheerfully the journey to ondoladeshiron took a sennight and a half for not only did they move through deep winter but they were restricted to the pace of the supply wagons that they escorted these wagons held immense quantities of food and weapons as well as much of the store of wild magicinfused articles that idalia had crafted for the first time kellen traveled with an elven army in formal battle array although he was certainly battleseasoned he had not yet won his spurs in the house of sword and shield and even though he was a knightmage he was also shalkans rider so for purposes of elven battle protocol he rode under the orders of petariel captain of the unicorn knights as a junior knight kellen found it instructive he kept his eyes and ears open and began to learn a great deal about the bonds of camaraderie that other unicorn knights had with their mounts the unicorn knights of necessity rode apart from the main army by elven standards they were all quite young though they would have been grandmothers and grandfathers among humans all of them were still mourning the loss of their comrades both elven and unicorn in the shadowed elf ambush for the community of unicorn knights was a small closeknit one not every elven fighter was even remotely interested in bonding with a unicorn oddly it was a community that kellen had never really been a part of until now he wasnt a real unicorn knighthis bond with shalkan was part of a mageprice lasting a year and a day that wasnt the same thing as choosing a unicorn for a companionor being chosen by one and what happened when the elf fell in love with another elf heor shewould never see their unicorn friend again not up close anyway youre thinking like a human again shalkan observed when kellen confided some of these thoughts to him i am a human in case you havent figured that out yet kellen said it felt good to discussfor a changesomething that had nothing in particular to do with shadow mountain shalkan snorted eloquently as if i could forget humans think the whole world revolves around thembut we have lives of our own too you know the partnership of knight and unicorn is a fine thing but in most cases both of the beings involved realize at the start that its only going to be an episodea relatively short onein what will be long lives for them both a year and a day probably seems like a long time to youwell for most of these knights their partnership wont seem to last much longer uhhiih that sounded awfully coldblooded to kellen maybe an elfwho was going to live several centuriescould manage it or how long do unicorns live anyway kellen asked longer than youre likely to if you keep asking foolish questions shalkan answered quellingly ah evidently there were some things even kellen wasnt supposed to know kellen didnt spend all his time with the unicorn knights fortunately a knightmage could go where he pleased and kellen took full advantage of that freedom jermayan was flying with ancaladar doing most of the longrange scouting for the little army but naturally he had brought valdien with him under deyishenes tutelage kellens equestrian skills had improved to the point where with jermayans permission and after a proper introduction to valdien to assure the destrier that it was indeed all righthe could take valdien out of the horselines and ride the great stormcolored destrier among the main body of the troops he saw things there that greatly disturbed him he knew already that elves were creatures of great respect for tradition he saw now that the tradition extended to the organization of their army the equivalent sons and daughters of these same elven households had probably ridden in exactly these positions a thousand years ago the last time the elves had gone to war which meant kellen thought with a frown that when the elven armies gathered to face shadow mountain the demon horde would know exactly who and where everyone was idalia had told him that the demons werent merely longlived like the elves but truly immortal so it wasnt impossible that there were actual demon generals out there that had faced the allied and elven armies last time he might not know everything about the art of war yet but he did know that it wasnt a good idea for the enemy to know what the entire disposition of your troops was going to be in advance and if the elves were as much creatures of tradition as they appearedwhich kellen had no reason to doubtshadow mountain already knew every possible battle formation they would use not good individually the elves were unstoppable fightersand individually they were perfectly capable of improvisation if they put their minds to it and they were smart enough to realize within seconds of an encounter that they were no longer playing by the same rules as they once had been for some of them that was fast enough to save them but the larger the group the more unwieldy and traditionbound it became the easier to defeat hed identified another problem kellen realized with an inward sigh it was just too bad he couldnt come up with a solution to it as easily the elven commanders werent going to throw out several thousand years of the proper way of doing things just on his sayso and their tactics had worked the last time thats the root of the problem it worked twice before they know it did so why shouldnt it work again the only bright spot in thingsno more than a faint glimmer really to be honestwas that kellen doubted whoever was running the demon side of this war had any interest at all in engaging in a series of formal battles as for the battle against the shadowed elves it wouldnt be a traditional form of warfare at all so it would rely on the elves strengths not their weaknesses it was almost as if they were certain to win and their victory didnt matter to shadow mountains ultimate strategy but if they ignored the shadowed elves knowing them for the trap that they were shadow mountain would mercilessly exploit that weakness in the elven lands defenses were trapped either way kellen thought in grudging admiration for the unknown demon general we have no choice but to do exactly what they want us to do for now chapter thirteen ondoladeshiron at last calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink sentarshadeen was a hidden city a city of forests and canyons ondoladeshiron stood in the middle of a vast plain at the foot of a mountain rangekellen recalled that idalia had turned from a silver eagle back into human form here if his memory was right ondoladeshiron was also where shed met jermayan the buildings of the elven city echoed the rise and fall of the surface of the plain and evoked the towering strength of the mountains behind them as well like the elves themselves ondoladeshiron had the ability to hide in plain sight though it should be easy enough to see a large city in the middle of a plain especially in winter ondoladeshiron eluded the eye deceiving one into thinking it no more than a natural tumble of stones the buildings looked nothing like buildings of any kind it was impossible to see anything that didnt look as if it had been formed entirely by the chaotic action of weather wind water and time yet kellen knew that whatever the elves were doing to hide their city they were doing it entirely without magic merely the skill honed by centuriesmillenniaof observing the natural world one thing that assisted ondoladeshiron to hide itself was the presence of the elven army camped at the citys outskirts on the gathering plain the encampment was as colorful as the city was circumspect drawing the eye toward itself at this distance all kellen could see was rows of pavilions in colors like the flowers in a spring meadow and the horse herd beside it kellen wondered just how many of them there were he idalia and vestakia had ridden here among nearly two hundred knights all andoreniel could spare from the patrols around sentarshadeen of course like every elven city ondoladeshiron also had its flower forest in this season it was the only spot of natural color in the snowcovered landscape though the trees at the outer edges of the forest were covered in snow all were in leaf and some were in flower courage brother idalia murmured as they neared the encampment what kellen asked he was riding valdien today and the destrier was for the most part behaving himself unfortunately jermayans mount knew that kellens horsemanship wasnt the equal of his masters and valdien had all jermayans dry sense of humor he liked to pull tricks on kellen at odd moments and then pretend hed done nothing at all it took all of kellens attentiveness to remain in the saddle sometimes though it was doing wonders for his riding skills it occurred to him that the destrier was giving him the equine equivalent of belesharons lessons in swordsmanship idalia gave him a strange look youre the first knightmage born in a thousand years dont you think a few people are going to want to meet you including other wildmages oh oh but nothing i should worry about right kellen asked with a crooked smile right idalia answered smiling back once again being shalkans rider worked in kellens favor though the rest of the knights were grouped by the city of their residence the unicorn knights pavilions were all bunched together at the very edge of the camp so that their mounts could come to them easily by the time kellen had turned over valdien to the sentarshadeen horsemaster and found out where he was supposed to be petariel already had the wagons with their gear separated out from the rest and he and the other sentarshadeen unicorn knights were unloading them while others that kellen didnt recognizeeven if all elves looked fairly similar even to kellen the armor of an elven knight was highly distinctivewere marking out the places where the pavilions were to be erected kellen quickly got to work no student of belesharons was afraid of a little hard work and besides he was looking forward to getting his bedroll unpacked and finding who was brewing the tea menerchel usually took charge of thatkellen had tactfully assured the others at the outset that he would happily light any fires they liked and do extra work putting up the pavilions but that everyone would be a great deal happier if he did not do any of the cooking the other thing at the back of his mind was that surely if he was hidden away in the midst of the unicorn knights none of the other wildmages would be able to find him it wasnt that kellen was afraid to meet another wildmage wildmages were one and all a force for good and hed long since gotten over the time when hed worried about being a notgoodenough wildmage that had ended at the moment when hed discovered he was a knightmage a different sort of wildmage entirely so then why both his wildmage training and master belesharon had taught him that such hidden reluctance was a warning to be confronted and understood at once if at all possible now that the pavilions were all in placeand firmly staked down against the windkellen went and collected his equipment and shalkans armor he dropped it in his tent then procured a large mug of winter spice tea from menerchel then returned to his tent to unpack his gear and think the matter over he wasnt afraid of the other wildmages he wasnt ashamed of what he was and as for not wanting to be the center of attention well he was getting plenty of attention right here since all of the other unicorn knights were just as fascinated by a knightmage as any strange wildmage might be and if elves were legendary for their stubbornness they were equally known for their curiosity so that wasnt it cozy shalkan said walking into the tent since the pavilion wasnaturallyin kellens color the light shining through it turned shalkans white fur a radiant pale green which was a rather startling effect kellen thought i guess its going to be home for a while kellen said so im just as glad its comfortable idalias looking for youor so i hear there are some people she wants you to meet shalkan said tilting his head to regard kellen from beneath his long lashes and i dont want to meet them and i dont know why kellen sighed im trying to figure that out child of the city shalkan said his voice unusually serious you are not responsible for the errors of your ancestors not even the most immediate ones of course not i know th is that it kellen said catching himself in midsentence maybe shalkan said inscrutably kellen thought about it idalia had been gone from armethalieh more than half her life but he hadnt it was true that hed been banished and armethalieh had severed all its ties with him but maybe deep in his heart he was still what shalkan had called him child of the city and armethalieh had not done well by the wild magic it had set the high magick in its place it had cast out its wildmages denied their existence killed them wherever it found them now he could identify the peculiar reluctance to meet another wildmage it was guilt but they wont blame me kellen said aloud exasperated with himself no they wontso stop blaming yourself you had nothing to do with decisions made in the city centuries before you were born kellen sighed feeling the knot of tension and reluctance dissolve im always borrowing trouble arent i i dont see why you feel the need to shalkan said when the world is always willing to give so much of it away for free now dont you have somewhere to be yes kellen said and thanks he found petariel and let him know where he was going then headed off to find idalia sentarshadeens encampment was at the far side of the gathering plain so kellen had to walk through most of the camp to reach it the tents of ondoladeshiron were nearest the city itself and kellen recognized banners from windalorianan deskethomaynel and thultafoniseen as he passed for part of his training in the house of sword and shield had been in the heraldry of the nine cities that meant lerkalpoldara valwendigorean realthataladon and ysterialpoerin were yet to arrive but they were the most farflung of the nine cities and it might be another fortnight before they arrived andoreniels army should be on its way to the cavern before that kellen hoped he reached the sentarshadeen pavilions and saw familiar facesbut not the familiar faces he was looking for in response to his puzzled expression dervasin took pity on him and observed that the wildmage idalia was to be found with evanor vestakia and the others among the tents of the healers and pointed him in the right direction once more kellen set off discovering that hed passed that collection of tents on his way across the field since the healers werent knights their tents were a reflection of their personal style rather than knightly colors some were very bright indeed their surfaces as brilliantly and randomly colored as a field of wildflowers others were as plain and deceptively simple as an elvenware bowl orin the way of elvescarefully painted to look like something they were not the pavilion idalia shared with vestakia for example was artfully crafted to look as if it had been stitched together from carefullytanned deer hides right down to the tiny stitches and the small imperfections in the leather only when you touched it did you realize that it was the same thick and durable silk canvas as all the others he wondered whose idea that had been he hoped vestakia hadnt had any problems theyd all grown so used to her appearance in sentarshadeen that it only now occurred to kellen that the rest of the nine cities might see nothing more than her outward appearance he dismissed the thought with a shrug she had many friends and protectors now he found idalias tent without difficulty and stopped outside to ring the bells braided into a length of cord suspended beside the entrance without a door to knock on the everpunctilious elves had found another way for someone to announce his presence come in kellen idalia called immediately she must have been expecting him or else by now she could just tell when it was him kellen pushed through the flapresisting the urge to duckand looked around idalias pavilion was larger than hiswhich only made sense as she might have to do healings here just now it contained a number of large chests a standing brazier for warmth and a low table with several stools that could be folded out of the way for night she and vestakia were both here and as kellens eyes adjusted to the lower light level after the wintry glare outside he saw there was a third person present as well the man got to his feet as kellen entered he was human tall and slender his skin burned dark with wind and sun making his age difficult to judge though kellen could tell he was certainly beyond middle years he bore an odd elusive resemblance to vestakia and kellen could feel the same sense of peace and intense focusfor lack of a better termradiating from him that idalia possessed i greet you wildmage kellen said bowing and i you knightmage kellen the wildmage said holding out his hand quickly kellen pulled off his gauntlet and took the mans hand hed spent so long among the elves that hed almost forgotten there were other ways of doing things this is wildmage atroist idalia said hes from the lost lands he knew my mother vestakia said excitedly yes virgivet was a dear comrade of mine i had always wondered what happened to cause her to leave winds bridgebut now that i know the whole of her story i see that she had no choice in what she did and she gave the world a splendid daughterone to be proud of vestakia smiled at the praise her eyes glistening with happy tears the four of them sat down around idalias table once again kellen removed his helm his cloakit was quite warm in idalias pavilionand his other gauntlet setting them in a careful bundle at his feet idalia set a cup before him and filled it with hot spiced cider refilling her own cup and the cups of the other two as well after an exchange of pleasantriesbrief by elven standardsatroist got down to business these are hard times for us in the lost lands when the firstling kings warning reached us he told us nothing new the dark folk have always walked openly in the hard western hills but if they now turn their attentions to the east we fear their hand will fall harder upon us than ever and if that should happen i do not think the herdsfolk will survive atroist glanced toward vestakia his expression grave ours is a hard land with hard ways as virgivet knew but the dark folk and their treacheries are a constant threat they steal unprotected babies from the cradle lure lone travelers to their doom attack our flocks in the guise of monsters perhaps that is why the wild magic runs so strong in the westwe have great need of it there without our spells to discover and mark them wanderers would be lured into the haunted places and not all our healing arts could restore sanity to such a one afterward when a kinsman is overshadowed a wildmage can lift the spell before harm is done to the light within if one is summoned in time and when the dark folk raid in forcethough once that was a rare thingour magic often gives us warning enough to get the people and the flocks to safety so that there is little loss of life kellen looked at idalia her face was gravely expressionless when hed ridden through the lost lands with jermayan the elven knight had told him that the place was dangerous but listening to atroist kellen figured theyd both been incredibly lucky vestakia had told him she had to spend a lot of time hiding from demons but kellen had thought they were just coming after her personally apparently the lost lands were practically a demon playground and nobody had known i see grim looks upon your faces atroist said with a gentle smile but this is the only life i or any of my people have ever known so to us it seems very ordinary the good goddess does not send to us a task beyond our strength and each year enough wildmages are born to protect the people and to replace those who go home to her so we had been content had been kellen quoted back to him but somethings changed atroist sighed deeply his weatherseamed face going grave in the last few turns of the seasons the dark folk have grown bolder and more savage their raids increase in frequency and number he bowed his head for a moment it is our custom to go in force to a village when we know the dark folk intend to strike at it and so i was at goatford that day with seven of my fellow wildmages though my home had been in winds bridge since virgivet left it was the springtide as it usually is when the attacks come for then the flocks are spread upon the hills in search of the new grass and the ewes and nannies are heavy with young the flocks are the life of the herdsfolk and without them the people will starve it was as important to get the flocks to safety as to shelter the people we did not manage it in time there was a great battle we wonin the sense that the dark folk did not take any of our people alive that is always a great cause for rejoicing among our people oh yes vestakia said feelingly putting her hand over his atroist took her hand clasping it tightly as if for comfort believe mei understand it would be much better for you to kill them yourself than to let them fall into their hands your people would thank you for it if they could so the good goddess and her consort teach us atroist said somberly but you are one of us so you know and afterward there were the wounded to heal and the scattered flocks to retrieve by the time my duties at goatford were done and i could return to winds bridge three days had passed but i was easy in my heart for i had left my people wellprotected with spells and charms he paused to take a deep drink from his cup but when i arrived winds bridge was not there for a moment atroists face crumpled with grief but then he composed himself the village was gone not one stone stood upon another the land itself was scoured as if by fire no tree no blade of grass not even the village well remained the very earth reeked of taint and blood for days i wandered the hills insensible i saw no other living thingnot even a remnant of the herds i realized that every living thing that had belonged to winds bridge was deador alive in the hands of the dark folk and more i realized that they had somehow concealed the attack upon winds bridge from the wild magic allowing us to send our strength to goatford and leave winds bridge unprotected for a full turn of the seasons i walked the hills stopping no more than a few nights in any village as i railed against the good goddess demanding to know how she could let this happen to the innocents under my care at last she took pity on me and opened my heart to the knowledge i had been too wounded to bear that if i if a dozen wildmages had been at winds bridge that day it would have made no difference we would only have died along with our people for such power as was brought to bear against winds bridge that day was too great for the wild magic to stand against alone there was a moment of painful silence after atroist finished speaking its my fault vestakia said at last they destroyed winds bridge because of me no kellen and idalia said in chorus and if it is atroist said what will you do vestakia blinked staring at atroist as if hed slapped her then she took a deep breath i no it isnt my fault im not responsible for what they do how can i be i cant control their actions yes they probably picked winds bridge to destroy because mama came from there but it was their choice not mine good girl atroist said with a smile i had to learn that lesson as well and its a hard one just because you have a connection to a thing you are not necessarily responsible for its actions but to finish my grim tale quickly this was nearly five turns of the seasons past since then we have found that the dark folk raid more often and will sometimes attack two or more villages on the same day or within a day of each other and so i come not only to bring my aid but to speak for my people they more than any do not wish to see the shadow triumph but if our wildmages and warriors leave the people and the flocks who will defend them against the dark folk how can we fight knowing that all we love will be gone when we return idalia cast a despairing glance at kellen this was a heavy blow but neither of them could blame atroist if things were as bad in the lost lands as he said then asking the herdsfolk to give up all their defenses was asking them to commit suicide but most of the wildmages left were in the lost lands and the high reaches and they were going to need them all would they come here kellen asked men women childrenand goats kellen idalia burst out you cant offer the whole lost lands sanctuary in the elven lands you dont have the power no kellen agreed but i think andoreniel will agree to offer them safe passage through the elven lands if we ask him to theres a lot of unoccupied land between the elven border and the wildwood and more between the wildwood and armethalieh the uh dark folk arent raiding this far east not yet anyway the noncombatants would be safeif cold cold vestakia scoffed this isnt cold they would come atroist said with certainty to be safe from the dark folknever more to fear the sobbing outside their shutters in the night nor the sound of wings overhead in the darknessnot to live in terror that any stranger may be one of them in disguiseoh yes kellen knightmage they will come and gladly all that was needed to put kellens plan into operation was to get the request to andoreniel and receive his permission in return fortunately he had a fast messenger available assuming he could talk jermayan and ancaladar into it the arrival of the dragon at ondoladeshiron had not caused panic since andoreniel had sent messages ahead of time but ancaladars presence was an occasion of more curiosity than kellen and vestakia combined when kellen left idalias tent he realized that jermayan wasnt going to be that hard to find jermayan and ancaladar making a virtue of the inevitable had decided to put on a sort of aerial display for the encampment ancaladar was circling the gathering plain flying low and slow enough for everyone to get a good look at him kellen could see the sunlight glint off the dragons black scales and see the blue flash of jermayans armor idaliavestakiacome look jermayans brought ancaladar down low enough for everyone to watch kellen called and the others crowded out of idalias tent to watch after a few minutes of circling dragon and rider soared high into the sky and there to kellens astonished delight ancaladar performed a series of acrobatics that reminded kellen of nothing so much as a selkie after a particularly choice fish it came to kellen that what he was watching however entertaining it looked now had a grim and entirely serious purpose these were the battle moves for sky fighting the forms that ancaladar would have to use against flying enemies jermayan would have to not only remain in the saddle but be able to cast spells while ancaladar was performing these maneuvers i hope jermayan didnt eat too much breakfast vestakia said sounding faintly worried as she stared into the sky idalia laughed oh he wouldnt make that mistake twice this is hardly the first time theyve done this its really quite enjoyable i dont think id care for it vestakia said firmly kellen glanced at idalia curiously shed ridden ancaladar while he and jermayan were doing something like that no he didnt want to know there were some things a man was better off not knowing about his sister about women in general probably geas or no geas im going to go out in the open and see if i can get them to land so i can talk to jermayan kellen said wish me luck he suspected that ancaladar had seen and recognized him because the dragon landed before kellen had gotten very far away from the edge of the encampment here there was nothing at all to break the force of the wind and it cut like a knife of pure ice kellen was getting pretty tired of winter already and idalia said that there was more to come moonturns of it in fact no wonder it wasnt allowed to really penetrate armethaliehs defenses against weather he bowed to jermayan as jermayan vaultedwith the ease of long practicedown from ancaladars back it would be interesting to know when you learned to fly like that kellen said the display was most instructive and i dont think youll get vestakia anywhere near ancaladar after that i would promise to be good the dragon said sounding faintly hurt i have been practicing jermayan said obviously pleased and it may someday be needful that she ride with us she is the only one who can tell where the shadowed elves lair if she can do it from the air then she could cover the ground very fastfaster than on horseback and a lot more safely youre the one whos going to have to convince her not me kellen said grinning or maybe you can talk idalia into helping you she seems to like flying never will she forget that she once had wings of her own jermayan said it is a hard loss to bear i admit i had not thought our display might alarm vestakia but ancaladar thought it best to present himself to everyone at once so all might know him for what he is immediately and it is a fine day for flying the skies are clear and the winds are relatively calm and steady and the sky is blue and the ground is white and its winter and sooner or later its going to snow again kellen agreed and as you know perfectly well i didnt come out here to talk about the weather but to tell you how i spent my morning quickly and concisely kellen told jermayan and ancaladar about wildmage atroist and the increasing frequency of the demon raids in the lost lands we knew they never stopped raiding there but lately its been getting worse atroist says that if they send us any help they risk stripping themselves of all protection but we need all the help they can give us you have a plan jermayan said studying kellens face leaf and star deliver us kellen shrugged it had seemed like a simple plan when hed come up with it back in idalias tent and frankly he couldnt see any other way of getting the lost lands wildmages on their side he took a deep breath atroist says that he can get them all to comeall the herdsfolk with their flocks and herds if andoreniel will grant them safe passage through the elven lands they can settle on the other sidein human landswhere they dont come then their wildmages and fighters will be willing to leave them knowing theyll be safe jermayan took a deep breath his whole body rigid with something beyond astonishment ancaladar began to laugh jermayan whirled and glared at his friendkellen could tell that much from his body languagebut ancaladar simply wouldntor couldntstop laughing he shook his enormous head from side to side scraping his chin in the snow eyes tightly closed in mirth at last jermayans shoulders relaxed he walked over to the twitching dragon and kicked itgentlyin the ankle very well my friend i stand rebuked he said to ancaladar who am i an elven mage to bridle at the thought of humans within our lands when there are shadowed elves beneath them if it will gain us help in an evil hour it is foolish to cling to outmoded thoughts and old ways he turned back to kellen you did not simply come to tell me this of course he said i need someone to go back to sentarshadeen and ask andoreniel for the safe conduct kellen said you and ancaladar would be fastest and i think andoreniel will listen to you so i thought id come and see if you were willing to go ancaladar gave a last faint wail of mirth and raised his head from the snow oh yes i am willing to go i want to hear what he says i see it is settled then jermayan said he sighed kellen i agree that we need their wildmages and no one could expect them to abandon their own people to them and it is equally true that the most direct route from the lost lands into human realms lies through elven lands but i do wish you had found another way with that jermayan turned back to ancaladar stepped up into the saddle and took off into the sky kellen shook his head there was something else he was missing here probably another ancient elven tradition that he hadnt had time to learn but jermayan was right they couldnt cling to those now they had to change or die jermayan did not return that day nor was he back by the following morning when the full army was mustered together on the gathering plain and kellen saw general redhelwar and rochinuviel viceroy of ondoladeshiron for the first time petariel had told him over morning tea that redhelwar would be wanting to see both him and idalia in his tent afterward as the only ones who had actually seen the enemy up close in order to plan the actual tactics of the campaign but this was a purely ceremonial occasion kellen had to admit that the army was an impressive sight but the elven destriersand probably even the unicornswould be of no use in the caves and against a demon attack in force even this much of an army wouldnt survive more than minutes it would take more than physical might to defeat the demons and kellen was coming to thinkafter what atroist had told him that it would take more than magic too some combination of both that he hadnt figured out yet he supposed or maybe it was just as simpleand as difficultas keeping the demons from getting their hands on whatever objective it was that they thought would guarantee them victory whatever that might be redhelwar was a grave and imposing figure in scarlet armor mounted on a destrier whose coat was nearly the same color kellen saw him only from a distance of course since he stood with the unicorn knights kellen tried not to think about the fact that redhelwars experience with real war was as theoretical as his own the elves had been at peace since the end of the great war and certainly for all of redhelwars lifetime but despite their heritage of peace kellen was coming to realize that the elves were a warrior race and he already knew they were master strategists if they could only be weaned from so much love of tradition but if redhelwar did not approach the unicorn knights closely to kellens great surprise rochinuviel did the viceroy of ondoladeshiron did not wear armor having instead chosen to don the elaborate jeweled robes of state that kellen had seen worn in the council chambers in the house of leaf and star the viceroy rode a palfrey of dazzling whitenessnot as white as a unicorn of course but nearly when he spokea short speech welcoming them to ondoladeshiron in andoreniels and ashaniels nameskellen realized that though hed been automatically thinking of the viceroy as he rochinuviel was actually she not he it had been harder than usual to tell between courtly jewels winter furs and the fact that rochinuviel was not young andso kellen was beginning to findelves tended to become more androgynous with age the vicereign finished her speech of welcome petariels mount a white unicorn named gesade white seemed to be the most common color among unicorns thanked her for her kindness to them rochinuviel rode away it was all very sedate and very little like what kellen had imagined it would be from the hints hed gathered around the edges of master belesharons tales at the house of sword and shield not that he expected everyone to be enjoying themselves no but this was the mustering of the army hed expected things to be noisier ive heard youre in trouble shalkan said when rochinuviel was out of earshot i am kellen said startled his partner had picked a fine time to mention it you are petariel said without turning from his position ahead of kellen one hopes you will return from your audience with redhelwar alive as your presence is entertaining one hears however that the absence of jermayan and ancaladar is because they have gone to sentarshadeen to negotiate a safe passage through the elven lands for the herdsfolkall of the herdsfolk and their beastsat your urging thats true kellen said he saw no reason to deny it one observes petariel said and there was a note of amusement in his voice now that no word of this reached your captainor the general of the armiesbefore the event now i forgive a knightmage all he went on holding up a hand knowing as i do that you are not truly one of us kellen nor precisely under my command but one wishes to observe that redhelwar is from windalorianan and has not lately been a part of the great events in sentarshadeen he will not yet have had the opportunity to become used to the ways of knightmages great in trouble again because i havent gone through proper channels can we watch gesade asked archly no rude one we may not watch petariel told his mount firmly kellen will explain his reasoning and his feeling that speed was of vital necessity in making this information known to andoreniel he and jermayan both acted properly as wildmages it is merely that we are not yet reaccustomed to the ways of wildmages i told you that you were in trouble shalkan said maybe kellen said he supposed he was in trouble if redhelwar wanted to make it trouble and not if not and petariel in the indirect fashion of elves had given him all the clues he needed to smooth matters over assuming he needed them but when he reached redhelwars tent almost an hour later after the parade was dismissed and hed unharnessed shalkan and located where he was supposed to go he found that idalia was there before him and seemed to have taken care of any feathersmoothing that needed doing i see you kellen knightmage i see you redhelwar armys general titles were rarely used among the elves and in the most formal usage they were placed last shalkan had coached him be welcome at my hearth now come and tell me everything you know of the enemy we face kellen stepped into the tent it was the same shade of red as redhelwars armor and surcoatwhich would have been unsettling without the bright golden light of the lanterns hung throughoutand large enough to hold a great many people at the center of the tent was a large table and pinned to it was a detailed map of the elven lands and much of the territory beyond there was the eastern ocean there was armethalieh the wildwoods the high reaches kellen looked down at it in delight hed learned to read maps at the house of sword and shield but this was the largest and most complete map hed yet seen this was the world or at least if not the world then a great deal more of it than he had ever seen before there was a small red dot in one place on the map this is the location of the one enclave of the shadowed elves that we know of redhelwar said i have asked idalia to draw as complete a map of the caverns as she can recall and i will ask the same of you so that we know all we can of the terrain before we attack but she tells me you have actually faced the creatures in battle yes kellen said he concentrated thinking back i got the impression that they were physically not as hardy as we are but if they have goblin blood their fangs or claws might carry poison for the next two hours redhelwar questioned kellen and idalia closely about their experiences in the caves then the noonday meal arrived and with it vestakia escorted by members of redhelwars personal staff kellen still had trouble reading the expressions of elves when they didnt want them read but he thought these two looked confused ah redhelwar said getting to his feetthe three of them had been sitting around the map tableand going over to vestakia here is the savior of the children of sentarshadeen the woman who helped kellen wildmage destroy the barrier that had plunged the elven lands into drought be welcome vestakia at my hearth he took her arm and ushered her into the tent kellen glanced at idalia idalia smirked it was pretty obvious that that little show hadnt been for vestakias benefit but for her escorts and it would be all over the camp within minutes to good effect if vestakia had been having any trouble up until now it had just been thoroughly and effectively quashed out here you couldnt get patronage with more clout than that of the commander of the army vestakias escort left and the service staff set out lunchbread soup and roast fowlon a second table thank you vestakia said looking up at him shyly i hope my presence hasnt caused anytrouble i will not have trouble in my army redhelwar said firmly and you are our greatest asset in this war besides he added with a faint smile no one could doubt one for whom the unicorns have vouched i was once a unicorn knight myself they would not thank me for doubting them now and their tongues are as sharp as their horns when they are annoyed now come eat i have many questions for you redhelwar said questions and he meant exactly that for this was an army in the field after the meal was cleared away he questioned vestakia until he knew as well as she did the extent and range of her abilities and how they worked it is a pity there is only one of you he said when he was satisfied for we could surely use more idalia does not think her magics will be of use in detecting the lairs of the shadowed elves i can try of course idalia said ill ask atroist to try too his powers may have more of an affinity for this sort of work since the lostlanders defend against dark magic all the time it will take four days to prepare the army to march see what you can do in that time redhelwar said meanwhile take my thanks for all the help you have given me it is invaluable for foreknowledge of the enemy is as important as any weapon it was a dismissal and they took it as such outside kellen began walking idalia and vestakia back to their pavilion shalkan told me i might be in trouble he said to idalia but i didnt see any sign of it i guess ive got you to thank for that you certainly do idalia said roundly if redhelwar werent reasonable and you werent a knightmageyou would have been in real deep trouble she shook her head with chagrin its as much my fault as yours i was so concerned about the safety of the herdingfolk that i didnt even think of that at the time military chain of command you and i were both thinking like civilians petariel says that wildmages are outside it technically which means jermayan wont be in for any trouble eitherhe sighedbut he and i both have to fight as part of the army so weve got to figure out a way to fit in and i guess that starts with not stepping on any more toes than necessary which means i should have told redhelwar what i was going to do if not exactly asked him for permission idalia agreed just so you know while hes not thrilled with the herdingfolk coming through elven lands he agrees that if thats the only way to gain the help of the lost lands wildmages its the best of our available choices but when jermayan and ancaladar finally returned a little before dusk it was apparent that not everyone shared redhelwars pragmatic outlook on matters the council debates jermayan said wearily the four friends were seated around the table in idalias pavilion sharing tea and the contents of a hamper of delicacies that jermayan had brought from sentarshadeen idalia had already set aside some of the sweet cakes for kellen to share with shalkan later kellen took a deep breath jermayan raised a minatory hand this time they will not be hurried you have pushed them a great deal in recent sennights and preparing for war has taxed their sensibilities to the utmost this newest matter is the gust of wind that lays bare the tree and if there is to be any hope of matters going as you would wish it they must go slowly but andoreniel kellen said sees the wisdom in your plan jermayan said soothingly as does ashaniel as does morusil and even belesharon and believe me his word carries great weight these and others speak as your advocates but the matter must be thoroughly discussed to be sure that all aspects of the situation are seen which means that there will probably be demons walking the streets of armethalieh before they come to a decision kellen thought uncharitably i am sure that atroist is anxious for word idalia suggested i do not expect it will take more than a moonturn for the council to provide andoreniel with the fruits of its deliberations in full and to provide its own solutions for the problems that it raises morusil has made the argument that in leaving the lostlanders available for them to prey upon we are allowing the enemy a source of strength and provision which it would be well to deny to them i believe that line of reasoning will influence the council in the end meanwhile we have battles of our own to fight four days later the elven army marched on the cavern of the shadowed elves idalia had done her best to try to detect other encampments of the creatures using the wild magic but had had no more luck than on previous occasions and vestakias power did not work at any great distance atroist had made the attempt as well both using the scrying bowl and using an instrument new to kellen and idalia something he called a hangingcrystal when not in use he wore it on a cord about his neck it looked to kellen like a clear teardropshaped keystone the narrow end wrapped with silver wire to make a loop for the cord to pass through but apparently it could be used to find things atroist demonstrated in idalias pavilion it found in succession a set of her hair combs kellens dagger and a pair of vestakias gloves all hidden in various places about the tent as a test when the crystal was working it would point directly toward the object even if it had to hover horizontally at the end of its cord to do so then they turned to the map without difficulty and with perfect accuracy the hanging crystal located ondoladeshiron sentarshadeen armethalieh and the wildwood but it was completely unable to locate any of the shadowed elf enclaves even the one they already knew about well idalia said with a sigh we tried i guess its up to you vestakia vestakia nodded grimly none of them were happy about this but none of them were surprised either just once kellen thought as he made his way back to his tent just once it would be so nice to be pleasantly surprised about something in this war the elven knights of five cities marched in force though not all of them would make the descent into the caverns once the caverns themselves had been cleansed kellen knew redhelwar intended to reclaim the bodies of their fallen comrades and fellow elves lost in the attack upon the caravan from sentarshadeen the unicorn knights rode nearly a mile ahead of the main army functioning as its scouts and trailblazers following a trail kellen had last ridden less than two moonturns before at the end of six days of traveling the unicorn knights reached the battlefield theyd seen no sign of coldwarg icetrolls or frostgiants and ancaladar had reported that the skies were clear of deathwings from here it was only two days to the shadowed elf caverns at the speed the army traveled to the unaided eye everything was pure and pristine the bodies buried beneath several feet of new snow but no one thought of it that way this was a haunted place drenched in blood and sorrow and would remain so forever in the memories of the elves ancaladar and jermayan circled low over the field the wind from the dragons wings stirring the loose surfacesnow into dancing veils a second circle and ancaladar headed westward again it looks as if theyll find us a place to lay our heads tonight gesade said stretching out her long elegant neck and shaking it useful things dragons i have never said dragons werent useful petariel said to his mount and if you could fly gesade theres a faint possibility you might someday be of some use as well the unicorn snorted and did not reply the campsite jermayan and ancaladar had found was kellen judgedperhaps three hours ride from the caverns in a sheltered valley surrounded by towering pines it was a large enough open space to hold their entire force and far enough away from the cavern that their arrival should not alert the shadowed elves once the army and the supply train arrived and the camp was in place redhelwar called his commandersand vestakia and the wildmagesto the command tent to make his final dispositions for the attack and to make certain that all the commanders had the opportunity to review the maps that kellen and idalia had prepared vestakia would be going into the caverns with them kellen was worried about that while tandarion had made her a fine suit of elven armor to protect herwith goldwashed vermilion enameling the precise shade of her skinshe did not have either fighting skills or wildmagery to protect her further but she was the only one who could sense the presence of the shadowed elves being able to see in the caverns was the major problem idalia and atroist had bespelled all the tarnkappa so that they granted darksight but they had only a couple of dozen of them such things were major workings and even with so many willing to share the mageprice there had been a limited amount of time to make them and the problem with tarnkappa was that they concealed you from friend as well as foe lanterns and torches were a possibility but they could be easily extinguished by the enemy magelight idalia said its a simple spell and not very costly and nobody will have to worry about carrying lanterns either magelight atroist asked looking puzzled this jermayan said he cupped his hands holding them a little apart the space between them grew misty then began to glow and in seconds he was holding a small blue ball of light he spread his hands and it floated up over his head ah atroist said in the lost lands we call that coldfire yes idalia an elegant solution it would be well to know that enough can be made in time redhelwar said it can be done jermayan said i will do it so that there is no cost there will be prices enough to pay for all by the time we are done ancaladar had told them that the shadowed elves moved by night so redhelwar made plans for a midmorning attack hoping to take them by surprise ancaladar said there were only two ways into the cavernsthe way he and kellen had taken to rescue idalia and the way she had taken to bring out the children based on the descriptions of both redhelwar elected to send the army in through the latter jermayan and ancaladar would go around by the back way meeting up with the main force as quickly as they could redhelwar elected to divide his force into four groups one the main force that would enter the caverns and mount the attack two a small force that would wait just outside the cavern mouth to secure it three a mobile force situated halfway between the caverns and the camp to secure the line of retreat and which could be called up quickly at need and four a sufficient force left behind to guard the camp in case the enemy was only waiting for them to leave to attack it considering the information they had availablewhich was very little kellen could find no fault with redhelwars dispositions he thought it would be more tactful to keep quiet about that fact though they left the camp an hour after sunrise heading for the caverns each of them had a ball of coldfire hovering over his or her head like a peculiar nimbus the radiance only a faint shimmer in the winter sunlight it would remain until jermayanor another wildmagedispersed it again kellen was grateful that shalkan didnt ask him if he was nervous he hardly knew whether he was or not his mind was filled with everything that could go wrong and a dull frustration that he hadnt thought of suggesting that someonehimdo a thorough scouting expedition of the caverns before they went in with their entire force but pulling back now would do more harm than good what information they might gain would be offset by the damage to the morale of the army and deep down kellen wasnt entirely certain that redhelwar would have taken his suggestion that was the real problem the elves honored him they respected him but kellen didnt set policy for the nine cities he didnt plan strategy for the army and he didnt have a real voice in the tactics it would use yet yet the sudden thoughtno realizationstartled him so much that he tensed all over shalkan craned his head around to gaze curiously at him but kellen shook his head wordlessly and shalkan went back to gazing at the path ahead yes yet there would come a timethere needed to come a timewhen the army did what kellen said not what redhelwar said buthe remembered the lesson of the crowned hornsyou couldnt command that sort of trust you needed to earn it he needed to earn it and fast then andoreniel would give him the army redhelwar would step aside without anger the army would follow him if he was good enough if he could prove he could lead an army and keep it alive and win if he could prove that being a knightmage made him understand strategy as instinctively as he understood fighting oneonone one single moment of blind panic touched him i dont know how to do that but he did gan had taught him xaqiue had taught him master belesharons story songs had taught him win a battle command a troopand win command a larger detachmentand win win always planand show them his plans were better than theirs and make the elves see him as a knightmage first and a young human second better yet get to the point where they looked at him and saw only the knightmage and the young human not at all and the first thing he needed to do to accomplish all that was to get through today here we are shalkan said the unicorn knights who had been chosen for the assault had ridden a little ahead of the main body of fighters now they dismounted to allow their mounts to get clear of the main army the cavern mouth was empty and there were no footprints on the snow that lay before it kellen shifted to battlesight for a moment but saw no sign of a trap that didnt make a lot of sense the shadowed elves must know their lair had been discovered any sensible creature would have posted guards or blocked the entrance somehow but they hadnt is everything well petariel asked much too well kellen answered grimly its as if they cant imagine we could possibly ever come back maybe they left petariel suggested vestakia will tell us soon enough adaerion was at the head of the force that arrived a few moments later redhelwar was waiting with the mobile forcethe general of the army was too valuable to lose vestakia rode beside him and kellen could tell with just one look at her postureuncomfortably hunched overthat the shadowed elves had not left theyre still there he said ah petariel said following the direction of kellens gaze well i should hate to have ridden all this way for nothing they formed up in the way they had planned at the war council the night before kellen and an elf called celegaer adaerions lieutenant would go first with vestakia and idalia directly behind them vestakia would give warning the moment she sensed the presence of the shadowed elves leaf and star be with you all adaerion said gravely kellen nodded forcing himself to wait until celegaer took the first step toward the cavern before following he kept himself from looking toward vestakia and idaliaor any of his comrades from the house of sword and shield barring a miracle this was the last time some of them would see the light of day this was a war fighters died in war get used to it kellen walked into the dark the magelight seemed to glow brighter the further they went along the passage until it was the only illumination the elves moved silently but he could hear the faint rustle of idalias clothing and every sound that vestakias armor made suddenly vestakia gave a gagging whimper theyre hereahead she choked out the passage widens just ahead kellen said quickly to celegaer hurry we cant let them trap us here without waiting to hear celegaers reply he ran forward at the end of the passageway wider corridors opened out to the left and right just as idalia had described they were crowded with the shadowed elves too many to easily countand this time the creatures were armed not to capture a dragon but to fight the shadowed elves wore bits and pieces of looted armor lashed to their bodies with strips of leather but ragged and mismatched as their armor was their weaponry was in gleaming earnest swords and shieldsspears and bows kellen dropped into battlemind without thought he raised his shield and the first of the small deadly arrows fired out of the dark glanced off it the shadowed elves swarmedthere was no other word to describe their movementforward they obviously didnt like the light but they werent blinded by it as some of the elves had hoped kellen cut down the creatures before him and pressed forward he and celegaer trying to clear the way for the elves that were moving up behind them but he quickly realized that their tactics werent working individually the shadowed elves were comparatively frail but they were attacking in enormous numbers taking advantage of the cramped tunnelsand what was worse they werent limited to the floor of the caverns they climbed along the walls and ceiling dropping into the middle of their foes to bear the elves down by sheer weight of numbers by ones and twos it was nothing to kill them but they werent attacking by ones and twos kellen fought on moving deeper into the righthand cavern at the spearhead of a group of knights up ahead the shadowed elf archers were firing with deadly accuracy he could see the arrows glowing dull green in his battlesight and knew from that that the arrows were poisoned he would have shouted a warning but it would have gone unheard the cavern was filled with the screams of the injured the clash of weapons and the hoarse howls and barking of the shadowed elves kellen shut out the noise and concentrated on his task cut step turn and cut again block attack dodge celegaer was on his left another knight was at his back one of the shadowed elves dropped down on him from above kellen grunted bending forward with the impact turning the move into a forward throw to dislodge the creature he felt the wind of an arrow pass his cheek there was a muffled grunt behind him kellen heardand feltthe elven knight fall to the floor of the cavern and die he killed the creature on the ground and moved forward at last the elves superior battle skills and heavier more effective armor turned the tide the battlefield opened up and it soon became a matter of keeping the shadowed elves from escaping and then it came to executing the enemy wounded and checking the dead and that was when kellen found himself just standing there sword hanging from his limp grip staring at an empty tunnel kellen celegaer laid a gentle hand upon his shoulder go back and rest for a moment then ask idalia if vestakia is well enough to come forward kellen blinked feeling almost as if he were rousing from a deep sleep he nodded and turned away he had to move carefully through the piles of corpses and the stone was slick with blood it soaked the bodies lying in it staining them all elf and shadowed elf alike the same terrible scarlet color the blue globes of coldfireso many in such a confined spacemade the scene shadowless and stark grief and shame hovered over the battlefield like carrion birds kellen had expected the griefthere were too many elven dead and he knew that soon he would be mourning the loss of friendsbut shame he did not understand theyd fought well theyd won there was no cause for shame was there at the end of the corridor he found petariel the captain of the unicorn knights had been wounded a spear had taken him just behind the knee at one of the weak points of the elven armor he leaned against the wall a makeshift bandage over his wound his helmet beneath his arm and to kellens astonishment he was weeping oh kellen our poor cousins leaf and star that we should be driven to this petariel said kellen had no idea what he meant but there would be time later to figure it out come on he said getting an arm under petariels shoulders lets get you out of here gesade and shalkan both would have my head if i let anything happen to you petariel laughed raggedly but it ended on a strangled sob the worst has already happened he said softly kellen halfcarried petariel back up the passageway he felt a deep pang of relief to see idalia and vestakia both there unhurtand quickly focused all of his attention on petariel lest his worry for vestakias safety turn into something he must not feel right now ah another one idalia said lightly the stretcherbearers will be back in just a moment i can walk petariel said grimly no you cant idalia said firmly not if you want to be riding again soon kellen helped petariel to lie down among the other wounded there were several healers working in the narrow space and a constant stream of the walking wounded were moving out toward the open air everything was moving so slowly but that was why the shadowed elves didnt bother with guards kellen now realized they were sure no one could attack them in force once he was sure his emotions were under control he risked a glance at vestakia vomit stained the front of her surcoat and she knelt beside idalia obviously dazed and exhausted by the presence of so much taint kellen sighed reluctantly celegaer needs vestakia he said to idalia now idalia asked im ready vestakia said valiantly raising her head there were deep shadows beneath her eyes and she looked haggard not yet soon he told me to rest kellen added trying to make a joke of it as if you would idalia said handing him a waterskin are you hurt kellen shook his head and drank the water was warm but it was unicornpure he felt better afterward i think they threw most of what they had at us some of them got away though well have to find them kellen said that will be my job vestakia said bravely come on then kellen said gruffly sounding far more brusque than he wanted to but he couldnt help it he felt as if he had no energy to spare for anything idalia and vestakia followed him back into the cavern celegaer and several of the others were waiting for them just past the end of the bodies all of them had the faintly stunned air of grief about them that kellen had noticed before vestakia celegaer said seeing her are you well well enough to do what you ask of me vestakia answered steadily then find our foe celegaer said without hesitation vestakia pointednot along the corridor but at the corridor wall the corridor curves idalia said thats the direction of the cavern village there will be females and young there she warned we can leave none alive celegaer said wearily i know idalia said gently celegaer kellen said if i can suggest now we know where the village is and vestakia is too valuable to risk send her outside to wait with adaerion until we think we have cleared the cavern then bring her in to check to see if we have missed anyone no vestakia protested yes celegaer said an excellent suggestion kellen padredor escort mistress vestakia back to adaerion and order the rest of the knights to come forward idalia wildmage will you also withdraw no idalia said taking a moment to consider i think i can be useful here chapter fourteen blood and sorrow calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink soon they were moving forward again only about half their original force remained there were not many dead considering the savagery of the battle but there were many wounded and though some of the wounds were minor celegaer had not wanted to take wounded elves into battle were too spread out and theres no way to avoid it in these tunnels all the advantage is theirs kellen thought were going to have to figure out how to fight this kind of battlefastin order to win it at last the tunnel widened out into the great cavern that idalia had described with the narrow pathway leading around the rim and the stairs going down to the village below the cavern was so vast that the coldfire coronas of the assembled army did nothing more than light their immediate surroundings all they could see of what was below was the faint glow of the central firepit with a flick of her hand idalia sent her ball of coldfire out to hover over the cavern the light was faint but enough to show that the crude stone village below was silent and still ambush kellen said with utter certainty you can sense them celegaer asked with surprise no kellen said but i know theyre waiting for us all the same or waiting for us to go away either course would gain them a victory of a sort celegaer answered so we go down but not unwarily archersto the rim once the archers were in place the elven knights began descending the stair it would have been the perfect place for an ambush but the shadowed elves did not take advantage of it when the first group of elves was at the bottom of the staircase their combined coldfire illuminated the cavern giving kellen a good look at it for the first time it was as large as merryvalethe entire village could have been dropped down neatly inside it walls and all there were scattered small huts and along the cavern wall kellen could see holesthey reminded him uncomfortably of very large ratholesin the rock the elves stood silent motionless what are they waiting for kellen wondered he wasnt looking forward to this any more than they were but it wouldnt get any easieror any betterif they waited and where were jermayan and ancaladar he looked toward celegaer celegaer met his gaze and there was despair in the black eyes after a moment celegaer spoke search every structure every hole find them all down to the smallest infant kill them all no survivors no prisoners the elven commanders voice was harsh he turned away striding toward the nearest hut the elves fanned out spreading across the cavern floor for a moment there was silence then celegaer screamed and the cavern exploded in a harsh babble of barks and whines kellen ran in the direction of the scream he was too late celegaer was dead his face and the front of his armor eaten away by a liquid thrown at him by a shadowed elf female who had just come out of the stone hut the archers on the rim had filled her body with arrows but they had been too late to save their commander celegaers troops were staring down at him in shock and horror search the hut kellen ordered keep your shields forwardwe know they use poison as a weaponnow we know they use acid too he moved on quickly heading for the next hut the doorway was low he had to duck to get inside it was one room windowless and it stank it contained a pile of furs and three small children i cant do this kellen thought in sick horror he knew they werent childrenthey were shadowed elvesbut they were young things very young they hissed at him cringing back from the light then suddenly all three of them shrieked and sprang at him there was no fear in their bulging pale eyes only the berserker madness of cornered rats they swarmed up his body scrabbling for every purchase clawing and biting at everything they could reach reflexively kellen knocked them away but they kept coming back he could see their glistening needlelike teeth smell their rank poisontainted breath no matter how many times he flung them away from him they sprang up and lunged for him again then one of them pulled kellens dagger free of its sheath it was an elven dagger made of deadly elvensteel and designed to pierce any opening or weakness in the elven armors defenses seeing the length of gleaming steel in the young things hands made all of his battlehoned instincts rouse at once they werent children anymorethey were the enemy with a gasping cry he struck the shadowed elf child as hard as he could then grabbed the other two and flung them against the walls of the hut stunning them then he took his sword and killed them all bile rose in his throat as he retrieved his dagger and kellen breathed deeply trying to center himself again but the selfforgiveness he sought would not come he had killed children how could he accept that i will have to find a way or not and whether i can or not finding out if i can will have to wait because my comrades are dying now gritting his teeth kellen left the hut all around him the battle was going badly there werent as many of the enemy this time but the elves were taking terrible losses they simply couldnt bring themselves to attack and kill what they sawdespite everythingas women and children and it was costing them dearly suddenly the cavern was ablaze with lightas bright as the noonday sun at midsummer kellen looked up and saw that the entire roof of the cavern was glowing with bright blue coldfire jermayan and ancaladar had arrived pull back im going to burn the huts jermayans voice spoke quietly as if in his ear and kellen could tell by the startled expressions on the faces of the elves that everyone else had heard it too they began to retreat but it was easier asked than done especially when they had to protect their wounded and recover their dead and it was several minutes of hard and bloody fighting before that could be accomplished the shadowed elves fought viciously as much like animalsor insectsas like thinking beings they did not seem to care if they sacrificed any of their owndown to the smallest infantif it brought them a greater chance of killing one of the elves in cold disbelief kellen saw the shadowed elf archers using their own young as shields saw children younger than the ones hed killed springing upon elven warriors armed with jars of acid like the one that had killed celegaer he dragged one of the elves out of the way just in time striking his young attacker dead the spilled liquid fumed and bubbled over the corpse smoking and stinking the elves were barely clear of the huts fighting their way toward the staircase when suddenly every stone structure within the cavern save for the staircase burst into flame that isnt possible thought kellen in awe any wildmage or high mage could summon firebut only to burn what would burn naturally but this the stone itself was burning as if it were seasoned wood drenched in lamp oil in seconds a roaring wall of heat separated the combatants from their prey shadowed elvesbodies aflameran from some of the huts only to be cut down by the archers in mercy the shadowed elves who had not been in the huts were trapped by the walls of flame their response to the sudden wave of magic was one of utter terror the archers who had been holding living shields threw them down and tried to flee but there was nowhere to go save into the elven army it was no longer a battle but a massacre some of the shadowed elves ran toward the flames kellen saw females grab struggling children and throw them into burning huts the structures already collapsing into ash the archers shot all they could before the flames took them it was over quickly the huts were gone the stone burned away to ash a wall of icy air filled the cavern wiping away the furnace heat the stone floor creaked and groaned forced to cool as quickly as it had been heated ancaladar launched himself from the rim of the cavern landing in the nowempty space kellen glanced around quickly feeling a deep pang of relief to see that idalia was still on her feet though her garments were tattered and bloodsoaked and her face was grim all of the elves looked stunned theyd won the battle but at a terrible cost both physical and spiritual which is what shadow mountain wants kellen realized with a flash of insight thats what this war is about its just another kind of drought the last one starved the land this one starves the spirit realizing that he felt his own soulsickness ease hed hated what hed done here today with all his being but it had been necessary the shadowed elves were demonic in nature they were creatures of the endarkened created as a trap for the creatures of the light to show them mercy would be to doom the light i pity them because i think they have no choice to be other than what they are and i forgive them because they have no choice but i have a choice to fight for what i think is right and i also forgive myself for making it but the elvesoh it was different for them not only had they been killing women and children they had been killing kin blood of their blood tainted but still their own i have to figure out how to take that guilt away from them kellen took a few steps toward jermayan and ancaladar it took you long enough kellen said he could sense the tension of the elvesnormal wildmagery was one thing but what theyd just seen went far beyond that we were hunting shadowed elves ancaladar said in his deep soft voice and a way here that i could pass through was hard to find jermayan was looking past kellen searching the armored figures for familiar forms he came over to kellen celegaer he asked in a low voice dead kellen said vestakia is waiting outside with adaerion and the reserves we didnt want to risk her better she not see this jermayan said grimly kellen idalia said coming up her voice echoed in the empty space i hate to say this but celegaer is dead padredor is badly wounded and so is tinbendon they cant find perchalas and youre a knightmage kellen looked from jermayan to idalia not understanding you are the ranking officer able to command jermayan said quietly what do we do hed wanted the job he just hadnt expected to get it now can you widen the steps to the surface we need to transport the dead and wounded he said he doesnt ask much does he ancaladar commented yes jermayan said answering kellen jermayan stretched out his hand and the steps blurred for a moment kellen thought there must be something wrong with his vision but when it steadied again he could see that the steps were wider than before as broad and easy as any grand staircase in a high mages house kellen stared at jermayan and ancaladar his emotions in turmoil awe yes and not a little fear not of his friends but this was power out of legend out of wondertales it comes at a price jermayan said quietly yes kellen said if no other price than the price of being set apart from everything normal and familiar by living in a world you could reshape with a thought cover our retreat he said to jermayan and ancaladar then get out yourselves i think we got them all but we wont know until vestakia tells us he turned and went back to the others gather up the dead prepare the wounded for transport were leaving kellen had learned by watching that a good commander gave an order and left the details to his subordinates he did nothing to interfere with the arrangements for departure he was busy enough helping to bandage the wounded neither he nor idalia dared to risk any healingsthough everyone there would have been willing to share the price they had been fighting all day and it would have been cruel to ask it nor did either wildmage dare to risk deeper exhaustion and incurring magedebt themselves but jermayan was not so bound he moved among the injured healing the worst of the injuries until kellen saw him stagger with weariness as he rose from beside a supine body a dragons power might be inexhaustible but a mage was not stop it kellen said quietly going over and putting a hand under jermayans arm we need you to be able to fight if you have to thats more important more important than their lives jermayan demanded in an anguished whisper theyll be with the healers soon kellen said and if you cannot fight when we need you we may all die he did not know where the words were coming from they were harsh and brutal but they seemed to be the right thing to say for jermayan nodded slowly and walked back to where ancaladar waited the elves began moving up the newlybroadened staircase carrying those too injured to walkand the deadin makeshift slings formed of cloaks and surcoats they carried the shadowed elf dead with them as well all that they had been able to recover kellen was surprised at that but had said nothing he would never he realized truly understand the elves even if he lived among them for the rest of his life kellen was the last up the stairs at the top he stopped and looked back the cavern was utterly empty save for jermayan and ancaladar and a fine coating of grey ash upon the floor it was twilight by the time kellen stepped into the open air again the corridors through which he had passed had been utterly empty the elves and the shadowed elves were gone and only spilled blood remained the army had moved more slowly as the corridor narrowed and the slower kellen moved the more it seemed he could feel exhaustion dragging at his limbs when they reached the narrow corridor to the outside he simply stopped leaning against the wall and resting until idalia came back for him we thought you might have gotten lost she said handing him a wooden cup kellen shook his head wordlessly the cup held hot cider he drained it in a few quick gulps vestakia he asked she doesnt sense any taint from where she is which is good redhelwar wants her to go down to be sure but that can wait until tomorrow if you agree if i agree when had redhelwar started consulting him she doesnt sense anything how close is she kellen asked right outside idalia said she said she could feel it when idalia stopped when wed killed all of them down in the cavern kellen said gently maybe she should go up to the other entrance now and check there just to be sure but i dont think any of them ran come on then youll need to make your report the reserve force had been brought up and transport wagons were being used to carry away the wounded the dead to whom time no longer mattered lay in neat rows in the snow waiting to be carried away in their turn kellen looked awaythere would be time enough later to find out who had died today globes of coldfire interspersed with more conventional lanterns flickered over the landscape lending the twilight an ethereal insubstantial quality as if he were in a waking dreamor a nightmare idalia led him toward redhelwar the general was seated on his bay destrier vestakia at his side on a cream palfrey her eyes widened in horror at the sight of him i will not ask you for a detailed report now kellen knightmage redhelwar said but i will need a preliminary one we entered the cavern village kellen said it was occupied by females and young as well as by the survivors of the first attackmostly archers i think they hid until we entered the village and started going into the huts they attacked us with acid and poison weapons jermayan and ancaladar arrived and set fire to the village and we did what wed set out to do celegaer is dead two of his lieutenants were badly injured and the third is missing so we left redhelwar nodded do you believe that more of the creatures may be in hiding elsewhere in the caverns he asked no kellen said shaking his head you didnt see how they came after us im sorry but i dont think any of them wanted to get away from the fight except at the very end and then they couldnt but id like vestakia to go up to the other entrancethe one that ancaladar usesand see what she can sense there just to be sure yes best to be as sure as we can without going back inside tonight arambor find horses for the wildmages and gather a party while the horses were being brought kellen took the opportunity to clean the worst of the blood from his sword it felt good to be able to sheathe it again he wished shalkan could be with him but that simply wasnt possible the horses were led forwardidalia had her own palfrey but the mare brought for kellena dapple grey with a white mane and tailwas a stranger to him he took a moment to stroke her neck reassuringly before swinging into the saddle blessing all those hours of lessons with deyishene her name is mindaerel redhelwar said she has lost a friend this day he paused and added heavily as have we all celegaer was her rider kellen nodded hed seen the closeness of the bond between jermayan and valdien more like that between dog and master than between horse and rider what would happen to all the elven warhorses bereft of their closest companions by the battle today he urged mindaerel forward to his relief she obeyed without hesitation if she was in some form of equine mourning she didnt show it unbidden the thought came to him she is a warrior too he dropped into battlemind easily scanning the terrain ahead for any sign of ambush and saw nothing when they were still half a mile from the cave opening he saw ancaladar push himself out through it springing upward into the sky kellen waved hailing the pair and ancaladar dipped a wing in reply the small party reached the cliff face high above there was a dragonsized opening in the sheer icecovered expanse of rock anything kellen asked vestakia concentrated she looked as if she were listening very hard although listening was not precisely what she was doing nothing vestakia said after a long pause she burst into tears and idalia moved to comfort her it was nearly midnight by the time kellen was able to settle into his tent at last he wasnt alone shalkan had joined him as much for emotional support as because it was freezing outside kellen was happy to have him there for both reasons the unicorns body helped raise the temperature in the tent appreciably kellen had discussed the days events with his friend already settling them in his mind so that he could work through them when there was leisure to if there ever was but a few things still puzzled him shalkan what did the elves do with all those bodiesthe shadowed elf ones i mean they went to so much trouble to get themthey brought all of them out of the caverns and back here i saw them but later theyd disappeared the unicorn snorted gently and snuggled closer to kellen they did with them just what they did with their own dead they took them into the forest and suspended them in the trees you can go and see tomorrow if you like kellen twitched no thanks but why you have to think like an elf if they buried them it would shut the spirit away from the wind and the sun if they burned them well that would be rather hard on the trees that were felled to make the pyres and if they floated them down rivers it would take their dead far away from home and hearth as for why theyre treating the shadowed elves the same way theyre treating their own dead well you saw how they acted today yes it waskellen groped for wordsstrange i didnt understand it surely they realize that the shadowed elves arent really elves shalkan made a hrumphing noise what if idalia did something really horrible but she wouldnt kellen protested automatically but imagine if she did how would you feel kellen thought about it first he had to imagine idalia being somebody else entirelybut feeling just the same way about her then he imagined her doing something awful i guess id feel but i still dont he faltered to you the shadowed elves are creatures of the dark to the elves they are elvesdebased tainted and twisted but elves nonetheless nothing you or i or anyone else can say or do will change that feeling and so they feel responsible which is just what they want kellen said feeling sick i know shalkan answered the following day kellen and a party of elves entered the caverns once more vestakia in the lead this time redhelwar accompanied themit was necessary the elven general said to see firsthand the terrain over which he would be sending armies to fight in the future once more jermayan and ancaladar entered the caverns from the other direction the two groups met at the site of the village cavern the coldfired ceiling still burned brightly over the cavern where the village had been eventually it would go out by itself if jermayan did not extinguish it but coldfireor magelightwas such a simple spell that such castings were often left to run out by themselves redhelwar looked down into the cavern in silence vestakia shook her head nothing she said sounding relieved by the end of the day they had explored a great deal of the cave system they found several more areas that the shadowed elves had used for various purposesstorerooms larders middensbut no further sign of the creatures themselves and thankfully no prisoners kellen didnt think that anything could be held prisoner here for long and still be sane at last everyone agreed that this cavern system was empty of shadowed elves and now redhelwar said we must find their next lair a message has come from andoreniel in sentarshadeen grander said marlen sarlin erlock jarel you must go to the other households today and tell them there will be a council at the meeting house tonight a message cilarnen asked how could a message come now not only had it been snowing for some timeand centaurs as he already knew did not think winter a suitable time for travelingbut a messenger would have come first to granders house and grander would have insisted on feeding him and cilarnen saw no stranger faces gathered around the table for the noonday meal what bird flies in winter sarlin answered gaily and the others laughed if elves never asked questionsand cilarnen realized thinking back that hyandur had never asked him a single question on the entire journey to stonehearththe beastfolk seemed to more than make up for it and worse think a question was as good as an answer it was only one of their many annoying qualities cilarnen knew hed been very lucky to be taken in at stonehearth winter without weatherspells to tame it was a terrifying thing without granders kindnessyes kindness and charity toohe would be dead by now but while he could manage to be polite he could not manage to feel gratitude what made it worse was that he knew that the beastfolk were treating him far better than the armethaliehans would have treated one of them if the situation were reversed he was honest enough to admit that even if he refused to say it aloud grander had even helped him barter his few personal possessionshis signet ring his goldandsapphire chain his pencase and penknife and the handful of silver and copper coins in his pocketsto buy himself suitable garments in the days after his arrival so that he would not start his time in stonehearth too deeply in debt to granders house hed had to pay a harnessmakerwho had used his city boots as a templateto make him suitable footwear but sarlin had made his new clothes without charging him for her labor and enough gold left over to buy cloth for summer clothes shed said proudly when she presented his new outfit to him a sennight after his arrival unless youll be wanting to buy something else keep it cilarnen had said ungraciously staring at the bizarre garments what is there here that anyone could want to buy shed looked hurt and his conscience had pricked him im sure you know what i need better than i do hed said hed struggled to find something to praise grateful in that moment that no one hed ever known would see him wearing them the workmanship is very fine ah sarlin had said perking up spun and wove it myself from our own sheep you wont find better and i only charged you what id charge familynot what i could get for it at spring fair either thats very kind hed said as it seemed to be expected do you need help with them you not being used to our wild ways and all oris your head paining you again no ii will manage excuse me with the bundle of cloth in his arms cilarnen had fled to his room and quickly closed the door his new quarters were much smaller than the chamber he had shared with hyandur there were hooks on the walls to hold his few garments and a pallet on the floor for sleeping there was a chaira welcomegift from marlenand a small chest which held a washbasin and a chamberstick there was no stove as the room backed on the great hearths chimney and so was usually warm enough cilarnen had flung the armful of clothing down on his pallet and pulled out one of the drawers of the chest inside was a small glass phial halffull of a brown liquid so dark it was almost black hed regarded it longingly for a moment then put it back in the drawer and closed it again the first day when sarlin had taken him to the centaur healer only the hope that the concoction would poison him on the spot had induced cilarnen to try her remedy the syrup she compounded was bitter dark and thick as honey but it had stopped the headaches completely a spoonfulno morenight and morningwill stop the pain do not take more young human for it has dreamhoney in it and it will make you thickwitted and scatterbrained hed ignored her prohibition once hed never been tempted to repeat the experiment no matter how much he craved oblivion for whatever dreamhoney might be the dreams it brought with it when he took too much werent nice ones hed sighed and looked at the clothes there was no point in putting it off he might as well look as if he belonged here that had been a moonturn ago one morning he had awakened at dawn in a fullblown panic and only after several minutes of thought had he realized that this must be his day to go to the temple of the light and change out his city talisman only he didnt have his talisman and they werent likely to let him back into the city now were they after that things got easier his days settled into a routine of choresonce marlen saw that cilarnen was steady and trustworthy he left more and more of the work of the stables to him a stables built to accommodate the needs of centaurs was an oddlooking thing and of course the horses were draft horses not riding horseswhat would centaurs need with riding horsesbut the animals were of good quality and cilarnen got on with them well enough but what does king andoreniel say father sarlin demanded bringing cilarnen back to the present you will find out soon enough grander said firmly on sarlins way out the door cilarnen stopped her grander had been very mysterious about this message and cilarnen no longer had any taste for mystery is andoreniel your king he asked sarlin stared at him for a moment her broad face blank with surprise oh she said at last but how could you know you are from the human city after all no andoreniel is the king of the elves and before cilarnen could think of another question to ask she was gone on her errand he was not permitted to attend the council of course he found out soon enough what it was about as centaurs werent a terribly secretive lotthe elven king was calling for the centaurs to honor an ancient treaty and send troops to his aidbut what no one would ever quite explain was why they all said things like andoreniel wouldnt ask without good reason or we must honor our treaty or he would come if we asked until cilarnen wasnt sure whether the centaurs knew why they were going or not or whether they just didnt trust him enough to tell him what he did know was that it was some kind of emergency that couldnt wait until spring and better weather for traveling and that one of the units would be mustering here at stonehearth before traveling on the whole village threw itself into preparationspacks must be sewn storm cloaks reoiled armor looked to iceboots fitted provisions sorted out and marlen seemed determined to spend every moment he wasnt training to go with them cramming every possible detail of what to do for the horses in any conceivable emergency into cilarnens head because cilarnen wasnt going it wasnt that he wanted to go it was just that he hated being dismissed as if he were useless and not that a bunch of talking animals were his friends of course but hed gotten used to marlen and grander and to all of the others who were leaving after they were gone things would be different and all of the changes cilarnen had experienced recently had not been good ones there was almost enough work to keep him from thinking of things like that though until the day when stonehearths gates were thrown open to the visitors a messengera centaur this timehad arrived the day before to bring word of their arrival and so by the time the troop cantered up the great feast was nearly ready every house had been cooking and baking since the night before and the entire village smelled like a cookshop this afternoon there would be a great feast in the village squarehed heard the hammering all morning as the trestle tables were knocked togetherand tonight every home would hold visitors for stonehearth would be hosting fifty guests and tomorrow they would all be gone maybe ill just stay here until its all over cilarnen thought leaning his head against the flank of a grey mare shed been out in the paddock all morning and her thick winter coat was clotted with ice it needed careful brushingbut he had been at stonehearth nearly two moonturns now and in that time he had become an excellent ostler he still wondered why the centaurs didnt just hitch themselves to the plows maybe they did maybe they used the horses for something else hed undoubtedly get the chance to find out if this lightblasted snow ever melted he hadnt thought it was possible to be so cold and even if his gift hadnt been excised there wouldnt be much he could do about the weather hed been an entered apprentice you had to be a master undermage to do something about the weather he finished with the mare and looked about for something else to do shaking his head at the centaurs foolishness an outdoor banquet in winter without mages to work the weather theyd all freeze cilarnen sarlin came trotting into the stable her cheeks flushed pink with the cold come and see the troop has arrivedand its nearly noon youll want to have a wash before the banquet and i made you a new tunic a gift he was unreasonably touched he knew that sarlin saved much of the money she earned from the sale of her cloth and finished clothingshe owned cilarnen had been surprised to discover her own flock of sheepto go toward her bridemoney which she would use to help set up her own household when she married well id better not wear it then he said gruffly to hide his feelings it will only be ruined by the snow that will undoubtedly fall today whoever heard of eating outdoors in winter but sarlin only laughed merrily oh dont be foolish cityman they have brought a wildmage with them and he has done magic so that the weather will be fine a wildmage she might have said a demon of the dark and cilarnen would not have been less stunned except he didnt believe in demons and he did believe in wildmages hed heard rumors that farmer kellens disappearance had had something to do with wildmagery he hadnt believed them at the time but what if they were true and what if kellen had escaped the city just as he had if kellen was here he was definitely the last person cilarnen wanted to see and he certainly didnt want to see a wildmage whether it was kellen or not but sarlin had him by the arm and was tugging him determinedly toward the house so it was follow gracefully or be stepped on by great lumping centaur hooves and they had to pass through the village square on the way to granders house despite himself he looked for the wildmage and saw him too he was easy to spotthe only human in the great jostling press of centaurs to cilarnens relief it wasnt kellen but a muscular fellow with a great black beard wearing a large broadbrimmed hat and a fur cloak looking more barbaric than the talking beasts surrounding him do you want to meet him sarlin asked eagerly slowing down his name is wirance he comes from high reaches in the mountains we trade with the high reaches at midsummer fairtheyre all humans there do you think youd like to live in the high hills i hear it snows all the time there come on cilarnen demanded and this time it was he who dragged sarlin away the new tunic was very fine cilarnen regarded it with a dull anger that he had not felt since he had first come to stonehearth it was of the softest thickest lambswool tightly woven and dyed a deep russet red a cloth that would have fetched a premium price even in armethalieh sarlin had said that the centaurs traded with the mountain folk armethalieh traded with the mountain folk as well he wondered how many times before in his life hed worn cloth woven by centaurs and not known it the front and sleeves were covered with delicate painstaking embroidery sarlins finest work this he knew would never have been permitted in the citythe colors were too exotic the pattern of fruits and flowers and birds like nothing hed ever seen before it was beautiful he hated he didnt know what he hated but right now cilarnen desperately wanted to hate something there just didnt seem to be any suitable candidates he thought he could manage to hate the elves if he worked at it for a while since hyandur was an elf and it was hyandurs fault he was here and now king andoreniel another elfwas taking away most of the male centaurs from the village and it was andoreniels fault a wildmage was here as well but hyandur had saved cilarnens life risking not only his but roirys and pearls lives as well and you couldnt expect elves to know that the wild magic was well wrong or is it just wrong in the city a small voice inside him asked cilarnen shook his head wasnt wrong in one place wrong everywhere he wished there was someone he could ask he stripped down and washed quickly then put on his new tunic sarlin would want to know how he liked it it is the most beautiful thing ive ever owned why did the truth seem like a betrayal of something to which he no longer felt any loyalty to cilarnens great relief he was placed far away from wirance at the banquet among younger sons and apprentices where he sufferedin silencemuch goodhearted teasing about his new tunic his head was starting to acheas it hadnt in longer than he could rememberand he took great advantage of the pitchers of mulled ale that were kept constantly filled he still hated the taste but hed come to like its effect he had no idea whether stonehearth was large for a centaur village or not it was tiny by the standards of armethalieh and maybe even by the standards of the delfier valley farming villages and so the square was completely filled with the banquet tables the village gates had even been left open to make more roomwhich was just as well or else the apprentices would have been crammed against the walls as it was cilarnen was in a certain amount of danger of being kicked and jostled by his fellows but centaurs were much smaller than the draft horses he tended daily and he could hardly remember when hed stopped worrying about it he was intent upon his foodand wondering if he could slip away to the stables without anyone noticingwhen a stranger appeared at the gates even for one of the talking beasts his appearance was outlandish he wore armor but not the simple steel that the other centaurs wore over a heavy woolen tunic he wore a shirt that seemed to be made of disks of metal sewn together it dangled down almost to his knees in front and spread across his withers behind he wore a sword as well hung parallel along his body in the way that cilarnen had seen other centaurs carry swords about his hips he wore a wide belt to which was affixed a number of small pouches as well as a host of other ornaments that flashed and jingled around his neck over the armor was a necklace containing more such ornaments and still more were braided into his waistlength hair his hair was black with a broad white streak in it and despite the weather he wore no cloak against the cold though cilarnen could see one along with a small packlashed upon his back three of his feet were white and one was black he carried a long staff in one hand although cilarnen couldnt imagine why a centaur would need one seeing that cilarnen was staring in the direction of the snowcovered fields one of the other apprentices looked up it is kardus wildmage he said kardus wildmage has come to join us there was a great bustle as two of the apprenticestolin and barcistrotted forward to greet kardus cilarnen hunched down in his seat hoping they would escort the new arrival to the high table where the esteemed guests were being feted if he was a wildmageimpossible as that seemedundoubtedly they would want to honor him but to cilarnens dismay kardus seemed to wish to sit with the apprentices and worse next to the only human among them him in armethalieh mages were treated with dignity and proper respect apparently no one here had ever heard of that notion before kardus had even removed his winter gauntlets and had a place laid for himor gotten a mug of alethe apprentices were pelting him with questions like the rowdy colts and fillies that they were where had he come from who had he seen what was the news was he going to the elven lands with captain kindrius and master grander how can you be a wildmage i thought centaurs couldnt do magic cilarnen said goaded out of his silence and so i cannot young human kardus said goodnaturedly but i study the three books and the great herdsman has given me the ability to know things unseen and so i go where i am needed and do what i am given to set my hand to and just as with my greater brethren with each knowing comes a task and do you have an er knowing and a task now cilarnen asked the others all stared at him as if shocked by his presumption but it was what they all wanted to know wasnt it perhaps it would be best not to pluck that fruit before it ripens kardus answered calmly reaching for the platter of roast meat in front of him and now the news from merryvale the village flourishes and jenna has accepted alfrin so you may look for a great festival at midsummer fair a new dozen of skeps have been put up and miele has split her swarm so there will be more honey soon for you greedy ones if you have sugar to trade as he spoke of the news from merryvalewhere he had meant to winter kardus saw the cityhuman slip away from the feast thinking himself unobserved he spoke on though his mind was far from the gossip of the villages since his books had come to him as a young colt he had followed the pattern of tasks and knowings set out for him by the wild magic though his race did not have the power to cast spells the great herdsman taught that each had its place in the great cycle and so his knowings came to him and he went where he was needed doing what he could to set things into harmony with the great cycle he had wide knowledge of the world gained through years of travel and if he did not have spellcraft to aid him his knowledge of herbcraftand the charms and potions given him by other wildmageswere his to use andjust as his greater brethren didhe paid the price of each knowing with a task he had received his knowing in merryvale to come to stonehearth and be here to aid the human boy that he would find here perhaps the knowing would unfold itself further once he had spent more time here that the boy was unhappy it did not take a wildmage to ken but how a human boy had come to be so far from his own folkand what karduss part in taking the herdsmans path might bethat he could not yet see but one did not herd ducks by chasing them that much kardus did know it was no use he was surrounded by themcentaurs wildmages and now something that managed to be an unholy combination of both excusing himself from the table as politely as he couldhe no longer really had any appetite cilarnen left the feast everyone in stonehearthdown to the foals born that springwas in the square so cilarnen had the rest of the village to himself all he really wanted was the chance to be by himself for a while but it seemed he was to be denied even that because he hadnt wandered for very long before he saw someone else it was another human a silverhaired man dressed all in white his garments were fine and if they were not familiar in style to cilarnens eye they were certainly more well cut and stylish than anything hed seen on either the centaurs or the human wildmage he must have come in with the centaurs and found he had as little taste for the rustic feast as cilarnen did the stranger smiled mockingly seeing cilarnen so archmages son kellen what a surprise to see you here have you tired of the children of leaf and star and think to make your way back to the golden city you have nothing to return to now your father claims another as his son he has given him the seat on the high council that was to have been yours and daily our foothold in the city grows stronger cilarnen stared at the man in shock the stranger thought he was farmer kellen as if he looked anything like the mad farmboy his shockand denialmust have showed plainly on his face for suddenly the strangers face contorted in a snarl of furious realization and kept on twisting itabruptly cilarnen could no longer think of the stranger as hebegan to grow its white clothes vanishing like smoke its skin turned as red as if blood had blossomed from every pore and great curving horns sprouted from its forehead at the same time enormous batwings shot out from its back it growled and lunged at him as fast as a cat might pounce upon a mouse if cilarnen had not been mageborn he might have died in that instant but if he did not have his gift he was at least used to seeing the impossible he did not stand staring in disbelieving amazement he turned and ran he felt a stabbing pain behind his eyesworse than any pain that had ever preceded it it made him reel blindly into a wallthe second thing that saved himbut before he could catch his breath the pain was gone taking even the memory of pain with it fool that thing isnt done with you yet he sensed the next attack seconds before it arrived and in panic he acted without thinking summoning up mageshield to protect him and it was there cilarnen and the demon both stared at the dull violet shimmer that hung in the air between them in equal amazement then the monster smiled showing cilarnen a mouth full of long sharp white fangs oh mageman i do so enjoy a challenge prepare your best spells ill be back for you spreading its hideous scarlet wings it leaped into the air and vanished cilarnen slumped against the wall panting as though hed run at least a league his gift was back he could feel it andmaybethe monster was gone he could tell granderask him what to do what it had been no he knew what it had been but that was impossible demons did not exist his nurse had used to frighten him with tales of demons the walls of armethalieh kept them out but childrenvery bad childrencalled them in and then they took bad children away into the dark and ate them demons had claws and fangs and long sharp teeth and the horns and tails of beasts and great batwings to fly over the walls with and they were red with the blood of all the bad children theyd eaten cilarnen slumped against the wall in despair he hadnt thought about demons in years they werent mentioned in the cosmology of the light though it mentioned the lesser races they hadnt been mentioned in his magickal studies though those studies had covered the elementals the lesser races the embodiments of magick and the illusory creatures demons are a nursery tale he told himself desperately a myth of error then he heard the first screams and over them the demons shrieks of laughter i wonder why hes come grander mused looking down the table to where kardus sat at the center of a group of rowdy apprentices it was a great honor to host two wildmagesand one of them the only centaur wildmage anyone had ever heard of besidesbut he did wonder perhaps because all of you are going wirance suggested i shall be sure to see what i can do for him before we leave tomorrow i admit hes a useful fellow good to have on your side in a fight too or when you dont want to fight i remember a time when kindrius began with an unearthly shriek the demon landed in the center of the table the table collapsed beneath its weight sending cups and platters flying everywhere for a moment there was absolute silence some of the centaurs at the farther tables began slowly to edge away trying not to be noticed but the ones closest to the demon were frozen in terror mages everywhere it purred staring at wirance with hot yellow eyes oh this is going to be fun then it reached out grabbing the nearest centaur and yanking her toward it it bit through her throat in one quick motion she reeled back choking and flailing as blood fountained from her ruined throat someone screamed and suddenly everyone was screaming and shouting the demon sprang away licking its chops to land on the back of another centaur wrenching the centaurs head nearly off its shoulders before bounding away again to arms kindrius bellowed to his men get to your homes grander shouted equally loudly what had been a happy celebration moments before was now a panicked herd of centaurs that the demon attacked at will though they had worn their armor the centaur warriors had not brought their weapons or shields to the feast some ran to fetch their arms other armed themselves with what they could grab from the table and attacked the demon it was useless the demon turned on its attackers its claws shearing through steel armor and leather padding as though it were the lightest linen it seemed to delight in wounding and crippling rather than killing and soon the screams of the injured were added to those of the merely terrified and when it seemed that matters could get no worse the demon added magic to its attacks it rose into the air and hovered wings spread wide it pointed and everywhere it pointed something exploded or burst into flame soon most of the houses around the square were in flaming ruins it pointed at the well and the housing dissolved in a spray of lethal stone shards a great jet of water fountained into the sky then water began flowing slowly over the stones of the village square they could not reach it with swordsnot that swords had been able to cut its scarlet hidebut the centaur warriors were armed now with spear and bow and the archers began to fire from what cover they could find none of the missiles found their mark the demon batted them all aside laughing madly as if this were all great fun even karduss arrows which carried charms upon them did not find their mark we will all die here thought wirance in despair he crouched inside the doorway of one of the few houses that had so far escaped the demons attention and watched with increasing fury as it slaughtered the centaurs as easily as a wolf might destroy a nest of field mice none of his spells were strong enough to defeat the demonhe thought he might be able to hold it for a moment or two if he could cast successfully but the demon had marked him for its most dangerous enemy and broke each of his castings before it was fully formed there must be something by the first frost i must think of something cilarnen could hear the sounds of the carnage even three streets away the taste of his terror was sour in his throat he had never been this frightened in his life not in the cell not looking at the outlaw hunt he could get away he had his gift back that would be useful somewhere else he could get away not out the main gatethat would be blockedbut there was another gate maybe the demon wouldnt look for him maybe it would think it had already killed him maybe the centaurs would kill it cilarnen got to his feet and started walking slowly toward the little gate and stopped no these were his friends they didnt care who cilarnen volpiril wasthey didnt know a thing about house volpiril or the high mages or armethalieh they didnt want anything from him they were just his friends they had helped him even though they didnt have to maybe he couldnt help them now he didnt know much about demons he hadnt believed in demons until a few minutes agoand even if he did have his gift most of his spells were useless without the equipment to do a proper working he didnt even have a wand for lights sake but there was one spell he didnt need a wand for and he bet even demons feared it he hoped they did he turned toward the square and began to run he reached the edge of the square and stopped hed never seennever imagineda sight like the one which greeted him bodies were everywhere the cobblestones were slick with fresh blood the houses that bordered the square were in ruins burning the well had been smashed and water was sluicing over the stones making the footing treacherous cilarnen could see that the wildmage kept trying to cast some kind of spellhe could actually see the energybut the demon kept breaking the spell before it could form it could not strike the wildmage but others werent so lucky cilarnen saw flesh crisped to ashand worse even while he gaped at the fight in shock and horror he saw the demons magic strike a young centaurs hindquarters and watched the flesh turn black and fall away from the bone like hot fat it should have made him sick but somehow seeing what the demon could do didnt make him more afraid it made him hard and still inside more determinedand more angrythan he had ever felt before he stepped away from the wall hed been hiding against and out into the square cilarnen raised his hand summoning the power of the high magick and the demon burst into flame burn cilarnen commanded putting all his will into the demand all his anger all his fear when he felt himself falter he merely had to allow himself to see the dead and the dying scattered about the square and his fury welled up in him again never mind that a mage was supposed to conduct all spellcasting in sublime detachment from everything and everyone this rage gave him power he didnt even know he had he did not stopa candle could not will itself to extinguish but the demon couldbut willed fire again and again until suddenly unfamiliar weakness drove him to his knees and the demon its body charred and blackened dropped from the sky wirance felt the tingle of unfamiliar magic and suddenly the demon burst into flames for a moment he thought it was a trick a trap but then the demon roared with pain flailing wildly in the air as it sought to extinguish the flames that raced over its body wirance glanced toward the edge of the square following the line of magic stretched across the sky and saw a slender human youth pointing his hand at the demon his whole body rigid with concentration and fury i dont know what youre doing boy but keep it up kardus hurried to wirances side forcing his way through the press of warriors in his hands he held a thin length of shining white cord i think the centaur wildmage began pray wirance said grimly and readied his spell the demon had stopped fighting now and hung in the sky a burning ember its wings skeletal its body ash and bones but the moment the strange burning spell was lifted it would begin to heal and in moments it would be wholeand more savage than before wirance waited for the instant the light of the burning spell flickered out then struck with his own this time it held the demons body fell to the ground surrounded by a white glow of restraint quickly wirance shouted his voice harsh i cannot hold this spell for long kardus lunged forward the rope of unicorn hair in his hands he fell to his knees looping it about the demons neck and jerked it tight the seared demonflesh crackled as the unicorn hair burned through it shearing through the neck and windpipe and with a crack the head rolled free a moment later the whole body dissolved into ash and began to swirl away in the water silence a terrible heavy silence is it dead someone asked hoarsely yes kardus said lunging awkwardly to his feet the demon is dead then the moaning the weeping the agonized cries for help began wirance looked around the village square resembled nothing so much as a slaughtering pen in the cold steam rose from the shattered bodies of the living and the cooling bodies of the dead and the air was filled with smoke he looked at kardus we both have much work to do here but we had best go find the boy first his name is cilarnen kardus said he is my task chapter fifteen at the siege of stonehearth calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink cilarnen had not gone far he was too weak to stand but he had crawled back around the corner of the building and was curled up against it trying to shut out the sobbing and groans of the wounded his eyes streamed tears but he was not weeping no not he surely cilarnen wirance said squatting down beside him are you hurt it thought i was kellen you see cilarnen explainedreasonably he thought and then it realized i wasnt so it killed everybody it tried to kill me first but i still had my gift lord anigrel was supposed to take it but he didnt that was wrong of him wasnt it theyre supposed to take your gift when they banish you we dont know what youre talking about kardus said gently we know who kellen wildmage is kellen came from armethalieh did you come from armethalieh too yes cilarnen said sitting back and looking up at the two wildmages im a mage of armethalieh i was anyway an entered apprentice and you used your armethaliehan magic on the demon wirance asked i used fire cilarnen said his voice thick with exhaustion and with what was certainly not weeping it was hard to form words but nownow his vision was clearing at last andhe was tired so tired he couldnt even think he was so tired all he wanted to do was sleep even an apprentice can do that i know nothing of armethaliehan magic how do you pay for your spells wirance asked cilarnen stared at him in utterly exhausted irritation there must be a thousand things that needed doing right now why was this man sitting here with him asking how the high magick worked pay you dont pay for spells in the high magick something occurred to him in the back of his mind something about the talismans but the thought flew away and escaped him all magic has a price young apprentice and woe to your teachers that they did not teach you this you have paid dearly for the spell you cast today and now you must rest wirance said he put an arm under cilarnens shoulders and lifted him to his feet cilarnen staggered the world reeling greyly around him despite himself he clutched at wirance for support it is as i said wirance said implacably suddenly arguing with wirance didnt seem worthwhile any longer i will take him to a place where he may rest then return to aid you kardus said putting his arm around cilarnen cilarnen leaned against the centaur gratefully to his relief they did not return to the square but went back along the same back street hed gone down not so long before kardus seemed to know stonehearth as well as cilarnen did when they reached the place where cilarnen had encountered the demon he flinched as if it somehow might still be here it was here cilarnen said shakily it looked human they can appear in any guise they choose kardus said suddenly the demons words came back to him as if he were hearing them at that very moment not the part about kellen that was kellens problem and if kellen really was a wildmage he wouldnt care if lycaelon had supplanted him or not but the rest and daily our foothold in the city grows stronger were there demons in the city waitwait cilarnen gasped it told meit saidwhen it thought i was kellenthat the demons have a foothold in the cityin armethalieh ive got to tell who who could he tell he couldnt return to the city he probably couldnt even cross the border and live ive got to tell someone cilarnen said desperately indeed you must kardus agreed you must tell kellen wildmage for he makes war against the demons and if there are demons in armethalieh he will make war against them as well it is my task to bring you to him but we will speak further of that when you are rested kardus took him to the stables not to granders house but cilarnen was so exhausted he didnt think to question it he took a horse blanket and curled up in an unused stall and was asleep before kardus had left the stables when he woke again it was dark and the stillness in the air told him it was snowing there was no light in the stable but he knew his way around it by touch after so long and groped his way to the lantern and tinderbox he was reaching for the flint and steel when he realized he would never need them again he concentrated and the lantern bloomed into light he felt dizzy for a moment and shrugged it off closing the lantern door and watching the small flame steady to brightness his momentary weakness didnt matter what mattered was why he should be able to do this at allor should have been able to cast the mageshield that had saved his life when the demon had first attacked him his gift should be gone burned from his brain but it hadnt been it had merely been sleeping and this made no sense at all he was grateful no more than grateful he was elatedbut it made no sense at all no mage would have let him leave the city with his gift intact even if they expected him to be dead within bells and it could not be an accident it must have been deliberate undermage anigrel had done this deliberately but why had he hoped that the young apprentice if he left the gift intact could somehow use the high magick to get himself beyond the reach of the hunt but that couldnt be right because his magick hadnt worked when hed first tried it cilarnen shook his head whatever undermage anigrels motives he had more pressing concerns now he picked up the lantern and left the stable it was snowing and the snow had swept the smell of smoke from the air it should have been peaceful it wasnt it was early evening but the streets were oddly dark and quiet without cloak or hood cilarnen shivered in the cold night air he felt unnerved and unsettled and the silence filled him with an edgy energy hed meant to go directly to granders houseas he shook off the last veils of sleep he became more worried about what had happened to his friendsbut as he walked up the street he neared the tavern next to the smithy and finally started to hear voices he hurried toward them as he approached a strange centaur male hailed him you granders boy come and help cilarnen came at a run the centaur who had hailed him was one of the warriors who had arrived earlier that day he was still bloody from the fight and one arm was splinted and in a sling but he looked vigorous enough looking past him cilarnen could see that both the forge and tavern had been converted to a makeshift hospital and were filled with centaur wounded someone said you were a mage have you healing skills the centaur demanded cilarnen shook his head his spirits falling none he said wiranceor kardus both occupied with worse cases than these they will come when they can the centaur looked weary i had hoped if there is anything i can do i will do it cilarnen said quickly i work in the stables i know you are not horses but an able body and a willing pair of hands counts for much if you are not afraid of blood the centaur said after today i do not think i will ever be afraid of it again cilarnen said bleakly for the next several hours cilarnen worked at the direction of others stitching wounds changing poultices over burns and helping to draw limbs straight so they could be splinted because those who had been lucky enough to escape injury were needed elsewhereto search through the rubble of smashed buildings for trapped survivors to build firebreaks and to lend their strength whatever that meant cilarnen wasnt sure to wirances wildmage spellsthe injured had been left to tend to each other cilarnen learned in scraps of conversations during the work that the snow was wirances doing so that the fires the demon had set could be contained and extinguished since the well had been destroyed half the homes of stonehearth had been either damaged or destroyed outright in its attack though this part of the village the farthest from the square was untouched it seemed to cilarnen that there was no end to the wounded and burned and then suddenly there was he found himself with bandages in his hands and no one to put them on here said comild taking them from him gently and putting them with the rest of the scavenged supplies go and wash yourselftheres water over there he pointed with his chin and cilarnen saw a bucket and at the same time realized that his hands were sticky with blood and unguents holding down a surge of nausea he hastened to cleanse himself as well as he could it will not be too difficult to rebuild the well though it may be best to call for a unicorn to purify it comild said i suppose cilarnen said vaguely not understanding what a unicorn could have to do with a well he looked up at the centaur what are you going to do now youre not going home are you comild shook his head kindrius is dead but it remains to be seen if any of the other subcaptains still live if they do we will choose a new leader from among our number if i am the only survivor the honor is mine and we go on wounded or not we will recover and our allies need us youre going to be a captain cilarnen asked not the way i would choose it comild said broodingly i hope your friends are well best go and see theres little more you can do for my men tired once morebut in a different way nowcilarnen stepped out into the street again it was dawn now hed worked through the night this time the cold air felt good he looked down at his tunic hed rolled up the sleeves when hed set to work but the front was as bloody and soiled as if hed been working in a butchers shop he blinked back tears sarlins rich gift ruined he was gladsuddenly desperately gladthat hed been able to find the words to thank her for it when shed given it to him he hadnt meant them properly at the time he hadnt understood why hed said it he hadnt understood himself he hadnt understood a lot of things hed find her now hed explain hed thank her properlytell them all how much they meant to him he began to run the street that granders house was on was one of the lucky ones its houses were untouched though the roofs of the houses on the opposite side showed some firegaps through the snow the street was awake every house was filled with refugees centaurs in full armor patrolled the streets and cilarnen realized with a sudden flare of alarm that where there was one demon there might be more the village could be attacked again he heard his name called a couple of times but did not stop he had to get home he pushed open the door of granders house the common room was filled with centaurs all were villagers familiar to him but he saw no one that belonged to the household blessed herdsmanits cilarnen corela gasped the kindly middleaged centauress started forward her face a mask of shock we thought you must be deadnow dont move where are you hurt im not hurt cilarnen said its not my blood im all right are you is where is he looked around still hoping to see familiar faces and saw none come into the kitchen corela said coming forward and putting an arm around his shoulders there was soup tea and hot ale in the kitchen corela dismissed the centaurs working there with a glance and closed the door behind them with one wellplaced nudge of her hind hoof there is bad news she said it is best given quickly cilarnen nodded unable to ask grander and marlen are gone to the herd they are truly dead ive seen their bodies not pretty but quick jarel has lost an eye but he will live they think with scars to brag on erlocks leg will heal but it is likely he will be lame minor injuries only to the others of this houseso minor that they were all able to share price with wirance and so they are sleeping now sarlin too they cant be dead cilarnen said blankly i never told them how kind they were to me i never thanked them they have gone to the herd corela repeated gently and they will be reborn as good spring grass to feed our flocks now wash and eat there are many tasks that need doing the horses cilarnen said with a pang of guilty realization it didnt matter what else had happened in the world the horses still needed to be looked afterfed and watered and turned out for exercise i have to go to the stables ill be back as soon as i can wash first corela told him firmly and eat it was good advice so cilarnen took it he didnt think that the horses would appreciate it if he came to them reeking of blood once hed finished his morning stable chores it occurred to him that nobody probably had time for any of stonehearths livestock that morning well he did he didnt need to sleep yet he wasnt sure he could there was something inside him something that made his chest and throat feel tight whenever he thought of grander something that wanted to burst out it was worse than when hed been caught and told he was going to be banished much worse he didnt want to be alone with it the sheep and goatpens were outside the walls guarded by shaggy herdingdogs in their kennels the great beasts came rushing forward when cilarnen appeared barking savagely when they caught his scent then sniffing and nudging at him hopefully no one has been here to feed them either cilarnen realized the sheep and goats could eat hay but that wouldnt do for the dogs hed have to go find something to feed them after he unpenned the animals the barking had roused the pens inhabitants and a great bleating and baaing issued from within cilarnen opened each door in turn jumping out of the way quickly to avoid being trampled by the outrush of hairy and woolly bodies the herd dogs abandoning immediate hope of food rounded up their charges and began herding them down to the river for their longdelayed morning drink while they were gone cilarnen went to the storage barn unbolted the door and began dragging shocks of fodder out dumping them in the snow centaurs might be able to carry them but he wasnt nearly as strong as a centaur he had no idea how many were enough or what to do with them but at least the animals wouldnt starve thats enough cilarnen looked up to find kardus standing in the snow behind him the centaur wildmage had a large canvas bag slung over one shoulder and a knife in one hand bolt the door or the goats will get in among the fodder and gorge until they burst as he spoke he began cutting the braided lengths of straw that bound the foddershocks together then help me spread this over the snow or the strong will keep the weak away from the food by the time the dogs brought the herds back kardus and cilarnen had covered the snow with hay and both sheep and goats settled to browsing contentedly kardus reached into his bag and pulled out several large brown loaves he tossed one to each of the waiting dogs who were standing by expectantly as they gulped them down cilarnen saw that the loaves were meat and bread mixed together obviously what the dogs were used to receiving i told toria i would see to the flocks today kardus said but i see you got here first id done the stables cilarnen said i didnt think anyone would have thought about the other animals yet they have thought kardus said but there are many dead and injured and not enough hands to do the work my friends are dead cilarnen thought bleakly feeling his throat tighten and eyes sting again and everyone in stonehearth had lost friends it was a small village everyone knew everyone else karduswhy did the demon come here do you know tell me but the centaur wildmage only shook his head wordlessly can anyone tell me savilla asked with spurious mildness just why there was an open attack on that grubby centaur village her highestranking nobles were gathered before her in the formal audience chamber where she had summoned them as soon as the word of yethlengas attack upon stonehearth had reached the world without sun she did not know why he had attackedand she could not ask him before she killed him for the lightborn had managed not merely to defeat him but to destroy him to destroy one of the eternal beautiful children of he who is for that they would pay in the last full measure of pain and despair but savilla would not hurry either her pleasures or her vengeance her own spies ranged freely and far wherever magic and ancient landwards did not constrain them she had agentsboth endarkened and otherwisein the wild landsbut yethlenga had not been one of them her creatures knew better than to risk her displeasure by showing themselves openly no matter what the personal cost i will know what i will know savilla said dangerously she sat upon the shadow throne dressed in scarlet as red as her skin and white as pure as shattered aged bleached bone there was utter silence no one dared to speak even though their queen had asked a question highness prince zyperis broke the silence at last crawling forward and bending low before her wings tightly furled in submission yethlengas action goes so strangely against your wise counsel that perhaps it was only childish foolishness and so you would excuse it savilla hissed she reached out with one foot and placed it on his shoulder digging in with her talons until the blood flowed zyperis raised his head to meet her gaze though the movement opened deeper gouges in his back never only beg that you question those who will give you proper answers my queen he said softly ask those who have been his companions and servants if they knew his plans and did not tell you that is treason and must be properly punished savilla straightened and pushed zyperis away from her with a kick that sent him sprawling bending his wings painfully beneath him she waved him to his feet with a languid gesture rise all of you chamberlain bring yethlengas household here to me now soon an odd assortment of beings were ushered into the audience chamberseveral lesser endarkened the squat misshapen cousins of their greater brethren a collection of humans and a blind centaur all knelt immediately your master yethlenga is dead savilla said without preamble your lives and fortunes depend on what you can tell me now i will reward truth and punish lies great queen we will tell you everything one of the lesser endarkened said and so will the vermin the slaves knew very little but the questioning of the servants produced the names of two of yethlengas companions anilpon and iroth and when the slaves were sent to the pits to await new masters and anilpon and iroth were sent for they could not be found where are they she demanded of her chamberlain we are searching for them queen savilla vixiren underbutler to her household said the tension in the audience chamber eased just a fraction now that savillas wrath had found a new target it is nearly as good as a confession zyperis suggested savilla glanced sharply at her son he had been brave today speaking out and risking her wrath but had it merely been an attempt to divert attention from himself had yethlenga been one of zyperiss spies was this a conspiracy and anilpon and iroth its other members perhaps and perhaps not she did not think zyperis was ready to challenge her just yet and the attack upon stonehearth had beenas hed pointed outstrange there was nothing to gain from killing a few centaurs and terrorizing an isolated collection of mud huts zyperis would never make such a foolish mistake but was it so foolish something at stonehearth had been capable of killing one of the endarkened and now she might never know what it had been you have to know cilarnen pleaded i do not lie to you when i tell you i do not kardus said i have traveled fareven into the lost lands where the dark folkas they call them there raid among the folk as foxes among hares but never have they come this far south since the end of the great war it is true that andoreniel calls us to fight in honor of the ancient treaties but the elves have seen only their work and their creatures in the elven lands not they themselves but one was here and it said that they have agents in armethalieh cilarnen repeated stubbornly holding on to what he knew so much of what kardus was telling him simply didnt make sense to him and he was really afraid to ask for an explanation what was the great war when had it been did it have anything to do with armethalieh did that mean the elves and demons had fought before what did that have to do with humans perhaps that is why the humans there would not heed the elves when they tried to warn them kardus said i do not know perhaps kellen wildmage will know we will ask him when we see him would kellen even care what happened to armethalieh somehow cilarnen doubted it still he had to try he turned and followed kardus back toward the gate at the end of three more days the small party left stonehearth heading for the elven lands they left a badly damaged village behind themand far too many dead but in the days before they left wirance sent messages to the nearest villages and helpin the form of food supplies and hands to help with the rebuilding would soon arrive if it had been at all possible comild wirance and the others would have waited until the others arrived nearly a third of the surviving centaur soldiers were too badly injured to travel with them but kardus thought that cilarnens news must be brought before the elves without delay and cilarnen reluctantly agreed little though he wanted to meet the elves and everyone agreed it was too dangerous for the two of them to travel alone sarlin had given him a horse to ride it was one of the draft horsesthere was nothing else available in the centaur villagebut it was better than walking shed insisted he take it youve already done so much for me cilarnen had said when she offered him the horse she was the lady of stonehearth now and the responsibility weighed heavily on her young shoulders but there was no one else to take it up she had put aside her grief to take charge of the preparations for their leaving gathering together supplies from the remains of the villages stores finding clothing and armor for those whose possessions had been destroyed making sure cilarnen had proper clothing for the journey wirance had his own mount of coursea surefooted mule the preferred form of transportation in the high hills especially in winterbut cilarnen needed something other than his own two feet or theyd not arrive at their goal until spring you took me in you andand grander and marlen his throat closed and he swallowed hard i never told them i never told you sarlin hugged him hard oh hush now cityman we knew hyandur told us how theyd hurt you therehow theyd killed all your friends and worked their evil spells on you and chased you off with their horrible stone dogs and still you wouldnt say a thing against them because they were kin that would put anybody off and you worked hard for us and never complained and then you saved our lives you did wirance told us the herdsman gave you your magic back and you saved us the least we can do is give you a proper four legs to get on with oh sarlin cilarnen said caught halfway between laughter and tears i promise ill come backand ill take good care of tinsin i will i wish i wish papa had been here to see this day sarlin said softly he always knew youd amount to something cityman but go on with you youve plenty to do to get ready and dont worry about us you wont know being cityfolk the way you are but farming folk are tough well get through this well get a crop in the ground come springand come you back by harvest youll see us doing well i believe that sarlin and well make sure you can cilarnen vowed he wasnt sure who we wasthough it felt right to say it not the high mages they didnt care what happened to the folk of the wild landsand they twice didnt care if those folk didnt happen to be human and he wasnt sure yetwhether the elves cared either but even if it was only he and kardusfor cilarnen knew by now that the centaur wildmage cared about all his people cilarnen would do his very best to see that sarlin and her people were left to live their lives in peace be sure you do sarlin said and kissed him lightly on the cheek now go your ways they departed laden with small gifts a packet of pastries a skin of last years mead a wellwrapped honeycomb one thing that cilarnen did not take with him was his phial of headache syrup it had been nearly empty the day of the banquet and stonehearths healer had been one of those killed in the demons attack even if she had not been cilarnen had the strong suspicion that his headaches had been linked to whatever had been blocking his gift for since it had returned the one time hed automatically taken a dose of the cordial it had made him as sick as if hed taken an overdose of it and hed given the rest of it to sarlin for the use of the wounded perhaps the headaches were gone for good the entire villageor so it seemedturned out the morning they left to see them off cilarnen was kissed and hugged and backslapped by nearly everyone in the villageall of whom seemed to know some version of his role in the destruction of the demonuntil cilarnen was grateful to clamber up on tinsins back and put himself beyond their reach he wasnt sure how to gracefully ask them to stop thanking him when he felt deep down inside that they should be yelling at him for not helping sooner the big grey mare was not the ideal mount she was a draft horse not used to having a rider cilarnen had practiced with her a few times in the past two days and shed come to accept the idea of having someone on her back but not to like it a set of tack had quickly been cobbled togetherreally just a riding pad and stirrupsbut though hed be in no danger of falling off cilarnen could already tell he was going to be sore at the end of the days ride it would still be better than walking comild gave the signal and the troop trotted out through the gates of stonehearth they stopped several hours later to eat and rest at least partly for the benefit of the two humans who were grateful for the chance to dismount and stretch their own legs for a change not that cilarnens legs hadnt been stretched already quite too much as a matter of fact straddling the draft horses wide barrel as hed been riding cilarnen had been thinking about the future for a change all the long sennights hed been in stonehearth he now realized hed thought no further than his tasks for the day but the demons attack had changed everything it wasnt just that he had his gift backthough that was part of itor finding out that the city he still loved despite all it had done to him was in terrible danger it was that somehow the world had become much larger than hed ever imagined it could be and he needed to find where he belonged in it and what he could offer it there were his magegifts of course and as much training as he possessed more than his tutors had suspected of course but how much use was it here outside the city his gift was fairly useless without the appropriate apparatus much of that he could make with the proper resources but it was unlikely hed have access to them anytime soon high magick was so very complicated but there was one item he might be able to make right here and it was absolutely essential the first of all tools at their rest stop he waited until everyone was finished eating and then sought out kardus he found kardus less intimidating than wirancehe and the centaur wildmage seemed to be bound together somehow though cilarnen still didnt understand karduss talk of knowings and tasks any more than hed understood when wirance told him that magick had to be paid for commons paid for magick not mages kardus he said walking over to the centaur is there an ash tree around here anywhere the centaur wildmage regarded him curiously they were stopped in a forest of young trees their branches winterbare cilarnen shrugged when kardus said nothing i wouldnt know one tree from another is any of these an ash tree or a willow willow trees grow best near water kardus said with a gentle smile but there is an ash here i will take you he led cilarnen away from the others stopping before a slender tree with smooth grey bark which looked pretty much like every other tree in the woods to cilarnen and now the centaur asked i need a straight length of wood about as long as my arm and as thick as my thumb cilarnen said gazing up at the tree there seemed to be some suitable branches but they were fairly high up living wood and i have now merited banishment all over again speaking of the secrets of the art with a nonmage oh well theyll have to catch me before they can banish me cilarnen thought with bleak humor kardus reached out and put his palm against the trunk of the tree dryad if you sleep here know that we do not ask this lightly we will take only what we need and use it well i promise you this he turned to cilarnen climb and cut take only what you need one of the gifts that the folk of stonehearth had pressed upon cilarnen at his leavetaking was a good heavy knife more than capable of cutting through a tree branch if he was careful but getting up the tree looked like more of a problem at last cilarnen managed to reach the branch he was after by standing on karduss shoulders and clinging to the slender trunk of the ash for dear life that left him only one free hand it would have been easier to just saw away a big cluster of branches near the trunk and then take what he needed after it had fallen to the ground he started to do that but then he remembered karduss words hed spoken to the tree as if there might be something alive inside as if dryads were real demons were real maybe dryads were more than illusory creatures cilarnen hesitated then adjusted the placement of his knife reaching far out along the branch and feeling the strain in his shoulder as he stretched at last the length of wood he wanted eased free and cilarnen caught offbalance fell sprawling into the snow he landed flat on his back winded but unhurtthe snow was thick and he hadnt fallen all that far he staggered to his feet brushing snow from his clothes hed dropped both the branch and the knife of course but the knife had made a deep hole in the snow crust where it had fallen and the branch was sticking up out of the snow like an arrow he picked them up now you must thank the tree for giving so graciously of herself kardus said is there really a dryad in there cilarnen asked cautiously turning toward the tree i do not know i do not have the magic to see her if she is there kardus said a little wistfully and this would be her season to sleep in any event but it is always proper to give thanks for the bounty of forest and fieldand to the otherfolk even if you cannot see them cilarnen nodded thank you dryad he said to the tree i really need this he felt strange talking to a treebut then hed felt equally strange talking to centaurs not so very long ago good kardus said approvingly cilarnen looked down at the length of wood in his hands it looked nothing like the polished elegant tool he had used back in the city i need to trim this he muttered under his breath he found an outcropping of rock and used it to steady the branch while he trimmed the ends flat he carefully cut away all the tiny twiglets sticking out from it measured it against his arm and trimmed again not elegant but a wand of living ashwood if it wasnt polished smooth with virgin beeswax and bound in fine silver those things shouldnt matter eleph vath kushon deeril ashan the sigils every firstyear student committed to memory the building blocks of the high magick cilarnen traced them in the winter air whispering their names under his breath they hung before him perfect shapes of colored fire cilarnen let out his pentup breath in a sigh of relief the difficulty with finding the next lair of the shadow elves was that it might literally be anywhere or nowhere this might have been the only enclave of the creaturesor the elven lands might be riddled with them no one knew and they dared make no assumptions and vestakia was the only one who could find them if the elves knew that then shadow mountain must know it as well her life was in constant danger for without vestakia their only alternative was to seek out every cave in the elven landsand even the elves werent quite sure where they all wereand search them all blindly and such a task could take an elven lifetime to complete and that was time they did not have not knowing where the next enclave of the shadowed elves might be redhelwar made the decision to regroup at ondoladeshiron the rest of the elven knights would have arrived by now and the wounded could be better cared for there the army moved more slowly on its retreat handicapped both by its burden of wounded and by the bitter winter weather the only mercy was that none of the horses or unicorns had been hurt in the battlekellen didnt think he could have borne that idalia jermayan and atroist worked tirelessly among the injuredthe sword cuts were bad enough but these were things that the elven healers were used to dealing with and they were masters of the healing arts but the wounds caused by acid and poison were resistant to everything the healers could do and there the skills of the wildmages made all the difference here kellen faced a great dilemma it was not that he was unwilling to help his friends and companions in every way he could though no knightmage would ever be as good a healer as a true wildmagebut the wild magic exacted a price for every spell in the form of a task the wildmage must complete in payment what if one of those tasks somehow ran counter to doing what needed to be done here dont worry about it idalia told him when he brought the question to her i dont know of course but im pretty sure the gods of the wild magic want shadow mountain out of the way as much as we do they arent likely to set you a mageprice that will interfere with that and you need the practice someday you might be the only healer around and what then so at the end of each day kellen joined the others in the healers tents doing what he could some of the prices he incurred were small and relatively easy to discharge like going to comfort one of the unicorns whose rider had been slain some of them he could not discharge for years to come if everlike the order to visit the homeland of the selken traders and some were simply odd like being told to forgive one whom he thought of as an enemy that was puzzling kellen didnt have any personal enemies armethalieh had banished him but even he had to admit there was nothing personal about it he was trying to exterminate the shadowed elves but again it was because they were tainted not because he hated them personally he didnt get along with every single elf in the army or in sentarshadeen but as far as he knew he didnt have any enemies in either place still if a personal enemy showed up kellen supposed hed keep his mageprice in mind and do his best to forgive whoever it was of course that didnt mean he wouldnt kill that person but hed forgive them as well between the long days of riding and working half the night as a healer he was nearly always tired and the icy conditions didnt help it was hard to get to sleep at night shivering in his blankets and harder to wake up sooner than he wanted he learned to get by on less sleep than he would ever have imagined possible to both eat and sleep in shalkans saddle andsomehowstay alert for danger through it all when they reached the gathering plain kellen saw that the encampment had grown even without the presence of most of the knights from ondoladeshiron sentarshadeen windalorianan deskethomaynel and thultafoniseen he recognized the banners of lerkalpoldara valwendigorean realthataladon and ysterialpoerin the four northernmost of the nine cities had arrived and there were other tentsnonelven tentsbesides mountain traders petariel said cheerfully though his leg was still stiff the combination of healer skill and wildmagery had him back in the saddle once more im glad theyre here we can use more wildmages oh not that youre not very efficient kellen he added teasingly i think you said at the time that youd rather be healed by a snowbear than let me anywhere near you kellen reminded him with a grin and if gesade hadnt threatened to stand on you and hold you down i might have gone and found a snowbear i should have let you the unicorn said consideringly it would have been fun to watch and we could have skinned it afterward and the stubbornest elf in the flower forest would have had a lovely new cloak only if i could have left the bear in it to share it with him kellen said petariels injurya spear through the kneehad looked bad enough at first but it was only a day or two later that the healers had realized how serious the shadowed elf poison could be nothing theyd been able to do had stopped the spread of the infection that ate the flesh from within not even the touch of gesades horn had been able to purify it only a healing spell had been able to lift the taint from the wound so that the healers drugs could take effect by the time kellen had been called to petariels side the unicorn knight had been delirious with pain and poison and a very bad patient kellen unharnessed shalkan before seeing to anything else but by the time the wagons carrying the rest of their gear got to the unicorn knights encampment a messenger had arrived as well it was dionan a junior member of the generals staff i see you kellen knightmage dionan said bowing i see you dionan kellen said he returned the bow as best he could with his arms full of shalkans armor youre wanted in redhelwars pavilion in two hours dionan said hes gathering all the commanders and everyone with special experience in fighting the shadowed ones that would be me kellen thought with an inward pang thank you ill be there two hours would barely give him enough time to change into the cleanest clothes he hadand maybe if he was luckyget some tea his stomach growled food unfortunately was going to have to wait he set shalkans armor in a convenient location and went looking for his packs idalia left her palfrey with the horselinessomeone else would untack cella and turn her out with the herd then clean her tack and bring it to idalias tent there was little deference to rank among the elvesat least not in the same way there was among humansbut the work of the healers was hard and often dangerous and that brought them a few privileges with cella seen to idalia went off toward the mountain traders camp to see if she could find some old friends and catch up on the gossip the wind here on the gathering plain was sharp and piercingidalia having spent a winter in ondoladeshiron several years earlier had dressed for the weather but even in furlined garments with a heavy fur cloak over everything she shivered in the wind the mountainfolk probably thought this was no more than a brisk spring day thoughit snowed early in the high reaches and spring thaw came late because of this the mountainfolk did very little farming hunting and trading for most of their needs they worshiped the greater powers in the form of the huntsman and the forest wife and were careful to do nothing to offend them lest they should withdraw the game and the fruits of the forest the tents of the mountainfolk were designed to withstand the heaviest of snows being low domes constructed of waxed canvas with thin rods sewn into the fabric to stiffen it once unfolded and staked into place no amount of snow could collapse them nor wind overset them in factidalia could see as she approached their encampmentall of the duncolored tents had been edged around with highpacked snow for added warmth and stability so that only the very tops protruded from the mounds of glistening white hail stranger a man anonymous in winter furs greeted her as she approached are you lost looking for old friends idalia answered pushing back the hood of her cloak so he could see her face by the first frostidalia come to give me my mule back have you to idalias surprise and delight it was kearn one of her closest friends among the mountain traders no more than youre here to give me my tarnkappa back kearn she responded with a grin im fond of that mule and i traded for her fair and square besides shes back in sentarshadeen and im not going all the way there just to fetch her to you well met nevertheless kearn said im glad you made it away from the wildwood safely theres many that didnt so i hear what have you heard idalia asked more sharply than shed intended if not for the discovery of the presence of the shadowed elves shed intended to head south into the wild lands this winter to try to discover more about the aftereffects of armethaliehs illadvised expansion of its borders come along and ill tell you then its not so very cold out here but the wind on the flat makes my bones ache resel come and keep watch the elves are good folk to be sure he said in an aside to idalia but i think we understand them as little as they understand us and a man can grow old waiting for them to come to the point when they want something so its best to have someone waiting at the entrance of the camp for when they show up so we can try to find out what they want and give it to them as quickly as possible he led idalia deeper into the camp back to his tent idalia negotiated the low entryway with ease the space inside was roomy enough though of course it wasnt possible to stand upright and dimly though adequately lit by a candle in a glass lantern the sides of the lantern were thick doublepaned and filled with water to magnify the flameand for added safety should the lantern break idalia sat crosslegged in a corner while kearn lit a small spiritstove and quickly boiled tea it was nothing any elf would have been willing to drink black as kaffeyah twiceboiled and served with a generous dollop of frozen goats butter for seasoning but the extra calories were welcome in the cold mountain environment that was the traderfolks natural home and the bitter salty taste was oddly refreshing idalia wrapped her hands around the wooden mug to warm them kearn squatted down on his heels holding his own cup and gazed down at the pot as if seeking inspiration for his tale at last when idalia was almost afraid shed have to prompt him he began last autumn when you gave me the warning of what the city planned i went home as swiftly as my girls would go passing the word of armethaliehs encroachment everywhere i stopped we expected that we would see lowlander folk coming into our mountains from the wild landsaye and otherfolk too i cannot say that we were happy at the thought but neither would any of us choose to turn them away and leave them to the mercies of the cityfolk so we did what we could to prepare and hoped that the winter would be kind at first they came in numbers no one knew how far the citys thievery would go so there was much confusion we made all welcome who camecentaurs whose homes lay closest to the old border it was at first and lowlander humans who had no taste for city rule fauns came tooi did not see them myself but they spoke to those who serve the wife and they said that all the lowland otherfolk were coming to us creatures of air and earth of river and lake and tree kearn stopped staring broodingly into his cup but something went wrong idalia prompted at last oh aye kearn said it did that many that we expectedthat the centaurs expected that the humans expected that the fauns told the children of the wife to expect they never came we did look for them idalia we went down the trailseven into the new socalled city lands for we have free passage as far as nerendale you know for the trade caravans and the city magistrates would not trouble us overmuch if they encountered us upon the road we found a few wildlanders still heading for the reaches and heard that some had decided to stay where they were and fight though in the end the city pulled its borders back before it had even knocked upon the gates of half the villages in the wild lands but the rest i know no more than that when word reached us that the city had tucked its tail between its legs and run craven the farmers that had come to us returned home for the most part since the children of the plow do not find our mountains hospitable the rest are with us here come to fight since they cannot farm as for the shining ones who can say i think they would wish to return to their own lands if they could and perhaps they have idalia nodded kearns story made little more sense to her than it did to kearn but what was certain was that it wasnt good news there was no way to tell now how many folkhuman centaurs and otherfolkhad simply vanished but she could make a pretty good guess at how they had vanished demons demons needed blood and pain and death to fuel their magic and while the raids they conducted on atroists people could have provided enough victims to do something like build the black cairn they would have needed to replenish their store of power afterward armethaliehs attempt to annex the wild lands had provided the demons with a perfect opportunity to conduct secret raids among the refugees harvesting hundredsperhapsof victims all unnoticed in all of the confusion and chaos who would have thought to look for demon raids youve thought of something kearn observed nothing encouraging idalia said taking a swallow of her bitter black tea and its not even a theory really just a supposition just then resel poked his head into the tents opening the elves he announced in longsuffering tones are looking for the sister of the knightmage i promised id look else theyd have set the place on its horns do we have such an item as a sister anywhere about the camp kearn that idalia announced setting down her mug would be me id better go find out what they want i thank you for your news kearnthough im not sure thanks is really the right word it so rarely is these days so much of the news is bad kearn agreed somberly fare you well then idalia he escorted her to the edge of the mountainfolk camp and idalia tucking her cloak tightly around her against the eternal winter wind went off to find out who wanted to see her she caught up with dionan fairly quickly he had vestakia with him and they were searching among the healers tents obviously looking for her idalia vestakia cried sounding breathless with relief weve been looking everywhere for you so i discover idalia said dryly here i am i see you dionan i see you idalia wildmage dionan answered bowing respectfully redhelwar asks if you would find it convenient if perhaps it would please you to join him in his tent no wonder the elves drive the mountainfolk crazy idalia thought wryly from her long experience with the elves she had no difficulty understanding that she had been bidden to come to the elven general at oncewhether it pleased her or not but few humans without equivalent experience of the elves would find dionans words as easy to decode of course idalia said it would please me greatly she added for good measure dionan led herand vestakia as wellthrough the milling and confusion of the camp redhelwars scarlet pavilion was an oasis of serenity in the midst of all the apparent disorderthough nothing in an elven camp was ever really disorganized when they reached the tent dionan bowed them in ahead of him idalia entered first and found that the pavilion was filled with people kellen was there and jermayan as well as a number of the highranking elven war leaders more surprisingfor this seemed to be a strategy meeting rochinuviel the vicereign of ondoladeshiron was there and atroist as well naturally tea must be served and drunk before the business of the meeting could be discussed though things went swiftly by elven standards when the delicate elvenware cups had been collected and set aside redhelwar spoke we have been blooded by the foe and he will be a difficult enemy to master redhelwar said yet by the grace of leaf and star and with vestakias aid and that of our wildmages we shall find the dark places in which he bides and scour his presence from the land so that they have no foothold here and the poor tortured spirits of our cousins can find rest at last there was a profound moment of silence and idalia remembered what kellen had told her even while they devoted every fiber of their being to killing the shadowed elves their elves never stopped thinking of them as elves and hating the necessity that drove them to slaughter what they considered to be their own kind yet this is a fight that cannot be won with sword and spear alone redhelwar said continuing we must once more take up our alliance with those who wield the wild magic as it was in the time of the great war to that end rochinuviel brings word from andoreniel rochinuviel bowed stepping forward the vicereign was gowned as elaborately as she had been on the day that she had greeted the unicorn knights on the gathering plain diamonds and moonstones glowed and glittered in her long black hair and she wore a cloak of thick white fur over a gown of white velvet banded in ermine and satin as bright as ice but despite the fact that she was dressed for court in a pavilion full of men and women wearing armor and coarser furs she did not look out of place she was simply rochinuviel as inviolate as the snowcapped peaks your words honor me redhelwar the words of andoreniel will bring change to the elven lands it is as i am sure you expect a hard counsel but wise and in time of danger new ideas must not be set aside merely because they are new andoreniels words are these the lostlanders must come south every man woman and child of them every goat and sheep every household chattel no living thing which they value is to be left behind they will be granted safe passage through the elven lands escorted by our own people all the way to the lands of men then shall their wildmages fight among us against the shadowed elves and those of their young men who are willing as well all of the lostlanders who take up arms in honor of the ancient treaties shall be our valued allies and all the rest shall be safe in the lands of men and all who aid them there shall have the gratitude of the elves so says andoreniel lord of the nine cities atroist let out a deep sigh of relief bowing his head i shall tell them this at once lady you are more than generous it is not i who am generous rochinuviel said rebuking him gently but andoreniel who speaks through me i have given his words and now i will go and leave you to see to the matters of war you will tell andoreniel when he may expect your people to arrive she drew her white cloak more firmly around her and walked from the tent her escortanother elf dressed almost identically but in shades of palest greyfollowed silently to know this thing will make good hearing redhelwar observed in the silence that followed i can speak to drothi today atroist said with help it will be easier but of course well help idalia said firmly glancing at jermayan and kellen just tell us what you need ah atroist smiled then when drothi tells me how soon the folk can be ready to move i can tell you lord useful redhelwar observed to no one in particular now we will discuss the battle of the cavern and what we may learn from it in order to be able to fight more efficiently in future battles for the next several hours there was a brisk discussionboth among those who had been at the battle at the cavern in the mystral mountains and those who had just arrived on the gathering plainabout the sort of fight the shadowed elves had put up and whether they could expect the same sort of battle the next time kellen found himself having to tell the story of what he had done and what he had faced over and over again there were things he wished vestakia didnt have to hear but there was no help for it it was no consolation to hear the others who had also been in the caves echo his story from their own perspectives the memories were still hard and painful ones what was clear to kellen was that they dared not risk another such battle as the one they had just fought though their losses had been comparatively small theyd been far too high when one remembered that this was only the start of the campaign against the shadowed elvesand that they had the endarkened still to fight perhaps that was the only enclave of the creatures an elven knight named belepheriel suggested when the battle had been gone over from every possible aspect it is true that we do not yet know the location of other enclavesor indeed if they exist at all redhelwar agreed reluctantly therefore we must wait until vestakia has discovered another nest of the creatures to see what we must do but it is best to be prepared for i do not think that they would lead us so easily to the only infestation of our enemy they are not in the habit of bestowing such rich gifts upon their foes and with that grim assessment everyone present had to agree redhelwar dismissed his commanders soon thereafter the meeting had been for the purpose of providing everyone there with information soon he told them he would want to hear strategies for dealing with the special problems of invading the shadowed elves underground lairs the four wildmages and vestakia left together intent upon their more immediate concerns what is it that we have to do to help you send your message to drothi idalia asked there must be a speaking circle atroist answered we use them to pass messages over long distances in the lost lands drothi will be awaiting a sending from me though she knows not when one may come it is a thing best done withhe glanced around at the bustle of the campperhaps some privacy well if jermayans going to help it needs to be someplace where ancaladar can be close by anyway idalia said in practical tones theres an old orchard out behind the flower forestyou remember the place jermayan we can meet there sounds cold kellen muttered it was hard to remember at the moment the last time hed been really warm it wont be when im done with it jermayan said with a smile perhaps you will tell me atroist what you require for this speaking circle a place to build a firea small onewhere we can gather around atroist said simply i have brought all else i need with me then let us meet there at dusk ancaladar and i can go now to prepare the place and idalia can bring the two of you if that is amenable to all of you i thank you for your aid wildmage atroist said bowing jermayan nodded and walked away leaving the others behind id better go check back with petariel to see what else needs to be done at the unicorn camp kellen said he glanced at the sky the day was overcast but it was still possible to mark the position of the sun through the clouds we have a few hours yet and vestakia and i will have a few things to do among the healers idalia agreed meet us at the healers tents an hour before sunset its a bit of a walk to the orchard chapter sixteen ghosts upon the wind calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink just at dusk they arrived at the old orchard the trees were bare and black with winter but kellen barely noticed them jermayan had indeed been busy a pavilion of ice stood at the spot where they would need to do their work it was all of a piece as seamless as magecrafted stone and as transparent as glass the light of lanterns gleamed from within making the whole structure glow softly in the fading twilight a human mage would probably have made a simple square building and let it go at that but jermayan was an elven mage he had created a replica of redhelwars pavilionthe available interior space of course would be much smaller because the ice walls needed to be thicker for the pavilion to standbut the exterior was exact in every detail down to the fringe and tassels along the upper edges of the walls the folds in the fabric of the tent the stakes and pegropes even the pennons hanging from the centerpole and from each of the four corners even the doorflaps that stood pinned back from the entrancethey would not close of course being made of ice but they were so detailed that they looked as if they could oh my idalia said mirth bubbling in her voice do you like it ancaladar asked appearing out of the flower forest to their right and moving quickly through the winter orchard toward them he cocked his head inspecting the icepavilion the boy shows promise its not something you see every day kellen said weakly here as in the shadowed elf village being confronted with the sheer scope of the magical power his friend could command gave him a moments pang it was not that he coveted it for himselfgods of the wild magic forbid itor that he did not trust jermayan utterly it was just that there seemed something almost unnatural about it it was true that to a nonmage there would seem to be very little difference between what he and idalia could do and what jermayan could do but kellen saw a very great difference what he did at least was justalmostan intensification of what an ordinary man might do or what the natural world did on its own he could make the healing process go faster but he could not call back the dead he could see things invisible to others but that was because his gift gave him the power to understand tiny clues that they could not see and showed him the results in visions he could call fire but he could not burn things that a natural flame would not burn he could not reshape stone with a thought but he had seen jermayan burn stone as if it were oilsoaked kindling and shape granite as if it were clay on the potters wheel and now thiscalling ice out of thin air to make a place for them to work in was the only difference between what kellen could do and what jermayan could do that jermayan had ancaladars power to draw upon was it that jermayan was an elven mage and kellen was human is this what your wildmages do in the south atroist asked sounding stunned id have to say that jermayan isnt exactly a typical wildmage idalia said comfortingly come jermayan said stepping out of the icetents entrance be welcome the three of them crunched through the heavy snow and in through the entrance of the tent it was warm inside even though the structure was made of ice the walls were smooth and featureless save for brackets of bronze in the shapes of wyverns that were set into the walls the lanterns illuminating the space hung from their jaws the floor of the tent was hardpacked snow providing coldif certain footing jermayans pack was tucked into a corner and the inevitable brazier was already brewing water for tea it looks very much as if youve done this before idalia commented looking around as she shed her pack kellen and atroist quickly followed suit as ancaladar does not wish to be treated as a pack animalyes i had to find a way of making shelter on my journeys since i could not carry it jermayan agreed pack animals walk ancaladar said simply poking his nose into the doorway of the tent i fly that you do idalia agreed squatting down in front of the dragon and reaching out to rub his nose gradually working her way up to gently scratch the browridges above his eyes the huge black dragon closed his eyes with pleasure atroist was busily working through the three packsall of which contained his suppliesand laying them out in the center of the tent he made a circle of what kellen recognized as keystones though very large onesso that was why the pack hed carried had been so heavytwo rings of them with a third set balanced upon the first two and at the center of the ring a carefully woven pyre of sticks and small logs all black and tarry with resin so long as the fire burns i can speak with drothi atroist said this is the wood of the ghostwood tree i will call the fire away when we are finished in case i need to speak againi have not seen ghostwood here in the south you have not been to the flower forest jermayan said we call these trees namanarii we use the sap in medicine it sends healing dreams i did not know that they grew any longer in the lands of men if you need more of it for your spells send to andoreniel for permission to take what you need and you may have it from any of the flower forests in the elven lands as he had been speaking jermayan had been brewing tea he paused now to pour it out and to hand the filled cups to each of them this was a set of cups kellen had never seen before they were tiny holding no more than a sip or twothe sort of cups the elves used for polite occasions they were elvenware delicate as moonlight and of a color kellen had never seen before black but their surface shone with a red fire like flames and somehow it seemed as if he could see a black dragon dancing through those flames kellen thought hed gotten used to the beauty the elves could create but this was truly the most exquisite piece he had ever handled they are for drinking out of not looking at jermayan reminded him gently kellen grinned and sipped the tea it was bitingly hot he tasted woodsmoke and fruitthe tea was some kind hed never had before and a stronger flavor than most of the elven blends it was odd but he liked it oh jermayan i didnt think you had any of this left idalia said her eyes going wide as she tasted it very little jermayan admitted but it is a good tea for this time and place take pity on a poor roundear who cant be trusted to boil water kellen pleaded the tea is called auspicious venture idalia said its made with the fruit of the vilya among other things its very rare because the vilya is always in flower but it fruits only once a century so you see maybe kellen said cautiously he sipped the tea slowly trying to make it last but trying to finish it before it cooled the flavor seemed to change with every sip he guessed hed better not get to like it too much if it was as rare as idalia said jermayan finished first and to kellens horror dropped his exquisite teacup to the snow and ground it to shards underfoot things of beauty are not meant to be guarded at the expense of more important things he said we cling to them at our peril only when we release them are they truly oursand are we truly free idalia finished her tea dropped her cup and did as jermayan had done kellen looked down at the empty cup in his hands destroy such a beautiful thing when would he ever see something like it again we cling to them at our peril he dropped the cup to the snow and crushed it beneath his boot the sound it made as he broke it seemed to resonate through his entire body atroist broke his cup in turn grinding the fragments into the snow come he said seating himself close to the ring of keystones the other three seated themselves around the ring of stones as well who will share the cost of this working with me atroist asked formally i said jermayan and i ancaladar said from the doorway i will idalia said me too kellen finished then let it begin atroist said stretching his hand out toward the wood walk with me the wood burst into flame and kellen felt the familiar sense of presence as the shield that marked the beginning of a spell of the wild magic appeared but nothing else was the same suddenly he was not in the icepavilion at all he got to his feetmoving without his own volitionand as he moved he saw he was in a small cottage the light was dimthe illumination coming mostly from a fire that smoldered on the hearthbut his body moved with certainty as if it knew this place drothi it was atroist who spoke not kellen and when he did kellen realized that he was not truly present at all merely hearing and seeing all that atroist did the illusion of presence was so real that it was strange not to be able to move at his own will and only now did kellen realize that although he could see the fire that smoldered on the hearth he could smell nothing at all not even the smoke of the burning ghostwood the woman sitting at the hearth looked up she was dressed much as vestakia had been when kellen had first seen her in a long tunic of coarse homespun with wide calflength trousers and heavy boots of rough leather over that she wore a large shawl woven in a complicated pattern of crossed stripes that would probably have been very colorful if there had been more light to see by she was not a young woman her face was seamed with the lines of age and her eyes looked almost white in the firelight as she gazed in his direction in an unfocused fashion kellen realized she could not see atroist at all what news do you bring kinsman drothi asked aged she might have been but her voice was young and vibrant with power the firstlings beg our aid as we knew yet they would not deny us help as well atroist said i have told them how it is with us and of our struggles with the dark folk and so they bid us travel to find sanctuary in the lands where the dark folk do not come the firstling king offers us safe passage through his lands for flock and herd and for every man woman and child of the folk the wildmages here speak of a land beyond the firstling borders where we may settle an empty land that we may take for our own and the firstling king gives his word that all who aid our people beyond the firstling borders shall dwell in his grace and here his word is no light thing even in the lands of men welladay drothi said coolly so the walls of the great border fall at last even for kern and chicken it will not take so very much to persuade the people to come i thinkaye and swiftly what is the news atroist asked and now kellen heard a note of fear in the wildmages voice the raids as you expected have continued drothi said simply as she spoke she picked up a spindle from the basket beside her and began pulling carded wool into thread with deft sure motions and to make matters worse the winter has been harder than any we have seen in a longhand of years had torchen not warned us it would be so when the rains began there would be starvation now but that is no matter since it has not happened there are things that are worse the great wolves have come again when the snows began to fall the folk heard them singing at icebridge and at songhythe which lie nearest to the stone wastes as you know the folk there had left their cattle to winter in the near fields and one day they woke to find them slaughtered every bull and cow with nothing left behind but blood and polished bones they knew the marauders for great wolves by the tracks and did the only thing they could they turned their flocks out as a sacrifice and fled south this is what the survivors say there were not many for the great wolves harried them as they went pulling them down in ones and twos running them like the deer until the weakest dropped from exhaustion and the strongest must leave them behind or die as well it was a cruel jest the dark folk played upon us that day to leave any alive when they could have taken all so easily atroist sucked in a trembling breath but drothi went on with her spinning implacably this was old news to her kellen realized yet the great wolves can be killed we have fought their kind before but now creatures have come into the land that have not been seen since before the settling if then we have seen creatures in the sky like giant batsthey do not come near but they bring fear to all who see them in the haunted places there are tracks upon the ground as if of giant serpentsyou remember the songs i taught you as a child atroist of the icedrake whose body is colder than the coldest ice and whose breath is poison i think it must have come again among us though i was certain it was only a legend from the oldest days other folk speak of black things that look like bears but are as tall as two men beasts with glowing red eyes and the power of human speech of things like horses but with cloven hooves the teeth of wolves and the tails of serpents no man dares leave his village to hunt no woman to draw water from the river the lost lands have become an abode not only of the dark folk but of monsters and our people suffer terribly i shall pass the word at once that we are to leave we will come as swiftly as we may pray to the good goddess that we survive the journey i shall atroist said and i will come to you myself and render what aid i can let it be so drothi said now leave me i have much work to do before i sleep there was a moment of disorientation and suddenly kellen was back in the icepavilion blinking in confusion at his fellow wildmages over the nowcold fire he breathed in deeply and coughed suddenly aware of the lingering spicy scent of woodsmoke this does not sound good idalia said mildly coldwarg and icedrake and shadewalkers and serpentmarae to judge by drothis description jermayan said grimly and the deathwings that we know to be the creatures of the shadowed elves as well the deathwings we had never seen before and all but the coldwarg we had thought to be gonedestroyed in the great war i guess theyre back kellen said he yawnedhe couldnt help it now that the spell had run its course the energy hed lent to its working left him feeling drained i must go atroist said getting to his feet and beginning to pack the keystones and the halfburned ghostwood into the packs again i will leave at first light i cannot leave my people to face such a journey alone when i might be able to protect them on their way of course you cant idalia agreed return as soon as you can and make your journey safely may the good goddess will it so atroist said what about this kellen said to jermayan indicating the icepavilion oh jermayan said a faint overelaborate note of casualness in his voice i thought id just leave it it wont melt you know not until spring ancaladar agreed from his position in the doorway and i might have a use for it later jermayan continued far too innocently whatever kellen muttered he wondered if there was any chance of getting a bowl of hot soup back at the unicorn knights camp or whether hed have to make do with cold trailrations at least thered be tea in an elven camp there was always tea dont tease him jermayan idalia said sharply what kellen said blankly i do apologize kellen jermayan said sounding truly contrite kellen was puzzled something had just happened and he had no idea what it was but idalia was mad and jermayan was upset look he said with a sigh im tired im hungry and im cold all i want is to help atroist get his stuff back to his tent so i can go get some dinner okay idalia smiled and reached out to ruffle his hair i do love you kellen she said with a smile sure kellen said sometimes sisters were just as baffling as elves since a good portion of the ghostwood had been burned in the speaking spell the remains and the keystones fitted neatly into two backpacks kellen took one and atroist took the other and they headed back in the direction of the gathering plain it was only after theyd passed the edge of the flower forest that kellen realized that idalia and jermayan had stayed behind he shrugged probably quoting poetry at each other he hoped jermayan had brought more teacups the firstlings are not as i imagined they would be atroist said after a while the elves i guess they take some getting used to kellen agreed i didnt even know they existednot reallybefore i left the city so i wasnt really sure what to expect good thing too not that hed had a lot of choice about coming to sentarshadeen but hed have worriedand it would have turned out to be for no good reason the golden city of magesyour cityis a place we only know of in legends atroist said someday perhaps we will speak of it further um well armethalieh probably isnt very much like your legends either kellen said tactfully he supposed the lostlanders thought of armethalieh as a sort of paradise the way the wondertales wrote about the mage college in our legends it is a place that shines with painful brightness to mask the darkness of its mages hearts a place where there is no night or day no winter or summer a place where the citizens have no souls for they have been stolen to fuel the magic of the mages music fills the air eternally to mask the cries of despair rising from the captive populace atroist said simply i apologize if my words offend you they are only legends oh theyre close enough to the truth kellen said sadly except that nobodys in despair everybodys perfectly happy with the life they haveor most of them are anyway theyrehe thought long and hard for a good analogysheep and the mages are the shepherds except that these shepherds not only keep them shorn of every scrap of wool they grow but would probably throw them to the wolves if wolves showed up but they dont know that and so theyre completely content you werent atroist pointed out no kellen agreed idalia wasnt either but most people are the high mages make sure of it he supposed he ought to hate armethalieh and the high council for what it had done to him certainly theyd acted out of pettiness and spite and tried to kill him but since hed been banished he was happier than hed ever been before in his life and to his surprise he was worried about them they were blind selfcentered bigoted idiots true but nobody deserved to be the demons victims kellen and atroist had reached the edge of the camp by now and a few minutes more brought them to atroists tent the two men stepped inside and kellen set down his pack with a sigh of relief id better be going shalkan will want to know what happened kellen said i hope your friends get here safely as do i atroist said fare you well kellen knightmage you too atroist wildmage kellen said when he returned to the unicorn camp kellen was grateful to find not only tea but soup and fresh bread waiting the advantages of being chosen for night patrol petariel told him cheerfully handing him a steaming bowl not you wildmage i order you to report to your bedroll at once you look exhausted ill make sure he gets there shalkan said walking around the corner of one of the tents and staring pointedly at the jar of crystallized honey until petariel laughed and offered him a disk of it huh kellen said inelegantly squatting near the large brazier and filling himself with bread and soup with brisk efficiency thanks and that was all he said for long enough to fill himself up to the brim with hot food and drink after half a loaf of bread three bowls of soup and two mugs of tea with a great deal of honey he felt a lot betterwell enough in fact to realize how tired he was he stumbled off to his tent one arm over shalkans shoulder glad he was awake enough to remember where it was so shalkan said once they were inside atroist spoke to drothi the lost lands are being used as a breeding ground for monsters kellen said struggling out of his armor when he heard his own words he stopped blinking in surprise but it was true wasnt it the demons had to put them somewhere while they were rebuilding their numbers i have to tell redhelwar the news will keep and youll present it so much more elegantly if youre awake when you do it shalkan said cuttingly now finish taking off your armor and go to bed kellen awoke when the sun was high feeling as if he ought to have had restless dreams but unable to remember any of them shalkan was already gone on business of his own kellen dressednot armor but camp clothesand made his way from the tent hed check with the watch commander for orders then go to the tents that served as the common dispensary for food in the settled camp to see about breakfast then bathe if his schedule allowed it a fixed camp allowed for a number of luxuriesthough he wouldnt have thought of them as luxuries a few months ago hot food he didnt have to cook himself hot water for bathing and more fur blankets on his bed than he could carry in a pack or on a packhorse that he shared with three others riasen was the captain of the morning watchsince petariel had been on patrol last night nothing for you to do while were in camp kellen riasen said cheerfully except stop wearing yourself to the bone working as a knight and a healer both if thats what being a wildmage is like i thank leaf and star i was born elven i did all right kellen said stung he hadnt thought hed looked that tired we were all taking bets on when youd fall over riasen said frankly but you saved petariels leg and so if theres ever anything you need ask i hope i wont have to kellen said but i will if and leaf and star defend us from the day riasen agreed now i have heard that rochinuviel has sent bullocks from her own herds and cheese from her own cellars you wont want to miss that probably not kellen agreed and if he was going to go give bad news to redhelwar he wanted to do it on a full stomach the dining tents were enormous the largest single structures in the camp designed to seat and feed hundreds at a time and to serve as a place where a large percentage of the troops could be gathered in one place in foul weatheror as a hospital in case of true disaster the tables and benches were delicate yet strong designed to be folded and stowed for easy transport in the event that the entire army should need to move somewhere despite having been constructed for function and efficiency the space maintained the ethereal beauty common to all the work of the elves and kellen was reminded suddenly of the teacup he had broken last night were the elves themselves like that teacup must the elves themselves pass away for shadow mountain to be destroyed this time was the attempt to save the elves the attempt to preserve beauty that would doom them all did jermayan know if the elven knightturnedmage did know then one thing was sure he wouldnt tell kellen maybe knowing for sure would be the one thing that would tip the balance toward disaster maybe working without knowing for sure was the only chance they had kellen shook his head it sounded like something out of the book of stars even at this hourlate for breakfastthe tent was halffilled with elves kellen walked the length of the tent toward the far end where it opened into the cooking area the army that had traveled into the mountains had contained only fighters and healers but an army kellen was discovering needed much more than that to function properly not only fighters but everything from blacksmiths to wagon drivers to armorers to launderers to cooksan army was essentially a small mobile city the kitchen staff seeing him took instant action without a word from kellen presenting him with a heavily laden tray burdened with roast meat cheese fruit buns and evenamazinglya few apples they were a little withered from winter storage but fresh fruit at this season was nothing short of a miracle kellen took his food to the nearest table and worked his way slowly through it trying to at least pretend he had table manners he wrapped one of the fruit buns in his napkin and tucked it into his tunic knowing shalkan would relish the treat later sometimes he wondered how the unicorn had indulged his sweet tooth before hed had kellen to cadge treats from breakfast overand feeling comfortably stuffedkellen went off to look for dionan he knew better than to think he could just barge in on redhelwar knightmage or no dionans tent was near redhelwars kellen waited outside while dionan dealt with another matterfrom the armor kellen recognized belepheriel the elf of the previous evening who had suggested that there might not be any more shadowed elves when belepheriel had left kellen walked up to the tent and courteously shook the bells attached to the tent flap i see you kellen knightmage enter and be welcome dionan said i see you dionan kellen answered in return he entered the tent dionans tent was set up as an office with a table and chairs a smaller table held a teapot and cupsit would have been startling if it did not kellen took a deep mental breath and resigned himself to attempting the elven dance of politeness once again one observes he began that the working last night went well and that because of that the wildmage atroist journeys back to the wildlands so very direct dionan sighed i will pour tea thank you kellen said meekly hed thought he was doing pretty good he hadnt come to talk about atroist after all i have recently tasted a most exceptional tea he said trying again it would please me greatly to know the name of this tea dionan said setting a tall pottery cup before kellen kellen lifted it and sipped tasting the familiar flavor of winter spice tea the name told to me was auspicious venture kellen said i am told it is a very rare tea i am pleased to have had the opportunity to have tasted it a rare tea indeed dionan said one may go half a lifetime without tasting it it had a strong flavor kellen said and it seemed to me that the flavor changed constantly i am sure i did not appreciate it sufficiently i am gratified by the variety of teas available for me to taste indeed dionan said you will find the teas of springtime to be strong and complex when they come into season i look forward to aiding you in your education should it be possible many humans are not interested i discover that i do not brew tea well kellen said i do not see that this should be a drawback to appreciating its taste the two go together dionan said a note of faint reproach in his voice still if you will begin by appreciating the taste you will come to understand the making for they are both part of the same thing the odd thing was kellen believed him tea and the making of tea had to go together likelike swordplay and the proper stance if you had one youd have the other you enlighten me he said bowing where he sat dionan smiled come to me to understand the spring teas and i will teach you the making with the summer teas for they are the most subtle and in the summer teas the making is all any fool may brew a winter tea he made an elegant motionnot a shrug but an indication the subject was about to change but perhaps you did not come to speak of tea perhaps i did not know that i needed to come to speak of tea kellen said but wisdom is not summoned only discovered another of master belesharons favorite sayings what was in my mind when i awoke this morning that redhelwar would wish to know what i had done and learned since i left him perhaps it is so dionan agreed if you come to his pavilion at the second hour after noon you may speak to him of the wildmage atroist and other matters touching on the current campaign i shall see to it that you have the opportunity to sample ice mountain wind as well you should find it interesting i look forward to that opportunity kellen said rising to his feet and bowing and i hope were both alive in the spring so you can teach me more about tea kellen spent the time waiting for the next move in this game of war on the hundred homely tasks that had been neglected while hed been in the field laundry a proper bath a thorough cleaning of his sword and armorand shalkans armornow that he had light and time to do them he discovered that his helmetcrest needed refletchingthe feathers had gotten thoroughly battered and bloodsoakedand dropped it off with the armorer on his way to redhelwars tent part of him chafed at this constant focus on inessentialswhat did it matter whether he had feathers on his helmet or not or what they looked likewhile another part of him was resigned to it he could not change the way the elves did things overnight in fact he probably could not change muchpermanentlyin his lifetime whenifthey all got through this and beat the demons back the elves would probably go right back to their old ways the next day and until they found the next enclave of the shadowed elves there was nothing more vital to be doing as he crossed the camp he could see mounted parties out on the plain drilling on horseback with the long elven lance it was beautiful to watch but it would be next to useless fighting underground he reached redhelwars pavilion and waited after a moment dionan summoned him inside dionan observes that you have recently had the good fortune to taste auspicious venture redhelwar said once kellen was seated perhaps you would favor me with your opinion of it it would be gratifying to perceive this tea through a humans senses kellens heart sank this was high formality indeed something he was terrible at and despite his growing interest in elven teas they were very different from the teas brewed in armethalieh and hed never really been much of a connoisseur tea had always been something you drank when you were thirsty and that was about it and of all time to start comparing the finer points of leaves still if that was what redhelwar wanted to talk about he guessed hed better do his best he needed to understand the elves if he wanted to be able to persuade them that he was right about shadow mountain but oh it was very hard to be patient at a moment like this but he put on a serious expression you honor me with your interest i know very little about tea and my tastes are uneducated as yet but i shall explain as best i can i am told that it is flavored with the fruit of the vilya to me it tasted of fruit and smoke and the taste seemed constantly to change i found it a strongflavored tea and to me that was very agreeable it was unlike any tea i have ever had and yet it seemed to remind me of something in a way i cannot define it is a good description for one unversed in tea redhelwar said one observes that it is odd for a knight to escape master belesharons tutelage without learning the ways of tea i have much more to learn in the house of sword and shield kellen said simply and many of the more subtle arts had been set aside to concentrate upon those which master belesharon considered more needful to my position and his limited time if that wasnt enough of a hint apparently it wasnt we shall do what we may to continue your education here redhelwar said now come try this tea cups were set before kellen and redhelwar and dionan seated himself with his own cup kellen raised his cup inhaling the fragrant steam it was hot yet somehow it managed to smell of the cold purity of ice the paradox was so odd that it actually distracted him from his everpresent anxieties kellen sipped cautiously it wasnt a tea for drinking carelessly like winter spice this was a tea that had to be paid attention to almost like listening to music it was herbal like most of the elven teas and there were flavors of grass and metal in itit sounded unpleasant but it wasnt not really and over all the sense of winter combined with the heat of the tea seemed to offer a promise that no matter how cold the day or how deep the snow spring would always come it is a riddle kellen said setting down his cup after several sips its hot but theres ice in it somehow snowand green things dionan exchanged a pleased look with redhelwar i did suggest that perhaps the brewing would not be wasted on him master i admit i had my doubts but you have convinced me redhelwar said yes winter mountain ice is one of teamaster thenandelets most subtle creations the recipe for its creation passed down in my family for many generations when you have finished we will pour something that requires less attention and speak of necessary things kellen finished his cup slowly still trying to figure out how something so hot could make him think of cold he didnt quite manage to solve the riddle before the cup was empty dionan removed the cups and replaced them with larger ones kellen caught the familiar comforting scent of winter spice tea good at least it wouldnt distract him from what he had to say dionan mentioned that you wished to speak of matters touching upon the wild magic and of the wildmage atroist redhelwar said when the new tea had been tasted as you know already he left this morning for the lost lands kellen said last night he spoke with drothi another wildmage there she said she will bring everyone south as quickly as possible and that because of the great trouble in the lost lands it will not be difficult to convince them to come go on redhelwar said drothi told atroistit was as if i were actually in her presence and could see her and hear everything she saidthat their raids on the lostlanders have continued through the winter and in addition monsters have begun appearing in the lost lands i did not recognize all of them from her descriptions but jermayan did he said that there are coldwarg icedrake shadewalkers and serpentmarae in the lost lands and the lostlanders have seen the deathwings that attacked the caravan near the crowned horns as well the coldwarg have destroyed two villages in the lost lands but she was not clear about where the others were only that they are close enough to the villages to be a constant and urgent threat and please please someone make the elves understand that urgent means urgent redhelwar sat and thought for several minutes after kellen had finished speaking this is fell news but good to have he said at last i shall send troops west to support the rangers andoreniel has sent to conduct the wildlanders to the eastern border if these creatures follow the wildlanders toward the elven lands it may be that our ancient landwards will not stop them all nor do i wish to witness a slaughter just outside our protection but perhaps you will favor me now with your views on why these creatures should have so suddenly appeared in the wild lands where they were not before this is a test kellen knew it with a sudden cold shock of intuition a test asin its waykellens opinion of the tea had been redhelwar was testing him but for what after the battle of the cavern redhelwar already knew how well he fought he chose his next words with great care drothi hasnt given us much information to go on but it seems clear to me from what she said last night and from what atroist has said before that they have long considered the wild lands their special private hunting preserve i think that now theyre using it as a place to breed up and collect these creatures in great numbers jermayan said most of them hadnt been seen since the great war and that hed thought most of them were extinct drothi said the wildlanders only knew them from ancient storysongs it seems to me from the tactics weve seen them using so far that they are not anxious to meet us on a battlefield they did that in the great war and they lost if they intend to try it again at all i think they want to make sure were very weak before they do so theyre using tactics of attrition first they struck at your water supply and that failed but if they can strike at crops and flocks and game in the case of the mountainfolk of the high reachesthey dont need to meet us on the battlefield they can starve us to death there was a long pause after kellen had finished both redhelwars and dionans faces were expressionless in the way that elven faces often were at last redhelwar spoke and all of these are creatures of cold if they are stopped by the landward barriers they will simply follow the mountains until they come to a place where they may pass and enter into human lands the elven general said grimly the coldwarg and the icedrake must stay in the realms of cold unless they are spellguarded but the serpentmarae and the shadewalker may roam where they will unless those who have created them are keeping them back to use later kellen said we wont know until it happens as with all things in war redhelwar agreed a reasonable analysis given the scant information that we have and i admit i have found their continued reluctance to take the field against us somewhat puzzling nevertheless there is another matter that it is in my mind to speak to you of today as a knightmage you fight for the elves and your valor is unquestioned but you are not truly of my command i would change that were you willing it is in my mind that you might be one of my alakomentaiia you would lead a troop under my orders and work as one with the other alakomentaiia of course you would need to take a destrier as your mount and for this i am truly sorry if shalkan consents it is also in my mind that mindaerel is without a rider and grieves at her loss you might take her did you find favor in one anothers eyes kellen sipped his tea without answering glad that the rules of elven formality allowed him time to gather his thoughts before he answered the alakomentaiia were subcommanders the elves didnt use a lot of ranks there were generals commanders and subcommanders and everything else was just understood by people who had known each other and worked and trained together for centuries as far as he could figure out hed have equivalent rank to petariel but below adaerion and the root word komenwhich was old elvendidnt really mean commander or anything like it it meantas close as you could come to it in nonelvishbrotherhood try to translate the whole thing and what you gotbesides a headachewas the servant of the brotherhood what redhelwar was proposing was as much an adoption as it was a military promotion but give up shalkan kellen wasnt stupid or dense enough to think this was nothing more than a polite suggestion on redhelwars part that he could lightly decline he wouldnt be with the unicorn knights anymore and he wouldnt have the protections against the demons that riding shalkan undoubtedly gave him but it would give him a visible and acknowledged placenot only in the army but in the war councils as well nothing would please me more than to accept your generous offer kellen said thinking hard and i believe it would be for the good of all but as you know shalkan and i are bound together by an unfulfilled mageprice it would not be wise or appropriate for me to answer without consulting him a proper answer do so redhelwar said rising to his feet to indicate that the interview was finished then make matters known to dionan and leaf and star guide and counsel you kellen rose to his feet and bowed elsewhere in the vast campit was as large as the larger elven cities by nowjermayan sought out vestakia on an errand that would he knew require all his arts of tact and persuasion if they were to find the rest of the enclaves of the shadowed elves quickly or determine with reasonable certainty that there werent any something jermayan doubted was likelythe only efficient method was for vestakia to search for them from dragonback it would certainly be the safest method as well for in that way he and ancaladar would be able to protect her from nearly anything that might seek to harm her all he had to do was manage to obtain vestakias agreement to the plan and he knew the child was terrified of flying there were only a limited number of places she might be having tried the more obvious places to no avail jermayan tracked her down at last in the flower forest vestakia would have been shy of crowds even without the added handicap of her demonic appearance having spent the first seventeen years of her life with little more company than a herd of goats she sought solitude whenever she could before the first war the flower forests had covered all the world and before the great war they had still been thick upon all of the elven lands and much of that terrain that was now bleak and sterile wasteland now all that remained of the great elven forests and their vast diversity of species existed only in the lesser woodlands that adorned the elven cities it was said that one day when the endarkened were utterly defeated the flower forests would begin to spread once more but jermayan wondered if perhaps that day was not meant to come it was winter but at every season the flower forest was lush jermayan followed the faint tracks in scattered snow and blown leaves deeper into the forest until he found vestakia moving carefully through the wood her gathering basket was already halffilledidalia or one of the other healers must have sent her here for supplies and some muchneeded solitude she stooped to gather a handful of winter mushrooms from the base of a tree then rose to her feet turning to face him jermayan she said she sighed and her shoulders slumped i know why you have come she said forlornly i suppose you must jermayan said yet i would not even ask were the need not so grave and i shall do no more than that but the othersthey would think i was such a dreadful coward ifif i did not do it vestakia burst out and its true of courseif i were just to fly over the elven lands and see if i could sense the shadowed elves everything would be much faster it might be the only way but it is so very highand i could fall and she was speaking very fast and her voice had gone thin and high with fear jermayan stepped over to her took the basket from her arm and set it on the ground and gripped her shoulders gently vestakia it is very high but you will not fall neither ancaladar nor i will permit it nor is it the only way ancaladar and i believe it to be the safest but that matters not if it will not work you must be calm and easy in your mind to be able to sense the shadowed elves and i do not believe that will be so if you are in fear of falling from my bondeds back vestakia managed a weak giggle no i guess not but she hesitated for a long moment maybe we should just go look at him indeed jermayan agreed picking up her basket we shall go and look at ancaladar the dragon was waiting beside the icepavilion that jermayan had created two nights before his great body dwarfing the structure completely for a few moments vestakias attention was distracted by the glittering structure of ice but she knew why she was here and her attention quickly returned to ancaladar shed seen him before of course but that was before shed actually considered getting on his back hes very tall she said faintly i am not so tall when i am airborne ancaladar assured her gravely and once i am in the sky my flight is as steady and level as you might wish my lady though i cannot control the winds jermayan will be sure to pick only the calmest days for flying though i am sure that i should jermayan said and ancaladar can sense the weather and how it will run from a great distance you know there is very little possibility that we might fly into a storm unexpectedly and there are all manner of ways in which we can secure you to his back would we have to fly very high vestakia asked in a very small voice the higher the flight the more serene the winds ancaladar replied but we would fly at your direction lady vestakia no one elses i dont know from how far away vestakia whispered almost to herself she looked pleadingly at jermayan he shook his head i cannot tell you that you must do this thing and i cannot tell you that you may not perhaps you would be comforted to take tea in the pavilion and consider matters further it will also give you the opportunity to inspect ancaladars saddle hmph the dragon snorted it is your saddle jermayan i have no need of a saddle but your bonded is a weak and feeble thing jermayan responded with a fond smile who requires many such aids and it is a work of art very fair to look upon thank you vestakia said i would very much like a cup of tea to her surprise it was quite warm inside the tent of ice there were carpets upon the floorjust like in the pavilion she shared with idaliaand lanterns hung from the walls for despite the fact that the day was bright and the ice was very clear its thickness made the interior of the icepavilion a bit dim one corner of the room was taken up with what must be ancaladars saddle and just as jermayan had promised it was a work of artthough vestakia hadnt yet seen anything made by the elves that wasnt and privately she thought they wasted a good bit of time on making things beautiful that only had to be serviceable she inspected it more closely while jermayan brewed tea she knew by now that every elven knight choseor had chosen for them a particular color of their own jermayans was dark blue so she was not surprised to see that the saddle and everything about it was in that color the leather was stamped with a pattern of tiny stars some subtly burnished with gold and silver leaf some merely indentations in the leather it was heavily lined with thick fleece both where the rider sat and where it would rest upon ancaladars neck several sets of wide padded straps went around the dragons neck and there were footbraces for a ridervery much like the horse stirrups she was already familiar withset into two sets of the straps the saddle itself was similar to a destriers saddle except that it was higher in the back and in the front and a second seat behindwhich explained the second set of stirrups this must be how kellen had ridden to the fortress of the crowned horns and when there was no passenger jermayan could carry things there continuing to inspect the saddle she encountered a set of very wide straps one set for each seat she picked one set up wonderingly they were too short to be part of the girthstraps but she couldnt quite figure out what they were for that is so i do not fall off jermayan said not turning from his tea preparations hed heard the faint clinking of course elven hearing was sharp it would be foolish not to take every precautionthough i am certain ancaladar could catch me if i did fall i could ancaladar said poking the end of his nose through the opening of the pavilion i would always catch you jermayan and you lady vestakia but the straps are strong and more could always be added as many more as you thought might make you feel secure and the tea is ready jermayan said gesturing to vestakia to come and sit beside him what willi mean do you know she stopped frustrated by her inability to phrase her remark as anything other than a question kellen made it sound so easy jermayan smiled and handed her a cup of tea for the next sennightat the leastredhelwar will consult with his commandersof whom i am not one thank leaf and starto decide what tactics will serve us best when we next engage our foe perhaps new weapons will be needed and those must be made and we must train in their use as well as in the best way of confronting the enemy all these things will take time and we do not know what those who oppose us may do should they do anything at all our plans will change vestakia sipped her tea and it is all up to me i must tell them where to go where the enemy is or not she knew she was the only one who could find the shadowed elves the wildmages had all triedeven jermayan whose power worked so differently from that of the other wildmagesand none of them could sense where the enclaves of the shadowed elves lay only vestakia had the power to sense demontaint and find the shadowed elves i must try she had led kellen to the black cairn though that had been the most terrifying thing she had ever done in her life she had gone down into the cavern of the shadowed elves and that had been worse and there had been true danger both times the threat of immediate death from an enemy who was trying to kill her but neither venture had made her sick with fear the way the thought of climbing onto ancaladars back and soaring into the sky did once when she was a child before mama had died she had gone with her accompanied by aunt patanene to the icewild river to fish the river had been in full spring flood and she had been far too young to be of much help so while mama and aunt nene worked the nets she had wandered away and walked out onto the slippery river stones and fallen in her heavy cloak had soaked through at once pulling her toward the bottom as the swift river current swept her along below the surface fortunately she had been upstream of the nets so mama and aunt nene had been able to rescue her before she drowned but ever afterward she had remembered the cold of the river and the airless choking darkness the thought of going up in the sky brought the memories back sharply flying made her think of drowning and her heart beat faster with fear if she did not agree to fly upon ancaladars back she knew jermayan would not rebuke her but if she did not agree to fly they would have to search for the caverns on foot it would take moonturns instead of sennights do what you can do you can do no more than that suddenly it seemed as if mama was beside her speaking in her ear mama had always said thatand after she had died aunt nene had said it for her it was as if mama had given her the right words to say now if i am too afraid up in the sky vestakia said slowly then i will not be able to do what you need but maybe we dont need to do it all at once if we could just practice a little to see if i could get used to flying her voice trembled and she stared hard down into her teacup hoping that jermayan could not see how terribly afraid she was to say even that much yes of course said jermayan calmly as if this were the simplest thing in the world today you will watch me put the harness upon ancaladar and sit upon his back he and i will help you get in to and out of the saddle as many times as it may take to make you feel comfortable with doing so then tomorrow as the weather will hold fine we will take a short flight if you like finding a white unicorn in a snowfield might be a difficult task but not when you had a sticky fruitbun left over from breakfast tucked into your tunic is that for me shalkan asked coming up silently behind kellen of course it is kellen said unwrapping the treat and holding it out for his friend um shalkan said finishing the bun in three bites next time get one of the marzipanstuffed ones i think theyre serving them at dinner tonight uhhuh kellen had no idea what shalkans sources of information were but they were always accurate especially when it came to sweets i need to talk to you youre even less happy than usualand thats saying a lot shalkan observed falling into step beside kellen redhelwar offered to make me an alakomentai kellen said bluntly there was no reason to mince words not with shalkan thank heavens at least there were a few beings in this army he didnt have to do verbal dances with for hours before he could get to the point and you accepted or not the unicorn asked id have to ride a horse unless kellen said hopefully no there are limits shalkan said firmly which horse he offered me mindaerel shes a good choice shalkan said gentle and well trained shell give you a lot less trouble than valdien does and you know how to ride not very well but you probably wont fall off but shalkan stopped and nuzzled him gently were not forever kellen or even for as long as a pair like petariel and gesade you know i will always be your friend buti will give you full honesty herea year and a day bonded to you will be quite enough for both of us and we both know that if you want those stiffnecked elves to listen to you theyve got to see what youre made of redhelwar is offering you a good place to start just dont think hes offering you an easy one i dont kellen said hed expected shalkan to objecthe realized now that part of him had been hoping that shalkan would object but shalkan thought it was a good ideas as well and that kellen knew meant he was going to do it hed ordered jermayan around on the way to the black cairn hed led the rescue party on the first expedition to the caverns he knew he could do it in the abstract but this was all real and immediate and a little daunting and much more formal than anything hed ever done before he wasnt good at being formal discussing tea and talking about the weather the way the elves seemed to expect their military leaders to do even when there was a war on give him something to hit with a sword sure he was fine better than fine but the rest of it hed have to learn that was all there was to it all right thensince you think i shouldi will kellen said taking a deep breath and dont think youre going to be leaving me behind if you happen to get sent off on any interesting missions either because that isnt going to happen shalkan said firmly youd only get into trouble if i let you go off by yourself right kellen said feeling a bit better so he wouldnt be riding shalkan but the unicorn wasnt going to let him go off into danger alone no interesting missions shalkan snorted eloquently switching his tail just be sure to tell the armorers so they can change mindaerels colors oh youll be quite the dazzling sight i cant wait do you want a faceful of snow kellen demanded do you think you can manage it shalkan drawled archly before kellen could react the unicorn bounded forward and kicked back sending a thick shower of snow into kellens face kellen fell backward coughing and sputteringand quickly assembling several snowballs to hurl with deadly accuracy at his friend hah he cried gleefully as his missiles found their mark for the moment troubles were forgotten if theyre going to fight the way the first ones did theres no point in risking vestakia in the first assault wave kellen said we do not know that they will nevertheless point taken adaerion responded we should risk vestakia as little as possible we dare not lose her there were days that kellen almost felt as if he were back in the house of sword and shield mornings were spent in battlefield drill with his new command afternoons at what seemed a neverending series of convoluted strategy meetings that made andoreniels council look straightforward every time he tried to drop a hint that the enemy wasnt acting the way they had in the last war the session turned into an excruciating analysis of what had and had not happened not what the elves were going to have to do in order to deal with it it was enough to drive him mad at least they might have something real to fight soon jermayan had actually persuaded vestakia to fly with him and they spent their days covering an expanding ring of territory centered on ondoladeshiron the area that theyd cleared was marked on a large map suspended in a frame in redhelwars tent and each day a new segment was marked offa tiny segment in comparison to the vastness of the elves lands but far better than nothing and much faster than if theyd had to do it on foot after almost a sennight of meetings kellen knew both the komentaiia and the alakomentaiia rather well though redhelwar still remained an enigma to him of the senior commanders padredor who had gone down into the caverns and faced the shadowed elves sword to sword tended to favor kellens suggestions and thankfully did understand that something had to be done to ready the fighters for an entirely new sort of warfare adaerion was conservative but hated to lose troops or assets for any reason and favored cautious plans that forced the enemy to commit its resources without forcing him to commit his own arambor preferred to draw the enemy out with a display of supposed weaknesskellen suspected his tactics might work fine in theory but in practice an enemy might take a pretended weakness and turn it into a real one and belepheriel still preferred to believe that there might not be any more shadowed elves at alland if there were they could certainly be dealt with by the tactics that had served his ancestors in battle for the last several thousand years his resistance was quiet but firm of his new fellowsinrankall of whom were old enough to be his grandfather at the very leastseveral had been newly raised in rank following the battle of the caverns and tended to be quieter than the others petarielcaptain of the unicorn knightsand rulorwenmaster of the engineerstended to be the most outspoken of the rest vestakia is not the only one who needs protection keirasti said our shields serve us well against sword and mace but not against a bucket of acid she winced faintly kellen knew keirasti had lost many of her command in the battle at the underground village and also knew that her long sleeves hid acidscars and stillhealing burns from that encounter i will hear suggestions for a defense redhelwar said formally no one spoke why didnt they say anything kellen wondered they all knew what the answer waseveryone in this room had been trained by master belesharon and he would certainly have told them just as hed told kellen if you cannot be where the blow is not you must arrange matters so that the blow strikes something other than yourself maybe it was some kind of weird elven etiquette having to do with doing things the way that things had always been done maybe they just didnt want to acknowledge the truth but kellen remembered what rochinuviel had said in time of danger new ideas must not be set aside merely because they are new a larger shield kellen said when it became obvious nobody else was going to say anything theyre no use on horseback but youre fighting on foot in the caverns something large enough to hide behind hide the children of leaf and star do not hide belepheriel objected if acid would improve your complexion it would not improve mine arambor said tartly yet the crafting of such shields would be the work of moonturns if kellen can show me what he is thinking of i believe my armorers can have at least a few ready within a sennight artenel said we have seen that good elvensteel is no defense against the vile liquids that such a shield as this must repel if they need not be metal then the work should go quickly let such shields be made redhelwar said bring the first one to me here as soon as it is completed the discussion moved onward kellen let out a breath he hadnt known hed been holding keirasti shot him a grateful look petariel edged over youre just lucky there probably wont be a flower war this spring he whispered id hate to face belepheriel in the field and youd probably lose your lance your garlands and your colors besides knightmage or no kellen nodded politely he had absolutely no idea what petariel was talking about chapter seventeen on the wings of dragons calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink its beautiful vestakia shouted over the rush of the wind jermayan nodded and ancaladar laughed aloud his deep voice booming through the sky today was the sixth day theyd flown and every day she grew to love it more she couldnt imagine now why shed feared it so even riding behind jermayan there was a freedom and a solitude here and she hadnt realized how much shed longed for it shed been alone for so much of her life that shed not only grown used to it that solitude had become a part of her fundamental nature living in the denselypopulated city of sentarshadeenand then in the evenmorecrowded war campshed yearned for something like this far more than shed realized in the beginning shed been constantly afraid that shed fall off her first flights were only minutes long and had left her shaking and sweatdrenched but stubbornly determined to master her fear and suddenly the moment had come when she was not afraid when she could look around her and see the wonder of the world below as only birdsand dragonssaw it and then their true work had begun each morning vestakia dressed in her warmest fursby now she had special clothing just for flyingand rode her palfrey to the orchard where jermayan and ancaladar waited they flew throughout the day landing once or twice to eat and brew tea for it was cold up in the high sky as they flew vestakia concentrated on the ground below willing herself to be aware of any hint of demontaint but as one day followed the next and she felt nothing vestakia began to wonder ifthough none of them thought it possibleher gift really wouldnt work from the air then suddenly today she felt it a thick queasiness at the pit of her stomach she drew a deep breath grateful as she had never been before to feel the onset of the misery that signaled that demontaint was near and she was even more grateful to realize by the way she felt that it was not just that she was high above that attenuated the sensation she tapped jermayans shoulder and pointed north he nodded and ancaladar veered off in that direction because they were moving so fast the nausea swiftly worsened and soon vestakia was gasping and shuddering clutching with mittened hands at the raised cantle before her down there she gasped knowing that either jermayan or ancaladar would be able to mark the spot close enough for the army to find it ah the yelp was torn from her as they passed directly over the site she expected the pain to begin to fade immediately as they flew away from the spot but to her dismay it didnt keep going she choked out ancaladar had begun to swerve back toward ondoladeshiron there was a slight bobble as he returned to his original course and vestakia whimpered as the pain began to increase again there she whispered it was the last thing she remembered some time later she realized she was no longer in the sky she was sitting on a blanket leaning back against ancaladars side no matter how cold it was the dragons body was always warm like summerwarmed rocks it was as if he radiated sunlight she took a deep breath her chest hurt the light brightened as ancaladar folded his wing back shes awake ancaladar said softly i know im awake vestakia said feeling slightly cross and at least we know it works we do indeed jermayan said folding her hands around a cup of hot sweet tea and helping her raise it to her lips and while i am grateful for the news it is perhaps somewhat distressing to learn that we have not one but two enclaves within a short days ride of one another to deal with and both of them very close to ysterialpoerin most ancient of the elven cities that isnt good is it vestakia said after a pause no ancaladar assured her there really isnt any way to make news like that sound good but were very glad to have it all the same since idalia worked with strong and sometimes toxic chemicals in her salves and potions kellen had brought her into the discussion with artenel the elven armorer already knew the shape of the shield kellen wantedlong and square but curved for strength but what to make it out of was another question metals right out idalia had said frankly acid will eat right through it glass is best to stop acid if its thick enough to stop a sword bladeand it will have to stop one or twoits too heavy to lift kellen protested and its fragile besides nay that is a myth artenel protested indeed glass does become fragile with time but new glass is supple and when thick is very strong yet a mace will crack it if it is not reinforced nor have i the resources here to make shields of glass what about wood kellen asked the acid will eat through it but not fast if its thick and wax idalia said its not as good as glass but its lighter and a lot more flexible if you layer wood with sheets of waxor even just cover a wooden shield with waxit should be even more resistant to acid they dont have to last forever just for one battle itll burn like a torch though but i will cover it in the finest leather artenel said brightening and the leather may be watersoaked before battle then wax laid atop the leather as well i think we may have discovered the very thing that will serve to confound the foe it would even serve to hold a thin pane of glass should some be found in time just then ancaladar returned to camp the dragon swept low over the camp once signaling that there was news before disappearing into the distance hes found them kellen said staring after the dragon it would be more accurate idalia said tartly to say that vestakias found them im going to go see if shes all right you stay here the news had spread throughout the camp by the time kellen returned to his tent shadowed elves had been found near ysterialpoerin messengers had already been dispatched to andoreniel and to the viceroy of ysterialpoerin to give warning and the army was making ready to deploy in all its strength since not one but two enclaves had been found shalkan said vestakia was fine though very tired kellen very carefully kept from going to see for himself not seeing vestakia left him plenty of time to worry about other things though all he knew about ysterialpoerin was that it was the oldest and northernmost of the nine citieswhich meant it would be even colder there than here if possible hed barely begun going over a list of things to doand orders to give when the bells at his doorway jingled be welcome kellen said turning it was kharren who was to adaerion as dionan was to redhelwar though she also commanded a force of her own adaerion was kellens direct superior in the military hierarchy which it had relieved kellen to learn when hed eventually discovered it better adaerion steady and fair than someone he could never hope to impresslike belepheriel kharren stepped inside and stood in the doorway of his tent regarding him politely i see you kharren kellen said remembering his manners kharren bowed slightly i see you kellen knightmage adaerion wonders if it would be convenient for you to attend him kellen bowed in return it is always a pleasure to receive adaerions wisdom after the formalities in adaerions tent had been observed and tea had been poured kharren departed leaving kellen alone with adaerion one observes that you distinguish yourself well adaerion said sipping his tea and that your discourse is always refreshing kellen tried not to frown what was that supposed to mean adaerions expression was impenetrable kellen wasnt sure whether hed just been insulted or not i thank you for your notice of me he finally said adaerion smiled impatience is a poor general yet decisiveness wins many an engagement this evening redhelwar dines with his senior commanders to discuss how best to approach the coming problem were you there perhaps you would contribute some remarks to the conversation but i wont be there because belepheriel at the very least would pitch a fit kellen supplied mentally even if it would be logical for a knightmage to be present this evening senior commander or not suddenly he realized what this little tea party was really about adaerion was giving him the chance to tell him what he wanted them to know so that adaerion could present kellens ideas kellen hesitated trying to figure out how to phrase his remarks in the indirect fashion that elven protocol demanded oh come kellen adaerion said gently and for the first time allowed a commiserating smile to curve his lips do you think i have never spoken with a human before i shall not shatter i promise you nor think less of you for being what you are for if you are human then you are also a knightmage and shalkans rider you are impatient and this is a good thing for some among us have far more patience than is needful speak as you would to one of your own kind no one else is here to hear kellen relaxed thank you he said with real warmth i thinknow that we have found themits important to know the layout of the inside of the shadowed elf caves before we enter in force we still dont want to risk vestakia for that though we might need her to find the entrances but we still have idalias tarnkappa and they worked before to conceal our presence from the shadowed elves what i think is that before the attack scouts wearing tarnkappa should be sent into the caverns to map them if theyre lucky they might even discover a route to the villages inside then well have some idea of what were facing so you would scout ahead adaerion said nodding he paused as if to gather his resources who would you choose kellen looked surprised more at the content of the question than that adaerion had asked it he was becoming used to the elves dropping into war manners now and then when it was the only convenient way to speed a conversation along the best scouts andanyone with experience in caves or rockclimbing some of the cave paths are pretty narrow and the tarnkappa wont protect someone from being discovered if theyre bumped into so they might have to climb to get out of the way how many would you send kellen shrugged forgetting for the moment that this was a human gesture adaerion might not understand it wont matter too muchonce theyre wearing the tarnkappa they wont be able to see or hear each other two or three perhaps so that at least one returns no more would you go yourself adaerion asked the question seemed somehow different from those that had come before it but kellen answered it just as honestly i would go if i was asked to i do not think that i would be the best one to send if i used the wild magic it might make them aware i was thereand during an important scouting mission is not the time to find out in some ways i am the best suited to the task and in some the worst i do know that while i would volunteer i am not the person best suited to make the decision these are good answers very simple adaerion seemed to be relieved to be finished with his questions and kellen was reminded once more that elves found questions not only rude but sometimes very difficult to ask as well perhaps even more difficult than he found their mode of speech i find some things simple other things hard kellen said i think perhaps everyone does beware he who finds all things simple for that one will make all things difficult adaerion quoted yes perhaps you are right to think so now there is much to do before we set out upon the warroad again i think you will find this journey very different than the first different kellen was to find was the greatest understatement hed heard yet from any of the elves the high mage anigrel tavadonlycaelon had said his elevation in rank was only a matter of time and so it had been a very short timewas a very busy and very contentedman his days were full and his masterand more important his mistresswere both more than pleased with him as the head of both the magewardens and the commons wardens he now knew everything that took place in armethalieh from the sullen grumblings in the lowest dockside tavern to the rash speculations of the entered apprentices who drank at the golden bells finding commons who would inform upon their fellowsfrom nobles in need of ready money to pay gambling debts to merchants hoping their warehouse fees could be eased to laborers who would tell what they knew for a bottle of brandy and a bag of coppershad been childs play and anigrels spells ensured that all of his informants were entirely trustworthy finding mageborn who would act for the good of the city had also been easier than hed expected fear had done his recruiting for himsome had come to him anxious to prove that they were not involved in his imaginary conspiracy others were equally anxious to align themselvesafter the banishings and resignationswith the new power in the city all were useful for anigrel not only collected information he dispensed it rumors were the weapons in his arsenal and he deployed them with the skill of a master strategist now the mageborn rememberedno one was quite sure who first spoke of itthat the lady alance lord lycaelons wife had been mountainborn and that the two childrenyes twothat shed borne to the archmage had both been banished for practicing the wild magic everyone knew that the mountainfolk were overrun with wildmagesundoubtedly alance had insinuated herself into the city in an early attempt to destroy it through wildmagery and had passed the heretical taint down to her children praise the light the archmage had been spared but it only proved how deep the plots against the city ran and that even humans would ally themselves with the treacherous otherfolkand worse the inhabitants of the golden city could trust no one but themselves and did not the elves consort with wildmages as well had not in fact the recently arrested sons of the deposed council members been attempting to learn wild magic possibly with elven help elves had been seen in the delfier valley near the time of the arrests undoubtedly coming to the aid of their confederates praise the light they had been stopped soon this tissue of lies and halftruths was common knowledge among the mageborn they accepted it without question why should they not it fed their prideand their deepest fears among the commons the rumors were simpler the wildmages had caused all the recent trouble in the city because wildmages hated cities and destroyed them wherever they could they meant to destroy armethalieh they could hide undetected among ordinary folk but would always reveal themselves because they did not follow the precepts of the light and so did not believe in the wisdom and goodness of the high mages everyone knew that to become a wildmage a blood sacrifice was needed since wildmages were corrupted young they usually murdered their parents the archmage had discovered the horrible truth about his son when kellen tavadon had gone mad and tried to kill him only the glory and wisdom of the light had protected the archmage and allowed him to survive to destroy the monster in human form that his son had become slowly the city became a place of fear in the low city brawls and riots increased as the fearful commons turned on one another the riots were of course the work of the wildmages to protect against them spells and protective talismans were neededand now the costs of such things were higher than ever before each sennight anigrel came to the council bringing reports of the rumors he had gatheredrumors he himself had started now distorted out of all recognition and the council acted upon his reports the watch was increased in numbers patrolling the streets constantly new and tighter curfews were introduced for the commonsnow everyone in the city must be able to present a talisman glyphed with their residence and their occupation upon demand the city was divided into districts and a permit was required from the newly appointed district magistratesall of whom reported to anigrelto travel outside of ones home district and in their fear the commons and mageborn alike not only tolerated these changes but welcomed them and clamored for more all in the name of safety and protection anigrel found it all immensely gratifying the city was growing more and more terrified and disaffected and blamed one cause the wildmages the commons had never heard of the endarkenedthe mageborn had made certain of that and the true history of the cityof the banishing of the wildmages of the creation of a magick wholly under human controlwas a secret shared by only the highest ranks of the mageborn soon anigrel would be ready to proceed with the next step of his plan all he must do now was tighten his grip upon the mageborn even furtherpersuade them that their enemy was not the endarkened had never been the endarkened that it washad always beenthe wildmages and that only the endarkened could save them once more the moon waned to darkness once more anigrel retreated to his private rooms within the mage courts bearing with him a small black bag such as mages used to transport the smaller tools of their art by now he had rooms in a dozen quarters in the city where he was known by a score of names but for his communion with his dark lady only this place would do here anigrel met with some of his magewardens and kept an evergrowing collection of documents and information on his brethren there was high mage corellius with his low taste for beerand his tradesman father over the years corellius had developed a number of interesting appetites that would prove quite embarrassing to him were they exposed to public scrutiny possibly even fatal in the current climate of opinion and mage nadar arbathil whose son perulan had needed to be dealt with so thoroughly in his youth perulan had engaged in quite a correspondence with folk across the sea who was to say that lord arbathil had not assisted him in doing so such a man might easily deal with wildmages as well there were moremany more some in positions of power some the sons of powerful men all malleable and two who were not with anigrels appointment the mage councils number remained at eleven there were two seats vacant and so far lycaelon had blocked every attempt to fill them anigrel intended to winnow the council further vilmos would be easy to remove the man was halfsenile and tottering toward reunion with the eternal light a little gentle pressure from lycaelon would gain his resignationfor health reasons of course and if vilmos would not see reason it would be a simple matter some night when he and anigrel stood together in the circle to see that some great working went just wrong enough to cripple the old dodderer or perhaps even kill him vilmos had been excused from the circle lately on account of his age but it would be easy enough to goad him into returning perhaps that would even be for the best there had been too many resignations from the council recently a death in service would be more fittingand uplifting to the commons arance and perizel were another matter both men were in their prime both stood in the way of anigrels plansand neither was susceptible to pressureon themselves or their sons a man who had begun his rise to power by murdering his own fatheras anigrel hadcertainly did not blink at a little more blood on his hands but the high mages were well guardedand difficult to kill but at the moment a more pleasant task awaited him from its small casket anigrel removed the iron bowl and set it on the desk that now occupied the center of what had once been his sitting room now that there were visitors to his rooms the casket shimmered with spells of warding and would open only to his touch but that in itself attracted no attentionthe high mage anigrel tavadon was known to have many secrets all of which he kept for the good of the city from the pencase at his belt he took the knife he would use and set it beside the bowl now he opened the bag and lifted out a large grey cat no doubt it had been some mageborn misss pampered pet but anigrel had seen it walking along the top of a garden wall and the opportunity had been too good to pass up it had been the work of an instant to enchant the creature into sleep and tuck it into his bag no one had seen him now before the animal could rouse fully into wakefulness again he lifted the cat over the iron bowl and slit its throat with a quick deft motion blood spurted into the bowl with a ringing sound filling it to the brimcats held so much more blood than the pigeons he had been forced to employ for so many years and a child a child would be even better but he must be careful his dominion over the city was not yet complete a mist of power formed over the steaming surface of the blood anigrel leaned forward dropping the lifeless body of the cat carelessly and opening his mind to his dark lady as he had each dark moon for almost his entire life what do you have to tell me my slave my love her darkness filled his mind and his soul completing him in a way that nothing else ever had and ever could from the moment he had first seen her reflection in a mirror in his fathers house when he had been a child of eight he had been hers utterly she had been his first and best teacher he would do anything to be with her always quickly he told her everything and soon they will be yours entirely mistress anigrel said humbly yet something troubles you my pet i sense it two inconvenient mages they must be removed he felt the rich glow of his dark ladys amusement umbrastone is what you need my jewel my slave it will poison a mageman and send him to his bed mixed with another poison it will render that poison undetectible by magic anigrel felt a thrill of delight two members of the high council poisoned in their beds with only a little care he could make it look as if their own families were responsible now that i have done something for you you must do something for me it is so hard for me to come to you sweet anigrel you must change the wards that bind the city you have the power now yesss only let him remove three more members of the council and it would be a simple enough matter to suggest that the mage council was now stretched too thin for its members to stand in the circle for every great working to suggest that maintaining the citywards be turned over to a specific trusted body of mages who performed no other task anigrel would select them anigrel would lead them and anigrel would corrupt them thoroughly it can be done i will need a little time but it can be done i swear it shall be done he felt his dark ladys delight flood through him filling his body with black heat anigrels body shuddered in ecstasy the intolerable pleasure building until he collapsed to the floor insensible it was just as well savilla reflected once the connection was broken to occasionally reward ones slaves it made the eventual betrayal so much sweeter and she looked forward with longing to the day when she could bring her sweet anigrel here to the world without sun and teach him what it truly meant to love the queen of the endarkened it was nearly a quarter of a centuryas the lightworlders counted time since she had made her first move in the war she had acted in secret for she knew the work would cost her dearly and in her weakened state any of her nobles might have challenged her she had withdrawn to a secret place deep within the world without sun and there she had worked tirelessly destroying hundreds of captives gathered in secretand all of her own folk who knew of her plan and then she had struck at armethalieh even with all her gathered power she had barely been able to slip through the wards the city wrapped about itself but her effort had borne fruit she had touched a childs mind receptive eager willing to learn all she had to teach chired anigrel now anigrel tavadonhad provided the crack in the citys defenses that would soon bring them utter dominion over their loathed enemy he had become hers utterly growing in darkness and strength through the years moving ever closer to the citys heart of power it was not a true breech of the citys wards as yet it was only a way for her to communicate unnoticed with her most devoted slave willing to work toward any task she set and now victory was near she could taste it just as she would taste the blood and flesh of her sweet slave when he was no longer useful to her the centaur party continued to travel toward the elven lands after the first few days cilarnens aches and pains subsided though riding a draft mare was just as uncomfortable as hed thought it would be in every spare moment he practiced with his new wand the need to practice burned in him he had his gift back and being able to use it again felt better than anything he could have imagined it was as if hed had a hand cut off learned to live imperfectly without it and then suddenly had it regrow before his eyes he was only an entered apprentice but he had been studying so hard to try to impress his father that he already knew many of the more complex spells that kept the city runningspells to purify water spells to bind and unbind spells to banish vermin spells to calm animals and send a nonmage to sleep dozens more but though he built the glyphs that summoned his spells until his eyes ached and his body trembled with weariness he was careful to leave them incomplete there was no need for them here after all and he really wasnt sure what would happen if he completed them for some of the spells he lacked some of the needed components for others well the more powerful the spell the more necessary he had been taught that it was to work it within a warded circle all his teachers had said that over and over from the first day hed entered the gates of the magecollege cilarnen wasnt really sure what would happen if he did them out here summoning fire was one thingand mageshield could be done anywhere but the others he didnt know and there was no one to ask seeing his difficulties with the high magick wirance and kardus had offered to try to teach him their heretical sorcery cilarnen had accepted with very little reluctance he was cast out by the light already so it didnt really matter to him one way or the other and kardus was the closest thing to a friend cilarnen had among the centaurs though he felt an odd aversion to wirance not a dislike precisely but more as if wirance simply wasnt someone he should be around these are the books of the wild magic kardus said placing three worn volumes into cilarnens hands one night as they gathered around the fire all the wisdom of the herdsmans path is written in their pages perhaps you will learn what you seek herein cilarnen accepted them gingerly there was a certain illicit thrill in handling them cilarnen opened the first of the three books the leather was stiff and slippery in his hands the covers oddly hard to open theres nothing here he said in surprise say you so kardus said frowning look deeper at what cilarnen demanded irritably theres nothing to see the pages are blank he handed the three books quickly back to kardus who looked down at the first book thoughtfully shaking his head in puzzlement try mine wirance who had been standing a few feet away stepped closer holding out a single slim volume cilarnen took it reluctantly it was one thing to tell himself he was willing to investigate other kinds of magic it was another to have his nose rubbed in the reality of it kardus could obviously read what was written on the pages of his three books perfectly well but to cilarnen those same pages were blank unlike the books of the centaur wildmage wirances book seemed to burn in cilarnens hands writhing under his fingers as if it wished to escape it gave him the same feeling he had around wirance only magnified a hundredfold he gritted his teeth and pried the book open it was blank he let the covers snap shut with a sigh of relief when he relaxed his grip it was as if the book flew from his hands and back to wirances nothing cilarnen said it was blank too well we know that whatever you are youre not a wildmagenor meant to be one it seems wirance said thoughtfully i am a mage of armethalieh cilarnen said hed never been so sure of anything in his life halftrainedmaybe never bettertrained than thisand lacking most of his tools but still a mage of the golden city and he would save her if he could a great pity we do not know more about what that means wirance said slipping his book back into his pack perhaps the elves will be able to help cilarnen nodded politely but privately he doubted it hyandur had been kind but as much as he stretched his imagination cilarnen could not imagine the elf tutoring him in magick we should be near the border of the elven lands soon comild said he had to raise his voice to be heard over the wind wailing through the treesas wirance had predicted before theyd left stonehearth the fair weather had only held for so long and for the last several days they had been traveling through increasingly heavy snow more and more cilarnen found himself longing for the comforts of the cityit never snowed in winter there and there was always hot water whenever you wanted it hot water hot food hot baths declare yourselves the voice came out of nowhere a figure had appeared in their path where none had been beforehooded and cloaked in white furs that made him almost impossible to see through the snow he held a short bow pointed at them an arrow nocked and ready wirance wildmage of the high hills brings comild of the centaurkin and his warriors to answer andoreniels call wirance answered yet do i see one among you who is neither centaur nor wildmage the elf observed his weapon unwavering cilarnen had been riding at the front with kardus comild and wirance now he wished hed stayed toward the back maybe they just wouldnt have noticed him thenthough that was unlikely on tinsins back he towered over the rest of the troop i am kardus wildmage it is my task to bring the human cilarnen to kellen wildmage kardus said stepping forward there was a long pause cilarnen blinked unable to believe his eyes suddenly there was a second elf standing beside the first the two of them were identical in every way except that the second elf held a long staff instead of a bow you will accompany me the second elf said he turned and walked off through the winter forest without waiting to see if they followed as they rode through the trees cilarnen realized they must be in elven lands now he looked back but the first elf had vanished again they rode now in silence broken only by the whistle of the wind and the crunch of the snow beneath their hooves where before the quiet had seemed companionable now it was awkward as if all of them felt that someone might be listening and judging all that they might have to say to one another for the first time it occurred to cilarnen that he could have been stopped and turned back at the border what would have happened thento him and to kardus since kardus would have been unable to complete his task would it have been like the magickal backlash to a spell of the high magick gone wrong or would kardus simply have camped on the border until his patience wore them away their guide walked steadily onward never looking back at last as the short winter day drew toward a close they reached a clearing that had obviously been prepared for them windbreaks had been strung between the trees in a halfcircle around the clearing to block the brunt of the winter wind the ground had been swept clear of snow and leaves very recently and cilarnen could see that it was as smooth and level as the floor of a house the sense of this place being a sort of outdoor house was heightened by the fact that in the center of the clearing was a tall cylinder its exterior was covered with the most beautiful tilework cilarnen had ever seen and through the openings in the side he could see the gleam of embers a stove who would put a stove out in the middle of a forest elves he supposed all you need is here others will come for you remain until they do the elf said with that their guide vanished as if hed possessed no more substance than the snow itself elves comild said with a sigh of relief as their guide departed elder brothers and all but still he trotted into the clearing the other centaurs following him cilarnen hung back it wasnt that this place made him uneasynot even as much as wirance did and down deep inside he trusted wirancebut ever since theyd ridden across the elven border hed had the peculiar sense of being inside a dream he couldnt wake up from and this place just made it worse kardus looked up at him inquiringly kardus back at the border if they hadnt let the two of us through what would you have done cilarnen asked we would have waited until they did kardus replied simply it is my task to bring you to kellen wildmage and yours to go but how long would we have waited cilarnen asked pressing for information until they did kardus said i have been in elven lands before the elves are not like humans nor like centaurs they are cautious but they are not unjust nor would they deny a wildmage who needed to complete a task sentarshadeen the kings city lies near the border if we did not leave they would send to andoreniel and he would tell them to let us pass so his guess had been right kardus had been perfectly prepared to wait the elves out cilarnen feltrelieved kardus wasnt going to abandon him are we going to sentarshadeen cilarnen wondered what a whole city full of elves would look like i do not know but come it is cold here and elven stoves give good heat the elves had left them more than a wellprepared campsite and a stove with a good fire at the edge of the campsite were more provisions casks of cider and mead bread cheese and the carcass of a deer skinned and dressed for roasting after weeks on the trail with nothing but dried food and trailrations to sustain them the centaurs fell upon the fresh food with shouts of delight and soon the savory scent of roasting meat filled the clearing and the smoke of bubbling fat spiraled up toward the trees as they waited for the chunks of meat to cook they shared out the bread and cheese and filled their tankards with cider and mead after trying the mead cilarnen stuck strictly to the ciderhed had a thorough education in alcohol by now and the mead in those barrels packed a kick like a centaurs hoof maybe if things were different he might welcome the release that came with surrendering to the lightheadedness that a bit of intoxication would bring but here nowno the last time he had relaxed a demon had come when it happened again he would not be unready wrapped in his blankets belly full some of cilarnens sense of unreality faded leaving him time to worry about what was to come what was he going to say to kellen outlaw when they found him cilarnen wasnt quite sure the demons words were etched in his memoryhed never forget thosebut their meaning seemed constantly slippery there was only one thing he could be really sure of he had his gift and he shouldnt cilarnen wokeas had become his habit long before theyd set out on this journeyjust before dawn in stonehearth granders house would already be awake and stirring he would wash and dress grab a quick breakfast of porridge and hot watered ale with the other apprentices and go off to his morning chores at the stable on the trail his first duty in the morning was to see to the fire hed learned to sleep with his boots inside his bedroll he pulled them on without letting too much cold air in and got to his feet his blankets wrapped tightly around him there was a moment of shocking cold as he dropped the blankets and pulled his hooded cloak around himself then cilarnen was ready to face the day the centaurs were just beginning to stir last night kardus had showed him how the elven stove worked the elves had left a good supply of the charcoal disks they used for fuel cilarnen opened one of the bottom gates of the stove good there was still a good bed of embers left he picked up several of the disks and set them on the embers then went to see to tinsin there was a water trough nearby but theyd emptied it last night he supposed he could fill it with snow and melt the snow to give her and wirances mule a morning drink but when he reached the place where the animals were tied there was an elf there automatically cilarnen glanced down at the snow there were no footprints this is not a riding animal the elf observed regarding cilarnen unblinkingly he looked enough like hyandur to be his twin did all elves look alike centaurs dont have saddle horses i had to ride something cilarnen said are you but the elf had vanished again cilarnen shrugged and went to find a bucket and his wand the same spell that warmed his bathwater at home turned a trough full of heaped snow into a trough full of water without much trouble he led tinsin and the mule down to it for their morning drink he brought them back up and secured them again out of habit the centaurs made quick work of breakfast and by the time it was done cilarnen could see a cart coming toward them through the trees it was on runners because of the snow and was drawn by four of the most beautiful horses cilarnen had ever seen draft horses yes there was no doubt they had been bred to pull heavy loads but beyond that they resembled his tinsin as little as a swan resembles a duck their heavy winter coats shimmered like the finest velvet and all four of them were so closely matched in color that there was not a hairs worth of difference among them they were a pale bronze color and their manes and tails were the color of heavy cream their harness was only a few shades darker than their coats and the cart they pulled of wood a few shades darker still it was as if the whole was some fabulous carving in amber a rich mans toy riding beside it were two elves on horseback cilarnen had thought that roiry was the most beautiful animal hed ever seen but the two stallions utterly eclipsed the elven mare both were greysone nearly white the other a dark dapple greyand they moved with an elegance and grace that made him think of dancing the cart pulled to a stop one of the elves dismounted and walked forward he approached comild the others precede you by many days the army marches to ysterialpoerin it is a great distance here are supplies for the journey and a guide i make known to you nemermet who will accompany you kardus stepped forward and bowed i see you nemermet may leaf and star grant us all a safe journey by the herdsmans grace the elf on the back of the pale stallion bowed slightly i see you kardus wildmage may the herdsman watch over your people by the grace of leaf and star take what you need from what is here more will be provided along the way get to work comild ordered his men with a wrench cilarnen forced himself to stop staring at the elves and the elven horses he quickly saddled tinsin and packed his gear upon her back then went to aid the others in emptying the cart under the watchful eyes of the elves soon the entire contents of the cartfood blankets even a couple of braziers and a store of charcoalhad been transferred to the centaurs packs there was even grain for the horse and the mule cilarnen hoped that nemermet was telling the truth about there being places to restock along the way because there certainly didnt seem to be any grazing to be hador any hunting either it would be hard enough finding running water though he could always melt snow it is good that luermai made known to us nemermets name kardus said to cilarnen as he helped him fill tinsins packs one of the few advantages of riding a draft horse was that she could carry a great deal in addition to her rider luermai you know him cilarnen asked we have met before kardus said but if he wished to be known to all he would have given his name to give us nemermets name is kindness enough as the elves reckon things cilarnen puzzled that out for a moment but arent we doing them a favor he said at last kardus looked at him if the dark folk strike first in the elven lands is it a favor to the elves to fight them there or is it better to wait until they come back to stonehearth cilarnen blushed i guess youre right but it just seems as if they ought to be more welcoming no one save wildmages has crossed the elven borders in a thousand years that there is need for anyone to do so nowkardus switched his tailupsets them when kardus put it that way it made more sense to cilarnen he supposed it was just like well elves and centaurs in armethalieh only not quite because the elves were letting them in even though they apparently didnt like it all that much and the high council hadnt let hyandur in at all when everything was ready nemermet turned his stallions head and began to ride off through the trees the centaurs wirance and cilarnen followed adaerion had been right about this journey being different from the last for one thing there was someplace kellen was supposed to be every single minute of the day from before dawn until well after dark for another this time he didnt ride among the unicorn knights and he found he missed their freeandeasy companionship more than hed expected to and he missed shalkan most of all for now that he was riding mindaerel in the middle of the army he only saw shalkan for a few hours each day when he could steal time from his other dutiesand there were many of them now that the army was on the move watches and patrols were added to the drills and planning meetingsnot that there was much time for drilling since they were heading toward ysterialpoerin as fast as the full army could travel the weather worsened the more they traveled north almost every day now brought snow and in the deep night kellen could sometimes hear the howling of wolves he didnt envy jermayan and ancaladar their post flying above the armyand back and forth through the cloudsall day keeping an eye on the territory ahead they were a sennight out of ondoladeshiron when the first attack came that day began like any other up in the greyness of false dawn into his armor pack his gear and off to the cookfire assigned to his group for a quick breakfast of tea and pastriesthe cooking tents werent unpacked at every stopthen to the horselines to collect and saddle mindaerel and gather his troop and find their place in line by then it was dawn and the army had begun to move as they rode kellen realized that he felt unsettledjust as he had the day that calmeren had come back to sentarshadeen bearing news of the ambush at the crowned horns leaving his troop in ciltesses charge he rode back through the line until he found adaerion collecting his commanders attention the two of them rode a little aside from the line and stopped somethings going to happen he said bluntly though keeping his voice pitched as low as possible i dont know what but soon i felt like this the day we learned that the children had been taken adaerion glanced back toward the line to where vestakia was riding beside idalia she seemed completely untroubled whatever kellen sensed it owed nothing to demontaint not all of the creatures that served the demons bore demontaint ride up and warn petariel to be on the alert then pull your force out of the line and ride to flank adaerion rode back toward the line but kellen could hear his next words clearly kharren allow keirasti shunendar duarmel churashil and thenalakti to know that it would please me greatly if they would ride to flank this morning and be alert for any inconvenience kellen urged mindaerel up toward the head of the army the mare seemed grateful for the opportunity to stretch her legs and soon overtook the unicorn riders who were as was the custom riding far ahead a vision a vision of spring petariel cried sighting him gesade wheeled around and came trotting back toward mindaerel seeming to run across the top of the snow rather than through it kellen reined mindaerel to a stop and waited for petariel and gesade to reach him youre to be especially alert today he hesitated i have a feeling what kind of a feeling shalkan asked trotting up now that he was no longer kellens mount shalkan continued to stay with the unicorn knights most of the timeto keep an eye on things hed told kellen like the day calmeren came that something bad is going to happen kellen said but vestakia doesnt feel anything not them then gesade said switching her tail anything else im not even sure about that kellen said he wouldnt have confessed it to anyone else but the unicorn knights petariel especially were the closest thing to family he had here outside of idalia jermayan and vestakia but were glad of the warning all the same petariel said nodding and even if nothing comes of it dont hesitate to give it again id rather a thousand warnings that came to nothing than to miss one we needed me too kellen said fervently he turned mindaerels head about and headed back toward the line to find ciltesse theyd been riding in flank for nearly an hour when he heard ancaladars shriek of fury kellen looked up just as a flash like lightning out of season lit the sky it silhouetted the dragon against the clouds surrounded by a flock of winged wheeling shapes like an eagle harried by crows deathwings ware thenalakti suddenly shouted from across the column horns blew taking up the warning call with the precision of a dance the elven army stopped and deployed for battle suddenly kellen could see all of it spread out before him like the markings on a map the deathwings above and the coldwarg packs heading for the army preparing to strike the column at several places at once under cover of the growing storm thenalakti duarmel and shunendar were on the far side he couldnt reach them but he keirasti and churashil were here and the flanking units became skirmishing units when the call to battle was given coldwarg he said to ciltesse theyll go for the unicorns first he stood in his stirrups and drew his sword making himself as visible as he could skirmishers to me thirty mounted knights pounded up the line they were ninety by the time they reached the head of the line and kellen saw his first coldwarg in the flesh the creatures were nearly the size of a unicorn their remote ancestors might have been wolves but wolf was only a small part of their nature now they carried their heads low their thick necks and heavy shoulderhump of muscle giving killing power to the enormous jaws that could crush a limbor a neck with one bite their silvery fur was faintly dappled giving them perfect winter camouflage and their thick wide paws were perfectly adapted for running over snow they were the ultimate predator and the pack sweeping toward petariel and the others outnumbered the unicorn knights three to one kellen swore softly to himself seeing the perfection of the trap the unicorns could not retreat to the safety of the army and they could not outrun the pack people will die here it was kellens last private thought archers he shouted keirasti churashil split them up suddenly the air was filled with arrows hed seen jermayan drop an icetiger in seconds with the deadly elven bow but though every arrow found its mark in a coldwarg body the arrows barely seemed to inconvenience the monsters they did however make the coldwarg aware that kellens force had arrived half the pack split off from attacking petariels knights and came for kellens flowing over the snow toward them like a ripple of wind the skirmishers could expect no assistance from the main body of the army kellen could sense that it had problems of its own ancaladar and jermayan werent able to stop all the deathwings some of them were getting through and not all the coldwarg were going after the unicorns chursashil and keirasti had split off keirasti drove past him heading for the coldwarg that had nearly reached petariels force kellen and churashil drove into the other pack side by side the elvensteelshod hooves of their destriers plowed the shattered bodies of the coldwarg that hadnt moved fast enough to escape into red ruin beneath them but it wasnt enough the horses grunted as they wheeled presenting tight walls of hooves and armor to the pack it was the traditional defense against coldwarg but defense would not serve the elves this day the moment the knights had taken their position and braced for attack the coldwarg facing them turned away and took off to resume the assault upon the unicorns once more follow and they were vulnerable yet there was no choice kellen spurred mindaerel to the attack once more as soon as they left the safety of close formation the coldwarg turned back and attacked it became a deadly dance over the snow through his battlesight kellen was aware that thenalakti duarmel and shunendar had joined him but the other commanders were as handicapped as he was by the coldwargs tactics the beasts would not stand and fight the skirmishers and when the cavalry gave chase they were easy prey all around him he could hear the shouts of elves and the screams of horses despite their best efforts the elves were too spread out every time they tried to regroup the coldwarg went after the unicorns again the unicorn knights were clustered together but the rest of the skirmishers kellen included were scattered by now in a wide ring around them he could see it as clearly as if he sat upon ancaladars back and the coldwarg were taking every advantage of that scattering them further he had to make them come to him shalkan oh please dont let shalkan be dead i dont think i could stand it kellen the unicorn appeared out of nowhere he was red with blood he looked as if hed been bathing in it but he was alive why hadnt kellen made him wear his armor hed make him wear it every day from now on he swore it im going to form square around the unicorns make them stand when i do they wont shalkan began make them shalkan sprang away a coldwarg leaped out of concealment in the snow and bounded after shalkan without a thought kellen sent mindaerel after it sword poised to strike a single downward blow severed the creatures spine for a moment he had a breathing space he looked around unable to see anyone he recognized where was keirasti where was thenalakti square he shouted at the top of his lungs unable to tell if anyone could hear him square around the unicorns skirmishers on the fields of ondoladeshiron hed seen the elven knights practicing their maneuvers and thought of those maneuvers as only a pretty dance useless in the war they were about to fight today kellen learned differently all about him on the battlefield a ripple seemed to move through the elven knights as the order was passed they moved as the fingers of one hand fighting through their separate retreats to execute the order kellen had given he urged mindaerel down into the fray closing up with the knights to either side slowly bloodily the square formed the knights fought for every inch of ground the pack seemed to sense what was happening and tried to drive through the gaps in the forming lines but at last the monsters were fighting on the elves terms they met a wall of steel and sword and hoof and at last the impenetrable square closed around the unicorn knights is everyone kellen began oh leaf and star beside him duarmels voice was flat with despair kellen looked his heart sank across the battlefield he saw keirasti riding toward them her mare running flatout petariel was behind her in the saddle limping along beside the mare on three legs her top speed now only that of the mares was gesade there was no hope gesade must have been wounded keirasti had stopped to cover her retreat and now the three of them were going to die in sight of sanctuary because if kellen broke the square to send out a rescue party the coldwarg would take more of them not just his friends the coldwarg circling the square saw them in the same instant archers fire kellen said his voice rough everyone hold steady he had no spells that would stop a coldwarg pack jermayan did he was sure but jermayan wasnt here but he was a knightmage duarmel take command hold them he gathered up mindaerels reins take me im faster shalkan was suddenly at his side kellen didnt question how shalkan knew what he was going to do or what it cost the unicorn to stand so calmly among the knights he flung himself from mindaerels back to shalkans and with a bound they were away shalkan flew over the snow like a blast of wind kellen barely noticed that he had no trouble keeping his balance on shalkans bare back the elven arrows flew all around them but despite the wind and the snow kellen knew that none of the shafts would strike shalkan the coldwarg were not hurrying as they loped toward their prey the death of their victims was certain and they would savor the fear before the kill though some fell to arrows the others did not slacken it would only take one or two to accomplish the kill kellen saw petariel push himself from keirastis saddle and fall to the snow beside gesade he saw the unicorn knight rise gracefully to his feet and draw his sword closer now there werent many of the pack left alive seven perhaps eight of those that had begun the attack many had fled many had died kellen and shalkan were within reach of the stragglers now he could attack them but that wasnt the point the point was to defend petariel gesade and keirasti keirasti had turned back when she felt petariels weight leave her saddle he could hear her shouting gesade was shouting too kellen didnt bother to listen to the words he was focused on what he must do the coldwarg could have attacked him and shalkan as they passed but they didnt kellen hadnt thought they would the creatures would find it far more entertaining to let them reach the others and kill them all together he was counting on it help me he said to shalkan almost conversationally yes the unicorn answered simply they reached the other three shalkan was running flatout bounding over the snow kellen thrust himself off backward landed standing in the snow whirled and drew his sword the coldwarg sensing at last that something was not right with their prey abandoned their lazy lope and began to run they closed the distance between them and kellen in seconds the world became nothing more than a series of targets kellen had no time to think only to be afterwardlong afterwardhe would realize it ought to have reminded him of fighting the outlaw hunt but it didnt and it never would because the kellen who faced the coldwarg in the elven snow was a very different man than the frightened boy who had faced the pack of stone dogs sent by armethalieh that boy had been unsure of himself uncertain of what to do kellen knew exactly what to do he cut through the neck of the first beast that leaped at him the second didnt die but it ran badly wounded he stopped counting after that each blow merged into the next it was as if they moved to meet his blade he knew where they were knew where they would be it was snowing harder now masking the world in an impenetrable veil of whiteness and it didnt matter kellen saw the world in patterns of blue and green and red his attacks their attacks defense retreat he did not plan to retreat he would not be where their blows landed they would be where his blade could find them it did not matter if he killed or merely wounded all that mattered was that he became the center of their attention the foe that could not be ignored that he dominated their thoughts until there was room for no other prey in their minds except of course that he was not the prey they were they just hadnt realized it yet here was the dancing circle as it had been drawn for him by all his teachersjermayan master belesharon those who had taught them back to the beginning of the world within it was what he had sworn to protect attack came from every side he crossed the circle again and again his sword spraying blood across the snow like dark stars at last there were no more targets the patterns faded around him and vanished into whiteness and his sword suddenly felt too heavy to lift warily kellen gazed around with his own eyes he could see nothing but blowing snow but the battlesight told him the coldwarg were gone or dead he looked around where were the others there was no one in sight they had to be here shalkan he said hoarsely keirasti petariel gesade now that it was over he could feel the ache in his muscles the weariness of long exertion in the cold before he could panic a mound of snow a few feet away thrashed shalkan got to his feet and shook vigorously then petariel and keirasti climbed out of the hollow where they had been shielding shalkan the two of them gently lifted gesade to her feet then at last keirasti allowed her mare to rise from where she had been lying the animal shook herself exuberantly and snorted as if in disapproval of the entire matter i believe i now know what a carpet feels like petariel observed his voice absolutely emotionless youiwait i stepped on you kellen said confused several times shalkan said i thought it best if we stayed out of your way i put orata down to use as a shield and gesade next to her shalkan told us all to curl up as tight as we could keirasti said hed said hed help kellen remembered with a sudden flash of gratitude if hed had to concentrate on protecting the othersif theyd been visible targets for the coldwarg well things might not have worked out so neatly im sorry kellen said contritely his voice thick with the exhaustion that poured over him like winter honey i didnt mean to step on you petariel stared at him as if hed gone mad kellen could read the expression very clearly even through petariels helmet you saved our lives you saved gesades life and now youre apologizing for it its true what they say wildmages are all mad lets go kellen said he shook his head to clear the snow that was falling into his face through his helmet slits and found enough energy to lift his sword and sheathe it those things wont be back today but im tired cold and we need to get back and report if you can walk that far gesade i can run if i have to the unicorn said proudly lifting her head let me go on ahead keirasti said ill let them know that leaf and star have favored us this day she vaulted into oratas saddle and cantered off in the direction of the army kellen looked up at the sky he could see nothing now that he had the luxury of worrying he hoped the rest of his friends were all right he knew as clearly as if the coldwarg had the power of human speech what their intent had been attack the army kill as many of the unicorn knights as they could they could not hope to destroy the entire army but every warrior they could kill was a small victory for those they served and if the deathwings had managed to kill ancaladar or capture vestakia you killed a coldwarg pack petariel said in tones of awe breaking into his thoughts i wish id been able to watch there werent a lot of them kellen said realizing the moment he spoke that the words sounded like the worst sort of false modesty he tried again petariel im a knightmage that kind of fighting is just one of the things im good at because of the wild magic like idalia can heal its not likelike something i trained all my life to have i mean its just something i am not something i had to earn it doesnt mean he wasnt sure what he meant to say so he stopped but you came for us you and shalkan petariel said that reminded kellen of something he rounded on his friend fury giving him a burst of energy he wouldnt have believed he had left only a moment before and what did you mean by that coming out here with me like that you didnt have a scrap of armor on you could have been killed i wanted to see the fun shalkan said innocently besides i knew youd protect me shalkan stretched out his neck batted his lashes and managed to assume an infuriatingly sappy expression of heroworship despite the fact that he was still covered in drying coldwarg blood i really ought to beat you senseless kellen said fervently gesade snorted oh dont make me laugh she begged it hurts the four of them began to walk slowly back toward the others through the thickening snow chapter eighteen the price of power calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink cleaning up after the battle took all of that day and the next vestakia was unhurt and idalia said that according to jermayan the greatest injury he had sustained in the battle was having to listen to ancaladar complain about how the deathwings tasted there would be more dead had you not given warning jermayan said later that night kellen had helped idalia heal gesadea coldwarg had bitten through her foreleg crushing the boneand then visited with his wounded in the hospital and then made his secondand more completereport of the day to adaerion he should by rights be so completely exhausted he couldnt stand but he found that he was too keyedup to sleep hed gone to the horselines to check on mindaerel and found jermayan there with valdien jermayan sensing kellens mood better than kellen did had brought him back to jermayans tent but there are dead it isnt enough kellen muttered staring down into a mug of mulled cider you would save all the world if you could jermayan said yes kellen said simply it was that but it was more than that today the responsibility for saving the lives of others had been realnot an abstract not a distant thing the lives he had to save were right there in front of him and people lived or died by how fast he could think and how many right decisions he could make in a very short time it had been his first taste of the responsibility he had chosen the responsibility that would only become greater the longer he pursued this path the weight of that responsibility felt like iron chains and every day would not always end in victory as this had someday he might have to stand and watch friends die because that was the only way to attain a greater victory he knew that and wasnt sure that he could bear it kellen there was a note of urgency in jermayans voice that startled him he looked up jermayan was studying him as if he were a problem to be solved in the great war the wildmages who fell to the dark they had fought first for the light they saw friends brothers sisters loved ones all die perhaps they wanted to save the world as well i oh kellen blinked as jermayans words sank in but i cant stop caring that they die no jermayan agreed but dont let your caring heart do the enemys work for him now go to bed after that first assault flank patrols became the order of the day during the march every unit of the army took a turn at riding them though the coldwarg and the deathwings never again attacked the army in the same numbers they had the first time jermayan reported that both creatures trailed the army at a distance constantly everyone knew this before very long and everyone was on edge waiting wondering what was going to happen next though jermayan and ancaladar could easily have flown back and destroyed the packs to do so would have meant leaving the marching column vulnerable to aerial attackand redhelwar was certain that this was precisely what their enemy was hoping for kellen agreed and had said as much since the coldwarg attack his position in the army had undergone a subtle change he had proven himselfshown that he could think quickly and well in battle and act efficiently to save lives and form strategies that would kill the enemy the senior commanders gave greater weight to his advice as for the subcommanders and the field knights kellen was welcomed at every fire and in every pavilion he spent as much time with them as he could knowing deep in his heart that the day would come when he would have to command them he wondered if redhelwar suspected it as well the progress he was making toward his goal should have made him happyit was what he needed it was what he was working forbut all kellen could see was the pressure of needing to be both right and lucky the next time he went into battle as well each time the stakes were higher and to gain his ultimate goal he could not afford a single misstep but at least they listened the creaturesdeathwings and coldwarg both were obviously acting under orders and kellen wasnt the only one to suspect that vestakia was their ultimate target the elves knew that the deathwings could snatch a rider from the saddletheyd seen it done one day when one of the whitefurred monsters had slipped past ancaladar and jermayans defenses though the archers had forced the creature to drop its prize unharmedso now vestakia rode in one of the wagons it was stuffy and far less comfortable than riding on horseback but at least she was safe from being snatched out of the saddle but others would not be and so ancaladar flew over the army and let the coldwarg follow it the land around ysterialpoerin was heavily forested dense pine woods made it utterly impossible to keep to anything resembling a formal line of march and slowed the armys progress as alternate routes had to be found time and again for the supply wagons once they entered the forest the deathwings had stopped shadowing them but the coldwarg did not the trees provided far too much cover for the coldwarg everyone knew they were there but jermayan and ancaladar could not always see them the elves hunted them when they could but no matter how many they killed it never seemed to discourage the rest kellen waited he knew something was going to happen and it would be when they let their defenses down and it did when the army was two days away from ysterialpoerin the coldwarg attacked again this time by night when half the camp was asleep kellen was roused out of unquiet dreams by shouts and horns and was halfway into his armor before he was even awake grabbing his sword he ran toward the horselines they were heavily guardednext to the unicorns the horses were the most attractive target for the coldwarg since without their mounts and draft animals the army would be crippled the battle this time was brief they lost a few of the horses and less than a dozen knights but once ancaladar was able to find a place to land and take jermayan onto his back the victory was not in doubt the third attack came days later this time at dawn just when they were all encumbered with packing and harnessing up one moment kellen was tightening the saddle girththe next only a glimpse of something moving at the edge of his vision warned him then the coldwarg were on them they came on as if driven and this time there was something desperate in the way they flung themselves at the elves there was no thought and no science in this attack they attacked as the shadowed elves had with hysterical ferocity as if they were not only trying to overwhelm the elves with mere numbers but as if the unseen hand directing them had decided to sacrifice them entirely kellen made a target out of himself and in a moment he was surrounded by the coldwarg which was exactly how he wanted it and he began his deadly dance perhaps it had seemed clever to the enemy to attack nowbut it was the worst of all times for them to try when the warriors were fresh well rested bodies still warmed and not stiff and cold with long riding the red and blue shadows of battlesight dodged around him circling driving in dashing out be where they arent making feints snapping enormous jaws be where they arent expecting it was what jermayan would call a challenge be the target they cant ignore with a new challenge involvedthe elves had come to understand that his battlesight allowed him to see every danger including friendly fire and were taking advantage of that so while he made an irresistible attraction of himself they surrounded him and sent arrow after arrow into the ring of coldwarg around him now his own dodging had to include the arrows that missed their targets and even a knightmage grew tired kellen drove his sword through the body of a coldwarg he was beginning to tire and as a consequence the strike was clumsyhed missed vital organsand the monster dragged itself along his blade jaws snapping as it strained to reach his throat he flung himself onto his back pulling his dagger and jammed it with all his force into the beasts eye he felt the tip of the blade grate against the inside of the back of its skull as the blow drove home as it thrashed he got his feet into the coldwargs chest and shoved with all his might flinging the dying creature away from him he rolled to his feet and looked around for fresh targets but his battlesight was strangely clouded a blue haze filled it though to his normal vision the scene was clear and with normal sight he could see the coldwarg walkingslowly stiffly away from their prey their heads and tails were down and their hackles stood up stiffly something is happening let them go kellen said quietly to the elves around him the coldwarg staggered away from the horses into the trees moving in an eerie silence kellen could see their sides heaving the beasts were panting as if they were running when they were a bowshots distance away from the horselines they stopped and burst into flames they burned as the stone houses in the shadowed elf caverns had burned with a hot and furious flame that touched nothing around them the fires burned so quickly that none of the beasts had time to utter so much as a yelp and in seconds nothing remained but pools of snowmelt where the coldwarg had stood the enemy had discarded its weapon the day they reached ysterialpoerin redhelwar and adaerion rode down into the city with kellens troop along as escort as the army continued onward toward the place where it would settle itself semipermanently ysterialpoerin was the closest in formjermayan had told kellento how the elves had lived in the days before the great war as they rode kellen kept waiting to see a sign that they had reached the city and finally realized that there wasnt going to be one they were already in it he looked around as much as he could without changing position it was nearly impossible to tell where the trees stopped and the buildings began so artfully did they blend together kellen had to look very closely as he rode but yesthere was a house built somehow between two of the largest trees several dozen feet over their heads and there was another on the ground this time its stone surface nearly indistinguishable from the stone outcropping thrusting into the forest beside it only it wasnt stone he realized a few moments later but tile made to look like stone and some of the trees werent trees at all he realized with a shockunless trees had doors in them and windows hed thought that sentarshadeen was beautiful and that its dwellings blended into the landscape but riding into ysterialpoerin was like riding into a dream while you were still awake even the snow seemed to have fallen here with the intent to fall beautifully at lastkellen suspected theyd ridden all the way through the center of the city to reach their destination but he hadnt seen a single elf and very few things he recognized as a housethey came to what would be in human lands the viceroys palace the forest opened out into a clearing at the far side of it stood a house the first one kellen had seen here that was easily recognizable like the house of leaf and star back in sentarshadeen it was a house not a palace though it was quite large unlike the house of leaf and star it was made entirely of wood ancient wood weathered to grey by the passing of untold seasons like the house of leaf and star it glittered with winters ice but everywhere that kellen could see the wood was carved delicate intricate carvings of vine and flower leaf and bud it was as if the house itself might burst into flower at any moment and take root in the earth beneath standing upon the portico of the house were two elves wearing elaborate jeweled and feathered cloaks of white pale grey and iceblue the riders stopped redhelwar dismounted and walked forward he bowed deeply i see you kindolhinadetil voice of andoreniel in ysterialpoerin i see you neishandellazel lady of ysterialpoerin we see you redhelwar general of andoreniels armies be welcome in the house of bough and wind branch of leaf and star you and those who ride with you we come on the wing to speak our word redhelwar said not moving from where he stood yet be welcome as the wind that shakes the bough is welcome kindolhinadetil said at this second invitation redhelwar moved forward adaerion dismounted and gestured for kellen to follow the three knights followed the elven viceroy and his lady into the house of bough and wind kellen resolved not to say a single word while he was here no matter what the knights of ysterialpoerin had seemed just like the rest of the elves kellen had met but on reflection he realized that must be because theyd left ysterialpoerin and traveled extensively through the elven landsand spent a number of years at the house of sword and shield besides kindolhinadetil and his lady were another pot of tea entirely he suspected they wouldnt have any particular patience with roundear informality knightmage or no he knew the elves were an ancient racefar older than humansbut walking into the house of bough and wind was the first time he truly felt that age walking through the doorway was like walking into a summer forest it looked nothing at all like a human house he smelled the green scent of new growth heard the twittering of birds and saw the flash of butterflies among the trees the fantasy was perfect yet there was no magic in it only elven artifice and the love of illusion passing between two trees they found themselves in a clearing there were other elves presentnot dressed in winters white but in the soft bright colors of summer they stood so very still that only kellens knightmage senses made him certain they were there at all and not merely some vividly lifelike artwork created to serve the same function as statuary kindolhinadetil and neishanellazel removed their long cloaks beneath them they too were dressed in summer colors kindolhinadetil in shades of green and blue neishanellazel in copper and gold servantssomehow kellen had no doubt there were servants in ysterialpoerincame forward to take the knights heavy winter cloaks as they did kindolhinadetil and his lady seated themselves on elaborately carved chairs and turned their whole attention to redhelwar it would please us to hear all that you may tell neishandellazel said speaking for the first time conciselyat least for elvesredhelwar explained about the shadowed elves how vestakia had discovered evidence of their lairs nearby and how he and his army had come north to exterminate them there was a silence after redhelwar had finished speaking in a human conclave it would have been filled with questions but on consideration kellen supposed they were all pretty irrelevant the elves of ysterialpoerin would know that redhelwar would do the job as fast as possible and the best way possible and protect ysterialpoerin as well as he could so what else was there to ask what ysterialpoerin can do to aid you will be done in andoreniels name kindolhinadetil said at last send your injured to us that they may find peace and rest and know that our forests stand ready to succor those who are heartsick for the forests of home know also that we will provide the last gift to all who require it the gifts of the voice of andoreniel are great and his counsel makes good hearing redhelwar said bowing very low once more and now i must return to my army so that all may be done as andoreniel wishes let it be so kindolhinadetil agreed rising to his feet it took kellen some time to figure out what the viceroy had meant but he had nothing but time as they rode to catch up with the army the last gift must be burialonly the elves didnt bury their dead they hung them in trees and kindolhinadetil had been sayingmust have been sayingthat it would be appropriate to put the shadowed elves there too he couldnt fathom ithow they could still feel kinship with those creaturesbut it wasnt up to him after all perhaps it would make them feel a little less guilty as for the rest kellen hoped there wasnt going to be any need of it but pragmatically thinking with two enclaves to clean out he knew thered be losses and the herdingfolk wildmages hadnt arrived yet though the army had added several more wildmages from the mountainfolk when they caught up to the army dionan told redhelwar that jermayan and ancaladar had scouted ahead and found a place suitable to make an extended camp padredor and belepheriel had taken several units ahead to secure and prepare it for the arrival of the main force and the baggage wagons while jermayan and vestakia made an overflight to determine the exact location of the caves all is as i would have it redhelwar said with satisfaction by a few hours before dusk most of the camp was in place though it would be another full day before all the larger pavilions were unshipped an hour earlier six elven scouts carrying tarnkappa had ridden out to the locations now marked on redhelwars mapjust as vestakia had sensed in her first overflight the two enclaves were only a short distance apart ancaladar had been able to spot separate entrances but that was no guarantee that the two sets of caves did not connect beneath the ground perhaps the scouts would be able to tell them whether they did or not when they returned for now vestakia was resting in the healers tent the strain of coming so close to such a large concentration of demontaint and then doing such delicate work of detection had exhausted her but fortunately the camp was located far enough away that she was not constantly affected by the nearness of the shadowed elves and there was nothing kellen could do to help her once again kellen forced himself to stay away from her bedside trying to give vestakia as little thought as hed give a sword or one of artenels new shields idalia or jermayan would tell him if there were anything truly wrong meanwhile he forced himself to focus on other thingsthe strange and somehow deeplyunsettling beauty of ysterialpoerin the fact that there was to be a strategy meeting after supper the proximity to ysterialpoerin and the fact that they could finally unship the ovens from the carts meant that the food would be better though elven food was never really bad kellen was getting tired of an endless diet of tea soup stew and porridgethough it did occur to him that he ought to be grateful to have the luxury of being tired of food of any sort the mountainfolk had been existing on much less and the time might be coming when he would look back on soup stew and porridge with longing youre restless tonight ciltesse said coming up to him with a cup of tea kellen took it gratefully warming his gloved hands he knew now why fighting in winter was something a sane man avoided at all cost the weather was another enemy to fight one that never got tired and never retreated and had the terrible weapons of cold and storm forever in its arsenal i suppose i wish it were over with kellen answered or at least that we knew more than we do ciltesse smiled faintly as do we allthe caverns cleansed and we home at our firesides and better yet that there were no need to have cleansed them at all yet all things come at a price is the fighting now the price of the centuries of peace in elven lands in the past kellen wondered or was it the price to pay for centuries of peace in the future if they won he didnt know he only knew that he felt terribly uneasy about what was to come or there was a scream from the healers tents and all kellens sense of unease coalesced into a sudden terrible sense of warning he flung away the cup with no idea where it went and gave poor ciltesse a shove in the direction of the unicorn knights were going to be attackedgo warn as many as you can kellen whirled and ran headlong through the camp toward redhelwars tent giving the alarm to all he passed it had been vestakia who had screamed she could sense demontaint at a great distance kellens own abilities relied more on hunchesthe more he faced a particular enemy the more accurately he could predict how that enemy would behave in battle and sometimes the wild magic gave him advance warning of danger to come but not enough to do any real good kellen thought in bitter frantic frustration he reached redhelwars tent and barged inside not stopping for courtesies redhelwar was disarming himself as dionan stood by in the distance kellen could hear a few of the elven warhorns blowing sounding the watchandward the enemy is attacking kellen blurted out vestakia sensed it too suddenly the calls of some of the horns changed an enemy had been sighted yes so it seems redhelwar said with remarkable calmness reaching again for the pieces of his discarded armor see to your command kellen sketched a salute and pelted off again as fast as his feet could take him thanks to vestakia and kellen the elves had gotten some advance warning but the camp was large and there hadnt been time to spread warning throughout the entire camp before the first attackers appeared coldwarg attacked the sentries appearing out of the snow like ghosts this time they were accompanied by shadowed elves showing no concern for their own survival the shadowed elves ran directly toward the center of the camp side by side with their fourfooted allies not all of them reached the camp those already beneath the trees jermayan could not reach but those still on open ground were easy prey for his magic but those who did get into the camp caused damage enough they were armed with bows not swordsthe terrible poisoned arrows that the elves had learned to fear in their last battleand with worse than that sacks of small fragile spheres filled with acid they threw them with deadly accuracy and as the spheres shattered the thick syrupy liquid inside burned through anything it touched but because they were fragile the spheres were vulnerable targets as well the elven archers quickly learned to aim not at the shadowed elves but at the sacks that they carried shattering the contents with a volley of arrows and leaving the acidsoaked carrier screaming in agony upon the ground for a few brief minutes until a merciful sword stroke ended his life there was no order of battle no organization kellen had not even managed to reach his troop again before he found himself facing a slavering coldwarg over the body of a dead knight the monsters jaws dripped blood and saliva it gazed at kellen with glowing yellow eyes for a timeless moment growled and sprang kellen stepped forward into its leap bringing up his sword like a boarspear the weight of the coldwarg knocked him flat but the beast was dead before they both hit the ground impaled through the chest he rolled out from under it wrenching his blade free as he did and went looking for fresh targets he smelled smoke some of the tents were burning and the reek sent a wave of panic through him then discipline took hold of him stop think kellen took a deep breath and stood where he was there was nothing to gain by running around like a chicken trying to avoid the barnyard axe he must use his gifts the shadowed elves werent stupid alien to everything the elves knew but not stupid even with the coldwarg to help them they were outnumbered here and had thrown over their main advantages of absolute darkness and confined spaces to make this attack the elves would kill them all and they must know it yet they had attacked anyway why they are creatures of the shadow the shadow fights a war of the spirit what is the greatest blow it could strike against the elves this night suddenly he knew this is a feint the shadowed elves mean to distract us from discovering their true target until it is too late and he knewwith a sudden awful certaintywhat it was he ran toward his tent there were shadowed elves and coldwarg along the way that he could have killed he did not stop he found isinwen near his tent the rest of his troop was scattered attacking the attackers but he sensed them nearby ciltesse kellen demanded isinwen shook his head kellen had ordered ciltesse to spread the alarm he might be anywhere there was no time to wait for him gather the troop get to the horses we ride at once stop for nothing alakomentai isinwen said he turned away running toward the others to pass the word kellen moved through the chaos of the camp giving the same order over and over he blessed the gods of the wild magic blessed leaf and star blessed all the trust hed earned in the sennights passedhis men abandoned the camp and the battle and followed him by the time he reached the horselines isinwen and the others who had gotten there first had retrieved their mounts and saddled them kellen vaulted onto mindaerels back and set her off as fast as he dared away from the camp and back into the forest through deep snow at night in the woods there were a thousand ways for a horse even an elven destrier to break a leg on uncertain footing but some of them must get through and that meant they all needed to know why this attack is a trap to occupy us kellen called back over his shoulder they strike at ysterialpoerin i think they mean to burn it unconsciously he shifted mindaerels path to the left and realized hed sensed an obstacle beneath the snow behind me and follow like my shadow he ordered and shifted to battlesight by this time he had learned to rely upon it as he did his muscles it was less like shifting to a different way of seeing and more like focusing on something you wanted to see clearly there the path to takethe clear path the safe pathburned a bright clear blue against the snow often narrow always twisting he set mindaerel upon it urging the mare to her fastest speed he felt the body beneath him gather and her speed redouble an ordinary horse would not have run so for her rider a horses nightsight was not good and where a horse could not see it would not go but mindaerel was an elven destrier she would answer her riders commands until her heart broke she ran through what to her must be utter darkness trusting absolutely to kellens touch to guide her behind him the elven knights in his command followed in a single file all riding at breakneck speed in mindaerels hoofprints back in armethalieh kellen had never believed in the light idalia had called it bloodless and it waseven more unconnected to the reality of daily life than the study of the high magick jermayan and the other elves swore by leaf and starand kellen had fallen into the same habitbut he wasnt at all sure what that meant as for the gods of the wild magic well kellen believed in the wild magic because he worked with it daily he had no doubt that it had a purpose outside itself maybe that was what the gods of the wild magic were but they didnt seem to be anything you could talk to directly right now he wished they were hed ask anyonethe gods of leaf and star of the wild magic the great herdsman of the centaurs the huntsman of the mountainfolk vestakias good goddessfor help in reaching the shadowed elves before they did whatever they intended to do he was certain now that theyd left for ysterialpoerin before the second group had struck at the camp and if sentarshadeen was the head and the crown of the elven cities ysterialpoerin was surely its heart to attack it to burn it as the whole might of andoreniels army stood by oblivious would be precisely the sort of thing shadow mountain would love best its why they never did it before they were waiting for an audience they want us to see how helpless we are and despair they want to break our hearts and our spirits he strained his senses as mindaerel raced over the snow he had gone now beyond hope beyond prayer he willed their victory because they dared not fail he could sense ysterialpoerin ahead its boundaries were as clear to his knightmage senses as if they were lines upon a map he could see its elven sentries and knew that they saw nothingnot the shadowed elves not the elves racing toward them but he could sense the shadowed elves he urged mindaerel onward in the darkness he dared not take his hands from the reins to unlimber his bow for his hands were her eyes he was by far the poorest shot in the entire campexcept perhaps for vestakiabut a bow had more range than a sword and even if he didnt hit any of the shadowed elves he could at least get their attention once they were in range at last his battlesight told him that they were and the shining azure paththe path of safety for a running horse widened out ringing the city with a band of manicured protection in that moment kellen blessed the elves attention to perfection for now the path was smooth enough that not one destrier would put a foot wrong between here and the city go kellen said motioning the others up as he reached for his bow he knew if he looked with his eyes he would see only darkness he knew the elves nightsight was better than his but he wasnt sure how much even they could see here under the overshadowing trees balancing on mindaerels back he strung his bow and nocked an arrow without thought he drew and fired without waiting to see whether hed hit the target he fired again neither as fast nor as sure as the elves but by his arrows the enemy knew it had been discovered all around him now the elven bows were singing kellen flung his own aside and drew his sword the shadowed elves could have runor tried to but as always the sight of true elves seemed to wake some madness in them they turned and the eight warriors among them began launching arrows of their own kellen could see the green fire of the poison upon their arrowheads their bows did not have the range of the elven warbows but the elves were easily within range of their arrows now their only defense was to ride the shadowed elves down before they could launch too many of their deadly poisoned shafts hoping none of the darts struck true and everyone riding with kellen knew it the shadowed elves only defense was to cut them down at a distance they knew that too they were twenty against eight and the shadowed elves wore no armor speed and momentum won when they closed the distance it wasnt even a battle in seconds the shadowed elf males were no more than heaps of rags upon the snow struck down by elven arrows trampled by the horses hooves several of the knights dismounted and ran forward swords drawn to make sure they were truly dead kellen isinwen cried pointing kellen saw the four survivorsall femalesrunning toward ysterialpoerin they ran in pairs each pair carrying a large jug between them without hesitation he urged mindaerel after them once he would have hesitated to attack them it seemed like an eternity ago now he took mindaerel to the right as isinwen swung left his sword flashed out and the nearest females head went flying he spun mindaerel facing the other and struck again beside him as if he were kellens reflection in a mirror isinwen did the same it was over kellen breathed a sigh of relief and then slowly mindaerel sank to her knees in the snow kellen sprang from the saddle as the mare rolled to her side her ribs heaving as she gasped for breath mindaerel he cried she raised her head mindaerel lady kellen choked sinking to his knees beside her now that he looked he could see the baleful green of poison the shadowed elf arrows sunk into the muscle high upon her foreleg just below the protection of her armor yet during the fight she had given no sign of her wounds she had run on fleet as the clouds before the moon had done everything he asked of her mindaerel he whimpered hearing her name mindaerel lay her head down in the snow again stretching her neck out toward him kellen reached out to touch her muzzle but before he could complete the gesture she gave a great sigh and stopped she was gone a moan escaped him as his throat closed we hail the bravery of a great warrior isinwen said quietly dismounting to stand behind kellen may she run forever through the fields of vardirvoshan kellen bowed his head feeling his eyes fill with tears hed lost a comrade a friend one who hadnt perhaps truly understood the battle or the need to fight it but who had given up everything she had to it out of love he stroked her muzzle but it was a pointless gesture the flesh was already cooling beneath his fingers for mindaerel was truly gone perhaps her spirit was running free through the fields of vardirvoshan where she had been foaled he hoped so he took a deep breath and got to his feet the task was not yet complete he knew what the shadowed elves intended but not how they were going to do it lets see what was in those jugs when they broke the wax seal and pried off the lids they found that both jugs were filled with oil and dozens of rings of a strange whitish material four of the male shadowed elf dead were carrying a second set of bowslarger and heavier than their usual onesand quivers of iron arrows with oddly shaped tips kellen used one of these to hook one of the whitemetal rings out of one of the pots of oilcautiously as he trusted nothing to do with the shadowed elves he held it up puzzled as the elves gathered warily around as the oil dripped from the ring it began to smoke then to burn glowing brightly and the shaft of the arrow began to glow redhot startled kellen dropped the arrow into the snow but to his dismay the snow did not quench the rings fire if anything it burned more brightly melting down through the snow and the ice beneath and curls of smoke began to rise from the buried leaves kellen scrabbled through the snow until he found the arrow shaft it was hot even through his gauntletsand plunged the ring swiftly back into the oil the ring sizzled and smoked the oil simmering with its heat and he shook the arrow gently wincing at the heat until the ring dropped off he quickly tossed the arrow aside and to his relief it cooled in the snow like ordinary metal the metal burns like one of jermayans firespells sihemand said sounding troubled theres no magic to it not that i can sense anyway kellen said puzzled but it would have burned as well as a fire spell oh yes those metal rings launched into the trees and houses of ysterialpoerin would have burned the forest and anything else they touched no matter how much water the elves had thrown on the blaze declare yourselves came a voice out of the darkness a little late arent you kellen thought uncharitably kellen knightmage he said turning in the direction of the voice he racked his brain he knew there were proper forms for this sort of thing but he didnt know them alakomentai to adaerion komentai to redhelwar armys general hand of andoreniel by the grace of leaf and star ruler over the nine cities isinwen supplied smoothly not missing a beat we come in a good hour for as you see by the blood on our swords there are those who wish ill to ysterialpoerin heart of the land and to kindolhinadetil voice of andoreniel and neishandellazel his lady isinwens voice took on the force and melodious tone of one making a speech these who would harm the forest came in the night bringing fire to the trees out of season and in a way not willed by the great balance that governs all things yet we came before them as the wind comes before the storm and so the forest stands strong by the will of leaf and star and all who would harm her lie dead by the will of kellen knightmage and the ways of the wild magic that should shut him up kellen thought impressed unfortunately there was very little that could truly silence an elf i see you kellen knightmage the sentry said bowing a great deal less impressed than kellen was i see you ysterialpoerins guardian kellen said bowing in return damn it all this was no time for elven formality but it appeared that the sentry was bound and determined to hold to convention kellen felt like a wild thing lunging against a tether he desperately wanted to get back to the camp and bring these strange new shadowed elf weapons with them but despite his feeling of urgency he knew that offending the elves of ysterialpoerin would only make trouble for him later he had to hold on to their respect he took a deep breath and restrained his impatience perhaps you will allow me to carry your word to kindolhinadetil said the sentry that he may know what aid and honor will best sustain you in the completion of your task now what was he to say once more isinwen saved him compared to kindolhinadetils burdens ysterialpoerins guardian our own are light indeed and we would be greatly honored not to add to them by more than the word of what has transpired here this night and we are but come upon the wing our duty to redhelwar armys general calls to us like hind to hart in spring and our hearts leap to obey let it be so then the sentry bowed again deeply and seemed to vanish without moving but by now kellen was practically used to that we need to take the strange weapons kellen said handle the jugs carefully they cant be allowed to spill leave everything else ill tell adaerion what happened here and let someone else worry about it for a change before they left however the elves arranged the shadowed elf dead neatly in the snow it was not only a mark of respect but would make handling the bodies easier later since theyd certainly freeze solid in the night kellen took the opportunity to look around for other traps but saw none and sensed no further danger to the city at least not tonight he walked back and collected his bow from where hed thrown it slinging it over his shoulder and as he did he saw the faint trail of blood in the snow from mindaerels wounds if hed known mindaerel had been hit would he have stopped tried to heal her could he have saved her life if he had even as he asked himself the questions kellen knew the answer was no no he wouldnt have stopped couldnt have stopped not until the shadowed elves were all dead and by then it would have been too late it would honor me did you choose to ride with me isinwen said trotting up beside kellen on cheska thanks kellen said he took isinwens hand and pulled himself into the saddle behind him they rode back toward the campmore slowly now following their own hoofprints in the snow the horses were tired and kellen sensed no need for haste the fight back at the camp was certainly over by now and if theyd stayed to fight it ysterialpoerin would already be burning he didnt want to be alone with his thoughts just now they kept returning to mindaerel he knew that a good general had to use the people and materials available to him to winuse them up as often as not he wondered if redhelwar regretted every death of those under his command suddenly kellen found himself hoping sofiercely so far hed been lucky his people had been wounded some gravely but no one had died but when they attacked this new set of caverns some surely would die he would not only send them to death he would lead them to it just as he had led mindaerel and afterward he would mourn them just as he mourned her now but he would knowhe knew nowthat it was something he did openeyed and would do again the next time there was need what was he becoming a leader a commander someone who can face shadow mountainstand against the demonsand not flinch nobody said it was going to be fun he wondered if this was how a sword felt while it was being forged but right now he needed something to take him outside his thoughts if only for a little while youre good at that kellen said to isinwen as they rode talking to the sentry theyre very formal here yes i was born here isinwen said blandly kellen stiffened in surprise if it had been jermayan kellen would be sure he was being set up for one of the elaborate and obscure elven jokes but he didnt know isinwen well enough to be sure isinwen chuckled one does not forget the ways of ysterialpoerin easily kellen was only glad he was riding behind isinwen so the elf could not see his expression but apparently it wasnt hard for isinwen to guess by the way kellen twitched he hoped desperately that he hadnt offended isinwen though he was pretty sure by now that isinwen was amusedby something at any rate i did leave the elf added perhaps it was supposed to mean something to kellen but he wasnt sure what to say after a moment isinwen spoke again one hears that the human city is punctilious in its ways and everything must be done just so isinwen said in his most neutral discussing the weather tones and some cannot bear it and leave perhaps then you would understand that when i went to the house of sword and shield to train as a knight i knew i could never bear to return to ysterialpoerin in sentarshadeen in ondoladeshiron in the eastern cities life is different different that was something that stretched kellens imagination hed gotten used to thinking of all of the elves as being as alike as they looked so the elves had the equivalent of armethalieh and this was it that was something hed never thought of except that their armethalieh didnt have high mages of courseand they could leave any time they wanted to and go somewhere they liked better or go to ysterialpoerin if that was what they wanted it occurred to him that for every elf like isinwen who couldnt stand the place there probably was one who found that it was their hearts desire so everybody who was in ysterialpoerin wanted to be there what if armethalieh could be like that what if people could not only choose but actually know what they were choosing you give me much to consider kellen said a proper elven answer isinwen said yet brief as they are on the borders and consider me as grateful as whatever you like that you were there to speak for me kellen said since i dont think it would serve redhelwars purposes if i insulted everyone in the city with what was taken for unpardonable rudeness and if its anything like armethaliehhe hesitated not wanting to insult anyone even in absentiait would suit some very well and perhaps not others we will not be here long by the grace of leaf and star isinwen said nor should you have need to go among the folk of ysterialpoerin called the great city of the forests heart as they would say again yet should there be need i will teach you some simple forms that should serve you i memorized them all in the days of my youth for i am no poet and that kellen is among the greatest of the reasons why i left by now they approached the camp and as they passed the sentries they met groups of elves bringing bodies into the forest in wagons in the distance kellen could see the lights of the camp rulorwen was with the groups carrying off the dead and kellen hailed him i see you rulorwen it would please me to know what you may tell kellen said automatically the awkward circumlocution seemed almost secondnature by now even if it was brief as they are on the borders i see you kellen it is good to know that you live rulorwen answered with the same intonation as if they had met in a garden the day was ours by the grace of leaf and star vestakia and idalia wildmage are well i have seen them adaerion lives and will wish to know that you live also that was the equivalent of being told report at once i go in haste kellen said take cheska isinwen said swinging down from the saddle theres work here kellen slid forward and gathered up the reins while isinwen had a quiet word with his mount he looked over his shoulder sihemand rhuifai come with me the rest of you look to rulorwen he rode down into the camp sihemand and rhuifaiwho were carrying the jugs of metalfire and the shadowed elf weaponsfollowed the camp was still disorderly in the aftermath of the battle but there were no bodies to be seen the fires had been put out though the smell of burning and the rank stench of poison still hung in the air making cheska shake his head and snort soon though kellen knew it would be as if the attack had never occurred kellen reached adaerions pavilion but before he could dismount kharren stepped outside he is with redhelwar she said without preamble go there kellen turned cheskas head toward the great scarlet pavilion at the center of camp when he got closer he saw that it had not escaped the nights battle unscathed the front was nearly charred away and a network of ropesobviously new and hastily addedheld the structure upright kellen dismounted motioning for the others to do so as well and stopped before the wideopen front of redhelwars tent where dionan stood guard adaerion redhelwar and several others were inside bring the jars and the weapons then go find ciltesse and tell him what has happened take his orders if you cannot find himif he is deadreturn to isinwen sihemand and rhuifai bowed a brief acknowledgment be welcome dionan said gravely kellen and the two elves entered his men set down the heavy stone jugs the bows and the quivers of iron arrows just inside where the doorway would have been bowed again and departed they mounted their horses and led cheska away with them kellen waited and as he did so the last of his energy seemed to drain away redhelwar was behind the others speaking with someone he couldnt see at last the general finished and came over to kellen kellen bowed very low since he knew in his bones that this was the only thing in the way of proper elven formality that hed be able to manage tonight reaction was setting in only the knowledge that they had saved ysterialpoerin from burning was keeping him going now i see you redhelwar armys general he said wearily i see you kellen alakomentai knightmage one observes that you do not ride mindaerel this night redhelwar said shes dead kellen said he took a deep breath and held back another sudden burst of sorrow the shadowed elves killed her may her spirit run free in the fields of vardirvoshan redhelwar said sympathetically i have had grave news this night and i would have your counsel with all respect i do not think what i have to say can wait and for my brevity i beg pardon kellen said the attack on the army was a feint the shadowed elves went to burn ysterialpoerin they had new weapons i think it would have worked but it did not work redhelwar said his manner suddenly intent we killed them all and brought the weapons back with us kellen said the city is unharmed yet it would be good to know how the knightmage knew to ride after these shadowed elves belepheriel said coming forward or how it is that he so often gives warningand never soon enough to prevent losses i would be interested to know what we will find in the caverns ahead if we continue to rely upon his warnings the note of contempt in belepheriels voice was impossible to mistake and kellen felt rage fill him as if he faced an enemy on a battlefield he had thought he had come to the end of his energy he had been wrong this new challenge filled him with a strength he had not known he still possessed he swung toward belepheriel the fury in his face so plain that even belepheriel stepped back redhelwar placed a hand on his shoulder but kellen stepped out from under it taking a step toward the elven commander i am a knightmage belepheriel he said very softly my magery is the art of war tonight the wild magic showed me that the attack upon the army was a cloak for an attack upon ysterialpoerin and so i stopped it would you see the heart of the forest burned to ash for your foolish pride in the ancient ways or shall i withhold the warnings i can give so that you may rejoice in a slaughter unrestrained by the wild magic you are free to ask me for that belepheriel or will you call me a liar and face me across the circle there was utter silence in the pavilion you cannot belepheriel began aghast it is unseemly we are in the field i will permit it redhelwar said this once abruptly his fury left kellen though the cold anger still burned deep belepheriel had been a dead weight in their councils ever since kellen had been admitted to themand undoubtedly long beforeand they could no longer afford that and now he remembered what the circle wasthough a moment before the words had come without thought when two knights could not resolve a differencegreat or smallany other way they fought within a circle the one to push the other outor kill him though that was so rare as to be the stuff of legendwas the winner and the matter was considered settled for all time duels were strictly banned for armies in the field yet the commander of all the armies was suspending that ban he knew belepheriel for the dead weight that he was and now belepheriel must know that he had been measured and found wanting i would hear your word to kellen belepheriel you waste my time redhelwar said implacably honor to the knightmage belepheriel said at last his voice utterly without color by the grace of leaf and star good fortune to him and long life and to his endeavors on behalf of the army as well which come in a good hour if there are no further matters that require my attention here i would see to my command redhelwar go the elven general said it was the most abrupt dismissal that kellen had ever heard from elven lipsand as such very nearly an insult belepheriel walked stiffly from the tent dionan bring tea redhelwar commanded kellen show me these weapons still feeling a little dazedhe thought he might have just cast a spell but this was certainly the first time hed done it without knowing about it in advance or without any of the tools of the wild magickellen walked over to the jugs knelt and lifted the lid of one of them picking up one of the arrows he explained what hed seen and done with the strange weapon as well as he could while he was talking dionan appeared at his shoulder and offered him tea not just a cup but a large wooden tankard kellen took it gratefully and drained it in a few gulps even though it was steamingly hot it was very sweet and he tasted allheal in the brew he handed it back with a nod of thanks still talking the white rings burn when they are no longer in the oil i think theyll even burn through the iron eventually nothing makes them stop burningnot water anyway and i think theyd keep burning no matter how much earth you shoveled over them i dont know what they are but theyre not magic perhaps artenel will know we shall give these to him and tell him to be careful redhelwar said dionan brought another tankard of tea kellen sipped this one more slowly getting to his feet the combination of allheal and honey was bringing him back to himself i accept that the wild magic told you of the second attack redhelwar said but it would make good hearing to know more if there were more to tell kellen frowned thinking hard redhelwar certainly had a right to know but it was hard to put into words it seemed to me he began hesitantly that there was no reason for their attack upon the camp they were giving up their only advantagetheir cavesto attack us in the open so there had to be a reason that seemed good to them it came to metheres really no other way to explain it im sorry that the attack must only be to focus our attention upon the camp and there had to be a reason why they wished us to do that the only possible reason could be that they had a second target and there is only one other target nearby worth taking ysterialpoerin said redhelwar gravely kellen nodded those that the shadowed elves serve want to break our hearts theres no better way than by destroying what were sworn to protect while its directly beneath our hand so i rode after the shadowed elves that were heading toward ysterialpoerin i didnt know what they planned and i wasnt sure it was shadowed elves i just knew thered be a strike at ysterialpoerin because because there had to be i knew it he held his hands out palm upward and shrugged the rest you know magic adaerion said a note of despairing humor in his voice we must become accustomed to it redhelwar yes redhelwar said he studied kellen for a long moment now come and give counsel in time of peril knightmage as it was in the days of my greatgrandfather redhelwar led him over to the table the others stood aside and now kellen could see there was someone sitting there he was bloody and battered though he had obviously already been in the hands of the healersone arm was lashed tightly to his body with a sling and a network of bandages and his head was bandaged as well with an effort kellen dredged his name up out of memory gairith one of the scouts theyd sent out earlier tonight the others are all dead gairith said wearily meeting kellens gaze the enemy came upon us as we rode toward the caves we were not wearing the tarnkappa then we fled hoping to give warning but they cut us down my lady emerna died may her spirit run free in the fields of vardirvoshan kellen said softly finding the proper words my own also died this night at their hands yet she saved my life in her death gairith said proudly for i lay beneath her and they did not stop to see if i lived or died i claimed the tarnkappa of the others lest they should fall into evil hands then donned my own and ran back to the camp as fast as i could yet i was too late too late to warn his head drooped with exhaustion and pain kellen glanced at redhelwar the elven general made a small gesture as if to say he left the matter in kellens hands i would question you if you can bear it kellen said gently let it be so gairith said wearily raising his head where were you when you were attacked at the stream that runs below the caverns a mile from the opening of the nearer it is the last cover of any kind before the caverns and there is not much as ancaladar has said there we would go our ways kolindearil alanoresen and morwentheas to ride north i and my comrades to leave our mounts and go ahead but we did not get the chance was it wholly dark by that time kellen asked trying to judge the timing of the attack the sun was behind the mountains and the light had left the sky but we could see well enough we saw them they saw us and then the coldwarg came at us from upwind where the horses could not smell them one last questionand i know you may not have an answer for me kellen said after a moment of thought did you see females among them or pairs of shadowed elves carrying large jugs very heavy i saw no jugs as you describe gairith said his voice a whisper of exhaustion for the rest i do not know they had bows and swords and clubs that i saw thank you kellen said you have helped me greatly i honor you dionan take gairith back to the healers redhelwar said dionan came forward lifted gairith from the chair and halfcarried him from the tent it would please me to know he will be all right kellen said when the two elves were gone he lost a brother tonightone of the other scouts as was one of belepheriels sons redhelwar said in expressionless tones kellen winced inwardly it did much to explain belepheriels behavior but it didnt excuse it they had no time for excuses he was laboring under an unpaid price of the wild magic to forgive an enemy he wondered ifjust nowhed failed to pay it and searched his heart but no belepheriel was not an enemy no matter how harshly they had treated one another he was only an obstacle kellen was truly sorry that belepheriels grief had caused him to force the issue that lay between them and not to leave it for some other time he would make amends for that if it were possible jermayan would know your counsel knightmage redhelwar said interrupting his thoughts you see what i have seen redhelwar kellen said the scouts did not see the second party the one that went to burn ysterialpoerin it may have left earlier perhaps to lie in wait until the attack on the camp began perhaps not we know they can move through the day if they must be right no matter what you always have to be right especially now the plan to destroy ysterialpoerin is good in their eyes he went on the plan to map the caverns before invading is good in ours they know were here they know what we mean to do i think he took a deep breath closing his eyes trying to call up the intuitive understanding of the enemy that he needed sit redhelwar said i ask too much of you kellen sank into the chair that gairith had so recently vacated feeling as if his bones were suddenly made of artenels most fragile glass you ask what must be asked he replied knowing if he knew nothing else that this was the right thing to say and i must give what must be given there was an answer here somewhere just beyond his reach if we cannot send scouts in to map the caverns adaerion said reluctantly into the silence we must go in with vestakia to lead us and that means we can only attack one enclave at a time and we do not know how many entrances or exits they may have ancaladar saw only two padredor said his eyes are sharp so we will guard the one so that nothing may pass it and attack the other kellen is right the enemy would love nothing better than to destroy ysterialpoerin in the face of our gathered strength so we must guard it as well we shall send a third of the army to do thatand all the unicorns for their senses may discover what ours do not a third again to the farther cavern and the mountainfolk with them as they are expert in matters of snow and ice so that no matter what seeks to escape the cavern or through the mountains nothing shalland if there are other exits elsewhere in the mountains there will be sufficient forces to dispatch against what may issue from them ancaladar will tell us what he sees for i think there is no way this time for us to gain his strength beneath the ground no kellen burst out feeling a jolt of warning course through him everyone stopped and looked at him will you speak knightmage redhelwar said courteously but this time kellen sensed impatience and reluctance as well this time redhelwar did not wish to hear him redhelwar meant to split the army into thirds and send vestakia into the nearer cavern with the attack force it wasnt the splitting of the army that disturbed kellen because they couldnt get the full force of the army into the caverns anyway having to do without jermayan and ancaladar was a blow but the dragon would be useful outside and it wasnt impossible that theyd manage to find him a back door once they were inside intuition had struck with the force of a blow it still wasnt clear to kellen what they should do but suddenly what they must not do was completely clear to him if redhelwar sent his forces down into that cavern without scouting ahead there would be a disaster redhelwar hear me you asked my counsel and now i give it wait guard the city guard the entrance to the other cavern yes but send idalia and me into the nearer cavern before you send the army in she can map it i can protect her if we can find the village at the caverns heart we wont need vestakia when we invade she can come in afterward to check that the cavern is clear and we will protect our most valuable asset what speaks to me knightmage redhelwar asked his voice cool and expressionless your head or your heart neither kellen answered honestly confused he was sure that by now hed offended everyone here and he only hoped that truth could make up for that the wild magic speaks redhelwar and only the wild magic send me alone if you wishi am not as good at maps as idalia but adaerion leaned over to speak into redhelwars ear saying something too low for kellen to hear you say this now knightmage yet you did not say it when i asked for your counsel redhelwar said his voice still neutral kellen struggled to put what was only a feeling into words knowing that he must convince redhelwar adaerioneveryone here how had the knightmage of the past ever managed it i was listening armys general he said to what comes he looked past redhelwar and his eye fell on a xaqiue board set up and ready for play ready for playbut as yet no moves had been made on the board he got to his feet and walked over to the board redhelwar he said tell me how this game will play out the elven general looked at the board no one can say kellen none of the pieces has yet been moved nor do i know who the players are yet if i were to move a piece you could begin to say kellen said yes redhelwar said and were you to be my opponent i could also say who would win at xaqiue this is indeed true kellen agreed i am a poor player but the game is a fine teacher tell me you wish to guard ysterialpoerin to seal the far cavern with troops i see no opening for their victory tell me you mean to send your troops down into unmapped unscouted caverns and the wild magic shows me an opening they can exploit but no more redhelwar said not yet kellen said wishing to shout at them but it shows me that and you have to listen but he did not dare did not dare offend them not when they had only just begun to take him seriously discussion redhelwar said to his commanders while we wait for kellen and idalia to returnor notfrom the caverns the shadowed elves could launch a second attack at ysterialpoerin the first force evaded our scouts and our sentries perhaps a second one would as well then ysterialpoerin would burn because we had not attacked the shadowed elves immediately ninolion said if the caverns can be mapped so that we can attack without risking vestakia in the forefront of an attack it is the more prudent course adaerion said but perhaps it is a feint within a feint perhaps they wish us to commit our strength to the cavern and leave vestakia at the camp then while we are engaged in the caverns they will attack the camp and take her there arambor suggested having somehow moved sufficient strength to do so out of either of the caverns directly beneath our regard adaerion noted dryly redhelwar raised a hand stopping what promised to become a long drawnout byplay whether vestakia goes or not padredor said slowly whether the shadowed elves attack us or not it would be good to know how the caverns lie before we are in them it seems to me that they worked very hard to turn us from reaching themand now that we are here it seems that they wish to distract us from entering them to discover the reason for that would be a thing worth knowing i believe around the pavilion it went with each of the commanders giving his opinionlet kellen go attack at once find another plan entirely dionan you have not shared your thoughts redhelwar said when everyone else had spoken we cannot attack the caverns tomorrow not if all the armies of great queen vielissiar farcarinon their dragons and their flying horses were here to aid us dionan said simply we must place three armies into positionone of them around ysterialpoerinand establish them against the weather which grows no more clement the day after tomorrow if leaf and star favor us is the earliest we can descend against the shadowed elves therefore my counsel is this let kellen move his piece in the game when he returns and can tell us more of the enemys mind and disposition we shall be ready as well there was a silence after everyone had spoken kellen could almost feel redhelwar weighing the possibilitiesthe opinions of his commanders the condition of his army the situation at ysterialpoerin and more sending kellen to scout the caverns would change the balance of power in the elven army kellen couldnt quite grasp itnot in a way he could put into wordsbut he could feel it the way hed learned to feel changes in the weather and redhelwar knew it and was deciding whether that was worth the risk as well as all the rest at last he spoke turning to look directly into kellens eyes i have heard the counsel of my komentaiia kellen knightmage now here is my word to you redhelwar said i will not risk your life and that of idalia wildmage for so little gain but neither will i risk vestakias when experience has shown us that our tainted cousins will attack in force the moment we advance into their lairs she will remain here safe while they expend their strength against us now go to your rest there is much to do on the morrow to prepare for our assault kellen stood for a moment stunned as redhelwars words sank in hed told redhelwar that a simple assault on the cavern without advance scouting would be a complete disaster and redhelwar hadnt listened at last he managed to bow i thank the general for his wisdom i go kellen said he made his way through the camp by instinct alone still feeling as if hed been struck redhelwar hadnt listened this was his fault when belepheriel had provoked him he should have ignored it but no his knightmage instincts told him he had been right to do what he had done to remind them all of what he was belepheriels would have been the loudest voice in favor of a direct assault he was certain of that but belepheriel hadnt been there and the plan was going forward anyway i saved ysterialpoerin for them tonight they know that and this is how they reward me kellen thought bitterly but that wasnt the right way to think either hed saved ysterialpoerin yes but not in order to be paid for it as ifas if he were a high mage of armethalieh kellen took a deep breath willing anger and hurt pride away what mattered was the problem at hand and he needed time to consider how best to deal with it there would be answers in his books of that he was certain his steps had taken him back to his home tents it was still early enough that several of his people were gathered around the communal brazier with a pang of relief he saw that ciltesse was there and isinwen had returned from the forest they got to their feet as he approached i share your sorrow at mindaerels death ciltesse said bowing many destriers in the horselines go without riders now by your leave and adaerions i shall select another to share your life that makes good hearing kellen said slowly forcing himself to concentrate on more homely and immediate problems you will know what i need better than i do myself ciltesse mindaerel i dont we will handle matters at first light alakomentai isinwen said there is a way such things are done in ysterialpoerin he smiled slightly at the small jest they both shared for a moment kellen had a wild vision of the elves hoisting mindaerel into a tree and shook his head sharply banishing the freakish fancy however they handled things in ysterialpoerin he was sure it wasnt that he nodded that makes good hearing she died a warrior and i would know now ciltesse if it pleases you to say how fare those who did not ride with me tonight blunt words and a flatout demand by elven terms but he hoped ciltesse would forgive him all live by the grace of leaf and star ciltesse said looking pleased and there were only the most minor of injuries and none from the blightcursed arrows of the shadowed elves all have been seen by the healers and are at their rest and so i will go to mine and encourage you to go to yours tomorrow redhelwar disposes the army for the attack upon the nearer cavern and there will be much to do chapter nineteen the wisdom of betrayal calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink kellen entered his tent buttoned the flap closed and called fire into the brazier and the lantern he opened the small pack he kept always with himit was the same pack hed been given in armethalieh on the day of his banishingand drew out his three books perhaps they would grant him wisdom he still wasnt quite sure why redhelwar had refused to allow the second scouting expeditionsurely he knew that kellens life wasnt at risk and he could have agreed to let kellen go without idalia if he were really worried about her safety perhaps it was because it just wasnt the way things have always been done or perhaps redhelwar saw the consequences of the cusppoint that kellen had only sensed and feared them he didnt know and it didnt matter now he ran his hands over the worn leather covers which one would serve him best tonight without hesitation he opened the book of stars at random and began to read a wildmages honor is not what honor may seem in the eyes of the world the honor of a wildmage lies in always paying the price of the wild magic no matter what that price may be and no matter what path the price may unfold the worlds honor takes many paths and many forms but to the wildmage there is only one path and one form and so it must ever be kellen closed the book of stars and stared unseeingly into the lanterns flame he couldnt remember seeing that passage there before but in a way hed suspected its existence ever since hed begun to be a knightmage he knew redhelwars plan of attack redhelwar wasnt going to change it if redhelwar followed it there would be disaster kellen knew it the wild magic had told him so do what redhelwar had ordered him to do or do what was right they wont be ready to attack for at least a day and a half dionan said so a full day at least to make ready and redhelwar will want to go at midday when he judges the shadowed elves to be weakest so he might even hold off another full day rather than attack late in the day time enough for me to reach the nearer cavern and see whats thereand get back again even if i have to go on foot the realization of what he was contemplating shook kellen he was a member of the elven army nowan alakomentai if he disobeyed ordersif he just leftit would be a serious thing he had no idea how serioushe suspected hed lose his command at the very least he would have betrayed everyone whod trusted himadaerion ciltesse isinwen he could sit here until dawn naming names and not be done with the list and everything hed done toward convincing everyone that they should listen to him as a knightmage and not just tolerate him as idalias younger brother who happened to be good with a sword would be gone it isnt worth it kellen thought wildly i cant throw all that away if he lost his position in the army if the elves went on doing things as they always hadfighting the last war and expecting their enemy to do the sametheyd lose shadow mountain would win wouldnt the greater goodthe longterm goodbe just to sit here and let redhelwar do as he pleased no matter what consequences kellen foresaw but suddenly belepheriels words came back to him yet it would be good to know how the knightmage knew to ride after these shadowed elves or how it is that he so often gives warningand never soon enough to prevent losses this time kellen had a warning that had come in plenty of time to prevent all losses how could he even think of disregarding it for whatwhen you came right down to itwould be personal gain a wildmages honor is not what honor may seem in the eyes of the world always pay the price because to refuse to pay it as hed learned when jermayan had begun to teach him about the great war would ultimately lead a wildmage into the service of the demons hed been given a gift by the wild magic a warning that would save hundredsthousandsof lives the price of that gift was personal disgrace he would pay it kellen bowed his head over the book of stars trembling as he thought of how close hed just come to doing something horrible better his friends should be alive to hate him than that they should be dead still thinking well of him he would know hed done the right thing no matter what they thought for the first time tonight he felt light and free he saw his path clearly get to the caverns see what the wild magic wanted him to see get back and tell someoneshalkan ancaladar and jermayan if no one else would listen to him then let redhelwar do with him as he chose all that remained was howa simple enough problem for a knightmage trained by master belesharon kellen packed his books away quenched his lantern and lay down feigning sleep in the darkest part of the night when the camp was as quiet as it ever got kellen slipped out of his tent within the camp itself he simply had to not be seen for it would be best for all when redhelwar asked after him if no one could say they had seen him go that was a comparatively easy matter with his battlesight to guide him but eventually he reached the point where he needed to pass the sentryring and leave the camp entirely if hed had a tarnkappa evading the mounted sentries riding post would have been as simple as covering his tracks in the snow but he hadnt dared risk lingering in camp long enough to steal one without one it took him over an hour to work his way past the rings of guards and it was the most agonizing hour of kellens life he used his battlesight to spot the sentries and their movements to mask the sounds of his own he carried a blanket with him and dragged it behind him to blur his tracks in the powdery snow it was snowing again and the wind was a constant wail through the trees and that helped to mask the sound of his movements as well the greatest danger of discovery would come when he had to strike off away from camp they might well see him then but the outer ring of sentries rode to a fixed pattern and by now kellen had timed it out exactly when they were on the opposite sides of the camp he would run when they were in a position to see him he would throw himself down in the snow and wait until theyd passed after half a league of that he should be out of sight they were in position kellen grabbed up his blanket and began to run at the end of ten minutes he flung himself facedown in the snow to wait i do hope you werent planning to go anywhere without me a familiar voice said from above his head yes gesade added where were you going kellen choked on a mouthful of snow barely managing not to yelp knightmage gifts were one thing but unicorns were sneaky he thought about ignoring them he thought about telling them to go away he might as well have wished for a tarnkappaor wings he rolled over on his back looking up at the two unicorns both of them were gazing down at him with identical expressions of polite interest their bodies white blurs against the snow im deserting kellen said after a long pause shalkan cleared his throat in the manner of a unicorn that was trying very hard not to laugh and wanted to make sure everyone knew it in that case he said mildly im going to need my armor and my saddle come and have tea gesade said you look halffrozen humans dont like snowbaths come to that elves dont like snowbaths either petariel will get shalkans things i wonder if you can strangle a unicorn make that two unicorns look kellen said gritting his teeth im telling the truth i really am deserting redhelwar told me not to leave the camp and im leaving so no one can know do you understand the snow had now had ample time to melt and hed have to wait at least another ten minutesprobably morebefore he could move again even if he could talk the unicorns into leaving his cloak felt damp and his armor well his armor felt like cold metal which it was all right gesade answered reassuringly as if to a small child we wont tell anyone come and have tea because if you dont youre going to find out how loud i can scream she added her voice taking on a warning edge oh do get up kellen shalkan said sounding bored you cant desert if youve got the coughing sickness everyone will hear you for leagues and i understand that idalias remedy for that tastes really awful one gesade said laying her ears back and switching her tail meaningfully kellen scrambled to his feet this is important kellen said to shalkan as the two of them followed gesade back to the camp of the unicorn knights its all right shalkan said rubbing his head against kellens arm for a moment kellen almost felt an urge to hit shalkan then draped an arm over the unicorns neck instead people are going to die he said and heard his voice tremble no shalkan said firmly i told you not to try to go off somewhere interesting without me didnt i you should have remembered the camp of the unicorn knights was silent and darkno need of elven sentries here with the unicorns to keep watch gesade walked into petariels pavilionopening the flap neatly with her hornand a few moments later petariel came out the captain of the unicorn knights had obviously been roused from sleep his long hair was loosely braided and he was still pulling a heavy fur cloak around him but his expression was alert as he saw kellen leaf and staryoure soaking wet gesade riasen and menerchel if you please he went to the banked brazier and began adding charcoal then went back into his pavilion coming out with another cloak here take this not your color but at least its dry kellen dropped his wet cloak to the ground and took the dry one gratefully gesade had roused menerchel and riasen now and kellen wondered with a sinking heart just how much worse things could possibly get kellens deserting gesade said brightly so we need shalkans saddle and armor tea first petariel said kellen youre as blue as ice i have to get out of here kellen said desperately you need to tell us what else you need riasen said as menerchel began to prepare tea im deserting kellen said wondering if theyd all gone deaf yes petariel said we all heard you tell us how to help kellen stared at them hed been expecting he didnt know what hed been expecting but not this for a moment he felt as if the earth had opened under himexcept that he also felt as if the moment it had hed discovered how to fly i think he should sit down shalkan said over here next to the brazier ill tell you what i know while his wits unthaw sit down kellen kellen sat if hed learned nothing else in the past several moonturns hed learned that arguing with shalkan was worse than useless quickly shalkan summarized the evenings events including most of what had gone on in redhelwars pavilion so now redhelwar has changed his battle plans and i imagine kellen hasnt been able to talk him out of them dont you huh gesade said stamping her forehoof they must be really bad plans no kellen said stung to redhelwars defense they arent not really its just he doesnt better tell shalkan said kellen sighed giving up he isnt going to risk trying to scout the caverns again without maps we cant attack them both at once and hes concerned about leaving ysterialpoerin undefended hes going to divide the army into thirds and guard ysterialpoerin and the further cavern theres nothing wrong with either of those ideas kellen said knowing it sounded bad but he was tired of mincing words but he means to send the third force into the nearer cavern using the troops to draw the shadowed elves to attack and thats bad gesade asked it must be shalkan said because kellens deserting to scout the nearer cavern before redhelwar can get the army into position i suppose all by yourself id wanted to take idalia kellen said unwarily but i cant ask her now well ask her riasen said that way the army will have decent maps at least she has a fine hand at mapmaking and youll have someone along to keep you out of trouble shalkan said with satisfaction though id hate to be the one to wake her up fortunes of war riasen said well draw lots for it i hey wait kellen said desperately how had things gotten so completely out of his control tea menerchel said passing kellen a cup kellen took it you cant do this he said trying to make them understand its one thing for me to disobey orders ill be in troublei dont know how much but probably a lotbut if you help me youll all be in trouble too i cant let you kellen shalkan said interrupting him tell them what will happen if redhelwar proceeds as he plans and no one scouts the nearer cavern before he sends the army in kellen focused on what hed felt in redhelwars tent trying to bring it into words there was nothing but dreada terrible sense of death and loss i he began no riasen interrupted somberly your face tells us too much once i said you might call upon the unicorn knights at need now the day has come he glanced at the others petariel and menerchel both nodded drink your tea before it cools kellen drank the tea this was mutiny a whole troop of the elven armythe unicorn knights the elite scoutswere disobeying redhelwars orders to follow his or at least to help him because try as he might he didnt seem to be able to order them not to help him i give up he muttered good shalkan said nuzzling his ear id almost thought you were going to be as stubborn as an elf on the other side of the brazier the three elves were playing an elaborate and quickguessing game wind water tree kellen had never been able to master itthe elves learned it as children and played it all their lives and though kellen had mastered the simple gestures easily enough hed never understood it well enough to play petariel lost the round and shook his head with a sigh i will go to waken idalia and tell her what she must know but you menerchel will bring shalkans armor here menerchel bowed elaborately a courtly reverence filled with mockery he straightened fading into the darkness beyond the edge of the lantern light there will be time for a meal before you go if we are quick riasen said he went into his tent i dont understand elves kellen said to shalkan the beginning of wisdom shalkan said kellen opened the jar of honeydisks and fed several to shalkan wont they get into trouble someones sure to look for me in the morning and displease us shalkan asked haughtily switching his tail but youre asking the wrong question the question is will they say theyve helped you and will redhelwar ask them kellen thought about that for a few moments as he finished his tea i really dont understand elves he finally said riasen came out of the tent with a large bundle of cloth and a flask he spread out the bundle near the brazier it held half a chicken a meatpie and some tarts the cordial will be warm but the rest must be cold riasen said its the best we can do you honor me kellen said pulling off his gauntlets and reaching for the chicken by the time hed finished eating menerchel was back with shalkans armor and the cordial was warmed like most of the decoctions of elven brewing it contained very little alcohol this one tasted strongly of sweet cherries and banished the last of kellens chill when hed drunk it he got to his feet and began armoring and saddling shalkan first rubbing him dry with his discarded cloak it wasnt much of a chorethe downy unicorn fur seemed to shed snow as if it were bespelled and maybe it was youd better dry that if youre going to wear it shalkan pointed out so kellen stood over the brazier holding his cloak to the heat soon petariel would returnwithout idalia he was sureand they could be on their way but not long after that petariel returnedwith idalia she was leading cella saddled and ready for a journey the palfrey even had full saddlebags and a bedroll lashed to her saddle well idalia said swinging into the saddle are you ready quite as if they were going off for a snowpicnic kellen nodded taking off petariels cloak and exchanging it for his own nowdry one he swung into shalkans saddle dont worry about the pickets gesade said shed backed away when idalia entered the camp but her voice was quite audible well take care of them thank you kellen said meekly fare well and safe journey petariel said and return to us in a good hour ill make sure of it idalia said shalkan took off at a brisk trot and cella followed for a long time they rode in silence wary of their voices carrying back to the camp the trees were few and far apart not thick enough to blunt the force of the wind and it was so cold that the snow was more like powdered ice finally the wind shifted and then dropped altogether kellen could tell that the clouds would probably start to break up soon that meant it would get colder there were two kinds of weather in winter hed learnedbad and worse you didnt have to come he said now that the wind had slacked enough to make conversation easy they were riding side by sidethough far enough apart to be comfortable for shalkan youre welcome idalia said you may be deserting your command but i am a wildmage and if i want to go wandering off into the shadowed elf caverns on a whim thats my business oh well at least there was one person who wasnt risking redhelwars displeasure tonight kellen what did you see idalia asked nothing i dont know he shook his head wishing desperately that he had something more concrete to tell her i really i couldnt tell redhelwar either but wei have to go look she gave him a long look her face hidden in the shadows of her hood petariel said you told redhelwar you wanted me along youre better at maps than i am he told her honestly but he said he couldnt risk us she coughed politely thats not all that got said in redhelwars tent tonight from what i hear her voice softened im sorry about mindaerel by the way belepheriels son was one of the scouts who died out here tonight and then later in redhelwars pavilion i called him a fool kellen said half answering kellen could feel idalias gaze even though he wasnt looking at her they said he challenged you to a circle and you refused but im sure thats wrong redhelwar wouldnt permit it redhelwar would permit it kellen said wearily and i challenged him he called me well he said the warnings i gave were conveniently useless lets go back idalia said after a pause and now her voice had an edge to it that could cut the wind ill challenge him myself no kellen said feeling tired of it all its all right well it isnt ill have to make it right later but he apologized storytelling is obviously not a knightmagely gift shalkan said i heard that after he apologized to kellen and wished him all honor and long life belepheriel left redhelwars pavilion and so did not take part in further discussion of the planning and strategy did he said idalia in an odd voice what did you say to him after hed apologized kellen kellen thought back he didnt give me a chance to say anything i challenged him nobody said anything redhelwar demanded his answer he gave it and asked to be excused redhelwar said go and everybody started acting as if hed never been there elves idalia sighed well what else once more kellen summarized what hed told petariel and the others about redhelwars change of plan and its all reasonable i suppose he concluded we didnt know before tonight that theyd try something like attacking ysterialpoerin so it makes sense to defend it and blockading the farther cavern and taking the two enclaves one at a time the mountainfolk will be put to good use guarding the farther cavern but attacking the nearer cavern without scouting ahead even without vestakia there kellen shook his head a finding spell might locate the village we havent tried that yet idalia suggested lets see if we can find it on our own first i brought the tarnkappa but i have lanterns too you can decide which well use thanks he replied touched beyond words that she was delegating the decision to him knightmages privilege idalia told him and i brought food tea and a brazierall items that im sure you forgot nothing i like better than spending a night in a cozy snowdrift followed by a day sneaking around a cave filled with murderous monsters she made her voice sound light though kellen was very certain she felt nothing humorous in the situation and its actually a relief to get away from the camp for a while all those people when this is over with im going to find myself a nice high mountaintop and sit on italonefor about ten years i think you and vestakia kellen said grinning to himself idalias matteroffact confidence in his judgment and abilities lightened his spirits they could do this and they would they were over halfway to the nearer cavern now and kellen was automatically sensing rather than seeing to find his way through the dark he looked up suddenly startled as six pale ghosts rode past oh the elven scouts whod ridden this way earlier in the day kellen watched them fascinated but why was he seeing them hed read the site of a past battle before but hed done it deliberately ah but sometimes the wild magic showed him things of its own accord when there was need was this one of those times idalia he said softly im seeing our scouts she knew exactly what he meant tell me show me he kept looking and saw moving through the scattered trees the shadowed elves as they moved toward the camp and beyond them off in the distance a second smaller party ah he said there he pointed off to the right thats where the party going toward ysterialpoerin went i was right they circled wide around the army but they were on the move at the same time as the party the scouts ran into i think they might have come from the upper cavern no wonder the scouts didnt see them thats another reason you wanted me to come along isnt it idalia said quietly in case there were still more of them if there was a third force in hiding waiting to attack the army just when things started to quiet down someone would have to ride back and warn them kellen agreed and that would have been you but i dont see one and vestakia and ancaladar can warn them of most things now as well as i can no matter how untrue it was belepheriels accusation still rankled couldnt belepheriel see that kellen wanted desperately to be able to give better warning than he didthat every time someone died because of something he didnt see he felt as if it were his fault i somehow think the elven army in full array with a dragon an elven mage and a woman who can sense demontaint to help them can muddle along without us for a few hours idalia said plusoh yesa full score of high reaches wildmages to lend their poor powers to the fight no shalkan drawled kellens right they absolutely cant get along without him wed better turn back now thanks a lot both of you kellen grumbled without rancor he took a deep breath feeling more of the tension ease they were both right he couldnt do everything himself and trying to was a sort of trap no one was indispensable even if they lost vestakia theyd find another waysomehowto discover which of the caverns held shadowed elves even if he died in the caverns somewhere there was another knightmage he was sure of it and now the wildmages knew to look for the signs of knightmagery in those called to the wild magic they would find himor her kellen realized with a pang of realizationand send them to master belesharon for training and the fight would go on the wild magic itself would see to it that he was replaced just as the wild magic had seen to it that he had come into his power theyd nearly reached the stream but he didnt want to spend the few remaining hours of the night among the elven dead and he doubted idalia did either lets he began wed better check for survivors idalia interrupted gairith said they were all dead i know and he stopped to take their tarnkappabut he was wounded himself and if they were only badly hurt he might have missed vital signs so they rode on they found the bodies of the horsessix of them kellen dismounted drawing his sword and motioning to idalia to stay in the saddle something was not right here no bodies the elves had not come to carry away their deadnot this soon and the coldwarg had not eaten them for they would not have stopped with the elven bodies and save for attackbites the horses had not been touched he paced around moving back and forth across the area he found emerna her throat and belly torn open there was still a hollow in the snow beneath her where gairith had lain he scratched at the fresh snow with the tip of his sword uncovering gairiths frozen blood at last he opened himself reluctantly to see the battle he watched the shadows of the elven scouts ride silently down through the falling snow in two files saw them stop and see the shadowed elves advance he turned and watched the shadowed elves come toward them over the snow the forward ranks of the horde breaking into a run saw the elves rein in and turn to run only to be met by the fury of the waiting coldwarg three of the horses went down in that first instant and by then it was too late the shadowed elves overwhelmed the scouts leaping onto the horses backs clawing at the riders armor it was like watching something eaten alive by maggots if that were possible kellen watched as one of the shadowed elves stabbed one of the scouts to death with his own dagger slamming the narrow deadly blade home over and over again saw others their armor stripped from them bludgeoned to death with clubs it was over in a handful of minutes the shadowed elves moved on like the horde of plague rats they so much resembled a few moments passed and he saw gairith work his way painfully from beneath emernas body one arm hung useless at his side and his face was covered with blood the elven scout staggered regained his balance and after checking the others moved off into the forest following the shadowed elves kellen waited but nothing changed the bodies were still there he blinked shook his head let me see what happened to them he demanded silently he had the sense that time passedhours and then moving over the snow came a band of nowfamiliar cloaked figures shadowed elves not warriors but a hunting party one had a brace of hares hanging from his belt another carried the body of some animal kellen couldnt identify when they saw the elven dead they grew excited gesturing to one another then they quickly gathered up the bodiesand all the weapons and pieces of armorstowing them in the curious slings that lairamo had described from her captivity in their hands and they were gone kellen blinked banishing the vision he shuddered there was no doubt what the shadowed elves meant to do with the bodies theyre all dead he said and shadowed elves came and took away the bodies why idalia said dumbfounded to eat kellen said there was no doubt in his mind kellen are you sure i saw them die kellen said gently none of them were alive by the time the shadowed elves came they died very quickly good idalia said resolutely and we can tell redhelwar and the others what happened to their bodies theyll want to know now lets find a safe place to camp and wait for dawn they found shelter behind a granite outcropping a few hundred yards uphill from the stream spread a blanket on the snow and huddled in their cloaks while idalia unpacked the teathings from cellas saddlebags lit the brazier and prepared to brew tea the quiet night and the simple everyday preparations helped to still idalias mind and keep her from thinking too much about what might lie ahead of them now and then over the years since shed left armethalieh idalia had wondered about what had happened to the brother shed left behind she hadnt thought about him very often for thinking about the life shed left behind held pain and her scryingvisions had never shown him to her shed always imagined him safe and happylycaelon had wanted a son as much as hed been indifferent to a daughterprobably growing up to be the next archmage of armethalieh if lycaelon had his way and never wondering what lay beyond the walls of the city never in her wildest dreams had she ever imagined she would see him again much less that their lives would intertwine so intimately when shalkan had staggered into her clearing in the wild lands half a year ago shed realized the wild magic had possessed other plans for kellen all alongeven before shed found the three books in his pack shed been happy to be able to train himand more frustrated than shed ever let him suspect when the wild magic didnt come as easily to him as it had to her but all had been explained once jermayan discovered that kellen wasnt a wildmage but a knightmage since kellen had come into his true power hed grown up frighteningly fast she didnt think the elves could see iteverything that humans did was fast to thembut she could he was nothing like the boy whod been pitched out of the gates of the city so short a time ago that boy would have never ever have been able to face down an elven general she knew much more of the story of what had happened in redhelwars pavilion than shed let on when shed been questioning kellen shed been the healer to treat gairith after he left there and gairith had been a silent witness to the entire confrontation between belepheriel and kellen and as a scout no matter what his condition his memory was sharp and nearperfect as to details she did not doubt that the wild magic had been involved in what had happened she had told kellen many times that healing was such a simple matter for her because so often all she needed to do was step aside and let the wild magic do as it wished apparently there was something similar that operated to assist a knightmage and kellen had done itor been possessed by itwhen hed shamed belepheriel and now that they were heading for the caverns in such haste it was obvious to idalia that the wild magic wasnt done with kellen yet but it was equally true that kellen didnt understand what hed done nor did redhelwar wish him to understand it though it had not in fact come to a circle belepheriel had lost his challenge and all that was once belepheriels was now kellens by elven custom including his rank it was an ancient custom and there were many good reasons to ignore it in this instance belepheriel was one of the most senior commanders kellen was a very junior subcommander but kellen was also a knightmage honored and well liked and there had been far too many witnesses to what had happened for the truth to remain hidden for very long the elves liked ritual custom order and traditionas she knew to her cost they had long since given up their share in the greater magics but had always welcomed the wildmages among them since the wild magic was a magic of when all was said and done setting things right it worked in small quiet ways and the elves liked that and found it suitable but kellens form of wild magic didnt operate in small ways nor in quiet ways he was a knightmage as hed told belepheriel his magery was the art of war and that was hardly small and quiet at the best of times at times like these when the need was so great he was a weapon that the wild magic would use in ways that were not what the elves were used to and he wont stop pushing he cant even if it were in his naturewhich it isnti dont think the wild magic will let him not until shadow mountain is destroyed ah i think the waters boiling kellen said unless you want me to make the tea gods forbid idalia said with an absent smile ive been told your tea is poisonous so they say kellen said holding out the pot is that why redhelwar forbid him to go to the caverns because he knew kellen well enough to know hed go anyway and that would give redhelwar some sort of pretext to leave belepheriel in command all he had to do was explain it and kellen would have done whatever was needed or redhelwar could have forbidden the challenge in the first place but to dismiss a knightmages warning idalia poured the water into the pot swirling it between her hands to mix the water and the leaves she could not read redhelwars mind or know what had been in his thoughts perhaps it had truly been as simple as him not wishing to risk kellens life perhaps tomorrowif kellen had stayedhe would have been invested as a commander supplanting belepheriel perhaps redhelwar would have had second thoughts theyd never know now the wild magic wanted kellen to act and act he would and they would deal with what came of it idalia poured the tea and they drank it quickly before it cooledor froze solid dawns coming shalkan said idalia looked at the sky the clouds were starting to break up and the stars she could see were faint we might as well go kellen said rising to his feet lets wear the tarnkappa but take lanterns too either the tarnkappa will shield us or they wont and there doesnt seem to be anything out here he furrowed his brows and you know now that i think about it thats just strange they know were here but there arent even sentries at the cave entrance you can ask them about that when we see them idalia said trying to sound as if this was the sort of thing she and he did every day she replaced the teathings in cellas packs emptied the brazier into the snow cooled it and packed it as well then took out the two tarnkappa shed brought she handed one to kellen along with a piece of blue chalk we wont be able to see or hear each other while we have these on but ill be able to see the marks you make on the cave walls and follow those she said and ill leave my ownin yellowso if we get separated for some reason you can use them to find me try not to do that kellen urged i really dont want to have to try to explain how and why i lost you to jermayan come to that i dont want to have to explain the reverse idalia said well go ahead i can follow your footprints in the snow as far as the entrance enjoy yourselves shalkan said with a shake of his head well be right here kellen put on his helmet then shook out the tarnkappa and flung it around himself as soon as the hood dropped over his helm the darkness became eerily bright making sure he could reach his sword and dagger easily kellen started off the tarnkappa muted the sound his footsteps made in the snow but it could not erase his tracks he walked in a weaving pattern toward the caverns entrancea straight line would draw the eye of any watcher as there were few straight lines in nature he reached the entrance and peered inside but there was nothing to be discerned by either the tarnkappas darksight or his own knightmageenhanced senses he stepped inside chalked a small blue arrow just inside the entrance and went on moving slowly and carefully the entrance passage was low and narrowthe shadowed elves might have been able to walk upright in it but kellen found himself crouching reflexively up ahead he could see the corridor broaden he was about to quicken his pace when a thread of green fire at his feet stopped him he froze looking down a few inches above the floor stretching across the whole width of the corridor was a shining strand of greyish material it glistened to his battlesight with baleful intent he flung off his cloak and spread his arms wide feeling something bump into one of them stop he whispered hoarsely the cavern was pitchblack to his vision now all but the thread of green fire what idalia whispered after a moment having removed her own tarnkappa theres a tripwire here low to the ground do you see it there was a long pause while idalia put on her tarnkappa and then took it off again so she could talk yes i need to see what it does i hope i wont trigger it step back kellen pulled his cloak back down once more the cavern was bright he knelt down in front of the tripwire and studied it carefully willing himself to see it deeply to know it suddenly in his mind he could see the tripwire breaking and as it did the section of floor on which he and idalia were standing pivoted and fell away leaving a deep pit where the floor had been how deep he wasnt sure but the fall would kill all who were standing in this length of corridor when the wire was broken kellen got to his feet and backed away he pulled off the cloak again if wed broken that wire the floor would have fallen away and wed both have been killed he whispered into the darkness there was a moment of silence kellen if were attacked by a horde of poisonflinging shadowed elves you can protect me right idalia said a strangled note in her voice yes kellen said with certainty then lets use lanterns because i really dont want to miss you warning me about the next trap because i cant hear you and theyre easier to put out quickly than coldfire they lit their lanterns and went on stepping carefully over the tripwire after marking its position with chalkmarks on the floor to either side of it the corridor opened out into a small chamber long thin poles were stuck into the rock at intervals jutting out into the room the only way through them was a narrow corridor down the middle disturbing one of those would bring a jar of acid pouring down dont touch any of those unless you want a faceful of something bad kellen said grimly they went on each of those trapsthe pittrap and the acidtrap would have caused losses but they could have built a bridge across the pitor even jumped itand once the acid jars were empty that trap would be harmless too neither was bad enough to make the army turn back and from there on theyd be alert for more traps but if the shadowed elves were attacking at the same time they wouldnt have the chance to spot them theyd be forced into them the next trap was a patch of corridor that looked like stone to the unaided eye but when kellen threw a coin into it it sank beneath the surface instantly he chalked a mark at the near edge saw where the far side was and jumped it idalia did the same chalking a mark to indicate the far boundary it must have taken them a long time to make all of these traps idalia said consideringly looking back at the pool of artfullydisguised quicksand moonturns maybe there werent any of these in the first cavern did they build these just for us and if they did how did they know we were coming kellen wondered aloud he was glad of the breathing space the need to be constantly alertand the knowledge of the penalty if he wasntwas draining and where are they idalia asked putting into words what kellen had been wondering since theyd begun to descend into the cavern thats what id like to know kellen said grimly these trapsbad as they arearent enough to stop the armyonly to make it pay dearly for every foot of tunnel it takes lets keep going we need to find the village it seemed they could not go more than a few steps without encountering another trap some were as simple as poisoned spikes jutting out of the walls or a rain of stones set to fall from the ceiling when a tripwire was broken some were as complicated as the jet of air rushing between two low holes in the wallsthey crawled beneath that one and didnt stop to find out what would have happened if theyd interrupted the flow of air some tripwires seemed to have no purpose at all that kellen could seethat probably meant they triggered more distant traps perhaps to seal the whole army into the cave system so it could be dealt with at leisure and no matter how far they went they saw no sign of the caverns inhabitants several side caverns had been hastily filledin with rubble as if the shadowed elves did not wish the invaders to get lostor to find shelter theyre leading us right to them idalia said or to the village at least kellen had no doubt of that and the army having gotten this far having sustained horrific losses would be thinking of nothing but closing with its enemy the corridor they were following made a sharp left turn and suddenly they were there the last village had been at the bottom of an enormous cavern this time the corridor opened directly onto the village floor though their lanterns cast very little light kellen had a sense of vast open space stretching off in all directionsall directions but overhead because the ceiling was still only a few inches above his head the lanterns did give them enough light to see the same cluster of stone huts as before and in the distance the banked embers of the communal firepit glowed redly but to kellens battlesight the whole of the low ceiling glowed with the evil green of a shadowed elf trap he swallowed hard realizing what he was seeing heresomewherewas the trigger that would bring the whole ceiling down crushing everyone beneath it as a man might crush an insect between his two palms idalia he said turning and stopped idalia wasnt there oh good now we can go home was idalias first exhausted thought when they reached the edge of the shadowed elf village and she saw the cluster of stone huts following kellen into this chamber of horrors had been nervewracking at times only the thought of the lives they would save had given her the energy to push herself on she knew she hadnt seen all the traps that kellen had it had been bad enough seeing the ones hed pointed out for a while tonight shed begun to think that the time had come to pay her mageprice the one she had offered up to save sentarshadeen but dying down here would serve no greater good and she had the faint suspicionno more than thatthat when the time came to pay her price the gods would see to it that her death counted for something at least so she hoped accidentsif anything in war could be called an accidentwere still possible but when she died she hoped it would be in the light and air and not buried beneath tons of rock someone was calling her idalia heard it clearly a voice off to her right a voice that claimed every bit of her attention and made her weariness vanish as if it had never been without thought she set her lantern aside and moved toward it she didnt need light to see where she was going kellen looked down idalias lantern rested on an outcropping of rock at his shoulder idalia he shouted the echoes almost masked the scrabble of claws against stone kellen whirled back tossing the lantern he held at the first of the creatures emerging from the rock and the darkness it broke against the creatures skin engulfing it in flame he recognized them from jermayans description goblins they were less than half the size of the shadowed elves but bore a horrible resemblance to them their frogwide mouths gaped as they sprang toward kellen exposing multiple rows of glistening needlesharp teeth and their skins were bruisedark they squinted their bulging pale eyes against the light of the remaining lantern as they bounded toward him running on hands and feet both they seemed to rise up out of the stone itself as if it were like water to them and they could spit poison a unicorn could heal it but shalkan wasnt here and this was not the time to think of any of that kellen let all thoughts and questions drop from his mind slipping into battletrance now without even realizing he had done so the goblins ceased to be goblins and became targets for his sword in the back of his mind where some part of him made cold calculations and plans was the knowledge that he dared not move very far from where he stood for to enter the village might be to bring the entire roof down no matter how his attackers came at him he spun and pivoted backing and turning only in his own footstepshe knew that was safeand hacked away at the goblins for every one he killed three more took its place there seemed to be an unending supply of the creatures but for all their vaguely manlike shape they didnt seem to be even as intelligent as the coldwarg and they kept interrupting their attack to devour their own dead and fight with each other but no matter how many were diverted there were always more than enough to take their place in his brief breathing spells kellen grudged every moment he had to spend on them but he dared not leave any of them alive they were creatures of the dark and if he broke off the attack they might have been given orders to trigger the collapse of the cavern roof he dared not stand too close to the cavern walls either as far as he was able to tell in the midst of fighting them back they could move through rock hiding themselves within stone as easily as elves could hide within a forest time and again kellen felt hands reach up out of the stone on which he stood to clutch at his ankles trying to pull him down so that the goblin horde could devour him he could feel their teeth grate against his armor searching for any way through its defense even as he cut and kicked at them there were spells he could use to make the fight end sooner fire was easy to summon and hed already seen how well they burned but he didnt dare every moment of the fight a part of his mind was focused on the cavern roof so precariously balanced he did not know what would bring it downperhaps even a wildmages spellbut he knew that if it collapsed neither he nor idaliawherever she waswould survive and so he fought on grimly killing the goblins by ones and twos he had no choice and then at last he cut the last three downand no more came kellen lowered his sword the goblin bodies were already starting to dissolve and the acrid stench of their decay made kellens eyes water he stepped hastily away from them along the edge of the cavern toward cleaner air and came out of his battletrance and the first thing that leaped into his mind was idalia where was idalia suddenly he became aware of an odd desire to go deeper into the caverns he was sure hed find what kellen stopped realizing hed taken several steps into the darkness without noticing and that something deep inside him had jerked him to a halt with a thrill of alarm he probed his own feelings the way he would probe a wound the yearning sensation was still there but suddenly kellen felt no desire at all to yield to it it was like the revulsion hed experienced at the black cairn turned insideout but he had no doubt its source was just as tainted its what would lure the army deep into the caves kellen realized in horror if it worked on elvesand he had no reason to think it didntthe knights would have followed it to their doom as idalia had followed it but why wasnt he affected certainly he felt the call and could follow it but he could resist it too he remembered what jermayan had said when the elven knight had first discovered what kellen was a knightmages gifts turn inward refining himself so he cannot be turned away from his path once he has chosen it a knightmage can withstand forces that would destroy a wildmage for his power lies in endurance and the alliance of his knightly skills with his wildmagery in other words he was stubborn well everyone had always said so kellen bared his teeth wolfishly whatever was calling was going to find out it had called up more than it could handle he looked at the lantern still burning undisturbed on the outcropping of rock should he take it no idalia had gone into the dark without it and he would follow her the same way he fumbled in his belt for the tarnkappa and pulled it on at once the cavern was sharply lit he could see the vast sweep of itfar more than the lantern light had shown himan enormous area stretching at least a mile and all of it carefully arranged to collapse as soon as the proper trigger was tripped he turned in the direction of the call the way was long but her steps were made smooth idalia hurried forward impatiently anxious to reach her destination which was what she stopped frowning where was she going where was kellen and why was it so dark she fumbled at her belt for her tarnkappa but before she could complete the gesture the call reached out to her again washing over her in a warm wave her hands dropped to her sides and she continued walking though there were no traps that kellen saw past the village cavern once he reached the edge of the village there were several tunnels for a moment he wasnt sure which of them idalia had taken but then the call lured him toward the centermost one it was smooth as glass and perfectly round as if made by the passage of some rockeating worm at the far end it opened out into what kellen had come to think of as a more traditional underground cavea high vaulted cavern filled with tall spikes and pillars of rock here he could hear the breath of the mountain and realized that sound had been absent from the labyrinth of tunnels he and idalia had just passed through he had the sense that this part of the cave system was one that the shadowed elves rarely used but there was something herethese caverns were filled with life he could sense itand what he sensed was mixed some was tainted but some was not he moved forward slowly sword ready and then he saw idalia she was walking forward as easily as if she could see directly toward a monster such as kellen had never seen before it squatted on its haunches its arms clasped across its stomach crouched upon a hummock of stone its body was squat and wide and it did not seem to be very large perhaps the size of a shadowed elf but much wider its skin seemed to be a dull black it was covered not with fur or feathers or scales but with little fleshy polyps of skin that gave it a nauseatingly shaggy appearance if it had any eyes at all they were so tiny as to be lost in the nest of facial polyps and it seemed to have neither nose nor ears its mouth was slightly open forked tongue lolling over curved fangs as it radiated the call that had lured idalia to it and by the time kellen saw her she was nearly within arms reach of it fast as he was kellen couldnt reach idalia in time he drew his dagger he could put it through her leg even at this distance the wound would stop her without killing her but then he realized with a sudden feeling of horror the creature would know someone was here and it could spring up and rip her throat out before kellen could reach it he could stab the creature but he didnt know if that would kill itor what stabbing it would do to idalias mind with a strangled cry of desperation kellen began to run he had to try to reach her no matter what he had to try and oblivious to it all idalia continued to walk forward caught in a spell she could not break suddenly halfadozen furry white softlyglowing spiders dropped from above directly onto the black squatting creature it closed its mouth with a startled snap and the calling kellen had been following stopped abruptly the spiders were the size of young lambs and swarmed nimbly and quickly over the creatures body as it writhed and batted uselessly at them silently it battled the swarming arachnids frantically attempting to catch them but they flowed away over the cavern floor as quickly as theyd arrived it was no more than a momentary distraction but it gave kellen the time he needed idalia had stopped moving forward and began groping for her tarnkappa shaking her head as if shed been roused from sleep as kellen passed her he shoved her hard knocking her sprawling his mind already full of what he must do he reached the creature and struck unhesitatingly taking its head from its shoulders in one clean blow it was not like cutting into a man or a coldwargor even a goblin beneath the skin the creatures flesh seemed almost jellylike and kellens blow did not meet the resistance of bone he leaped back and just in time its flesh began to melt away as soon as its head rolled free of its body dissolving like wax plunged into a furnace filling the cavern with the sicksweet scent of decay and something worse kellen looked down at his sword wondering if it would ever be clean again and saw to his horror that the metal was black and flaking where it had entered the monsters body with a sinking feeling he set the tip of the blade against the stone floor and pressed gently the sword bent then snapped like rotting wood kellen winced not the worst thing that could happen but high on the list he wasnt helpless with only a dagger and half a sword but he wasnt happy about the situation he turned back to where hed left idalia time for them to get out of here her body was covered in spiders their bodies werent just glowing whitely now they were pulsing in pale colors green purple yellow pink and idalia wasnt moving suddenly it was darkthe blinding darkness of the cavesand idalia knew something was terribly wrong the last thing she remembered clearly was the cavern the deserted shadowed elf village and then it was almost as if shed been asleep she groped for her tarnkappa but before she could pull it free a savage blow from out of nowhere knocked her sprawling she hit the stone floor of the cave hard and in the utter silence could hear nothing but the faint sound of the caves breath and the pounding of her own heart in her ears then she felt fingers plucking at her clothes no not fingers legs do not fear us we are friends a voice spoke in her head more than a voice picturesimagesmemories she pulled off a glove and reached out hesitantly she touched stiff silky bristles good easier who are you idalia thought back she could see themand herselfa strange disjointed picture relayed by multiple eyes spiders but like no spiders ever seen in the outside world and with that picture came something she had not expected peacewarmth welcome the welcome of one ally recognizing another one creature of the light though these spiders spent their lives in the darkness of the caves acknowledging one of like spirit strange as it seemed and as repugnant as most humans found spiders to be these were friends she relaxed and opened her mind a little further we are crystal came the reply this is our home and it has been ravaged by the black minds those you call shadowed elves come and take our webs our eggs our children she felt their anger at the pillaging the shadowed elves ate the crystal spiders and used the silk from their webs and cocoons for their own purposes idalia felt a flash of alarm purely her own this time if the shadowed elves were here in the caverns and triggered any of their traps they are not here now forlongthey have made the traps and brought the others to lure you in then they left idalia a voice with an edge of panic to it idalia can you hear me kellen alarmed sounding notquitecertain the crystal spiders were a threat but ready to believe they were its all right im all right truly theres nothing to worry about theyre friends allies a people of the light theyre talking to me idalia said trying to concentrate on the spiders and kellen at the same time thats why theyre sitting on me i think its the only way they can speak to my mind she turned her thoughts back to these new allies go on tell me more none of the shadowed elves are here gone all gone to their other place it is not far we are there too and we know other black minds like the one who called you are there as well beware for the black minds do not need eyes to see that which is invisible is visible to them the crystal spider sent a blurred picture into idalias mind and she shuddered a duergar they were cousins to the icetrolls but could not bear even as much light as their cousins they lived in the deepest caves and lured prey to them with their mental powers and they were utterly blind so a tarnkappa would not conceal its wearer from them what are they saying kellen demanded still sounding unconvinced well she couldnt blame himhere she was covered in spiders after being lured down here by a duergar they live here it really is all right kellen she replied making her voice sound reassuring theyre friendly honestlydidnt you see how they distracted the duergar so it lost control of me for a moment she had seen that in their minds as well they dont like the shadowed elves and they see us as their allies they told me that the shadowed elves set up the traps in these cavesand called in some other black minds they say then left yeah kellen said with a sigh ive already met some of the other black mindsa pack of goblins but what was that thing that was after you duergar idalia said briefly they lure prey with their minds tarnkappa dont work against them because they cant see oh kellen sounded slightly chastened there was a pause we need to set off all those other traps and i think if we do this whole cave might collapse the roof of the village cavern is set to come down but i couldnt see the tripwire for it or any other way of triggering it do you understand idalia thought to the spiders i dont want any of you to be hurt but this place is too dangerous to leave as it is we understand the crystal spiders said they seemed to speak as one or perhaps all of them together made up one mind wait there was a long pause and idalia sensed that the spiders were consulting among themselves and picking through her surface thoughts trying to find a concept they would all understand wait a day before you make the caverns safe and we will not be harmed and when next you hunt the shadowed elves we will give you what help we can i promise we will wait idalia said aloud and i thank you for your help there was a wave of movement and the shining carpet of enormous spiders that had covered her scuttled away idalia sat up watching as the balls of glowing pastel light disappeared into the darkness actually seeing them for the first time whytheyre beautiful she said aloud in surprise poor thingsnever harming anything but insects suddenly finding themselves hunted by shadowed elves i guess were not the only ones the shadowed elves are hurting kellen said quietly theyre hurting everything that lives idalia said grimly thats what they were designed to do hurt things why kellen asked plaintively and suddenly he sounded very young and fragile why would they want to do that it doesnt sound like any kind of life what possible kind of existence is that for anything kellen idalia said her voice suddenly sharp with fear you said you were attacked by goblins did any of them bite you of course not kellen said indignantly but there was a dreamy undertone to his voice that idalia didnt like some of them chewed on my armor a lot though i couldnt help that no of course you couldnt come here and let me see she cupped her hands and concentrated a faint mist began to coalesce between her palms growing denser and brighter until it burned chill and blue she gestured and the ball of coldfire rose to hover above her head in its light she could see kellen standing a few feet away his tarnkappa was hanging from one hand his swordhalf his swordwas hanging from the other she got to her feet retrieving her discarded glove in the process and walked over to him she leaned over and sniffed his armor reeked of goblin venom but it seemed to be in one piece if any of them had spit in his face he wouldnt be standing here debating the nature of evil knightmage or no hed be goblin dinner but if any of it had gotten through the joins in the armor and soaked into the padding and through the padding i think i might have been poisoned after all idalia kellen said somberly and with a slight slurring in his voice i dont feelquite right i think so too idalia said but not badly youll just be a little drunk and shalkan can fix that once were out of here she hoped a unicorn could cleanse a poisoned wound but how could shalkan reach the poison that had soaked into kellens skin kellen laughed bitterly can you get out of here without me he began removing his armor without triggering any of the traps we passed on the way in can i keep from triggering them he set the last of his armor aside the damp blotches of poison were visible now on the legs and thighs of his leather underpadding kellen began to remove it as well because if not youve got to heal me now or weve got to figure out something else that will work and if we cant weve failed and the army is going to die where the goblin poison had reached his skin through the underpadding there were raised red welts kellen rubbed at them absently shivering in the cold of the cave he was wearing nothing but a hipwrap now but at least it was untouched by goblin poison he was right idalia realized she had no idea where she was in the caves now she was sure kellen could lead her back to the village cavern even in this condition but even though theyd marked them carefully on the way in idalia wasnt completely certain of her ability to navigate past all the traps on the way out without a knightmages battlesight to point them out and kellen might not be able to do it at all if the poison fogged his mind any more deeply and if she did leave him and make the try and succeeded then shed have to come back in and try to get him out later when he was in even worse shape from the slow working of the poison hed absorbedbecause shalkan couldnt get in here at all though he might possibly manage to throw off the effects of the poison by himself eventually it was a gamble she didnt want to take and they couldnt afford to wait and leaving him here alone sick without sword or armorwell she doubted shed have a brother to come back to considering what else the crystal spiders said was prowling around down here but if she did heal him there was no one here to take any of the physical price even if her mageprices seemed to have all been paid in advance the effort would leave her exhausted and navigating the labyrinth of traps took a huge amount of physical stamina she wouldnt be able to do it after doing a healing and kellen wouldnt be able to do it carrying her but there was one thing she could try idalia began to rummage through her possibles bag here are the choices as i know them she said if i leave you and go for help and to warn redhelwar i might be able to get out by myself but i dont guarantee it meanwhile you get sicker and ior someonestill have to come back in and get you out or i can heal you here after which youll probably have to carry me out and i dont think that will work either kellen laughed giddily caught himself and shook his head or you can drink this she said having found the phial shed been looking for its not a healing its not really a medicine its a cheat it convinces your body its wellfor a little whileno matter how badly youve been hurtor poisoned but when it wears off what its done to you has to be paid for with a true healing or a lot of rest or both why would you make a bad thing like that kellen asked sounding less than half his age he rubbed at his head as if it hurt dropping the tarnkappa to the cavern floor sometimes a man needs to be able to walk off a battlefield with two broken legs idalia said this will let him do it but he pays for it afterward her brother suddenly shook himself all over like a dog shaking himself dry gods of leaf and star kellen swore sounding like himself for just a moment if you told me it would kill me in a day id still take it give it to me before i get too stupid to know how to drink idalia placed the thumbsized glass phial in his hand blessing the impulse that had caused her to bring it with her when shed packed for the journey kellen broke the seal and quickly tossed it back shuddering and gagging at the taste chapter twenty the order of battle calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink why did all of idalias herbal medicines seem to be made of the bitterest herbs she could find the taste made his eyes water and his teeth ache and kellen swallowed hard resisting the impulse to retch but the disconnected floating feeling that hed been fighting off ever since hed killed the duergar was gone he was himself again he took several deep breaths i feel better he said you wont in half a day idalia warned in half a day the elven army would have been warned about this trap at the moment that was all that mattered kellen inspected the pile of discarded armor and garments the sheen of goblin poison glowed sickly green to his battlesight in far too many places he picked up his heavy fur cloak inspecting it carefullyit was cleanand put it on then looked at his armor regretfully theres no way to carry it safely and half of its covered with goblin spit ill miss it he picked up his dagger and his broken sword come on first lets do something about your feet idalia said taking out her dagger and beginning to cut her tarnkappa into strips it wont be much but its better than having you try to walk out of here barefoot the return trip seemed to go far more swiftly than the trip in idalias potion of false healing filled him with energy so that kellen had to be careful to adjust his pace to hers he felt as if he could run all the way but making their way back through the traps was still a painstaking process one that required the most exacting concentration kellen breathed a sigh of relief when he and idalia stepped over the last of the trip wires idalia hugged him tightly i never never never want to go down there again she said fervently neither do i kellen said now that it was over he could acknowledge the fearand more the disgusthed felt every moment hed been down in the shadowed elf caverns there was something horribly unclean about those traps compared to them the goblins and even the duergar had been wholesome ill cut up the blanket i left with cella to make you a pair of leggings idalia said but im afraid youre going to have a cold ride back at least it should be day when we get out kellen said i just hope it isnt snowing too hard they reached the entrance of the cave it was dusk theyd been underground a full day but sunset wasnt the only thing that greeted them spread out across the valley starting a bowshotslength from the cavern and running all the way to the stream and beyond was a third of the elven army they sat on their destriers like statues as if they had been waiting there for centuries and were prepared to wait for centuries more a light snow was falling and from the way it had collected on their cloaks and armor they had indeed been waiting here for some time the only movement was the flutter of the war banners on the wind and the occasional shake of a destriers head facing the army was shalkan standing firm right in the mouth of the cavern his horn glowed deep scarlet and every inch of fur not covered by his armor was fluffed straight out it looks like they got here early idalia said noncommittally kellen looked out over the assembled host with a sinking heart he saw not only adaerions banner but belepheriels and redhelwars as well ninolion had been wrong the general had been able to make his dispositions in less than a day or else finding kellen gone hed put everything else aside to bring a force to the nearer cavern and now shalkan was holding them off good to see you shalkan said not moving as kellen and idalia walked slowly up to stand with him i was right kellen said the whole caverns been turned into one enormous death trap you might want to let redhelwar know shalkan replied as outwardly calm as if kellen had just remarked on the depth of the snow ah here he comes now the general rode into the first rank of the assembled knights but came no closer considering the way shalkan looked he probably didnt dare youd better go out to him shalkan said i believe he was unaware until now of how protective a unicorn can be wincing inwardly at the thought kellen stepped out of the cavern mouth into the snow wrapping his cloak around him as tightly as he could the snow was kneedeep and soaked through the rags of the tarnkappa wrapped around his feet instantly as he had been taught at the house of sword and shield he shut the pain and the cold away in a small part of his mind and concentrated on the task ahead he reached redhelwars stirrup and bowed as formal a bow as he could manage under the circumstances i see you redhelwar armys general he said but redhelwar did not greet him in return instead he bent his head only enough to look stonily down at kellen through the slits in his helmet what do you have to say to me kellen knightmage kellen suspected that this was not war manners but the attitude of a commander who is about to issue a great deal more than a simple reprimand either way it did not matter he took a deep breath no matter what was done to him after this at least he would have prevented a disaster with his disobedience i say that the cavern is a death trap redhelwar there are no shadowed elves here it is filled with a series of traps cleverly concealed to destroy the army if it enters and if the army actually reached the village cavern the entire roof would collapse upon them the commanders eyes widened but kellen wasnt done yet further the shadowed elves brought allies to ensure that the army would advance into the caverns at any cost within the caverns are both goblins and duergar i have seen and slain both but more remain he closed his eyes for a moment and picked his words with the utmost precision whoever entered that cavern mouth would never come out again neither living nor dead this was not only meant as a trap it was meant to destroy onethird of our army elves were ageless and beautiful even the tales told of them in armethalieh said so and though kellen had seen that they did age the marks of age came slowly and at the end of a very long life and even in age they were still beautiful but in that moment redhelwars elven beauty drained away like water poured into droughtparched earth for a moment kellen saw the elven general not only surprised but terrified he lowered his eyes quickly not wishing to see more if i had done what i wished to do followed the plans i had made redhelwar said his voice sounded hollow as if he bore a burden of unendurable pain i would ask a boon armys general kellen said keeping his teeth from chattering with an effort the wind seemed to find every gap in his cloak and the snow burned against his skin he couldnt feel his feet at all name your boon kellen knightmage redhelwar said his voice was stronger now and kellen dared to look up again redhelwars face was still haggard but it no longer looked quite so naked we escaped the cavern alive through the help of allies the caverns are far too dangerous to leave with their traps intact but we have promised our allies time to escape before we destroy the traps they ask for a day all shall be as you wish redhelwar said hollowly he raised his hand and gestured dionan rode forward sound the retreat redhelwar said his voice steady now but without expression we return to camp dionan raised his horn to his lips and blew a complicated series of notes instantly the army was in motion its elements turning in place and beginning to move away from the cavern bring ninolion to me and fetch idalias mount my compliments to belepheriel and let him know it would please me greatly if he and his people would continue to watch over this cavern for untoward events under no circumstances are they to enter it and could someone find something for kellen to wear idalia demanded irritably forging through the snow to stand at kellens side he hasnt got a thing on under that cloak the uh goblins poisoned my armor i had to take it off kellen explained blushing furiously he thought hed actually rather freeze than have idalia explain things see to it redhelwar ordered still in that terrible flat voice dionan rode off shalkan will assist you redhelwar said to kellen go to him dionan will see what may be done and my thanks to you you have saved me from a great error kellen bowed he couldnt think of anything to say idalia grabbed him by the arm and dragged him back toward shalkan shalkans horn was back to its normal pearlywhite color now get on he said seeing kellen it took kellen several tries to mountby now he couldnt feel either his hands or his feetbut once he was on shalkans back he felt better even through the armor the unicorn was radiating heat like a furnace and soon kellens teeth stopped wanting to chatter and he stopped shivering was everything going to be all right now or as all right as things got these days at least redhelwar had believed him it hadnt occurred to him until just now that the elven general might not have what could he possibly have done then where am i going to get another set of armor he said aloud turning his mind with relief to things that didnt matter quite so much and another sword he was beginning to feel a bit of that muzziness return he wasnt quite sure where the broken one had gotten toor his dagger he thought hed left them both back inside the cavern just after the last tripwire the majority of the elven army had withdrawn to beyond the river now only redhelwar and his adjutants remained and belepheriel and his command both of those things are artenels problem and im sure hell rise to the challenge idalia said how are you planning to trigger the traps in the cave thats jermayans problem kellen said with a certain amount of relief im sure he and ancaladar will rise to the challenge tomorrow i take it redhelwar didnt have a problem with that idalia said i think hed have given me the whole damned army if id asked for it just now kellen said ah idalia said theres cella ninolion had led the palfrey up to redhelwars side idalia went out to the mare and led her back to kellen and shalkan she was carrying something else in her other hand but by now it was too darkand once again snowing too hardfor kellen to see it clearly here she said put these on kellen reluctantly untucked his hands from his cloak to take what idalia was holding out to him it was a pair of the long heavy sheepskin boots that were worn over armor as a further protection against the cold they were an elven pair of course so even without armor kellen could barely cram his feet into them idalia rooted around in her packs and came up with several blocks of journeyfood she gave one to shalkan handed one to kellen and unwrapped the third for herself kellen wolfed it down as quickly as he could then wrapped himself tightly in his cloak again lets go she said mounting cella i want to get you back to camp and into the hands of the healers before you fall over you go ahead kellen said shalkan and i will follow as closely as we can i promise idalia nodded and trotted after the retreating army kellen glanced once more at redhelwar and the others without shalkan he might have been tempted to join themor at least think it was his dutybut with shalkan it was impossible shalkan made an exception for idaliaat needbut for a whole troop of elves impossible fortunately no doubt now he was beginning to feel unpleasantly drunk lets go home youll have to make your own way from here shalkan said trotting into the circle of pavilions that made up the camp of the unicorn knights id suggest stealing some clothes but nothing will fit where is everyone kellen asked looking around none of the lanterns in front of the pavilions were lit and even the communal brazier was cold and dark probably off at ysterialpoerin shalkan said where im going to get this armor off and get a good meal as well as to catch up on the gossip so dont worry about me now gostraight to the healers if you please i can smell that potion idalia gave you that and the goblin poison both you need to get them both taken care of now im going kellen said meekly hed forgotten what a long cold walk it could be from the unicorn camp back to the main campof course hed never done it wearing nothing more than a cloak and a pair of tootight boots before at least there was a string of lanterns to mark his way though the snowthe everlasting snowhad drifted so high that they seemed to rest directly on its surface and some of them had melted small craters in it so their light gleamed against walls of ice and he had the awful feeling that idalias potion was wearing off very quickly now because he didnt seem to be able to keep the cloak closed it seemed to take too much effort somehow and he had the strongest desire just to lie down right here in the snow and sleep halt and declare yourself a sentrys voice came out of the darkness stopping was the best idea kellen had heard in hours he opened his mouth to explain who he was and that was the last thing he remembered be all right now the poison is gone and ive healed him of the potions effects all he needs now is rest and food a strangers voice one that kellen didnt recognize thank you arozen ill see to it that he gets both idalia you should rest as well idalia arozen said hey kellen said weakly he pried his eyes open though that seemed to take a great effort idalia was glaring down at him as if he were a personal enemy a man stood next to her dressed in high reaches furs arozen presumably vestakia was there too and ciltesse isinwen all his command he struggled to sit up dontyoudaremove idalia said strongarming him flat with one expertlyplaced blow im not moving kellen said hastily now entirely bewildered why was idalia so angry with him it was a difficult healing arozen said explaining the potion idalia gave you is in its way a kind of poison as well and you were already poisoned and you were also paying mageprice so you were closer to death than you realized and it is cold out there in the night well im not dead now kellen said honest paying mageprice he couldnt think of any spells hed cast unless back in redhelwars pavilion what hed done to belepheriel had been a spell after all if the price had been to go off to the shadowed elf cavern in the middle of the night taking complete disgrace on himself then he guessed hed paid the price in full idaliavestakiaciltesseim fine he said tired butfine he knew arozen wouldnt have let idalia share the mageprice of his healing as tired as shed been but he suspected that the reason the others were here was because they had including vestakia that makes good hearing alakomentai ciltesse said now go and rest kellen demanded all of you please idalia if you dont think ill be smart enough on my own to stay here you can find you can find he didnt manage to finish his sentence before he was asleep hunger and the smell of food woke him daylight was shining through the walls of the healers tent and isinwen was there with a large covered tray that smelled wonderful kellen scrambled into a sitting position and reached for it isinwen set it carefully on kellens knees and removed the cover i see you isinwen kellen said tell me what i need to know of your courtesy the tray was piled high with enough food to feed three people and kellen was so ravenous he was sure he could eat all of it thinking back he wasnt sure when the last time was hed had a full meal one day two he thought it might have been the journeymeal on the march the day theyd reached ysterialpoerin but he wasnt quite sure he reached for the tall mug of tea first you have slept only through the night which should please you the farther cavern is quiet as is the nearer you will need to see artenel today for a first fitting for your new armor and to choose a new sword ciltesse has selected three destriers for you to choose from but thinks you will pick anganil there have been wagers placed of course kellen found himself grinning around a mouthful of bread and cheese hed discovered that elves would place bets on the most unlikely of things and at the most unlikely of times even in the middle of war probably in the middle of battle redhelwar wishes to see you when you are fully recovered and belepheriel begs the favor of an audience as well kellen nearly choked on a mouthful of roast chicken belepheriel wanted to see him he took a deep breath and prepared to eat crow along with his chicken isinwen i fear i have offended belepheriel greatly by my rash and illconsidered words it would please me if you who are wise in the ways of the elves can help me to understand what seems strange to me isinwen smiled your manners improve kellen the whole camp knows what happened in redhelwars pavilion that night though certainly no one would say so belepheriels words are just as i have said them to you he spoke so to ciltesse in my hearing he comes as a petitioner it is for you to say yes or no thats not a lot of help kellen muttered swallowing chicken and reaching for a meatpastry you would wish to know his reasons for asking isinwen said i do not know them i do know that he will not offer you insult should you come as a guest to his pavilion if you would seem gracious accept if you wish a distance to grow between you say nothing if you wish to truly sever all connection then refuse to see him but that course could lead to awkwardness awkwardness kellen suspected was a mild understatement of what would actually happen and whatever hisor belepheriepsfeelings the army could not afford a feud ill see him kellen said quickly i did not know that his son was one of the scouts who died i wish i had we searched for their bodies and did not find them isinwen said sadly you wont kellen said abruptly he lost all appetite he pushed the tray away the wild magic showed me their deaths they died quickly and well but thenafter gairith had left themthe shadowed elves came and took their bodies kellen hesitated for a long time it was a hunting party searching for food isinwen made a quick gesture over his heart and bowed his head for a moment tell belepheriel so it is better to know no matter how black the news i will tell him i wish it seems there are very many people i must see this day his mood of good humor was quite gone now he would have liked to enjoy it just a little longer isinwen nodded were i to have the choices set before you i would go first to belepheriel then to dionan to discover redhelwars pleasure the rest of what you must do can be set about those things and now clothing was prepared for you while you slept i have had it brought when isinwen said that clothing had been prepared he meant precisely that the garments he presented for kellens inspection were nothing kellen remembered ever seeing before though it was all in his colors the skintight pants that the elves favored had been made in his size woven of soft heavy wool with a twining pattern of leaf and vine worked into the weave thighhigh boots of smooth leather lined in sheepskin with a tapered heel so that kellen could ride in them at need were also a perfect fit a sleeveless quilted undertunic was a superior replacement for the one he had lost he wasnt sure what it was made of but its surface was as soft as down a heavy longsleeved tunicalso woolthat came nearly to his boot tops again a perfect fit better than the old one for he suspected he had been putting on some muscle in the chest a pattern matching the subtle weave in his leggings was worked into it in silver thread gauntlets of the same leather as the boots their cuffs lined with vair which would be welcome against the cold a baldric and beltbut no scabbardits entire surface stamped with a twining pattern of vines in elvensilver was again superior to what he had left behind the buckle was of green enamel and through its glassy surface kellen saw not more leaves but stars and last of all lest you freeze again your cloak isinwen said on the outside it was the thickest softest green velvet kellen had ever seen the lining was white fur faintly dappled the fur looked oddly familiar coldwarg fur isinwen said proudly it will not freeze no matter the temperature even if it gets wet petariel said that if anyone deserved a cloak made from those wretched hellbeasts you did kellen took the cloak and swirled it around his shoulders it felt oddly heavy in his hands but once he had it onlike his armorhe didnt notice the weight where had all this stuff come from he didnt think even tengitir could have produced this quantity of clothing overnight and then there were the boots boots took time to make he wasnt going to ask he thought all things considered he was probably better off not knowing at least he wouldnt have to face belepheriel looking like a street urchin assuming the elves who valued children beyond all treasure had any such thing youll have to show me where belepheriels pavilion is kellen said to isinwen he didnt feel at all ready but then he doubted that he ever would belepheriels knightly color was a pale blueviolet and so was the pavilion that isinwen conducted him to before bowing and leaving kellen to face the unknown alone i dont want to do this for all of isinwens assurance that belepheriel had petitioned to see him and would not insult kellen while he was belepheriels guest kellen was doubtful about what was to come and his ability to deal with it appropriately hed been right to do what hed done and once he would have thought that was all that mattered but hed grown up a lot since those days now he knew that being right wasnt enoughat least not among the elves you had to be right in the right way or so it seemed and the elves had a lot of ways of insulting people well he would just have to be man enough to take it he stepped up to the doorway took the rope of bells in his hand and shook it gently at least the first part of what he needed to do was accomplished everyone in camp had seen that he had come when belepheriel had asked enter and be welcome kellen stepped through the flap of the pavilion the pale violet light shining through the silk gave everything an unearthly pallor belepheriel stood to face him the elven commander was alone i see you kellen knightmage i see you belepheriel komentai the elven commanders tent was similar to adaerions and dionans containing several tables chairs a brazier lanterns and a number of large chests all the furniture could be folded away for night but belepheriels pavilion was large enough that this wasnt really necessary though kellen saw no sign of a bed it would please me greatly if you would take tea with me belepheriel said i would be honored kellen replied instantly well at least he wasnt going to be slapped across the face with a gauntlet at belepheriels gesture kellen seated himself at the table hed never wished so hard in his life that hed managed to get all the way through master belesharons training before all this happened he was sure this exact situation would have been covered somewhere the only thing he did know was that he mustnt rush matters there was certain to be a good half hour of talk about the tea and the weather before they even began to discuss whatever belepheriel wanted to discuss belepheriel did not disappoint him they began with the weatherthe winter was far more severe this year than in previous years ancaladar promised them a break in the weather but not for at least a sennight a winter this severe ensured a wet spring which would certainly mean deep mud and hard travel the rice crops would undoubtedly flourish though the wheat would probably not do as well as in previous years and it might well be a waste of time to plant rye at all by then the tea was ready kellen sipped it cautiously and looked at belepheriel in surprise it was armethaliehan blackhis own favorite you do me great honor belepheriel he said setting down his cup one should not stop learning belepheriel said my master and yours said that in the house of sword and shield i fear i set aside that lesson we are all finding out things we did not wish to know kellen replied slowly and only after a moment of thought yet we must learn them belepheriel responded with emphasis as if it were he who must convince kellen of this if i had not set my face against the wild magic all would have gone just as it did kellen said quickly your voice was not the only voice in redhelwars tent his was the decision for he is the leader of us all there was silence for a while i do not know how to say this kellen began hesitantly you know i am uncivilized before hed come to live among the elves hed certainly never thought of himself that way and he still didntnot really but considering the news hed come to bring he thought it best to give belepheriel all the warning he could you are not elven nor can you ever be belepheriel said simply you do as much as a young human may to honor our ways and you are more than that you are a knightmage sent to us by leaf and star speak if you would there is something i would tell you it is a thing of ill hearing and it will bring you grief kellen sighed heavily there is no good no civilized way to impart it i am warned belepheriel said wait he refilled both their cups i did not know that night in redhelwars tent that imerteniel was one of the scouts first i am sorry for your loss but there is more of this matter that i must speak on after i had left the camp when i rode out over the battlefield i saw the bodies of the horses but the bodies of the scouts were gone he licked lips gone dry and clutched his cup so that his hands ached the wild magic lets me see how a battle has happened and so i saw what had taken place imerteniel and the others died very quickly fighting to the last afterwardkellen took a deep breath told his muscles to relax and went ona shadowed elf hunting party came to the spot where the bodies lay and took them away they were looking forfood belepheriel got to his feet and turned away i thank you for bringing this news to me he said quietly kellen sat silently he didnt think even master belesharon could have told him the proper thing to say to someone when youd just told them their sons body had been eaten by shadowed elves belepheriel spoke without turning once i mocked the warnings you brought to us i wish you to understand our land has been at peace since the city in which you were born was no more than grass and sand my grandfather would go to the place where it now stands to swim and fish the seafolk found those waters a pleasant place as well in those days my family had a summerseason home on one of what you now call the out isles the flowers there were very beautiful and in the orchards there grew a kind of saltplum that i do not think grows anywhere now since the great storms that came to scour the coast the seafolk prize fruit and flowers greatly they would come to the shore and trade shells and pearls for fruit and flowers we always traded fairly with them there was a sad smile on his lips that did not reach his eyes now that house is gone my father and my grandfather are gone my sons imerteniel was the last i have no wife and no daughters i shall have no more children the ghost of a smile was gone there is no one left to carry on my line no one left who will remember that pleasant summer home or the scent of the wind in the seagrass or how the stormlight fell upon the sands kellen looked up at him mutely unable to think of any way to respond i thought the threat that we faced to be a small and simple thing easily dealt with belepheriel shook his head slowly even when i saw proof that it was not i refused to see i wished things to be as they had always been but the world does not go according to our desire but after the patterning of leaf and star and it is the wildmages who help it to do so kellen was far out of his depth and he knew it it is not the wildmages belepheriel he said but the wild magic that works through us we are nothing but the hands or the sword that those hands wield i pay my mageprices i try to do what it asks of me thats all sometimes it moves through me in ways i do not understand having me do things i do not yet know the meaning of that nightin redhelwars pavilion belepheriel turned and looked at him studying kellens face intently the wild magic spoke through you i see and you do not fully understand what you did i insulted you kellen said i know that now though i did not then i challenged you to a circle i understand what a circle is now as well then you also understand that you won belepheriel said no but belepheriel seemed to think he had what if he had frantically kellen cast his mind back over everything hed learned about the challenge circle at the house of sword and shield but all that he could remember was that it settled all arguments he shook his head i do not understand what winning means he said carefully but it would please me greatly if the whole matter could be forgotten as if it had never been we have an enemy that will take all our strength to defeat we do not have to make enemies of one another nor weaken ourselves by misunderstandings hed seen enough of the squabbles between mageborn families back in armethalieh the last thing he wanted was to start something similar here belepheriel continued to study him kellen kept his face still but he knew that the elven commander could read it as easily as kellen could read a book of wondertales he only hoped he wasnt making matters worse but he couldnt think of anything else to do redhelwar needed all his commanders able and ready to fight your words go against all custom yet we must all learn new things if we are to survive in these dark times belepheriel said let it be so then i would give you a gift if you would accept it and let it be known if any should wonder that the gift would have been given no matter what words you said here to me today i will remember kellen said and i will let it be known i am honored to receive a gift from your hands he really had to find jermayan and find out what hed just done but whatever it was it seemed to have smoothed things over with belepheriel and that was all that mattered right now belepheriel went over to one of the chests and drew forth two silkwrapped bundles one small one very long he placed them upon the table you have earned these he said opening the smaller bundle and i have the right to give them spurs there were three degrees of elven knighthood the first was the sword kellen had gotten that by default since hed taken a sword with him on the quest for the black cairn before anyone had realized he was a knightmage the second was the shield jermayan had given him thata shield looted from the body of one of the bandits he and kellen had slain along the way but it had still counted as a formal shield of knighthood the third was the spurs kellen had spurs of coursethey were necessary to give commands to an elven destrier but they werent the formal ritual badge of completed knighthood these were they were made of elvensilver the instepplate covered with a mosaic of tiny gems in a dozen colors they glittered as brightly as sunlight on ice but kellen could not make out the pattern if there was one maybe human eyes couldnt i have not completed my training in the house of sword and shield kellen said quietly only leaf and star may say whether any of us will see its walls again belepheriel said and i say that whatever graces master belesharon has yet to teach you you are now a knight in all the fullness of the rank and so you shall be honored stand he took the spurs in his hands kellen got to his feet belepheriel knelt before him and buckled the spurs into place over kellens boots when he had finished he rose to his feet and now the other he went to the table and laid back the wrappings it was a sword kellen had already guessed that from the shape the scabbard was black smooth and utterly plain some sort of leather but looking closer kellen could see that it seemed to shimmer casting back not only the color of the pavilions silk but shimmering with other colors as well like like ancaladars scales the sword itself was as ornate as the scabbard was plain the quillons were designed to resemble rolling waves the metal looked blue but it was difficult to judge colors here in belepheriels pavilion for a moment kellen thought that the hilt was encrusted with pearls but then he realized that it was motherofpearl made to look like pearls but it was the pommelweight that drew the eye the elves rarely used faceted stones preferring the play of light and color to be found in the smooth cabochon cut but the pommelweight of this sword was a faceted transparent sphere the size of a large apricot it glittered brightly casting rainbows across the walls of the pavilion her name is the light at the heart of the mountain belepheriel said she has always been victorious it is said that she fought at velalamion but as to that no one can say in truth she is a thousandyear sword forged when we knew to craft weapons of war forged to teach the enemy the taste of defeat and dissolution kellen regarded the sword uncertainly he knew perfectly well that belepheriel was doing him an incredible honor and that many of the other elven knights had swords just as elaborate but he couldnt imagine riding into battle carrying a piece of jewelry the grip looked slippery just to begin with try her belepheriel said he had no choice kellen stepped forward and took the scabbard in his hand lifting the sword from the table he gripped the hilt it wasnt slippery at all he pulled light at the heart of the mountain slipped free of the scabbard with a hiss he felt himself automatically settle into guard position as if the sword were alive his last weapon had been a good onenothing that came from the elven forges was flawedbut this was better than that a great weapon ancient perfect she answered to him exactly as if he and she were one being he knew precisely where every atom of her was even with his eyes closed after a long moment he realized he was just staring at the play of light along the surface of the blade and reluctantly sheathed it again how can you bear to part with this he thought gently belepheriel took the scabbard from kellens hands and hooked it to his belt use her well he said and know that you will always be honored in my house and at my hearth and you in mine kellen said i uh dont actually know if i have a house or a hearth belepheriel but i shall take the desire for the deed kellen knightmage belepheriel said bowing and now i believe you will need to surprise redhelwar it didnt take long for kellen to discover what belepheriel had meant he presented himself at dionans pavilion as soon as he left belepheriel as usual redhelwars adjutant was busy even with twothirds of the army elsewhereif an elven army didnt run on paperwork then endless meetings and consultations seemed to take their place if kellen didnt receive any looks of open curiosity he was at least thoroughly inspected by everyone he passed and by everyone who found a reason to pass by dionans tent while he waited he had no doubt that the information about the spurs and the sword would be all over the camp by the time he was finished here at last he was able to enter as we await adaerion dionan said pouring tea it would please me to hear anything you wished to tell this was briskness indeed from the elves well he could certainly match it you will have seen that i bear gifts given by belepheriels hand kellen said he wished it known that the gifts would have been given no matter what i said to him today dionan looked puzzled we will drink tea he said after a long pause adaerion arrived a few moments later belepheriel has given kellen gifts dionan said without preamble as brusquely as any human he has given him the light at the heart of the mountain he has given him the spurs of knighthood leaf and star adaerion said he inspected kellen closely it would please me to hear how belepheriel fares if you would care to oblige me in the telling elves i will never understand elves kellen thought do they think ive killed him he looked well when i saw him and when i left him kellen began cautiously well if they were going to be as straightforward as any human then he would take the rare opportunity to do likewise isinwen told me when i awoke that belepheriel wished to see me i went to see him i apologized for being rude to him i told him how imerteniel had died and what happened to his body it and those of the other scouts were taken by shadowed elves about the challenge he told me i had won it i dont understand that because we didnt fight i asked him to just forget it had ever happened because we dont need to fight among ourselves he gave me the sword and the spurs and said he wished it known that he would have given them to me no matter what happened between us i apologize if my brevity offends kellen added for good measure there was a very long pause adaerion and dionan looked at each other then back at him both of the elves were watching him as if he might faint or explode or turn into a dragon right before their eyes kellen adaerion said speaking slowly and carefully do you understand that by winning the challenge you had the right to take belepheriels place in rank and that you gave it up to him by your words to him oh oh no wonder everyone had been acting so oddly and no wonder adaerion had felt it necessary to speak so bluntly now kellen knew enough by now about how elven gossip ran to know that everyone in camp must have a pretty clear idea of what had happened between him and belepheriel in redhelwars pavilion that night and it looked like running off the way he had hadnt changed his position particularlyat least it seemed his socalled rights under the challenge would still have been honored everyone must have been expecting him to take over belepheriels command the moment he was on his feet again kellen shook his head adaerion dionan you both know that i want redhelwar to listen to my counsel when i have something to say that is given to me by the wild magic to say that i dont want what belepheriel has would be a lie but i wish to earn itnot to take it away from someone else not by he was about to say playing childrens games and stopped not this way he finally said earning it would be right having it because we have lost a commander and i was needed would be right taking it would be wrong you would renounce being a commander of hundreds because it did not suit you adaerion asked no no nothing like that i renounce being a commander of hundreds because i do not yet have those skills kellen said frankly it was true he could command a smaller force in the field easily now and certainly he could advise redhelwar about what he thought the army should do but as for being able himself to think of and give the orders on such a scalethose skills he still lacked i must learn all that you and dionan and redhelwaryes and belepherielcan teach me about the use of an army and quickly he let out a breath he had been holding in without realizing it and i honor belepheriel it would be wrong for all of us for me to claim what i cannot properly govern it would be as if i had been foolish enough to claim the light at the heart of the mountain when i did not even know the use of a dagger and i have to figure out what shadow mountain is really after all of this with the shadowed elves bloody and dangerous as it is is just delaying tactics there has to be something shadow mountain wantsand doesnt have yet when it has it the real war will start and if we cant fight it properly well lose he already knew that the elves might be able to bring more fighters into the field but to do so would be to utterly strip their cities of protection shadow mountain was waiting for that he was sure the demons themselves might not be able to enter the elven lands but many of their creatures could even when the elves destroyed the last of the shadowed elves they wouldnt be safe from the other creatures of the endarkened the centaurs the mountainfolk the herdingfolk wildmages the wildlander farmersall of them would add to the armys numbers perhaps even double its size but that wasnt enough to gain them victory not without an enemy who would stand and fight and against the demons it would still be suicide then your decision is made dionan said kellen nodded he wasnt sure if hed made a terrible mistake and insulted everybody or done exactly the right thing it felt right to him that was all he knew then perhaps you will wish to see what artenel can do to replace what you have lost dionan said at the third hour past noon it would please redhelwar to drink tea and hear your thoughts on tomorrows attack upon the farther cavern yes kellen said getting to his feet of course it would please me greatly to drink tea with redhelwar he exited dionans tent with a feeling of intense relief fortunately it was nearly impossible to get lost in an elven war camp once youd learned the disposition of the tents kellen found the tents of the armorers without difficulty the first thing that caught his eye were several of the new shields racked outside the coopers tent for transport to the farther cavern he picked one up and hefted it experimentally heavy yes but not as heavy as hed expected it was half as long as he was tall and would provide good protection in the caverns leather over wax over wood just as he idalia and artenel had decided watersoaked it would be heavier but hed still be able to lift it he judged and the elves were much stronger than he was kellen this is no time for idleness we have much to do artenel said walking out of the main armorers tent and regarding him sternly meekly kellen followed the master armorer into the tent one wishes of course that you had not had the misfortune to lose every piece of your armor all at once artenel said sounding mournful but it is not without precedent and fortunately knowing that you would be difficult to fit i began my preparations sennights ago he gestured at the long table at the center of the tent and drew back a protective cloth with a flourish all the components of a full set of elven battle armor in kellens size lay there waiting the armor kellen had just lost had been covered with a subtle pattern like woodgrain the armorers said the patterns added strength to the metal and the pattern chosen to ornament the metal of the armor was apparently another matter of great importance to elves jermayans had a pattern of tiny stars over its entire surface and knowing the elves as well as he now did kellen had no doubt that it was an accurate representation of the night sky at some season master belesharon had called kellens armor plain and dull because it had been made in such haste that there had been no time to add the coat of glistening enamel that was the final touch on normal elven battle armor kellen had liked that just fine but apparently artenel had had a lot of free time to spend on making a new set of armor just on the chance that kellen might need it because the armor he unveiled for kellens inspection was as green as shalkans eyes each piece glittered like glass and instead of woodgrain the metal beneath the enamel was covered with a tiny intricate pattern of twining vines similar to the pattern worked into his clothes here and there kellen could see an occasional star glisten palely among the leaves leaves and stars leaf and star he felt a sudden cold chill who do these people think i am the elves swore by leaf and star just as the herdingfolk did by the good goddess and the centaurs by the herdsman when kellen thought about it at allwhich was rarelyhe thought they were all probably different ways of seeing the same thing he and idaliaand every other wildmagetouched when they invoked the wild magic the power that set mageprices and kept the world in balance certainly one of the first things that idalia had taught him about the wild magic was that paying whatever mageprices the wild magic set was a way of keeping the world running properly even if he didnt understand at the time how the prices he paidsome of them quite small and personalcould really help how had rescuing a servant girls kitten back in armethalieh for example helped the wider world but knowing that you were a tool of greater powers and accepting that fact kellen realized was far different than knowing that everyone else knew it too hed been able to handle the thought of being scorned outcast relieved of his command a lot better than he was handling this kellen realized because he was used to being the goat the misfit the butt of a thousand jokes hed been that all his life when hed become a knightmage well the elves were tactful and hed gone almost immediately into training in the house of sword and shield where master belesharon had treated him like the humblest apprentice so while life had been much more pleasant his status hadnt seemed appreciably different from what it had been before now things were changing and rapidly you wanted to command the elven army and you didnt think things would change along the way what would shalkan say if he knew you thought that it is very beautiful kellen said gravely i am honored it is unworthy work filled with flaws artenel said dismissively done in haste under the worst possible conditions had i dared to present such a piece to my masters as evidence of my craft i would still be feeding the forge fires in the guildhouse but it is sound and strong and will turn a blow i promise you that and in a few moonturns better will come from sentarshadeen better than this despite artenals protests kellen could see no flaw in the armorand if artenel said it would protect him he could be certain that it would but though the pieces were complete the armor was far from finished for now it had to be assembled on the body of the man for whom it had been prepared and a thousand modifications made nearly done artenel pronounced with satisfaction a few hours later though you will undoubtedly wish to make the last adjustments yourself as you say kellen said hastily scrambling from the undertunic and leggings hed worn for the armorfitting back into his clothes but at just this moment i am called elsewhere kellen ran all the way to redhelwars pavilion and suspected that he was late anyway but if that was the case the elven general gave no sign of it to his surprise redhelwar was alone kellen had somehow expected this to be a less private occasion he wondered if he was going to get the scolding he still felt he might deserveor at least that protocol ought to demand he had disobeyed ordersno matter how strong the need and no matter how right hed been to do so there was still that but as always they began with amercifully briefdiscussion of the tea and the weather soon however redhelwar changed the subject you come before me as if your spirit lies heavy kellen yet already today i have had adaerions good counsel and dionans and belepheriels as well and i have been privileged to hear all that idalia wildmage could tell me of the nearer cavern redhelwar leaned forward a little so i would know what lies unsaid between us that you look upon me as one who expects ill tidings well if that wasnt an opening to come straight out with what was bothering him he had never heard one when you made me alakomentai you gave me a place in your army kellen said thinking his words through slowly army officers follow orders you gave me an order and i didnt follow it yet you are also a knightmage a voice of the wild magic and if i would command the wild magic then perhaps i shall step outside and command the wind and the weather to answer my will as well the general said dismissively it would be as efficient a use of my time you risked both life and honor to save the army let that be an end to this matter it was an order and kellen took it as such seeing kellens assent and relief in his expression redhelwar smiled ever so faintly and turned to more practical matters the first of the centaurs will arrive at ysterialpoerin within a sennight so jermayan tells us not so many as we will see come spring but a goodly number for the seasonand the weather which remains difficult unfortunately the wildmages tell us that to bring truly calm weather here would take all their power and worsen the weather elsewhere so they do not advise it perhaps it is just as well that our battles this season take place below the earth a number of high reaches wildmages travel with the centaurs of course it will be good to add their numbers to those already with us but it still wouldnt change the weather kellen remembered that idalia had never wanted to meddle with the weather without a very good reason and right now the weather patterns were still trying to settle back to normal after the long unnatural drought that was one of the reasons this winter was as bad as it was and a good reason why it was a good idea to leave the weather strictly alone no matter how bad it got but if the shadowed elves are changing the way they attack kellen began that thought has been much in my mind redhelwar said somberly idalia has spoken to me of the traps she saw in the first cavern but says that you saw more yet from what she described such traps as were there would be the work of moon turns to create yes kellen agreed they knew we would be coming and they knew it perhapsbefore we were led to their first lair all that we do here to fight them is planned for us by others but we have no choice no redhelwar said quietly and tomorrow we discover what further entertainment they have planned for us goblins and duergar kellen said instantly the crystal spiders said there were more of them in the farther cavern and all the shadowed elves will be therethe ones from both caverns so well be facing more of them than we expected he felt a surge of gratitude to the crystal spiders odd creatures though they were if they hadnt come to idalias rescue if they hadnt made the effort of talking to her yet if we face more of our foe than we expect the reverse is also true for we have evaded their trap by the grace of leaf and star and the intercession of the wild magic the commander tapped the table with one finger betraying his own tension in a manner that elves seldom indulged in light will keep duergar at bay and we shall have that in good measurebut it will not stop one from luring prey within reach of another foe redhelwar added consideringly wildmage athan has suggested that he might work a spell of calling to cause the shadowed elves to come out to us they are easier to kill outside their caves and we would be beyond reach of their allies a good plan if it works kellen agreed idalia said that the tarnkappa dont work against duergar but they might work against goblins they move through stone though redhelwar dismissed goblins with a shrug we have hunted goblins many times in the past they are foolish and easily lured when they are hungry enough with the shadowed elves dead and unable to control them they will be simple enough to kill the duergar will present a more difficult problem only a knightmage it seems can withstand their call there might be a spell that would help ill ask jermayan and ancaladar and the crystal spiders dont like the duergar any better than we do theyll give us all the help they can he added then we are well begun by honoring our promises to them and now perhaps once you have settled a matter of no small interest to the army we shall ride out to the nearer cavern and see that promise completed redhelwar said rising to his feet kellen was never precisely certain exactly how the elven destriers were organized he did know that taking care of several thousand horseseven several thousand horses who knew their names and invariably came when calledwas a large job for someone several hundred someones probably even though the knights did much of their own horsework the animals that were going to be immediately needed waited in the horselines standing quietly in orderly ranks those that would not be needed as quickly seemed to wander at will though kellen was sure that was only an illusion he saw idalias cella and redhelwars bloodred bay waiting patiently dionans stonegrey mare and the thirty mounts of his own troop standing by as well all under saddle and ready to ride out ciltesse had been loitering nearbythere was really no other word kellen thought ruefully to describe his secondincommands behavior i see you ciltesse redhelwar said greeting him it would be pleasant to discover the nature of kellens new mount that is yet to be known ciltesse said gravely i see you kellen knightmage he said formally i see you ciltesse it would please me greatly to be presented with the fruits of your wisdom kellen said bowing ciltesse led him to the end of the line of horses three destriers without saddle or bridle stood waiting here are those which i judge could best meet your needs gathered from those which are available ciltesse said it is for you to choose of course nor will you tell me their names for the whole camp is betting on which one i will choose kellen said smiling he wondered if his choice would match ciltesses he turned and regarded the horses two were stallions one was a mare they all regarded him with wary curiosity ears flicking back and forth as he had when he had chosen deyishene he cleared his mind and regarded them through spellsight the young stallion he rejected immediately the black was a beautiful animal young and filled with fire and spirit but kellen neither needed nor wanted that much eagerness in a mount he considered the mare next and shook his head she was a dark dapple grey and had the grace and quiet spirit he wanted and needed but she had loved her rider too deeply to be quite ready for a new master yet he paused to stroke her neck gently would he have to reject them all maybe jermayan would loan him valdien for the day or he could take the marebut not as a permanent battlemount he turned his attention to the last of the three the buckskin stallion was by far the oldest of the animals ciltesse had collected and though his coat was wellkept and without flaw kellens battlesight showed him the ghosts of old wounds wellhealed to his surprise kellen could feel that he was being judged as much as he was judging he could tell that if the destrier found his rider lacking it had an arsenal of tricks that would put anything valdien had ever imagined to shame but he could also tell that the stallion was calm steady and smart it would stand unafraid in the face of a pack of coldwargif it trusted its rider to know his business now you old warrior i think might be what i need your experience just might make up for my lack of it and i hope im your match in courage shall we show them all kellen wondered looking up into the stallions eyes i wont be the best rider youve ever had but ill let you teach me everything you know animal speech was one of the gifts of the wild magic but like so many of the powers of a true wildmage it was one that kellen lacked yet the stallion seemed to understand something when kellen looked into his eyes because he lowered his head and butted kellenhardin the chest this one kellen said staggering back a step did i choose you or did you just choose me it is as i said isinwen said to ciltesse sounding smug he would choose firareth over anganil chapter twentyone blood on the moon calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink anganil kellen discovered was the name of the young stallion the mares name was grayn firareth had apparently rejected several potential riders alreadythough always with great courtesy isinwen assured kellen i thank you for bringing me to his attention kellen said he wasnt sure quite yet whether he meant it or not he offered firareth a piece of dried appleciltesse had brought themand the stallion accepted the treat with grave politeness a commander must do more than look to his mount isinwen said ciltesse was born in windalorianan among the fields of vardirvoshan where it is said one learns to ride before one learns to walk it is indeed true that anganil is the finest of the available destriers young and in his prime while in a very few years firareth will return to vardirvoshan to live out his days if leaf and star are with him but he is wise and can keep a rider safe even when such a one may be occupied by other matters and what seemed like a very few years to the elves might seem like a considerably longer time to a human kellen reflected andlistening to what isinwen did not sayhe got the impression that ciltesses opinion of kellens horsemanship might be just a bit better than kellens actual skills i am pleased with my choice leaf and star grant that my choice is pleased with me and that i can keep him alive it was a prayer that kellen seemed to be making more and more often these days he didnt think he could bear the heartbreak of losing another destrier so soon soon they were riding out toward the nearer cavern kellen took the opportunity to get to know his new mount and suspected that firareth was taking his measure as well fortunately between them deyishene and mindaerel had managed to teach him enough horsemanship for him to reassure his new mount that he did know what he was doing and after a while he felt firareth relax a bit idalia had contented herself with saying that she was glad to see he was looking so well apparently nobody was going to scold him today on the other hand he hadnt seen shalkan yet though he suspected the unicorn was following them at a comfortablefor shalkandistance when they reached the cavern jermayan and ancaladar were already waiting better go tell him what youd like idalia suggested kellen rode forward to where the enormous black dragon crouched in the snow he was pleased to see that firareth approached ancaladar calmly farneyirel would be pleased to know that firareth has found a master who will honor him as he deserves jermayan said he has waited long to return to the field i think well do well together kellen said idalia said i should instruct you on how to trigger the traps ancaladar snorted gustily firareth flicked an ear but was otherwise unimpressed say rather you should tell us what you have seen of them jermayan will do the rest the dragon said i am so instructed kellen said ironically bowing where he sat most of the ones i saw involved a tripwire i saw a lot of tripwires that didnt seem to activate any traps i could see in some places there was quicksand disguised as stonethat needed no tripwire at all in other places there were rods sticking out of the cave walls and if you brushed against them jets ofsomething would spurt out of the rock or jars of acid or poison would be broken or tilted on you in one place there was a jet of air flowing continuously across the passage i dont know what would have happened if that had been interrupted and the entire roof of the cavern village is set to collapseits a huge place i dont know how they managed it the trigger for that must be somewhere in the village i think but i didnt go into the village to look for it a prudent child ancaladar commented so jermayan let us snap the wires and smash the sticks and see what comes of that the dragon looked up studying the snowcovered slope of the mountain and i would suggest that everyone stand well back just to be safe kellen rode back to the others ancaladar suggests we move back he told them and on the whole i think we ought to be even more cautious than he suggests they retreated to the edge of the little stream by the time they turned back ancaladar had moved back as well far enough from the cavern mouth so that hed have plenty of room to launch himself into the air quickly jermayan gestured a spark of blue fire flew from his hand and vanished into the cavern mouth for a very long time nothing seemed to happen at all then the ground beneath the horses feet began to tremble and shake a long low shuddering rumble that went on and on the elven destriers shied madly backing into a streambed that suddenly held ice but no water as their riders fought to steady them kellen could see a plume ofsmokeduststeam issuing from the caverns mouth as he did his best to reassure firareth the destrier might be tranquil and mildmannered but this was something wholly unexpected but the shaking subsided fairly quickly and the animals steadied though they were still restless and unhappy the trapsthere must have been a lot more of them than i saw kellen realized and whatever spell jermayan had used it had set off every single one the cavern mouth well it wasnt there anymore the ice that had covered the rock face had fallen away in large sheets and there were deep raw cracks in the exposed granite of the cliff face as the mountain seemed to have settled i hope for their sake all the crystal spiders got out all right look ciltesse said pointing high above where the opening of the cavern had been the snow on the mountain began to shift it meant nothing to kellen who had never seen either snow or mountains before this winter but others knew better snowspill isinwen shouted ride the horses needed little encouragement to run kellen looked back and saw ancaladar bound into the air the snow was halfway down the mountain face by now spreading like a fan a large fan he could hear it now a roaring like a waterfall but faint and farofffor the moment how much snow was on that mountain was it all coming down if the entire army had not come this way the day before breaking a deep trail in the snow that even another nights snowfall had been unable to fill they would not have been able to try to outrun it but try was all they were able to do the roaring now was as loud as the fury of a battle and the wave of snow pushed wind before it kellen felt the rush of air at his back and braced himself even though he knew that it was the most futile of gestures then he felt the spell as it was being cast and saw two waves of snow as high as ancaladars shoulder pass them by on either side racing along beside them as fast as a running horse a few hundred yards further on the force of the snowspill was spent but without jermayans spell it would certainly have been enough to bury them all the troop reined inkellen had been bringing up the rearand stopped kellen looked back there was a deep sheltering v in the snow along their track beyond that and to either side the snow lay white and smoothand deep there was no sign of the cavern mouthor even of the cliff face ancaladar landed a few yards ahead the dragon kicked up a great plume of snow with his landing then settled deeply into the snow jermayan dismounted and walked through the snow to redhelwar kellen urged firareth forward jermayan bowed it seems the cave was more extensively mined than anyone properly understood redhelwar said ancaladar expected a small snowspill jermayan admitted he has seen them before when the snows have been heavy and we thoughtwhen i sent the wind to scour the cavernsthat when the roof of the village cavern collapsed there would be some disturbance but jermayan looked a bit shaken and more than a little drained kellen was reminded once again that if ancaladars storehouse of power was infinite jermayans energy was not he wondered just how much energy it had taken to turn aside that wall of snow but we are all still alive thanks to you and the caverns are gone and so are the traps which is what matters kellen said and i do not think from the way idalia is looking at us that either you or i will have to worry about tomorrows battle if you do not go and rest now so i have said ancaladar said speaking up now but i am a mere dragon so of course my bonded would not listen to me no we must land and he must assure himself twiceover that what he could see with his own eyes was indeed so and stand here in the snow when a warm fire and a hot meal is what he truly needs it was amazing really how much ancaladar could sound like shalkan when he tried though kellen had the impression ancaladar was reserving the worst of his lecture for when he and jermayan were alone then let him go to them at once redhelwar said speaking directly to ancaladar jermayan bowed once again and walked back through the snow to ancaladar men idalia said in disgust coming up beside kellen wildmages kellen corrected absently or maybe elven knights keirasti isnt any more sensible and shes a girl girlshes old enough to be your grandmother idalia said with a snort greatgrandmother probably kellen said agreeably and i suppose the healers all take care of themselves very sensibly or do they work themselves until they drop going without food and sleep when there are wounded to care for idalia laughed looking surprised youre getting far too good at arguing little brother and the worst of it is youre rightas you know perfectly well since youve worked in the healers tents they ducked their heads covering their faces as ancaladar took off raising a shower of snow when the black dragon was well airborne dionan gave the signal and they began to ride back toward the camp youre sure youre all right idalia asked fit to fight tomorrow kellen told her allowing himself just the briefest moment of preening thinking about his new glory of armor and weaponry ill be a stunning sight too you just wait and see that night kellen attended the meeting of the senior commanders to plan the placement of the troops no one had remarked about his presence at all either for or against it kellen kept his mouth shut and his ears open if he wanted to learn how to handle an armynot just set policy for it or to react to an emergency facing ithere was the place to begin kellen had expected they would attack the farther cavern sometime during the next day but athan wildmage had said that his calling spell needed to be timed to the moons appearance in the sky above the cavern mouth the shadowed elves were more likely to come out at night too and for once they wanted them to come out so the army would have one last day of grace to finish its preparations for attack one more day to rest to heal to mend armor and weapons and make new ones to plan the trouble was without knowing what exactly they were going to face it was difficult to plan redhelwars decision was to divide the army into very small very mobile sections it was more likely the shadowed elves would attack if they thought the odds looked to be in their favor the third of the army that was to have been used to attack the nearer cavern would be kept well back and hidden until the enemy was thoroughly committed and those who were already there had been ordered to spend the day appearing to scatter their forces on the pretext of building a more permanent set of camps and organizing several hunting parties their strategy was founded on the hope that the shadowed elves were just as uncoordinated and barbaric as they had been at the first cavern there was every possibility for the plan to turn to a disaster if the shadowed elves showed any organization and generalship at all and everyone gathered in redhelwars tent that night knew that every battle theyd had with the enemy thus far might be all part of one long feint the shadowed elves might not actually be the feral halfanimal rabble that they seemed if that was the case the elven losses would be heavy tomorrow but there was no way to know kellens knightmage gifts couldnt truly show the future at best they seemed to give him a wider view of the present hed seen the attack on ysterialpoerin because it was already in motion and the nearer caverns had already been mined when hed given his warning that they were too dangerous to invade and he already knew his battlesight could be blocked by demonic magic when it came to the outcome of tomorrows battle he knew as little as redhelwar did the sole advantage they had was that they had not lost a third of the army to the trapped caverns kellen only hoped the enemy did not know that but there was no way to be sure the following morning he went out to say goodbye to shalkan before taking his troop out into position the morning meal had been lavishthe cooks had truly outdone themselves since it was the last proper meal the fighters would probably see for a whole day at leastand kellen was certain he was not the only one who did his best to try not to think of it as a farewell feast when he buckled on his new armor for the first timeit had been waiting in his tent when he returned from the meeting the previous nighthe had to admit that despite his reservations about what he could not help thinking of as its gaudiness artenel had done a magnificent job as long as he didnt look at it it felt just like his old armor nearly as comfortable as an ordinary suit of clothing at that the showy armor actually made him relax a littleit was very difficult to picture himself going out in something that looked like a fancydress costume to actually fight never mind what his head knew his insides took one look and didnt believe his sword of course well hed never mistake light at the heart of the mountain for his old sword but that was not a disadvantage the sword moved like an extension of his handno his thought and if he had to kill any more duergar well hed use a spear tucking some delicacies saved from breakfast into his new surcoat he went up to the unicorn knights camp even if he didnt have much of an appetite this morning that never seemed to hinder shalkan though the unicorns were posted at ysterialpoerin now there was a great deal of traffic back and forth between the city and their camp once kellen and the others were in position redhelwar intended to move the units that had been guarding the cavern back to the main camp for a few hours as well if the shadowed elves were watching the more confusion about who was where the better i see you kellen knightmage a familiar voice greeted him from the edge of the unicorn knights encampment i see you riasen kellen said ive come looking for shalkan i ride out to the farther cavern in a few hours and i hoped to see him and i back to the city riasen shook his head ruefully i should have brought an edifying scroll or twoyou cannot imagine how very dull it is there but thats all to the good when one is hoping not to be attacked of course he glanced out toward where the unicorns were drifting toward the camp one imagines shalkan will be along in a few moments if only to admire the fact that you have something near to proper armor at last urm yes kellen replied blinking owlishly at him riasen chuckled and motioned to him to follow toward the center of the unicorn knights encampment only think what artenel could have done with enough time and the proper equipmentbut still no one will think badly of you it is wartime armor after all and you will soon have better and no one indeed could find any fault at all with your spurs and sword quite fitting since you come from the seacity he picked up a cup from a table inside the door of his own pavilion and filled it from a pot steeping on the brazier there before offering it to kellen tea i suppose it must be fitting since the one who gifted me with them is long in years and wisdom kellen said accepting the inevitable cup of tea with real gratitude hed never thought of armethalieh as a seacity before he could see the wave pattern in his swords quillons but he still couldnt make out the pattern on his spurs even in the strongest sunlight the stones glowed brilliantly and he could tell there was supposed to be a pattern but that was all and riasen perfectly casually seemed to find as much fault with his armor as artenel had utterly stunning shalkan drawled mincing into the center of the circle of pavilions he struck a pose and somehow managed to remind kellen of some of his most dandified classmates back in armethalieh the ones who spent every moment they werent studying the high magick arguing about clothes i can see i shall have to have a new saddle and armorimmediately barely worth putting on i assure you kellen said doing his best to match shalkans tone still artenel does wonders with the poor resources at his command shalkan snorted rudely as if you could tell the difference well i cant kellen admitted dropping the pose he says its sound where it counts and thats all i really care about shalkan shook himself all over in silent laughter if you did live a thousand years i still dont think they could manage to make an elf out of you probably not kellen agreed he finished his teait was cold before he was done with it but the arid winter weather left him constantly thirstybowed courteously to riasen and followed shalkan off beyond the circle of pavilions i see youve won your spursand gained a fine sword shalkan said when they were private or as private as things got in a warcamp anyway belepheriel wanted me to have them kellen told him still a bit bemused by it alland still worried that he might have done something wrong by elven standards i hope i did the right thing by accepting them if he hadnt wanted you to have them he wouldnt have given them to you shalkan said inarguably the way the elves see things you honored him by taking them and if i do say so you managed your way out of the whole mess fairly gracefully all things considered im still well no i do know how i got into that mess and i think i know why too he started to rub his eyebrow with his gauntleted hand then realized what he was doing and shrugged instead the wild magic needed to change belepheriels mind about the way he was seeing things before he made some bad decisions but it wasnt very comfortable magic often isnt shalkan said shrewdly at least today youll be dealing with simple straightforward actions with no worry about elven manners riding places and killing things that isnt exactly straightforward either kellen muttered oh the battles themselves were but they were brief compared to the time spent preparing for them and recovering from them that was filled with complications i brought you some honeycakes and i have a question honeycakes first shalkan said firmly even though the cold had made them rockhard the unicorn enjoyed them thoroughly and the question he asked when hed finished the last crumb is there supposed to be a pattern on my spurs kellen asked from the look on shalkans face this wasnt the question hed been expecting lift your foot the unicorn finally said a reasonable request both kellens boots were buried in snow up to the calves kellen lifted his foot and brushed the instepplate and rowel of the spur clear of snow shalkan inspected both closely its seashells in ocean foam he finally reported in the kindly tones of someone describing a sunset to a blind man oh kellen put his foot down again he told me his grandfather used to go to armethalieh that they had a home on one of the out islands if you can call going to armethalieh visiting a place before it exists then yes shalkan agreed blandly the elves once ruled the seas as well as the forests but that was a long time ago even as elves think of time kellen took a deep breath and regretted it immediately as the cold air seared his throat and lungs are you going to be he began shalkan interrupted him im fine i will be fine now stop worrying about me as riasen says those of us at ysterialpoerin should probably have brought xaqiue and gan to keep from getting bored youre the ones who will be facing moments of unusual interest tonight thats one way to think of it kellen said but when he had trudged back to his own pavilion again kellen somehow felt a little better though he could not have said why in fact he and his thirty spent much of the afternoon being as cold and bored as any of ysterialpoerins nearer defenders despite knowing redhelwars plan kellen felt very much like a xaqiue piece himselfover and over it seemed theyd no more than settle into one position than the order would come to shift to another at least the constant shifts in position kept the horses from freezing solidif the shadowed elves did come out as athan hoped thered be a good deal of mounted combat tonight and none of them could afford to be stiff the farther cavern was in a more elevated area than the nearer one the only entrance the scouting parties had been able to locate was at the end of a twisting path halfway up the mountainside kellen knew that there were troops actually on the mountainthe men of the high reaches and most of the knights of ysterialpoerin who were most familiar with the local terrain kellen certainly didnt envy them their posts if it was cold down hereand it washe could only imagine how much colder it must be farther up the mountain one thing a day spent emulating a xaqiuepiece did was give everyone a good idea of the ground theyd be fighting over later jermayan had set coldfire spells over all of them that would trigger with a single word of command but until that moment redhelwar had given orders that there was to be no light at all they moved through the dark to their final position it was almost half a league away from the mouth of the cavern but kellen knew why his command was here and not in the front lines redhelwar was taking every possible precaution against a repeat of the feint against the camp and the attack upon ysterialpoerin he could feel the army around him waiting above the clouds jermayan and ancaladar circled a light snow was falling the wildmages had been willing at dire need to shift the heaviest of the weather a league or so westward but warned that the lull would only be a day at most followed by a brutal storm kellen knew without actually seeing it the moment that the moon rose above the mountain and athan began his spell imagination and spellsight showed him what his own eyes could not athan kneeling at his small brazier his great grey owl perched upon his shoulder athan casting the dried herbs upon the coals and calling upon the wild magic kellen knew from what idalia had told him beforehand that athan had asked for no aid to his spell whatever price the gods of the wild magic asked athan would bear the whole cost of the spell and the casting alone now the price had been asked and agreed to and athans calling began though only the wildmages gathered here could sense it still there was nothing but silence and darkness and the faint moaning of the wind kellen felt rather than heard a flicker of movement and looked up athans owl glided by in utter silence overhead a keystone clutched in its talons the keystone was brilliant with power to kellens spellsight it must be the focus of the calling spell wherever it is thats where the shadowed elves will try to get to athan still had not moved the wildmage stood alone armored and ready just below where the path leading up to the cavern opening began with a sinking sense of dread kellen suspected he knew what the price of athans spell had been not suicidefor the gods of the wild magic did not ask for things like thatbut to offer his life by being the first to meet the shadowed elves attack he was a wildmage and standing in the open he would be an irresistible target for any tainted creature for those who fought the calling spell his mere presence could serve to draw them out he might well survive there was a chance and there was no rule that said athan could not defend himself but the mageprice athan had accepted had probably accepted kellen reminded himself for he did not know for sure carried with it a terrible peril still there was silence and an eerie tranquility despite the fact that twothirds of the elven army shared these woods with him kellen could hear nothing nor did he see anything beyond the men and mounts of his own troop the moon was the faintest shine in the clouds overhead casting no light on the snow below he felt his stomach knotting again and his hands were clenched inside his gauntlets let athans spell have worked let it have worked if it hasnt well have to go in and if we fight on their ground theyll have all the advantages suddenly the false peace of the night shattered he heard distant shouts the ring of steel on steeland a moment later the entire forest was fullmoon bright as balls of coldfire appeared over the heads of every elven knight but he felt athan die in that same moment a shining beacon that existed only in his mind extinguished between one breath and the next theres more than one exit from the cavern be ready jermayans voice spoke as if in his ear theyre out kellen said to his troop grimly there are multiple exits from the cavern lets go he could see the battlefield nearly as well as jermayan and ancaladar could as redhelwar had hoped the sight of their elven enemy drove the shadowed elves to attack recklessly they swarmed from their cavern like hornets from a nestand not just from the exit the elves and vestakia had first identified they were burrowing up out of holes concealed by ice high on the mountain as well attacking the defenders there but redhelwar did not want to contain them or push them back he wanted as many of them to come out as would come so the elves offered little resistance to the attack of their foes falling back before them in redhelwars tent it had seemed a simple plan with little that could complicate it kellens first hint that things were about to go badly was the arrival of the deathwings theyd never flown at night before but suddenly an enormous flock of them appeared half of them went after ancaladar the other half swept in low over the army through the areas of heaviest fighting but in a few moments it became clear that to attack the elves was not their purpose again and again they swooped down snatching up the shadowed elves by ones and twos and bearing them over the elven lines and away ancaladar could do nothing to stop them he and jermayan had their own battle to fight any archer not actively engaged in combat shot at the ghostly targetsaiming for the shadowed elves rather than the deathwings as the shadowed elves were easier to killbut it didnt seem to help if they managed to kill or wound one of the shadowed elves the deathwing simply dropped its burden and went back for another and the deathwings themselves were nearly impossible to kill with simple arrows they have a cache of armor and weapons hidden somewhere else for just this emergency kellen knew that with a sudden sinking feeling without knowing either how he knew it orworseknowing how to find it he only hoped that whatever else the cache contained it did not contain any of the white rings of metalfire follow them no it was tempting but if he pulled his unit out of the outer ring to follow them he would break the wall of redhelwars defense and hed received no clear warning from the wild magic that there was a crucial need it would be the height of folly to go charging off without a directionleaving a hole in the lines that the others were counting on to be filled and without jermayan in the sky to tell redhelwar how the battle was progressing on the ground kellen was needed here more than ever he felt jermayan and ancaladar being driven further and further away leaving redhelwar essentially blind so far as the battle was concerned suddenly he knew what he had to do ciltesse take command here dont let them break through whatever you do he touched his spurs lightly to firareths sides and rode to find redhelwar hed gone less than a quarter mile when he encountered shadowed elves that had broken through the ring their tactics against mounted knights were savage but effective they struck first against the destrier if they could shattering its legs with heavy clubs and then springing on the downed knight using poison or acid or thinbladed knives to destroy the armors defenses and kill the elf within every knight they killed gained them new elvensteel weapons as well as eliminating an enemy the shadowed elves swarmed toward kellen and firareth kellen had an instants warning as he felt the stallion gather himself he took in a sharp breath and a shiver of energy ran through him not quite fear but a close relative and then firareth plunged into the midst of the shadowed elves spinning and striking with hooves and heels and teeth kellen struck as well reaching with his sword what the destrier could not onceit seemed a long time ago nowjermayan and valdien had showed him what an elven destrier was capable of on the field of battle kellen had been sure then that hed never master the intricate cues that would tell his mount what to do and in fact he didnt know them yet but firareth obviously knew exactly what the situation called for and after master belesharons training and shalkanskellen could stay in the saddle no matter what his mount chose to do and elvenmade equestrian armor was just as flexible as anything the elves made for themselves so he let battlesight and firareth tell him what to do it was a dance a dance in which two moved as one a deadly dance of hoof and steel and one that the shadowed elves were not prepared for firareth might have had some form of battlesight himself the way he anticipated what the enemy was going to do next and met the threat before it could even evolve it was over before the shadowed elves realized that they were outclassed and outmaneuvered not one of them escaped good fellow kellen said a few moments later patting the side of his mounts neckarmor against armor but it would have to do firareth turned to look at himwith kellen imagined an air of equal approval then he snorted and looked about head high the stallion was excited obviously looking for more targets the shadowed elves were trying to break through the line drawn by the calling spell and by the nearness of their enemy with the arrival of the deathwings there was no more question of luring them outit had become a matter of killing them before they escaped and everywhere kellen looked the fighting was heavy the skirmishers werent armed with the elven lance but the line units were and for all its unwieldiness it proved their most effective weapon against the deathwings kellen saw one elven knight stand in his stirrups heft his lance and fling it skyward like a javelin it transfixed the body of one of the deathwings and brought it crashing to the ground the others with him rode quickly forward their mounts trampling the creature until they were sure it was dead the fighting was frenzied now but kellen did his best to detour around it his goal was to reach redhelwar he found the elven general on an outcropping of rock overlooking the cavern mouth redhelwar was surrounded by his personal guard and by mounted messengers whose purpose it was to take orders to the various units engaged in battle sir he called to catch the commanders attention he caught it all right the elven commander turned in his saddle to stare why are you here redhelwar demanded jermayan cant see the battlefield for you kellen said as his battlesense and wildmagery told him just how far they actually were at the moment jermayan and ancaladar were far to the west of ysterialpoerin kellen could locate them as easily as his own right hand the deathwings have driven ancaladar off but i can tell you what is happening the shadowed elves are breaking through our lines and they have weapons andsomethingcached somewhere between here and ysterialpoerin i dont know where if you can see the battlefield then tell me what you see redhelwar ordered sharply automatically kellen closed his eyes responding to the command as if hed been bespelled himself for a moment the world seemed to spin then everything steadied dreamlike and impossibly tiny a pattern in his mind in colors that only elves could see as if it were nothing to do with him as if it did not matter he heard himself reciting the places where the line was weak where units had been decoyed out of positionor slain entirely they had assumed the numbers of the shadowed elves would be similar to what they had encountered in the first caverndoubled of course since they were facing the warriors of two caverns here but of the same order theyd been wrong there were far more of them here the shadowed elves thrived on darkness and cold and theyd been preparing for this battle for a very long time if redhelwar had fallen into their trap and lost a third of his force in the nearer cavern tonight wouldnt be a battle at all it would be a slaughter redhelwar was giving orders to his messengers now and they sped off like arrows from an elven bow but kellen didnt listen the important thing was to see the picture and report it would a time ever come when he could see and fight theyre behind the line kellen heard himself say theyve really broken through now theyve driven a gap in the lines where east and north not just the few dozen that the deathwings had managed to carry over their line but a number that could pose a serious threat to ysterialpoerin a hundred perhaps more he could see how theyd done itthe long perilous climb over the glacier the bitter clash with the high reaches warriors then down the side of the mountain and into the night go find them theres little more you can do here redhelwar said kellen opened his eyes drawing in a deep breath of icy night air and for a moment the battle spun crazily around him before everything settled again the world seen only through his human senses seemed oddly flat and simple but now urgency tightened his gut and he had orders to follow with a quick salute he turned firareth about and rode back to his men the fighting was heavier now and several times kellen was delayed though he went as quickly as he could by now the skirmishing units had been drawn into the fighting called up to replace fallen comrades and to draw the ring of elvensteel tighter around the enemy kellen located isinwenhe did not see ciltesseat the head of the troop they had obviously just withdrawn from a clash with the enemy and were looking about for fresh foes isinwen was not riding cheska but a strange destrier whose caparison and barding was drenched in blood ciltesse he did not want to know yet he must ask we were separated isinwen replied voice cracking and hoarse from shouting i have not seen him since there was no time to worry about a single member of the troop he would either be alive or dead and they had a job to do disengage we have orders come with me isinwen raised the warhorn to his lips and blew a short call a few moments later a few more members of kellens troop came riding up their swords black with blood even in the blue light of the coldfire ciltesse was not among them follow kellen called theyve broken through the lines weve orders to stop them kellen set a hard pace and the others followed him in the direction of where the shadowed elves had broken through the lines in his battlevision kellen wasnt sure what their plan was escape to attack ysterialpoerin it didnt matterwhatever they planned he had to stop it if he could do no more than warn the defenders of ysterialpoerin that would be enough if this was not completely familiar land it was familiar enough now with the coldfire to help that he dared take them at a hard canter they pounded through the soft snow a growing urgency in him though no direction as yet by now hed lost all track of time athan had not cast his spell until the moon had risen above the mountains so the battle had begun several hours after sunset at a guess it must be after midnight now but the clouds were denser than ever the only illumination was the crowns of blue fire each of them carried with him casting blurred and changing shadows over the snow and against the trees only the nearer trees and undergrowth had any definition at all a few yards away everything blurred into an insubstantial misty grey he carried the map of the terrain in his headhalf memory of the maps in redhelwars pavilion half memory of what his battlesight had shown him their path and the path of the fleeing shadowed elves should intersect somewhere ahead the forest made pursuit more difficult kellen never thought thered come a time when hed be wishing for the open icy plains that led up to the nearer cavern but he did now he would have been able to see for leagues there and they could have let the destriers run allout at last kellen could sense open space ahead he raised his hand slowing the horses to a walk with the coldfire they didnt have the advantage of surprise but whatever was there he wanted to see it before they rushed to engage and the animals could use a breathing space even if only for a few minutes they reached the edge of the trees ahead of them stretched a long shallow valley all was black without even the shadows of trees to give it shape in the distance his battlesight showed him piles of dirtcovered snow where the shadowed elves had dug all the way down into the frozen ground two sets of ropes were attached to something beneath the surface of the snow and the shadowed elvesthe ones that the deathwings had lifted over the lines earlier he thoughtwere pulling with all their strength axes and shovels and unused coils of rope were scattered over the surface discarded when they were no longer needed not a weapons cache or if that then more a tools cache but why what was buried here that was so important to them that they would dig down through ice and snow and frozen earth to get to it in the middle of a battle and why now why not earlier there was something beneath the ground as well kellen couldnt quite make it out and knew he didnt have the time to spend trying the shadowed elves were trying to get to it which meant it would be very bad for the elves i dont know what theyre doing but it doesnt matter they want whats there we must stop them from getting it kellen said to isinwenand with his heart leaping into his throat gave the signal to charge they rode down the valley toward the work party of shadowed elves the second group of shadowed elves caught sight of them and began shouting in their strange barking language running toward them isinwen who has the fastest horse kellen shouted over the sound of their snowmuffled hoofbeats nironoshans cerlocke is fastest isinwen answered without hesitation nironoshanride to ysterialpoerinnowand tell them the shadowed elves have broken through our lines they may expect company kellen ordered at the top of his lungs his party was outnumbered six to oneat least and at those odds it was a more than equal fight and he dared not assume this was the only group of shadowed elves that had broken through redhelwars careful defenses i go nironoshan spurred cerlocke off at an angle from the main charge the pale destrier he rode quickly drawing ahead of the others kellen expected the shadowed elves to go for weapons as his troop bore down on them but they only increased their desperate hauling on the ropes soon he was close enough to see them by coldflre instead of battlesight and then to slaughter them it was almost too easy the only difficult thing for him and his troop was reaching them to attack as the piles of earth and snow on either side formed a natural bulwark that made them difficult to get to but even while they were being cut down the shadowed elves would not relinquish the ropes leading down into the pit not even to defend themselves and a few seconds after the last of them fell dead the second wave of shadowed elves reached the pits edge unlike the others these were well armed in the light of the coldfire kellen could see the gleam of looted swords and daggers in their hands on foot kellen shouted vaulting from firareths saddle and giving the destrier the command to leave the field mounted the elves were vulnerable to attacks against their horsesthe shadowed elves had proven that to them time and again this night on foot a chance against these greater numbers perhaps once more his world narrowed to a series of feints and targets as kellens mind forced his aching coldstiffened muscles to obey each foe he killed was one less for his war brothers to face and no matter what they did here ysterialpoerin was warned in a distant part of his mindthe part that must assess things even now heknew the battle was going against them time and again he felt his comrades die and fed his fury at their deaths into the fight though it cost him dearly in his exhaustion he summoned fire and set a dozen of the enemy burning like torches but fire was easy to put out in the midst of a snowfield and in the moment he was distracted by setting the spell two shadowed elves got past his guard swarming him like starving rats it was his cloak that saved him as much as his armorthe coldwarg fur was heavy and thick it tangled their blades buying him the vital moment he needed to throw them off the ground began to shake kellen hadnt thought there was anything that would make a shadowed elf break off an attack once one of the creatures had begun but the two that were attacking him actually cowered back and in their moment of inattention kellen killed them both suddenly the pit behind him exploded upward and outward as if it were a stoppedup fountain spewing ice stone and earth high into the air and something was rising with it kellens first confused impression was snakeand he hated snakesbut this was only as much like a snake as the deathwings were like true bats it was the white of dirty snow it had a head vaguely similar to ancaladars but there all resemblance ended the eyes were dead black and malignant the body that of a serpentsif a serpent were large enough to swallow bulls without choking it radiated cold like a palpable forcethe temperature dropped quickly enough to make kellens face hurt and the pooling blood on the bodies of the shadowed elves hed just killed froze solid with an audible crack icedrake sihemand shouted one of the creatures shadow mountain had bred in the lost lands they radiated cold and exhaled poison get to the horses kellen ordered suddenly it was difficult to talk he looked around the rest of the shadowed elves were gone faded into the darkness theyd run the moment the icedrake had burst free and the temperature was still dropping hed thought hed been cold before now he knew hed never known the meaning of the word the icedrake radiated a cold as intense and deadly as a forgingfurnaces fire he backed unsteadily away from the pit his blooddrenched surcoat was frozen to his armor it tore like paper when he moved the icedrake towered over him rising as high as the tallest trees in the forest of ysterialpoerin before arching its neck and beginning to lower itself slowly toward the snow kellen switched to battlesight but instead of the familiar overlay in glowing blue and redshowing him the creatures attackpattern and where he might attack in turnhe saw nothing but the same queer fog that had surrounded the coldwarg when theyd been demonbespelled kellen isinwen shouted rousing him from his daze run he tried but by now he was so cold that even to move was agony he managed a few steps and fell and knew that he couldnt get up again you will learn to do that which you think you cannot do he could hear master belesharons words in his head he tasted snow and blood from coldcracked lips through the facepiece of his armor he couldnt run but he could move clutching at his sword he used it to lever himself to his feet again cold even the icedrakes presence was lethal if he stayed here any longer he would freeze to death the icedrake appeared in front of him its chin landing in the snow with a soft thump it opened its jaws they were large enough kellen realized with a distant sense of astonishment that he could just walk down its throat but that obviously wasnt what it had in mind and there was no way he could get out of its way fire ill summon fire he thought desperately but there was nothing here that would burn suddenly the icedrake burst into flames its jaws snapped shut and it reared up looking affronted a ragged cheer went up from the elves kellen stared bewildered though every inch of its body was covered in flamesthe snow all around it was meltingthe fire seemed to have no effect on the monster itself at all and then jermayan and ancaladar struck from above with all their might the great black dragon stooped down out of the sky and seized the icedrake just behind the head as an eagle might seize a snake with great pounding wingbeats the dragon carried its farfromhelpless prey into the sky kellen almost fell the relief of rescue was so intense instead he forced himself to his feet and began to stagger through the slush isinwen met him halfway and dragged him the rest of the way to the horses boosting him into firareths saddle can you see it can you see ancaladar kellen tell us he demanded kellen shook his head to clear it looking skyward theyd barely arrived in time jermayan and ancaladar had fought the deathwings before but never in such numbers and this time their intent was clearif they could not harm ancaladar they would kill his bonded for the death of one meant the death of the other and they could harm ancaladar for the dragon though large and fast and possessed of a tough armored hide was still flesh and bone and blood their fight carried them far from the mountains far past ysterialpoerin for every one of the whitefurred horrors slain by ancaladars teeth and clawsor jermayans sword and spellstwo more seemed to take its place when the creatures could find no other way to attack they simply threw their bodies at the dragon and his rider attempting to batter them from the sky by sheer force but at last the sky was clear where now ancaladar asked jermayan could feel his bondeds weariness it matched his own but there was still work to be done the fight was by no means over not for them and not for the army below and behind them back toward the battlefield fly below the clouds i want to be able to let redhelwar know how the land lies between ysterialpoerin and the cavern of course ancaladar agreed curving a wingtip in a gentle arcing descent ysterialpoerin was quiet as was the camp but then running through the snow below ancaladar spotted a lone horseman riding at top speed through the snow in the direction of the city thats nironoshan one of kellens troop the dragon said follow his tracks jermayan ordered tersely kellen had sent his fastest rider as a messenger to ysterialpoerinbut why a few wingbeats later he knew the icedrake reared up out of the earth spraying rock and ice about it with the force of its exit and then lowered itself to the snow seeking food the creatures would eat carrion or the frozen victims of their radiated cold but they preferred to stun their prey with their breath and swallow their paralyzed quarry before it died jermayan could see the remains of a battle on the snow below and a handful of elven knights still alive and kellen directly in the icedrakes path jermayan summoned fire enfolding the creature in flames but to his dismay it was not consumed the flames coated it like a cloak they annoyed it but they did not harm it the icedrake reared back lifting half its length from the snow and looking for its tormentor and ancaladar stooped upon it seizing it behind the head and dragged it into the sky his mighty wings straining the icedrake hissed and thrashed spewing clouds of poison vapor that were blown harmlessly away by the winds of the upper air before they reached jermayan as the white worm flailed jermayan tried spell after spell before realizing that all of them were useless no spell that he knew had the slightest effect on the creature all he could do was use his spells to constantly heal the damage it was doing to both him and ancaladar with its radiant cold for as long as his strength held out beyond that this was ancaladars fight alone the dragon raked the icedrakes body with his formidable hind talons the icedrake used its body like a whip attempting to wrap itself around the dragons neck and break it or strike his wings hard enough to break them and no matter what ancaladar dared not let go of his grip on the icedrakes head theyre fighting kellen said in response to isinwens question his battlesight showed him the combatants locked in struggle above the clouds ancaladar will win he added with a certainty he did not feel and then he and jermayan can give you all the details he shook his head to clear it there was still work to do come on half the shadowed elves ran off when that thing came out of the ground we need to find out where the others were as tired and nearly as battered by the cold as he was and of the twenty who had ridden away from the main battle with him five would never ride again the snow is fresh let me try reyezeyt said exhaustion tugged at jermayan but he knew he dared not fail a moments inattention to his spells and both he and his bonded would freeze to death it would not matter which died first for the others death would follow in a heartbeat ancaladar roared with pain and fury as the icedrake slammed its muscular coils once more into his ribs this time he was quick enough darting his head down and to the side his jaws sank into the icedrakes body with a sound like ice breaking on a frozen pond for just an instant the creature went still in agony jermayan could taste the foulness of its blood in his own mouth as well as the acid pain of burning cold but in that instant ancaladar claimed the victory he curled his hind talons upward sinking them deep into the icedrakes body in an unbreakable grip it was impossible for him to fly in such a contorted position but he had flown very high during their battle now he folded his wings back and simply fell pulling at the struggling body in his grasp with claws and teeth at last the icedrake tore jermayan felt it die felt the ancient and inimical energies fade and felt ancaladars surge of triumph at the same moment ancaladars jaws snapped shuthe quickly opened them again spitting out fragments of fleshand he straightened his body with a snap letting the wind pull his wings open the ground had been very close relief gave jermayan new energy and ancaladars magic was a boundless well for him to draw from he healed the damagethe last of the damage for with the icedrake dead there would be no moreand sent up a silent prayer of gratitude to leaf and star that they had won he let his own joy and relief spill out to ancaladar and felt the dragon share his own ancaladar circled low over the pit from which the icedrake had emerged and fastidiously dropped the pieces of the dead creature beside it there was no bloodthat had been spattered to the winds aboveand the corpse was already softening in the quick dissolution of creatures of the dark ancaladar landed and walked over to the pit peering down into it curiously i wonder where it leads he asked nowhere we want to go jermayan said grimly nor do i think our enemies should have the use of it the spell of unmaking was one of the most complicated spells he knew and one of the most dangerous for it returned things to their original condition and so must be used with great care but ancaladar had insisted that he practice it over and over and over again and now jermayan had good reason to be grateful for his teachers stern determination he cast it now focusing upon the pit stone and earth and ice shivered snow leaped up into the air all caught in the dance of magic a moment later the pit was gone sealed once more now we return to the fight jermayan said yessss ancaladar agreed and jermayan smiled just a little to feel the dragons strength return as they launched back into the sky the tracks of the shadowed elves led quickly into the trees and scattered and then vanished altogether try as he might kellen could summon no vision of whathadbeen to tell him where theyd gone nor could reyezeyt find any trace of themnot even the piles of ash that shadow mountain tended to leave of servants it was displeased with but it shouldnt be displeased with these servants should it they and the others had done exactly what theyd meant tounleashed another shadowborn monster to ravage the elven lands if jermayan and ancaladar couldnt kill it after at least an hour spent searching for a trail that didnt exist even kellen was willing to give up come on he said wearily wed better report to redhelwar but i want to take a last look at the pit first he paused a moment to try and find jermayan and the dragon with his battlesense but even that was weakening as exhaustion claimed him when they got there kellen received one of the few pleasant surprises of the night the pit had been filled inas if it had never beenand lying in the snow atop it were the two halves of the icedrake like the deathwings it seemed to be decomposing with supernatural swiftness and the destriers welltrained though they were flatly refused to approach the stinking remains at least we know who won kellen said i hope theyre both all right they turned their horses back toward the cavern bearing their dead and leading the nowmasterless destriers by the time kellen and the remains of his troop returned to the lines the tide of battle had shifted firmly in the elves favor belepheriel met them as they were coming in the elven commander rode at the head of a full hundred for all their numbers still only a fraction of the troops under his command to see you gladdens my heart kellen knightmage he said as serenely as if there was not still fighting going on all around them and mine to see you belepheriel kellen said though the news i bring makes illhearing jermayan and ancaladar have returned and told us of the icedrakes destruction the commander replied the battle goes well for usthere are only scattered knots of resistance from the enemy now and our line holds firm jermayan has sealed the main entrance with ice so they may not retreat and by dawn the field will be ours and i have failed kellen said bitterly i lost the shadowed elves i was sent to findthey escaped and i could find no trace of them i sent nironoshan to warn the city but and if you had not jermayan and ancaladar would not have known to seek out the icedrake and we would have lost far more this night than the location of a few shadowed elves belepheriel said reprovingly one warrior does not win the war as master belesharon will surely have told you come you have done your part and now that i have found you i have done mine with the line secure redhelwar has ordered the healers wagons brought up you and your men need healing rest warmth and tea i will make your report to redhelwar kellen wanted to argue the point but he was too tired and far too cold and he certainly owed his command and their mounts a rest so he followed belepheriel to the healers encampment a circle of wagons set up half a mile away from the lines he was unsurprised to find idalia there as well she came out of the healers tent to view the new arrivals took one look at him and ordered him into the healers tent but im not kellen began now kellen sighed and obeyed go warm up he said to the others it was bright inside the healers tent and after so long outside it seemed swelteringly hot frost formed on the exposed surface of kellens armor and melted immediately jermayan told me about the icedrake you know what they can do didnt it occur to you that it was going to kill you take off your armor idalia commanded he blinked at her in confusion well yes but inow no after the flesh has fallen from your bones with frostburn idalia said acidly kellen unhooked his cloak and dropped it to the floor of the tent then pulled off his helmet idalia studied his face critically not too bad she pronounced come onboots and gauntlets his hands and feet had been numb with cold before the warmth of the tent made them ache now clumsily he managed to get his gauntlets off and barely remembered to keep his leather gloves on to remove his frostcold sabatons and greavessitting down first on a wooden stool that idalia impatiently indicated at last his bare hands and feet were exposed the skin was white with cold but whatever horrible affliction idalia was looking for she didnt find it nevertheless she pulled a pot of salve from her apron pocket knelt before him and rubbed it into his feet briskly it hurt kellen kept his mouth shut though she might think of something worse when she was done with his feet she did his handsand that hurt even more then she wiped her hands clean took a pot of something else entirely and daubed it liberally over his face that at least was pleasantthe thick salve smelled of honey and lanolin all right you can armor up again you were damned lucky idalia said grudgingly i know you were warned about frostburn well yes kellen admitted too long in the cold and the flesh died on the bone and then rotted if not seen to the healers had been very graphic about it but its not as if we had time to stop and build a fire idalia grunted reluctantly and wordlessly conceding his point kellen gratefully put his armor back on and picked up his cloak there were deep slashes in it from shadowed elf blades but perhaps someone would be able to repair it later he got to his feet idalia i lost track of ciltesse and several of my other people earlier he said hesitantly have you seen idalia shook her head compassion in her expression now i havent seen them but im not the only healer here someone else may have or they may not have been wounded at all check with the others checking with the healers might be a good idea but as kellen left the tent two more elves were brought in one bleeding from a deep swordcut the other shaking from poison right now the healers had enough to do he left the tent and passed behind the ring of wagons the horselines were set up there with lanterns illuminating large braziers heating the everpresent kettles of soup and tea he quickly found the others theres bad news he could tell that from isinwens posture alone as the elven knight stood huddled against the braziers heat his helmet beneath his arm tell me quickly kellen said coming up ciltesse is dead isinwen said i saw jolia in the horselines and i asked othersvalhile penemiel aldere gone to leaf and star reyezeyt said softly kellen took a deep breath hed seen ayihletevizi fall earlier tonight in the fighting lirgrinteko rirnas airiren and those the shadowed elves had killed at the pit as well hed lost more than half his command tonight elves hed ridden with trained with lived with trusted his life to and sworn to keep safe he bowed his head feeling his throat swell with unsheddable tears alakomentai isinwen said gently it is not easy but it happens in war you were not generous with our lives you were our mayn against the enemy first in every battle mayn meant shield in the old tongue of the elves kellen was not comforted he took a deep breath if our losses were so heavy he began ah no do not fear that reyezeyt said sounding almost relieved at what he thought was the cause of kellens distress the skirmishing units took the brunt of the enemys attack we and the mountainfolk took the heaviest losses i hear the army is still strong it was cold cheer but it would have to do come kaldet urged take tea it is crude and simple stuff but it will warm you chapter twentytwo smoke and storm calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink at dawn the warhorns blew the victory hours before carts of wounded had begun moving back toward the camp well guarded by line units that could now be spared from what was by now little more than a series of executions kellen and his people remained having no orders otherwise and slowly a few last stragglers from kellens troop found them rhuifai janshil krinyen kellen knew that isinwen was right loss was the price of war no one blamed him for the deaths except himself youve got to stop this or youll go mad he told himself if belepheriel can forgive you for imerteniels death then you have to forgive yourself now because the deaths of those who died tonight are no more your fault than imerteniels was if you cant forgive yourself youll be useless in this fight and the stakes are too high for that they knew what they were doing and they did it willingly and gladly they were elven knights trained for war dont dishonor their deaths by letting them make you less than what you are we will always remember them kellen said heavily hed been silent a very long time isinwen looked up in surprise when he finally spoke yes he said simply their names will be entered in the great book in the house of sword and shield the house will remember them and so will our children and leaf and star will remember also as long as the forests bloom and the stars burn and its our job to make sure that the forests bloom forever kellen thought grimly ill make sure they do i swear it a few hours after dawn adaerion rode down with the order for kellen and his troop to retreat back to camp and make sure you eat and sleep when you get there youre going into the cavern tomorrow adaerion said when they were mounted and ready to ride wearily kellen turned firareths head toward camp kellen missed the next battle which took place that very night redhelwar brought the unicorn knights up from ysterialpoerin to the farther cavern backed them with a handpicked selection of volunteer cavalry that could work in close proximity to unicorns and arranged for jermayan and ancaladar to slaughter a small herd of deer directly below the cavern mouth he didnt ask jermayan to unseal the ice barriers over the cavern openings there was no need the evervoracious goblins lured out into the darkness by the scent of fresh meat swarmed toward the mound of venison through the ice and rock and once they began to feed the unicorn knights attacked one thrust of their mounts horns would kill a goblin and though the creatures spat poison the touch of a unicorns horn could quickly heal the hurt though the elves slew them in great numbers the lure of fooddead deer the bodies of slain goblins and the prospect of living preykept the creatures coming they must have been more than usually ravenous perhaps the shadowed elves had kept them short of prey many of them stopped to eat instead of attacking and elven lancers riding in and out of the fray quickly added the new arrivals to the swiftly growing mound of dead at little risk to themselves goblins would rather eat than kill and would break off an attack in order to feed only in the absence of food were they truly dangerous to an enemy so long as there was something to eat they could be killed with relative impunity and at last no more goblins emerged into the upper air as redhelwar had told kellen the elves had hunted goblins many times in the past that was the tale kellen heard when he was roused at dawn of the next day he might have slept even longer save for the fact that someone was shaking the bells at the door of his tentand had been for some time by the sound of things he staggered over to the doorway still wearing his armors underpadding idalia was standing there a roll of cloth under one arm and a covered mug in the other oh good she said youre still alive you certainly slept like the dead she dumped the bundle on the floor of his tent and held out the mug armethaliehan black i figured youd need something stronger than winter spice this morning how long kellen croaked snatching for the mug and flipping back the lid the fragrant smell ofvery strongtea filled the pavilion he drank eagerly lets see idalia said pretending to think about it its dawn so the battle at the cavern ended yesterday morning last night the unicorn knightswith a little help from qualifying cavalrylured out and killed whats probably all of the goblins from the caverns now redhelwar wants to see you as soon as youve eaten so you should probably get dressed and go see him she dropped the tent flap and walked off while kellen was still coming to terms with being awake kellen finished his tea and put on his armorapparently hed cleaned both before passing out yesterday though he didnt remember doing itand put on a fresh surcoat the bundle idalia had dropped was his coldwargfur cloak mended i have to remember to thank her for thatif she wont take my head off for it petariel was in the dining tent and kellen got a more detailed version of the slaughter of the goblins from him as he worked his way through a platterful of food i wish id been there he said surprised to find it was true well we cant let you have all the fun petariel said reprovingly it made a nice change from riding picket around the heart of the forest i assure you we return nironoshan to you incidentallywhile we thank you for the warning if youve lost any shadowed elves i assure you we havent found them theyve probably run off to some other rathole kellen said darkly just in case they havent well continue to look for them petariel assured him but i dont think i can promise to return them to you in the condition you last saw them kellen shook his head smiling painfully he knew petariels lightlymocking words were a mask for the grief that all the elves shared at being forced to execute those they thought of as their own kind he understood it better than he would have once petariel had offered kellen neither sympathy nor acknowledgment for the members of his troop he had lost in the battle though he was sure petariel knew about them and for that kellen was profoundly grateful if petariel had kellen wasnt sure hed have been able to stand it i wouldnt dream of asking you to return them at all he said striving to match his friends tone one does not ask for the return of a gift since you have given me such a rich gift i shall have to ask gesade what i may gift you with in suitable recompense petariel said but you must go now else you will be late for the days interesting events when kellen arrived in redhelwars pavilion the senior commanders idalia vestakiain her scarlet armorand jermayan were already there once he would have fretted about being late now kellen simply assumed that if redhelwar had wanted him earlier he would have sent someone to fetch him kellen knightmage redhelwar greeted him it is now time to finish what we have begun vestakia must lead us to the shadowed elf village kellen thought about it for a moment will it work he asked bluntly i know you can sense taint vestakia but the shadowed elves arent the only tainted things still in thereeven without goblins vestakia nodded i know i cant tell one kind of tainted creature from another but from what jermayan says about the duergar if we go in lit with coldfire theyll sense it and get as far away from us as possibleand the shadowed elves wont we hope kellen thought grimly weve killed allor nearly allthe goblins and most of the fighting males redhelwar said what you should face today should be only females and young though in greater numbers than you have faced before kellen nodded then vestakia will be able to lead us to the village and once shes found it shell return to the surface immediately i wont object vestakia said with a rueful smile jermayan and ancaladar were waiting for them at the cavern mouth the day was dark and even cold as it was the air felt heavy instead of crisp kellen remembered what the other wildmages had said about the weather because of thatand because clearing the caverns of all their tainted inhabitants would probably not be the work of a single day redhelwar would be making a second temporary camp here once the battlefield had been cleared the elves were still working to remove the bodies of the slain shadowed elves as the fighting force rode through and everywhere kellen looked the snow was churned and stained he found himself looking forward to the snow to come before theyd arrived jermayan had improved the path to the cavern mouthnow it was a long gentle slope instead of the steep twisting path the shadowed elves had carved as those who would enter the cavern began to dismount he banished the shield of ice that had barred the entrance first ranks take your shields adaerion ordered the supply wagon with artenels experimental shields stood ready and waiting kellen collected his and hefted it artenel had made some improvements including a shoulderpiece that would allow the shields weight to be more evenlydistributed there werent enough shields for everyone but at least those in front would have greater protection than before from the shadowed elves preferred weapons they ascended into the cavern kellen and isinwen led with idalia and vestakia directly behind him as before the passageway was straight at first and narrow enough that only two elven knights could walk sidebyside kellen walked carefully alert for tripwires just because they didnt expect this lair to be catchtrapped didnt mean it might not be and a quickly prepared trap could be just as lethal as one that had been moonturns in the making but he saw nothing at allnot tripwire goblin nor shadowed elfand soon they came to the first point in the cavern where a decision as to their direction must be made by now the only light came from the coldfire that crowned them all behind him he heard vestakias breathing grow ragged though she tried hard to control it which way kellen asked leftfar left she corrected as the tunnel branched in all directions here unlike the last two shadowed elf caverns kellen had been in this one was a honeycomb of tunnels and chambers and after the second turn he sent someone back to mark their path for without clear signs they might never find their way out again still they saw no sign of the enemy and kellen began to believe that once again the rest of the shadowed elves meant to make a stand at the village surely they know thats useless kellen thought there was something disturbing about the idea that this part of the battle would repeat the previous one everything theyd seen so far told them that the shadowed elves had learned from the first battle they would know that hiding wouldnt save them theres something wrong here he said to isinwen tell me isinwen said instantly nothing clear of course it just doesnt feel as if things are quite as they should be here i cant tell more than that behind him vestakia choked out a laugh then gagged and began to cough let me make this known to redhelwar any information is better than none isinwen said yes kellen stopped while isinwen moved back through the line to find a runner to carry the message vestakia are you all right oh im fine vestakia said sounding breathless and a bit irritated i dont know what you mean about things being not quite right here they certainly feel normal to meall wrong isinwen returned and they continued vestakia grew weaker the deeper they went into the mountain until kellen wondered if she would actually be able to lead them the entire way to the village her breathing now was punctuated by strangled whimpers of pain and idalia was allbutcarrying her but she never faltered giving them their directions in a clearthough shakingwhisper each time the path became confused her courage was as true as a sword blade if there was a single elf in the entire army who still doubted her after today that doubt would be gone there she said at last in a voice so faint kellen had to strain to hear it look ahead to the left wait here kellen said to isinwen they stood at the entrance to a huge cavern by now kellen had lost all sense of time without vestakias guidance he would have been certain theyd been wandering in circles he left the others and crossed the cavern senses alert looking for any exit to the left he nearly missed it the opening was small and narrow as shadowed elf passageways tended to be but when he looked cautiously through it he could seeat the bottom of a short series of shallow terracesthe glowing firepit that marked a shadowed elf village and though it was too dark to see clearly in the cavern beyond he sensed life in abundance and the sense of wrongness hed felt before came back again stronger but still no clearer he saw no traps for a moment kellen considered retreating adaerion was in charge of the assault but he was certain adaerion would listen to him if he said they should leave but no there was something down there even if it didnt turn out to be shadowed elves they needed to either kill it rescue it or talk to it their job was to find out whichjust as soon as vestakia was safe he returned quickly to the others thats it get her out of here he said to idalia go with her tell redhelwar somethings not the way its supposed to be i cant figure out anything more ill tell jermayan too idalia said maybe he can help the cavern outside the entrance was large enough for them to gather a good portion of their assault force there as they waited for the others to get back to the surface kellen tried to bring his sense of foreboding into sharper focus but could not something was not right that was all he knew kellen you must go first adaerion said if it is an ambush you will be able to tell us at once after you all those with artenels shields we shall surround the village if we can and do what we must kellen and the others nodded none of them liked the necessity that lay before them but it had to be done and what other terrible things will have to be done before the power of shadow mountain is broken kellen wondered uneasily at last it was time kellen hefted his shield and stepped through the doorway he quickly slipped to one side keeping the rock at his back his battlesight showed no threat there was utter silence in the cavern save for the faint sound of water dripping steadily somewhere far away the elves followed him quickly each crowned with coldfire the more that came through the brighter the cavern became they spread out along the terracesfive shallow broad steps kellen now saw something the cave itself had created smoothed and evened by the passing of countless generations of shadowed elf footsteps the cavern itself was a beautiful thing the stone ceiling dripped with eternal icicles of stone some of which at the edges of the cavern had grown long enough to touch the floor the cavern had obviously once been filled with them andjust as obviouslythose in the center had been cut away and used to build the village huts giving many of them an odd resemblance to the log house kellen had shared with idalia in the wildwood this village was larger than the last one theyd seen the structures more elaborate indicating longer habitation but all the life kellen sensed here was concealed within those hutsthough this cavern had many exits kellen could not perceive a single shadowed elf lurking in ambush soon the attack force had moved into position and still there was no sound no movement from the shadowed elves everyone knew were there adaerion indicated the nearest hut and pointed to keirasti communicating solely by gesture she pointed to five of her command and moved toward it then everything began to happen at once they cant possibly all fit into these huts kellen realized belatedly a dozen yelping children swarmed from the hut just as keirasti and her troops reached it as if their screams had been a signalor perhaps because they could not bear to lie concealed a moment longerthe door of every hut burst open and barking yelping shadowed elf young burst forth running at the elves they were every size from those barely able to walk on their own to those halfgrown and they attacked the elves in the manner of starving rats there was not one fullgrown shadowed elf among them children kellen whispered in horror nothing but children he ran into the first hut the one keirasti had approached lying on the floor pushed into a corner he saw halfadozen shadowed elf infants a couple were still moving feebly the others were already dead they starved to death there was no one here to care for them and they starved to death because their mothers were elsewhere he ran back outside and grabbed the nearest elf he could pull from the fighting goruntell redhelwar all the adult females are somewhere else they arent in the caverns he saw the elven knight turn away to carry his message and raised his sword covering the warriors retreat the winged gods had warned them centuries ago that this day would come and so against the time of testing they had prepared digging their long tunnels deep into the rock preparing weapons making all ready when the day came that the hated ones summoned the brothers into the night to die the sisters were ready they gave their last orders to their young they went to the tunnels and there they waited knowing they must not dig their own way to the surface until they knew all was lost but all was not lost the last of the brothers came for them just as the winged gods had promised that they would they brought them into the terrible cold bright world of the upper air promising them blood and meat enough to atone for the death of every cub with weapons in hand and death in their hearts the sisters and the brothers hurried toward the place where the hated ones made their home the unicorn knights were working a wide circle through the heartforest carefully searching for anything out of place while the regular cavalry patrolled the city just outside its boundaries despite the fact that there had been no attack nor was likely to be oneneither group was less than alert elves were a patient people centaurs coming gesade said sniffing the wind a day or two i think it will be good to have the reinforcements petariel said and good of them to travel so far from their farms in winter we must make them welcome gesade sniffed again the winds wrong but something lets go look unicorn and rider trotted off along their assigned path through the snowy forest vandelt and merchan had been partners rather longer than the usual pairing among the unicorn knights a little over a century now vandelt had never found the elf to whom his soul could bond and merchan simply said that vandelt was incapable of managing without him vandelt might have been captain of the unicorns if hed chosenhed certainly been a unicorn knight longer than anyone else currently serving among thembut he was far more interested in his garden and he was quite willing to admit that he had no interest in command let petariel have that honor with vandelts great goodwill but he had seen his fragile and delicate garden at deskethomaynel turn to dust in the great drought and he was as willing as anyone to strike out at the servants of those who had killed his beloved plants and he was by no means stupid merely unambitious so when merchan warned that someone was approaching from the direction they had been set to watch vandelt blew a warning immediately even before he rode out to investigate further it did not save them the arrow took merchan squarely in the chest it did not penetrate his armor but it clung and it burned vandelt could smell the stench of burning fur see the shimmer of heat and see wisps of smoke as the padding beneath merchans collet began to kindle but of their attackers he saw nothing run merchan the unicorn turned heading back toward their own lines vandelt raised his horn to blow a second more urgent warning but it was too late merchan had only gone a few yards before a net fell over them from above tangling them in its meshes and sending merchan crashing to the forest floor before vandelt could cut them free the shadowed elves dropped from the trees long knives flashing in the weak sunlight merchan and his rider died within seconds of each other the shadowed elves cut the ring of burning metal carefully from the unicorns body handling it with tongs and spiked it to the nearest tree then they moved on kellen says that somethings wrong idalia passed vestakia into the hands of the waiting healers who would take her back to the temporary camp a mile away as quickly as possibledistance was truly the best remedy for what ailed her that and a great deal of restand turned back to the elven general he will have given you all the information he had of course redhelwar said imperturbably well his precise words were tell redhelwar somethings not the way its supposed to be if that helps he couldnt tell me more than that he did try i know kellen he will have redhelwar broke off looking past her hed looked grim a moment before now he looked appalled idalia followed the direction of his gaze a single elven knight was running toward them from the cavern mouth running as if more than his life depended upon it he slid to his knees at the feet of redhelwars bay destrier a feint he gasped the females are not there kellen saidthe females are not in the caverns but the children were idalia said with sudden bleak understanding they left them behind so vestakia would have something to follow redhelwar barely moved his voice did not waver dionan tell jertnayan what tildaril has said request him if it is possible to find where the females have gone dionan rode away immediately to where jermayan and ancaladar waited on the cliff above the cavern entrance padredor i leave this secondary camp in your keeping guard itand vestakiawell when the others return from the caverns tell them we proceed as planned redhelwar continued yes redhelwar padredor said whatever might be happening elsewhere the caverns must still be scoured tildaril idalia i thank you both for your warnings when you see kellen next tell him he did all that anyone could ask of him i must return to camp if the females are gone we must look to the location of the next attack he turned and rode away yes kellen has done all that anyone could ask of himnot that hell believe that idalia thought with a resigned sigh she went to fetch cella for the ride back to the nearer camp her tools were there including her favorite scrying bowl perhaps she could see something useful vandelts warning had not been in vain for it was heard and relayed across the forest by a dozen horns even before he was struck down but it had been a warning only the unicorn knights were still not sure what they faced as they rode toward vandelts patrol area i smell bloodand smoke gesade said alarmed suddenly she leaped forward a net fell to the snow in the place where shed been above petariel cried unicorn knights fired into the trees as their mounts dodged madly evading nets spears and deadly fragile bottles of acid a few bodies fell but not enoughand from their concealment in the trees shadowed elf archers were returning fire with the terrible poisoned arrows that the elves had learned to fear in the rear of the vanguard menerchel blew the call to battle loudly enough to wake the forest itself leaf and star guard and guide us this day petariel thought their ambush having failed the enemy revealed themselves plainly now not the twoscore refugees from the battle that kellen had warned them ofhundreds of shadowed elves swarmed through the trees and over the forest floor they attacked where the army was weakest ysterialpoerin and gesade had been right now he smelled it too the forest was burning almost before dionan had finished speaking ancaladar took to the air the oncoming storm made the air currents turbulent and hard to predict higher altitude would have made flight easier but to seek greater height was the one thing they could not do he and jermayan must find the vanished shadowed elf females that kellen had warned them of and to do that they must fly low enough to see the ground ancaladar saw nothing moving below save for redhelwar and his troops making their way back toward the main camp he swept past the camp in a long curveeast then north the ground was harder to see herethere were fewer patches of open land and more forestbut ancaladar had hunted his own food for over a millennium he was an expert tracker and his eyes were sharp he studied the ground closely searching for signs of their prey ancaladarlook his bondeds voice was tight with fear ancaladar raised his eyes to the horizon in the distance near the elven citysmoke fire there was no thought of containment no possibility of a careful battle plan even being near these creatures was utterly painful to the unicornsa disastrous miscalculation that their enemy was quick to capitalize upon the unicorn knights fought on foot at petariels command theyd ordered their mounts to run but the unicorns couldntor wouldntleave their partners the cavalry units fought on foot as well for they had all learned quickly that a mounted warrior was at a disadvantage against this foe even kindolhinadetils guard had come at the sound of the warhorns to lend its strength to the fight the shadowed elves diedbut taking far too many of the elves with them and the forest was burning now jermayan saw tracks where no tracks should belooking down through the trees he could see places where the snow had been trampled by the passing of hundreds of feet and ahead curls of smoke rising from ysterialpoerins forest in a score of places smoldering still but about to burst into true flame and when they did the fire would take the heart of the forest with it once before kellen had stopped the shadowed elves from bringing disks of everburning metal to the trees this time they must have succeeded he could call those pieces of metal forth from their hiding places but it would take time time to find them time to bespell themand meanwhile the forest would catch and kindle and his comrades would die while he spent himself on this instead of coming to their aid you know how to stop this ancaladar said quietly the snow is near bring it now yes jermayan took a deep breath as ancaladar made a wide sweep around the heartforest he forced himself to set aside his fury and uncertainty to become an untroubled vessel of magic the snow would keep the fires from spreading buy him time to come to the aid of the army he could feel the patterns of the weather through ancaladars senses now he reached out with his magic to the coming storm bringing what would have been here by tomorrows dawn immediately the sky darkened wind lashed the trees below forced into the valley by storm clouds wrenched from their proper places the air currents boiled like an icy broth and ancaladar battled to stay skyborne the blizzard came as inexorable and deadly as a breaking wave an updraft sucked dragon and rider suddenly high into the clouds instantly jermayan was blinded by wet icy mist deafened by the crash of air colliding with air as solidly and loudly as boulders in a floodtossed streambed jermayan felt his skin begin to prickle and barely threw a shield around both of them in time lightning chained across the sky striking against his shields again and again as if the weather itself were angry about its mishandling it was needed jermayan thought as he and ancaladar were hurled across the clouds forgive me ancaladar fought for altitude his wings straining in their sockets and after a desperate battle they were above the storm soaring through calm winds and sunlight as sheets of ice crackled and fell from the dragons great wings jermayan looked down at the roiling cauldron of black snowheavy clouds that filled the ysterialpoerin valley it was snowing now a blizzard that would not spend itself easily or quickly and though snow would not quench the shadowed elves burning metal nothing else would burn the damage to the forest would not spread not an elegant execution ancaladar said at last sounding both amused and breathless but effective are you well bonded i shall be better when the enemy is vanquished jermayan said though i wish it did not have to be are you ready to return i shall be quick ancaladar said the great black dragon folded his wings and dove through the storm falling to earth as swiftly as if he were a thunderbolt himself at last the bitter work beneath the ground was done not without casualtiesfor even the shadowed elf young fought with desperate intensitybut it was done all were dead even the infantsand that the elves could tell themselves was an act of mercy for the youngest had obviously gone untended by their siblings they settled the bodies neatly but left them behind to recover later for adaerion was uneasy about what might be happening above kellen had led the host going in this time he was last out for the caverns were not yet safe even if no shadowed elves or goblins remained here there were still the duergar to hunt down adaerion could be certain kellen could resist their lure and could protect the others from giving in to it figuring out how to hunt them downso the caverns could be finally clearedwas a problem for another day and even when we clear this place out who knows how many more lairs remain kellen thought wearily and this isnt even the war this is just another of shadow mountains strategies to weaken us before the war he had never felt so close to despair by the time he reached the surface kellen already knewfrom talk passed back up the linethat the promised blizzard had come earlymagically early no one knew why but everyone was agreed that the wildmages would not have called it fresher information came the closer kellen got to the surface but it was frustratingly incomplete a battle at ysterialpoerin their own orders remained the same stay here and clear the caverns at last he reached the endtunnel and almost wished he hadnt snow was blown along half its length he could see nothing beyond the entrance but dim whiteness each pair of knights who walked out through the entrance was visible for only a few seconds before vanishing into the dense allconcealing snow their heavy cloaks whipped around them as if they were made of thin silk kellen hurried forward all but shoving isinwen ahead of him they must have won at ysterialpoerin redhelwar would surely have been able to get the reserves from the camp to the city in time to support them he was grateful that jermayan had taken the time to reshape the ramp out of the caves the wind was fierce and the snow that covered it had been packed down to ice by the feet of those before him if it had been any steeper it would have been a slide not a pathway he looked for adaerion but it was jermayan who came toward him out of the snow shalkan is asking for you come quickly shalkan shalkan was at ysterialpoerin he is unhurt but hurry jermayan had brought the storm kellen gathered that much from the elven knights halfdistracted explanation on the flight to ysterialpoerin that and that the elves had won the battle i thought for the forest and the city it did not matter to the shadowed elves or to their masters if they all died so long as they accomplished their task of destruction and so i looked first to the trees snow would slow the burning and its cause could be looked to later so that is a great victory jermayans voice was bitter carried back to kellen as they flew through the clear air and sunlight above the storm when poets unborn sing of this day in centuries to come surely they will say that we won jermayan kellen began if he couldnt get some straight answers out of jermayan soon he was fairly sure he was going to start shouting not now ancaladar said the dragon tilted his wings diving back into the storm and speech became impossible in the maelstrom of their descent kellen was working the saddlestraps before ancaladar had quite settled the dragon had landed in a clearing barely big enough to accommodate hima neat piece of flying with the winds as strong as they were kellen slid down the dragons icecovered ribs into a drift of snow shalkan he shouted that way ancaladar extended his neck in the direction kellen needed to go hurry kellen ran he came upon it all at once a scene so hideous that at first his mind refused to admit what it saw and then when he realized what he was seeing kellen staggered back against a tree bile rising in his throat dead unicorns there were too many to count they had been laid in the snow in rows neatly as the elves set their own dead freshremoved from the battlefield their bodies were rapidly being covered by the falling snow covering the hideous wounds the shattered horns dead they looked so small kellen come shalkan appeared in front of him blocking his view of the dead and rousing him from his horrified daze the unicorn was glowing just as he had on the night kellen had first seen him kellen reached out his gauntlet blindly and closed it over shalkans mane letting the unicorn lead him away shadowed elves did this kellen said a few moments later it wasnt a question the females from the caverns attacked led by the males that escaped athans call the females had all borne young it made things difficult now shalkan stopped and looked at kellen many of us are hurt i am taking you to where the healers are caring for usbut as you know only a particular sort of healer can be of use to us a virgin kellen said a chaste virgin fortunately there are a few of those around shalkan said with a ghost of his usual dry humor so you will see blood and wounds in plenty but nothing the healers cannot handle and the knights may go to the wildmages of courseas soon as the rest of them manage to here i dont say the blizzard wasnt necessary but it causes problems the knights can go to the wildmages but the unicorns cant because i cant be kellen began embarrassed and outraged you are shalkan said inexorably the only wildmage who can touch us you have seen a unicorn healed if you can heal gesade she will live gesade idaliajermayan kellen said desperately cannot approach her it would kill her shalkan said she is very badly hurt you are her only hope i cant do this i need tools kellen said shutting away his fear and someone to share the price both are waiting shalkan said he hesitated for a moment theres something else you probably need to know petariel is dead kellen took a deep breath hed shared his morning meal with petariel theyd joked together about petariel going off to a dull day of guarding something nobody was going to attack and now he would never speak to petariel again he knew somewhere in the back of his mind that eventually he would weep now though all he could feel was a terrible emptiness though it was not as terrible as the emptiness that would move within gesade shalkan began to move forward once more as quickly as the deep snow would allow does she know kellen asked we arent sure shalkan said a few moments later they arrived at the clearing where the wounded unicorns were being tended it had been hastily enclosed with awnings of heavy silk canvas hung between the trees and overhead and the ground was covered with sleeping mats cloaks and even carpets several heavy braziers heated the air kellen and shalkan stepped inside here the air was moist and filled with smells some familiar to kellen some not the cinnamon scent of unicorns the oddlysweet scent of elven blood the rank scent of shadowed elf blood and faintlythe acrid scent of the poison they used on their weapons the cloying smell of burn ointment and the flowery scent of nights daughter the herb that jermayan had used so liberally on kellens burns to numb the pain he could never smell it without remembering that long torturous journey back from the black cairn and ever since then the scent recalled unpleasant memories he knew everyone here but he didnt dare stop didnt dare let himself see any of them not now he had to think of only one thing right now gesade she was at the far end of the tent lying on her side the overpowering reek of nights daughter nearly made him gag she smelled as if theyd bathed her in it her fore and hind legs were tied together trigwenior and ansansoniel knelt before her holding them gently and menerchel sat on her shoulders even though she had been heavily dosed with a sleeping cordialkellen could smell it from where he stoodshe was thrashing weakly trying to get to her feet the three of them spoke to her soothingly trying to calm her but she was beyond hearing her entire head and most of her neck were completely swathed in salvesoaked cloths there was an airhole at the end through which he could hear her whistling gasps for breath her agonized whimperings but they sounded wrong menerchel looked up as kellen approached his face was streaked with tears he said nothing there was nothing to say kellen moved behind him kneeling at gesades back as close to her as he could get he pulled off his helmet and gloves what he needed was already laid out hush gesade hush he said speaking to her as if she were deyishene or lily its kellen ive come to help just lie quietly if you can ill help you i promise he didnt know if she heard he cut a few strands of his hair and a few from the base of gesades mane below the ointmentsoaked cloths then he reached for the bandage at her neck already otherselven knights unicorns even one or two of the healerswere gathering around to share the price just as shalkan had promised but shalkan was nowhere in sight nodont menerchel begged seeing what kellen was doing i need her blood for the spell kellen said gently and i need to know how shes hurt acid menerchel said starkly they threw acid in her face kellen closed his eyes for an instant fighting back the images menerchels words evoked acid was a favored weapon of the shadowed elves hed seen the wounds they caused armor was no defenseacid ate metal slipped through every crack and the unicorns went into battle only lightly armored kellen peeled back the edge of the bandage exposing raw burned flesh slick with numbing ointment gritting his teeth he wiped a small patch of skin clear blood beaded to the surface he soaked the hairshis and hers togetherthen quickly replaced the bandages he picked up the knifea small healers knife wickedly sharpto cut himself then realized hed almost forgotten to ask the vital question no wildmage could ever assume that help would be offered it must always be asked for who will share the price of this healing with me we willall of us menerchel said kellen looked up at those waiting making sure that all agreed then he cut his hand mingling his blood with gesades quickly now he summoned the brazier alight and added the proper leaves willow ash yew a thin coil of blue smoke began to spiral upward leaf and star let this work he motioned for menerchel and the others to move backgesades struggles were weaker nowand gently dropped the knot of bloody hairs onto the coals then he laid his hands on gesades exposed neck and shoulder she quieted at last beneath his touch and for a terrible instant kellen thought she was dead until he saw the slow steady rise of her ribs the peace that filled her gave him a moment of calm as well when he saw the shimmering dome of protection form around them all he felt a spark of hope the gods of the wild magic had heard forgive forgive and forget the words filled his mind and kellen knew that this was the price they set upon gesades healingand that it was twice now that the wild magic had commanded him to forgive his previous mageprice was still unpaid but that wouldnt matter idalia had told him that prices could run unpaid for years all that mattered was that you paid them willingly when the time came he did know that you knew when the time had come to pay a mageprice although figuring out how to pay it was left up to the individual but none of that was important now he would have accepted the price if it had been far higher i will he promised the sense of listening departed all that was left was the work of healing it was the hardest yet as if he tried to lift the weight of the earth itself from beneath his feet again and again he struggled to become a conduit for the healing magic feeling as if he tried to touch something just out of reach and every moment he struggled he felt gesade growing weaker dont try be master belesharon said that in the practice circle only when you could step aside from your thoughts of what you should be doing and do the thing itself was the thing accomplished he stopped trying he thought of gesade whole he remembered her looking down at him in the snow the night hed tried to escape from camp to scout the nearer cavern he remembered heryes and petarielrunning at the head of the unicorn knights on a day that was bright and clear powdery snow had sprayed up from beneath her hooves as she ran and the sunlight had sparkled off their armor he realized he was lying curled around her body his face pressed against her stomach breathing in her warm scent it was an awkward position and kellen straightened with a stifled groan he didnt remember moving or closing his eyes he blinked he felt as if hed been asleep though he was sure he hadnt the protective shield was gone so whatever was going to happen had happened he felt hollow and lightheaded but that was normal after a healing for healer and healed alike you glowed menerchel said that was encouraging kellen decided but he was still reluctant to lift the bandages and see what lay beneath at least gesade was sleeping now not writhing in heavilydrugged agony he lifted the lower edge of the bandage again white fur thickly soaked in ointment but there was no trace of burn or scar eagerly now kellen lifted away the rest of the clothsthey had not truly bandaged her only wrapped soft cloths loosely over the terrible burns the flesh beneath was perfect whole then he reached her head it took him a few seconds to understand why what he was seeing looked so wrong her horn was unblemished her soft muzzle was whole but her eyelid was sunken into its socket frantically kellen lifted her head the other side matched exactly the eyelid sunken over an empty socket she had no eyes shalkan found him several hundred yards from the unicorns clearing he was kneeling beside a tree gagging up what felt like every meal hed ever eaten in his life kellen go away he couldnt bear to see anyone right now especially shalkan not after what hed done kellen i hurt her i blinded her how could a healing have gone so wrong was it because hed come here straight from the caverns what had he done to her it was all his fault i saw her before the healers got to her shalkans voice came to him harsh and rasping as if the unicorn had been weeping until his throat was raw you didnt she was already blind shall i tell you what a bucket of acid in the face does to a personor a unicorn i could describe it in great detail if youd like shalkans words were cruel but they penetrated kellens own grief and horror stop it kellen said wearily i already know ive seen it too he sat back scrubbing his face with snow but i healed her or i could have if id been good enough and that was what was so horrible he hadnt been good enough not nearly good enough and he had been her only hope no an elven healer kellen didnt know came and knelt in the snow beside him i am no wildmage but i have aided them in their healings and i have heard them speak among themselves the power of the wild magic to heal is indeed great but it cannot create that which is not there that which willor mightgrow with time will grow at a wildmages touch but that which is lost is lost forever the healer took his shoulder in one hand and shook it look at me kellen knightmage see the truth in me kellen studied the healers face she regarded him with grave compassion and faint puzzlement as if she had never seen anything like him before kellen knew without having to ask that she was from ysterialpoerin shes right the storm of rage and griefand guiltthat had filled him a moment before was gone leaving only aching numbness it isnt fair he thought wearily would gesade want to live without sight but thats her decision to make isnt it today youve given her the power to make her own choices again now if youll accept the lady arquelles word that you did all you could do perhaps youll be sensible come inside and rest shalkan said crossly his voice still sounding hoarse or perhaps youd like to give the healers even more to do no kellen said getting stiffly to his feet his bare hands were numb and aching with cold im coming he felt battered both physically and emotionally and he wasnt quite sure whether shalkan was really angry with him or simply knew that the last thing kellen could take right now was his sympathy no one rejoices to see the starbegotten in pain arquelle said softly as kellen walked back through the snow it has overset stronger hearts than yours kellen knightmage and that perhaps was the truest thing he had heard in a day of terrible truths cilarnen wirance and the small party of centaurs traveled west and north as luermai had promised each time their supplies began to dwindle nemermet led them to a fresh cachetea salt charcoal grain honey spices and the blocks of compressed rations that nemermet simply called journeyfood it never seemed to stop snowing he ought to be used to it by now cilarnen told himself hed never seen snow actually falling before this winterthe little snow allowed to alight within the city walls came at night and certainly wasnt allowed to fall where it would inconvenience anyonebut this journey seemed determined to repair the lack of every day of those eighteen winters snow in addition to being cold painful inconvenient and sometimes actively dangerous cilarnen decided was boring but there was nothing else to look at there was snow with trees and snow without trees there were cloudy days when it snowed and fewer cloudy days when it didnt snow and very infrequently clear days when you had a dazzling vista of snow kardus who was the only one of them who had traveled in elven lands before said that the snow was unusually heavy this year nemermet had no comment to make on thisbut then as cilarnen had quickly discovered their guide apparently had no desire to engage in conversation with them at all his only interest seemed to be to hurry them along as quickly as possible pushing them to the limits of their endurance every day after the first sennight it became obvious that tinsin was slowing the partys pace the draft mare obeyed cilarnens orders willingly but no amount of willingness could make her as fast as a mule or a centaurlet alone as fast as nemermets icegrey stallion she was meant for plowing fields and pulling wagons not gallivanting crosscountry the next time they stopped at one of the trail huts for supplies there was a mule waiting there the mule was obviously of elven breeding it looked very much like the one hyandur had loaned him it was a russet color with a cream mane belly and tailtuft and quite elegant for a mule in the morning you will take oakleaf nemermet said as he unsaddled his mount speaking directly to cilarnen for the first time leave tinsin here no cilarnen said surprising himself im responsible for her i wont abandon her what will she eat a hundred dangers ran through his mind what if there are wolves or bears orsomething he ended lamely nemermet regarded him expressionlessly she will be cared for his task finished he began to turn away that isnt good enough cilarnen said all his anger and frustration at days of following orders he didnt quite understand came boiling to the surface but he did his best to keep his voice low and even sarlin of stonehearth gave tinsin to me i promised id bring her back safe everyone says were not supposed to ask you questions if you dont want me to ask you questions then give me answers for a moment he didnt think nemermet would answer him then the elf seemed to reach a decision tomorrow when we are gone a rider will come he will take her to winter with our own stock cared for as if she were our own in the spring we will see her to stonehearth if you cannot nemermet turned away indicating the conversation was finished i will say this for you boyyouve got more courage than sense comild said coming up to him cilarnen leaned his head against tinsins shoulder i just dont like being pushed around elves oror high mages i dont like being pushed around had he really hated life in armethalieh that much no hed loved living there and the thought that he could never go back hurt so much that he didnt dare think about it but mageborn keeping secretssaying things were for the good of the city when that was a lieplotting against the city and moving other mageborn around as if they had no more worth than pieces on a shamat board no cilarnen didnt like that at all if they will do that to their fellow mageborn they will do that to anyone citizens the delfier valley farmers the mountain traders the selkens the wildlanderslike sarlin and comild and kardus and he wasnt sure anyone could stop them not if what the demon had told him at stonehearth was true he sighed and began the awkward business of removing tinsins saddle and bridle once cilarnen had been remounted their journey went faster and in another sennight they began to see faint signs that anothermuch largerparty was traveling in the same direction now nemermets insistent haste began to make sense luermai had said that others preceded them and nemermet was obviously trying to catch up with the other party by now they were well into the mountainskardus said that beyond this lay high plains but further than that into the elven lands he had not been though cilarnen missed tinsinand despite karduss assurances wasnt entirely certain he trusted nemermets word that shed be cared for and returned to stonehearthhe had to admit that oakleaf was much easier and more comfortable to ride and the elvenbred mule was certainly bettersuited to the terrain they had to cross in the middle of their third sennight of travel they finally caught sight of the other centaurs theyd crossed the last of the mountain passes and were starting down into the valley look comild said pointing cilarnen peered through the falling snow dimly he could make out a blot of darkness in the distance moving slowly over the plain below there are your fellows nemermet said you will join them tomorrow if we hurry now they lost sight of the centaur army when they reached the plainthe rest of the levies would have crossed the elven border together cilarnen realized comilds people had been delayed by the demon attack upon stonehearthbut they were only half a day behind them now and the wide deep track the others had made with their passage made travel for comilds party both easy and fast they pressed on that day until well beyond their usual stopping time until wirance finally called a halt its as dark as the inside of a goats stomach now the wildmage said bluntly and im not minded to spend tomorrow healing the fool that lames himself on the ice tonight well stop here you may be able to see in the dark my elven friend but we cant and neither can these poor mules reluctantly the others agreed there were no sheltering trees on the high plains but by now all of them carried pieces of heavy canvas designed to be joined together by collapsible hollow tubesa gift of the elves left for them at one of the trail huts many days ago each piece alone could serve as a windbreak when they were all joined together they formed a shelter large enough for humans and centaurs both to take refuge together from the worst of the storms assembling it was a tricky matter however and something theyd never done in the dark cilarnen hadnt worked any high magick since nemermet had joined themeven so simple a thing as lighting a fire he wasnt sure why he didnt think nemermet would try to throw him out of the elven lands just for being a high mage but there was no longer any point in wondering they needed light and magelight was a simple spell one that every studentapprentice knew he concentrated the ball of blue light grew between his hands when it was as large as he wanted he spread his hands it hovered above them a small full moon youre full of tricks wirance said approvingly he swung down from his mules back and began to unpack his piece of the shelter cilarnen dismounted as well the sooner the shelter was assembled the sooner they could begin to get warm he thought longingly of teathough the hot water nemermet called tea was a poor substitute for the real thing you did not name yourself a wildmage when you stood upon the border if nemermets voice held any expression at all cilarnen would have said it sounded faintly accusing but of course it didnt he wasnt entirely sure elves had emotions im not a wildmage cilarnen said struggling to match nemermets even tone im a mage of armethalieh armethalieh now there was emotion in nemermets voice surprise and contempt kardus stepped forward placing his body between cilarnen and nemermet he was banished as was kellen wildmage the centaur said and there was warning in his tone he has lived for a season among the centaurs of stonehearth and fought valiantly in their defense and it is my task to bring him to kellen wildmage then do so nemermet said briefly his tone gone flat and turned to help the others erect the shelter in the glow of the magelight cilarnen stared at kardus in shock hyandur had known he was from armethalieh and had helped him escape the centaurs had known where he came fromand theyd pitied him for it he now realized ruefully he hadnt expected this reaction armethalieh too had a treaty with the elves kardus said quietly but they have not honored it to help the elves cilarnen wasnt quite certain hed heard the centaur wildmage correctly like the centaurs to send troops even after all that had happened to him in the last few moonturns cilarnen found that an impossible concept to quite imagine high magesand citizensleave the city yes but they would not even allow andoreniels envoy to warn them a dozen disparate pieces of information came together in his mind all in a rush hyandur he was the one who came to warn the high council wasnt he they didnt let him in he paused and added wonderingly he saved my life when the city denied himhe still saved my life and so you see that the elves can be kind remember that there were times when kardus sounded just like his old tutor master tocsel cilarnen thought ruefully though certainly master tocsel would never have had a good word to say about the elvenkind he turned to help assemble the shelter chapter twentythree journeys end calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink much later crowded in among the centaurscramped but warmcilarnen found himself lying awake his mind was filled with questions but of them all only one was really important if elves were like humans or centaurs with individual likes and dislikes well and good but if armethalieh actually had somehow had a treaty with the elven king and had broken it how likely was it that the elves would help armethalieh now and if kellen tavadon was living among the elves which side would he take humanor elven as nemermet had promised they caught up to the main body of the centaurs the next day a few hours after they broke camp that morning another elfthis one on a bay mare wearing beautifully fitted armor enameled in a rosy hue several shades lighter than her coatcame galloping back to them i see you nemermet the mares rider said he was wearing armor as well though it hardly looked to cilarnen as if it would be of any use in a battle it matched the mares exactly and like the mares looked more like jewelry than armor i see you linyesin nemermet said bowing slightly here are the stragglers from stonehearth comild and his levy and the wildmage wirance who accompanies them i also present to you the centaur wildmage kardus whose mageprice is to bring the banished high mage cilarnen before kellen knightmage linyesin lifted a horn from his saddle and blew a few notes after a moment cilarnen heard an answering echo of that horncall in the distance andoreniel thanks you for your care of them and asks that you aid the others in helping the herdingfolk across our eastern border safely linyesin said i go with pleasure nemermet said without a word to the others he turned his stallion around and headed back the way hed come come linyesin said to them your comrades await you we are grateful for your strength and are eager to hear your news not much to tell comild said gruffly as they followed linyesin toward the other centaurs one of them came down on us at stonehearth our losses were heavyours and the villagers both but the wildmages killed itthem and cilarnen there was a pause but though cilarnen was expecting a sudden barrage of questions from linyesin it didnt come that is welcome and interesting information the armored elf said at last it nearly outweighs the discouraging news that one of them has been seen east of the elven lands that is puzzling news indeed but perhaps you will have told luermai or nemermet more of your tale than you have told me no wirance said simply as for why it came we are not sure cilarnen hesitated he didnt want to deliver the whole of the message he had for kellen to this strangeronly kardus and wirance knew that the demon had spoken to him or what it had saidespecially considering how the elves seemed to feel about armethalieh but it couldnt hurt to fill in a few of the details it saw me he put in hoping he didnt sound as ineffectual as he felt i dont know why it was there either but at first it thought i was kellen tavadon it looked like a human and it spoke to me telling me i couldnt go back toto armethalieh when it realized i wasnt him it attacked me i fended it off and it decided to destroy the village first before coming back to kill me he stopped wondering if hed said the wrong thing linyesin was staring at him intently it would be good to knowand it would please me greatly the elf said if you would say further how you fended off the attack of one of them and survived it was mageshield cilarnen said thinking back he wasnt sure his shield had been all that effective it was more as if the demon seeing he was a mage had simply decided to kill him last it must have meant to take you captive when it discovered that you were a mage linyesin said echoing cilarnens thoughts or to take a very long time over your death fortunate indeed that matters occurred otherwise cilarnen shivered from all hed seen at stonehearth fortunate was an understatement by now they were within sight of the centaurs there were a couple of hundred of them and with them were more mountainfolk and several more elves all in armor each suit of armor was a different color they looked like a handful of spring flowers somehow transported to the midst of winter and there were supply carts like the one cilarnen had seen just inside the elven border but these were much larger drawn by six draft mules instead of by a pair of horses he wondered how theyd gotten them over the passes comild gave a grunt of satisfaction at the sight of the carts decent meals at last linyesin laughed cilarnen would hardly have been less surprised if the elf had dismounted from his mare and turned cartwheels in the snow oh yes comild proper food nemermet brought you to join us as fast as he could and the food the scouts travel on can be lessthansatisfying but we dont mean to starve you before we reach ysterialpoerin he would hardly have called it luxury a moonturn before but fresh meat pancakes hot cider and a warm place to sleepeven if it was a tent he shared with three of the mountainfolkmade cilarnen feel more confident than he had since hed left stonehearth the centaurs had been eager to exchange news as they marched and apparently their new guideselven knightswere freer with information than any of the elves comilds party had dealt with up till now in the few hours cilarnen had ridden with the army he and kardus had learned more about what was going on than they had in all their time riding with nemermet all nemermet had told them was that their eventual destination was a place called ysterialpoerin now they knew that weather permitting they would reach it in two sennights three at the mostassuming nothing attacked them along the way and attack was possible at any moment though so far theyd been lucky another reason nemermet had hurried them along so swiftly the elven lands were already under assault not by the demons directlyapparently they couldnt come herebut it seemed that they had found a way to slip their creatures past the landwards the centaurs had been warned to be on the watch for a kind of wolf the size of a pony bats as large as small ships and apparently worst of all things called shadowed elves which had to be destroyed at all costs though nobody said anything directly cilarnen got the impression that the demons meant to destroy the elves and the elven lands first these demonsnobody called them anything but themwere nothing like the armethaliehan nurserytales hed been terrified by as a child he managed to figure that out though nobody wanted to talk about them much cilarnen doubted that the centaurs hed talked to knew much more than theyd said and he wasnt quite ready to try questioning any of the elves he suspected that kardus knew more but the centaur wildmage would not answer any of his questions this is neither the time nor the place was all kardus would say wait for better remembering the sight of the demon at stonehearth cilarnen reluctantly decided to take his advice they were two days away from ysterialpoerin when the blizzard struck the wildmages traveling with the army had been warning of truly bad weather to comein a day perhaps two cilarnen knew that linyesin was hoping that they would at least reach the edge of the forest before it began so that they would have some shelter and protection from the storm the centaurs had rejoiced when the wildmages told them that weather magic had been done by the wildmages with the elven army pushing back the storm and giving them an extra days grace but then the storm struck without warning and far too early it was an hour or two past noon cilarnen was riding beside kardus near the supply carts when suddenly he heard the horns begin to blow what is it are we being attacked he demanded in alarm no kardus said puzzled its the signal to make camp suddenly the temperature dropped sharply and the sky turned black cilarnen looked up alarmed the sky was boiling there was no other way to describe it he heard a rumble and a sudden crash of thunder and saw lightning flash across the sky a wall of windfierce enough to make kardus staggercame howling down out of the north oakleaf began to sidle and balk as thunder boomed again and heavy wet flakes of snow began to sheet down out of the nowblack sky belatedly cilarnen realized what the horns had meant the promised blizzard had come now and if they all didnt get under cover they were going to freeze he swung down off oakleafs back the mule fussed and balked but cilarnen managed to lead him over to the wagon and tie him fast they formed the supply carts into a windbreak and fought to get the shelters up for without shelter they would freeze and quickly but it was useless the wind was too strong it was the mountainfolk who realized what must be done to save them they emptied the supply carts flinging the contents haphazardly into the snow as the elves struggled to unhitch the mules so that they could be brought to shelter so great was the force of the wind that the wagons contents blew everywhere already snow was mounded against the windward side of the wagons and no one could see more than a few feet in any direction every coil of rope they found the mountainfolk passed to the centaurs who used it to link themselves together so that none would be lost in the blinding snow cilarnen found himself unceremoniously liftedhe didnt see by whom and tossed into one of the nowempty carts he landed hard and immediately tried to scramble back out again stop that boy do you want to freeze ive never seen a storm come up this fastnot even a called one an unfamiliar voice said out of the darkness it was one of the mountainfolk others crowded in quickly and then pulled the tarp closed over the end of the wagon but kardus cilarnen said the wagon shuddered with the force of the wind your centaurfriend is warm and safe in the middle of the herd the stranger said which is more than you or i would be out there just now theyre hardy folk have patience the worst of this should blow itself out in a day or two and we can be on our way and then i admit id like to have a word or two with whoever called this blizzard called cilarnen said blankly of course the stranger said calmly you dont think this came naturally do you this weather was supposed to come tomorrow or the day afterand not a storm this hard either a wildmage called this up and id like to know why as the wind howled around them and cilarnen buried his head under the shelter of his cold arms he decided that he wanted to know why too very badly indeed i need to get back kellen mumbled aloud he was exhausted from the healing but he thought he might as well rest back at the cavern as here where he was supposed to be right now anyway youre exhausted shalkan told him not unkindly as kellen sat at the front of the unicorns tent wrapped in blankets and drinking a cup of soup someone had brought him youre not thinking clearly if you insist on going tonight wait for ancaladar to get back a horse wont be able to make it even as far as the main camp in this weatherand dont make eyes at me even if i were willing to take youand im needed hereyoud freeze by the time i could get you there he knew shalkan was rightthe snow was coming down even heavier than before if that was possible and in full darkness even a unicorn might get lost and getting back to the cavern camp wasnt really an emergency why is it snowing kellen finally thought to ask the weather wasnt supposed to turn so soon the shadowed elves tried to burn the forest jermayan is pretty sure they used the everburning metal you stopped them from using before he had to bring the storm to stop the fires from spreading kindolhinadetils foresters are out looking for the pieces now perhaps they will be able to save the individual trees that were set afire but whether they can or not the forest itself is safe i should go and help kellen said groggily trying to get to his feet you should stay where you are and drink your soup shalkan said firmly lowering his horn meaningfully i will wake you when ancaladar returns kellen had no intention of falling asleepespecially here not when there was so much to do but shalkan was right he needed a little more strength and he could get that from the soup it wouldnt hurt anything or anyone just to sit there until he finished it shalkan woke him a few hours later come on he said prodding kellen with his horn it was the prod of the horn rather than shalkans voice that stirred him out of an unrestful sleep kellen was glad to be awakened he was as groggy as if he hadnt slept at all his dreams had been unsettled filled with shadowy menace and battles hed woken with the same feeling he had alltoofrequently these days that time was running out that while they spent their energy on inessentials shadow mountain was winning the larger war he got unsteadily to his feet and staggered after shalkan into the thighhigh snow pulling his heavy cloak tightly about him the snow was still falling heavily and steadily there was a narrow trench where others had walked but even that was filling quickly and the snow showed no sign at all of stopping if the wind kept up like this theyd have snow dunes up to a dragons eye before long ancaladar and jermayan were waiting for kellen in the same clearing as before balls of coldfire hung in the trees illuminating the blowing snow and very little else the forest is secure jermayan said raising his voice to be heard over the sound of the wind the foresters have found every ring of the shadowed elf metal good shalkan said shaking to rid himself of the snow that clung to his fur and kellen has done what he came here to do so you may take him back to the cavernsas he insists the cold had woken him thoroughly at last which was a mixed blessing kellen clambered up onto ancaladars back slipping on the dragons icecovered side he wondered if ancaladar even noticed the cold he wished he didnt jermayan seated himself in the forward saddle with a great deal more grace and pulled the riding straps tight but they didnt take off at once instead ancaladar trotted quickly through the trees to kellens initial puzzlement at last he figured out the reason of course he cant just jump into the air he may be able to land straight down but in this wind he needs more room than there is here to get into the sky kellen made sure his own riding straps were tight having experienced several of ancaladars takeoffs he had no desire to fall off especially in this weather and at night soon they reached an area where there were fewer trees and ancaladar spread his wings springing into the wind the force of the storm spun him like a kite and he used its power to pull him into the sky rising in a tight swooping spiral it seemed to snow harder the higher they went until suddenly the snow was gone and darkness was replaced by light the brilliance of the moon and the stars beneath them the clouds looked like the snowcovered landscape we have paid a heavy price for victory this day jermayan said quietly as ancaladar leveled off petariel gesade so many of those kellen had ridden with fought beside dead or terribly wounded in these last battles and how long until idalia vestakia jermayan and ancaladar were added to the list everyone he knew everyone he loved yes kellen said tightly the last thing jermayan needed was a display of emotion when he himself must be feeling worse than kellen he must have known his friends and fellow knights fora century at least these were elves who should have been spending the next several centuries contemplating their gardens practicing their arts making beautiful things and perfecting themselves and nownow they were gone we must take what comfort we can in having won jermayan said somberly for the consequences of defeat are too great to bear but are we winning jermayan kellen looked at his friends back heard the weariness and neardespair in his voice and did not ask his question aloud the following day kellen vestakia and keirasti met with adaerion to discuss the best way of ridding the caverns of duergar by now both their units had been brought up to full strength again as redhelwar reconfigured the hardhit skirmishing units and formed new ones the blizzard still hammered the land the pavilions of the cavern camp were all halfburied in snow and ropes had been strung between them to allow people to find their way between them without that there was every chance of becoming lost even in the few feet that separated one pavilion and the next kindolhinadetil has opened the archives at ysterialpoerin to redhelwar so we now know something more than we did of the habits of duergar they are not accustomed to luring many victims at one time so if you approach them in force at least some of you should be safe from their call and able to attack them while the others are held in thrall adaerion said but our light will drive them into hiding as it did the last time we entered the caverns keirasti said you will not have light adaerion said the wildmages have worked upon this problem since we understood we would have to hunt duergar they have crafted darksight hoodsenough for both your troops they will not render you invisible as tarnkappa would for we now know that would be useless but you will be able to see your prey and approach him in darkness and artenels artificers have made you spears and nets which will be of more use against these creatures than your swords so we can hunt them keirasti said with grim satisfaction but it would be pleasant indeed to hear how we will find them the crystal spiders will tell us kellen said theyre as eager as we are to free their home of what they call dark ones they said they would give us aid if we go into the cavernspast the village caverni think theyll come out and speak with us all that remains is getting there keirasti said she glanced at the doorway of adaerions pavilion and winced faintly as the wind shook the fabric vigorously we might as well move into the caverns until weve cleared them kellen said reluctantly although the last thing he wanted to do was to move underground the big chamber near the entrance would do for a base camp if we light up enough of the cavernsi can cast coldfire on the walls or jermayan or one of the other wildmages canwell be safe from the duergar and we wont have to keep coming back and forth through the snow the camp was a mile away from the cavern mouthclose enough in ordinary winter weather but not something he wanted to ride through twice a day in a storm and it would be warmer underground as well so much of their energy was being wasted in keeping warm that everyone was exhausted a reasonable suggestion adaerion said with equal reluctance will the crystal spiders be able to tell you when the caverns are empty vestakia asked speaking up for the first time im not sure kellen admitted theyre not very much like anything weve ever seen before though theyre not tainted so when they say the caverns are empty thats when id like you to check and see what you feel nothing i hope vestakia said but you did say they could talk to each other didnt you that the one lot in the trapped caverns talked to the ones here kellen nodded frowning faintly in puzzlement wondering what she was thinking well vestakia said once the cavern is clear maybe someone should find out just how far away they can talk to each other because the weathers getting so bad nowif these storms keep upthat jermayan and ancaladar and i wont be able to fly to search for the next shadowed elf cave but if there are crystal spiders living in all the caves in the elven lands and they know everything that goes on in their caves and they all talk to each other maybe they can tell you where the next cave you need to go to is everyone stared at her it was such a simple practical obvious solution that none of them had thought of it and it would save them an enormous amount of timeand danger to vestakia if it worked that is an excellent notion lady vestakia adaerion said with grave enthusiasm it is certainly something we must try once the caverns are safe to enter kellen felt a sense of relief not so much at the thought that vestakia wouldnt be in constant dangerthough that thought was never far from his mindbut at the thought that if her plan worked she would no longer be completely irreplaceable well kellen said once weve gotten rid of the duergar and you tell us the caves are clear ill introduce you to a bunch of giant glowing spiders and you can ask them yourself how would you like that vestakia grinned at him better than flying around for sennights freezing my feet off to tell the truth and spiders certainly wont care a bit what i look like so we wont have to persuade them that im not tainted kellen and keirasti moved their troops into the caverns when the blizzard blew itself out they barely noticedtheir days had settled into a wearying hideous routine as they searched the caverns hunting duergars with the darksight hoods the wildmages had made for them they could approach their prey in darkness and still see and hear one another and the crystal spiders kept their promise letting them know where to hunt the creatures had approached them eagerly as soon as they had ventured past the nowempty shadowed elf village remembering what idalia had done as soon as he saw them approach kellen pulled off his gauntlet and held out his bare hand the enormous spiders had climbed over him eagerly until he was covered in them though they looked as insubstantial as thistledown the whole swarm of them was surprisingly heavy one of them walked out on his arm and settled its body in his palm you return he heard the voice in his mind it tickled faintly now we can help you hunt the black minds we know where they are show me kellen thought pictures appeared in his mindparts of the cave system he hadnt seen yet they were blurred impossible to decipher the crystal spiders must have sensed his bewilderment for the pictures ceased we will take younear and then you will know know how kellen thought in bewilderment you will know the voice in his head repeated the carpet of spiders ebbed from his body and the crystal spiders began to scuttle away with surprising speed we follow them kellen said to the others soon enough he understood what the crystal spiders had meant after they had followed the spiders for a whilebeing careful to mark their trail at intervals in order to find their way backtwo of their party simply dropped their weapons and began walking forward rhufai reyezeyt said sharply janshil let them go kellen said quietly theyll lead us right to where we need to go the first kill was easy though the duergar held ten of them spellbound at the end it didnt seem to understand that it was still vulnerable the others rushed forward confusing it and kellen and keirasti spitted the duergar on their long wooden spears in death it dissolved instantly filling the cavern with the same gagging sweetsick stench kellen remembered from his first duergar kill it was the last time their hunts were to be this easy the duergar seemed somehow to be able to silently communicate with one another once kellen and the elven knights had killed the first one the others seemed to understand there was a need to hide and if they could not hide attack watch him watch him kellen shouted his voice echoed eerily in the vastness of the cavern a dozen of the elves stood like sleepwalkers the duergar was backed into a small alcove just off a larger chamber deep within the mountain it crouched and snarled revealing a mouth filled with formidable teeth then it sprang at the entranced elves keirasti barely blocked its rush toward the helpless ones sweeping it back toward the alcove with the shaft of her heavy spear then she too dropped the spear sinking to her knees in a daze the weapon clattered to the ground as she fell beneath the duergars spell some of the first victims were rousing now as the creature turned its powers on other prey kellen rushing forward to attack found his way blocked by seheimith and nironoshan he thrust them aside but by then the duergar had released them and claimed others seeing its way blocked only by those who were powerless to hinder it the duergar bounded forward away from kellen and toward the freedom of the deep caves kellen hefted his spear and threw it did not go in as deeply as he hoped but it broke the monsters concentration the elves carrying the net rushed forward flinging the net over the creature and trapping it seconds later it was dead not as bad as it could have been kellen said relieved at least this time no one died keirasti said tightly when one of the creatures had bitten tildarilone of her commandthere had been no time for kellen to even try to heal him tildaril had died in seconds screaming in agony as armor and flesh had boiled away from the bite like smoke they left the net and spears where they were they were useless now that theyd come into contact with duergar blood lets find the next one kellen said as hed expected the crystal spiders appeared almost immediately once the duergar had begun to hide the crystal spiders had needed to lead kellen and the elven knights closer each time kellen knelt down and removed his gauntlets as they had each time before the crystal spiders swarmed over him nestling into his outstretched hands the long furlike bristles that covered their bodies tickled his hands as if they were as much cats as spiders each time they touched his mind the contact became easier though kellen always had the impression that he baffled them as much as they confused him if vestakia went ahead with her plan and tried to get complicated detailed information from the crystal spiders she wasnt going to have an easy time of it dead webs eggs babies all safe now came the voice in his mind you need to show us where the next one is kellen thought back forming the silent words carefully all safe now all safe kellen sighed mentally and tried again the crystal spiders werent stupid they were just alien where is the next black mind that we need to kill there was a pause he felt a riffling through his mind as he did whenever the creatures were trying especially hard to make him understand something there are no more not here not here kellen said aloud if the spiders made a distinction between here and not here maybe that meant they were able to sense the other caverns and the black minds there there are no more black minds in these caverns we have killed them all he thought back all dead all webs eggs babies all safe came the reply once more good kellen thought back thats good i want to bring a friend of mine to talk to youabout other black minds in other caverns will you talk to her he sensed confusion and uncertainty then a long pause as though the spiders were conferring among themselves or perhaps they were simply thinking in all the times hed talked with them kellen had never decided whether they were one groupmind or separate creatures she will kill black minds the spiders finally asked she helps us kill black minds kellen answered yes then we will speak with her the spiders answered thank you kellen thought at them as the mass of spiders flowed off his body and scurried away into the dark he got stiffly to his feetit was cold in the deep caves a constant damp chill that made his bones acheand looked at the others they say that one was the last he said good i am tired of sleeping in a cave keirasti said simply and i am tired of wearing a bag over my head now we can go back they gathered their remaining weapons and headed for the surface despite the warmth of the bodies packed around him cilarnen was cold though he knew he was lucky not to be freezing he was thirsty and as the bells passedhe still reckoned time by the standards of the city even if no one around him didhe began to be hungry as well how long were they going to be trapped here tarik had told himthe man had eventually introduced himselfthat the elves theyd been riding to meet would probably come looking for them soon cilarnen hoped so it would be a cruel jest on the part of the light if the people coming to aid the elves were slain not by the enemy but by a storm called by one of their own people in addition to everything else being packed in so closely with a bunch of wildmages was uncomfortable in a way cilarnen couldnt quite define like being forced to listen to an annoying sound or a ringing in your ears that went on and on and wouldnt stop but there was nothing to be done about those things and so he resigned himself to being miserable and he hopedif it came to the unthinkable worstthat at least kardus would survive and take his message to kellen as it happened tarik was quite right late the next day cilarnen was roused from an uncomfortable halfdoze by shouts and the violent shaking of the wagon the tarpaulin at the back was hauled away and light snow and fresh arctic air streamed into the cramped confines of the wagon ah tarik said with satisfaction rescue the others clambered out of the wagon and through the snowtunnel at the foot cilarnen simply sprawled where he was luxuriating in the absence of the wildmages it was as if someone had finally stopped banging on a sore tooth at the moment he didnt care if he stayed here and froze cilarnen come kardus was leaning into the wagon looking worried a rescue party has found us they will take us to their camp it will be a long cold journey and we must travel through the night but better that than to remain here for a moment cilarnen thought of telling kardus to go on without him that he was fine where he was but he realized that that was ridiculous hed freeze here and his message would go undelivered he had to go on for armethaliehs sake if nothing else everything hurt as he crawled across the floor of the wagon toward kardus the centaur lifted him down and carried him through the snow as if he were a child and cilarnen was too weak to protest it was still snowing heavily and the wagons were nearly buried the centaurs had dug down a large ring of firm ground for themselves and the mules and horses but outside it the snow was centaurshoulder height the snow was still blowing downnot as heavily as when the blizzard had first struck but it was impossible to see more than a few yards he could barely make out the forms of their rescuers blurred by the snow can you ride kardus asked yes he had no idea whether he could stay on oakleafs back or not but cilarnen knew he was going to try they left the wagons behind and the heaviest of their gear linyesin said that they could come back for it when the weather cleared cilarnen wondered when that would be spring from the others he learned that their rescuers were more of the socalled elven knights and a few more men of the high reaches the centaurs were already organizing themselves into marching order moving slowly along the path the rescue party had broken through the snowdrifts kardus handed him a wineskin drink thisall of it it will warm you and strengthen you for the journey cilarnen took the wineskin gratefully to his surprise it actually contained winenot the mead the centaurs preferredand it was hot wine besides he gulped it down quickly for once not caring about the taste and without wondering how it had been heated when he had finished kardus took the wineskin back stay with me this will be no pleasant journeybut far better than remaining here in the open several bells later cilarnen decided that kardus had a great gift for understatement the sun set but they did not stop all through the night they traveled at a plodding pace little better than a walk he had thought the journey thus far had been nearunendurable it had been a mild spring jaunt compared to this cilarnen hated to think of how long oakleaf had gone without proper care at least he understood why this was happening the poor mule didnt at dawn they stopped but only long enough to give the animals a little water and some broken cakes of journeyfood it was simple enough to melt a hole in the snow the edges turned instantly to ice and formed a natural watering troughas long as you could keep the water from freezing once cilarnen saw what the wildmages were doing he did it as well and allowed oakleaf and the mules that were being led along behind him to drink though he could usually summon fire without difficulty this time the effort left him giddy and breathless as though hed run for a long time without stopping he did his best to conceal his difficulty from kardus but he suspected the centaur wildmage noticed all the same but the rest was alltoobrief and soon they were on their way again they traveled faster with light to see by soon they were among the trees where the snow was not as deep and the wind did not cut so sharply the only drawback to that was that at intervals the overburdened boughs would bend and dump a load of thick wet snow on whoever was unfortunate enough to be beneath them at the time he supposed it would be a breathtaking sight assuming he could actually see it through the veils of snow hed read perulans pastoral talesalong with everyone else in the citywith their detailed descriptions of woodland groves and shady glens but perulan had been describing the tame forests of the delfier valley not something this wild the trees were taller than the masts of the selken ships larger than the pillars that lined the great temple of the light and those were just the ones he could see but even the forest could not distract him from his cold and exhaustion for long he had never been so tired and all he really wanted was to lie down in the snow to sleep forever but of course even he knew that was the last thing he could possibly do the sound of horns roused him and cilarnen realized hed been asleep in the saddleor near to it he jerked upright every frozen muscle protesting and looked around wildly certain they were being attacked the light was the dark blue of twilight and they had moved out of the shelter of the great trees were within sight of the camp kardus told him its nearly over cilarnen didnt remember the rest of the ride at all all he knew was that eventually someone lifted him down from oakleafs saddle and carried him into a place filled with light and warmth he roused enough to drink when a cup was held to his lips oakleaf he said and that was the last he knew for quite some time it was day when kellen and the others reached the surface againand snowing only lightly which was a pleasant change the air was drier and colder here than down in the caverns but fresh and kellen breathed deeply as he walked down the ramp kharren and a halfdozen knights were standing guard outside the cavern kellen greeted her with a careless wave i see you kharren the crystal spiders tell us the caverns are now free of duergar he said that makes good hearing kellen knightmage kharren responded i will send elatar for your horses adaerion has news for you but he will wish to give it himself soon kellen was following kharren into adaerions pavilion he wondered what the news was but if it had been anything truly urgentand badkharren would surely have delivered it herself i see you kellen adaerion said motioning for kellen to sit i see you adaerion kellen said bowing respectfully before he sat pircano poured tea for all three of them kellen sipped it gratefully tea had never seemed to get hot down in the caverns perhaps you will indulge me by letting me know how your work fared below adaerion said bad news first as you know we lost tildaril kellen said quietly now the good news but other than that we were lucky and sustained no real injuries the crystal spiders tell us that we have killed all the duergar now vestakia can go down and see if the caverns are indeed free of taint and the spiders have agreed to talk with her as well so that she can see whether they are truly able to communicate with others of their kind in other caves it might take her a while to find out anything useful though he added that work may have to wait adaerion said four days ago the centaurs who came at andoreniels summons reached our camp traveling with them was a high mage of armethalieh kellen stared at adaerion in disbelief a high mage here it would be interesting to know how it was that a high mage was permitted to cross the border into the elven lands he said after a long pause we did not know then that this is what he was he came in company with a wildmage whose price it was to bring him to you to me kellen echoed blankly heand the wildmagewere both quite certain of it adaerion said kindly there is more linyesinwho has heard some of the boys story but not he thinks allsays that he was living at stonehearth a centaur village when it was attacked by one of them fortunately there were wildmages there as well because some of the levy was mustering there and they managed to kill the creature with the high mages help the boy says that it mistook him for you and when it realized its mistake set out to destroy the village this doesnt make any sense kellen said puzzled high mages dont leave the city they just dont and the only business any high mage has with me is to finish what the council started he shook his head baffled but he killed a demon id certainly like to ask him how he managed that nevertheless kardus has his price to pay adaerion said and only kellen could help him pay it but a high mage consorting with a wildmage voluntarily i will see him kellen said reluctantly maybe he isnt a high mage he thought hopefully maybe hes lying hed thought he was done with armethalieh forever and the thought of having to confront itor one of its emissaries at leastunsettled him in a way that no battle could but i want to make sure the caverns are clear first kellen added only partly from a desire to put off the confrontation with this ghost from his past for as long as possible if hes waited this long certainly he can wait a while longer indeed adaerion said his voice conveying nothing of his thoughts and while you complete that task we shall begin dismantling this camp for its purpose is finished kellen collected isinwen and told him to ready idalias and vestakias horses his troop would accompany him back into the cavern to guard vestakia while a second troop waited outside to guard the entrance then he went looking for idalia and vestakia he found them in idalias tent playing xaqiueor rather idalia was playing xaqiue against herself while vestakia watched with interest moving the green pieces at idalias direction ah idalia said when kellen poked his head into the pavilion youre back and adaerions told you about our wandering mageborn oh come now brother dearwhat else could make you look like a faun dragged through a bramble bush backwards i want to know who he is and what he wants kellen said between gritted teeth the anger in his voice surprised him well his name is cilarnen and he wants you idalia said matteroffactly leaf and star know why i dont suppose you know him cilarnen volpiril kellen asked stunned no two living mageborn bore the same given name by the custom of the city and kellen knew of only one cilarnen well no one knows his family name he didnt give one idalia said you do know him vestakia said i thought you might why else would he be asking for you i was at school with him hazy memories surfaced of a time so long ago that the events that occurred then might have happened to someone else cilarnen had always been everything kellen wasntthe golden young mageborn whod excelled in all his studies and been the masters petted darling except for one day a few sennights before kellen was banished when for some reason master hendassar had chosen to humiliate cilarnen in front of the entire history of the city class hes no more a high mage thanthan i am kellen said indignantly but if he is cilarnen volpiril his fathers a member of the high council which makes it even odder that hes here idalia said her eyes narrowing and traveling with a wildmage dont forget kellen laughed bitterly id certainly like to know how that came about considering what the high mages think of the wild magic but the pampered little mageborn can certainly wait until were sure the caverns are clean the shadowed elves have surprised us enough times already i want to be sure our backtrail is safe this time and he wasnt at all averse to having cilarnen cool his heels it would do him good to discover he wasnt the most important creature in this universe kellen and pihrandet rode back to the caverns with their troops though no one expected troublethe caverns were supposed to be emptyboth idalia and vestakia wore armor vestakia her full suit of scarlet elven armor and idalia her heavy shirt of elven chain kellen found himself wishing that shalkan were here to talk to the news that cilarnen had come to ysterialpoerinand was claiming to be a high mage of armethaliehhad unsettled him more than hed thought possible why in the name of the gods of the wild magic had he come banished lord volpiril would never let that happen but then why resolutely kellen forced all questions and speculations from his mind he had to concentrate on the task ahead are you all right he asked vestakia as they reached the cavern mouth i dont feel anything she said her voice light with relief she swung down off her palfreypihrandet moved to assist her but her riding skills had improved greatly since the start of the campaign and she dismounted without helpand began to walk toward the cavern mouth wait kellen said dismounting from firareths back he paused to give the stallion a companionable pat then drew his sword and moved forward dont get yourself killed for overconfidence the others moved up and with vestakia and idalia in their midst moved back into the caverns once more they had lanterns with them of course but for the first part of the journey they didnt need them kellen had cast coldfire on the rocks and walls of the cavernit had been the surest way to keep the duergar from creeping up on them as they sleptand the walls glowed a faint pale blue the spell would wear off eventually but he saw no reason to dismiss it they went all the way down to the village cavern and vestakia felt nothing she looked at kellen and shook her head no if there were anything hereanything at all id feel it im sure of it kellen hesitated but vestakia and the crystal spiders both agreed that the caverns were empty of tainted creatures and he had to admit that his hesitation stemmed from the fact that once they went back hed have to confront cilarnen but that was his problem and not a reason to keep everyone else standing around in the cold lets go back then he said with a sigh then smiled smiled broadly in fact good work vestakia she ducked her head but it seemed to him that she was so happy she was glowing they reached the main camp just before dusk kellen sent the others on ahead there was a stop he wanted to make first it wasnt just that he wanted to avoid the meeting with cilarnen it was that there were other obligations he felt he had to discharge that were just as pressing and almost as uncomfortable to deal with in the sennight that hed been underground the unicorn knights had returned to their old camp many familiar pavilions had been struckthe encampment was barely half the size it had once beenbut kellen wanted to pay his respects hed fled like a coward the night hed healed gesade the least he could do was ask after her perhaps someone here would know he rode into the center of the encampment and dismounted riasens pavilion was now in the place where petariels had been he came out at the sound of kellens arrival kellen you come in a good hour he said we had begun to think you loved the caves so well you intended to spend the rest of your life underground it began to seem as if i was kellen replied with a shake of his head but vestakia says that the caverns are now free of taint and so i suppose we shall be moving on once she finds the next one riasen shrugged by now the other unicorn knights had appeared as well kellen saw many familiar facesbut as many more were missing gone forever petariel vandelt melchia too many to count he swallowed hard but riasen was still speaking and once you have dealt with this high mage who has come all the way from armethalieh to speak with you of course kardus says he was banishedif this goes on there will be no one left there at all and we might as well live there ourselves kellen had forgotten how fast gossip traveled among the elves riasen undoubtedly knew everything there was to know about cilarnen but before he had to reply to that a welcome interruption spared him the need i see you kellen menerchel said with pleasure poking his head out of his own pavilion i do not doubt that you have come for a proper cup of tea tea would be welcome kellen said gladly we could not make it properly in the cavernsat least it never tasted right it is a wonder you all did not die of thirst menerchel said in tones of mock concern i would not myself care to engage in such hazardous duty no proper tea it is not to be thought of i shall see to it at once he disappeared back into his pavilion to bring out the teathings it would please me greatly to hear what you have heard of this armethaliehan kellen said but i came first of all to see if you were well and to ask after gesade why not ask me yourself a familiar voice came from behind him im only blind you know not deaf kellen turned around quickly gesade and shalkan were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder he looks stricken shalkan said to her you know the look indeed i do gesade replied sounding as if nothing much had ever happened to her very much as if hes done something wrong and is waiting to be scolded for it well kellen have you done something wrong she looked completely restored to healthexcept for the closed sunken lids and the hollow eye sockets kellen couldnt speak gesade walked carefully forward with shalkan at her side to guide her she reached kellen and he automatically raised his hand to stroke her neck well boy she said tartly would you rather i was dead no kellen said instantlyand honestly but youd rather i could see gesade finished for him well so would i of course wed all rather a great many things that we dont get but this is not the end of the world or my life so kindly dont carry on as if it is if you please but what are you going to do now kellen asked gesade leaned into his hand stepping back a pace so he could rub the particularly soft spot just behind her ear im going to stay in the heartforest until spring then im going to go home to the great herd and run with them gesade said someone will come to be my eyes for that and ill live my lifewhich i could not have done without your help and that is that boy its charming of you to wallow in selfpity over me when i know very well that youd happily have strangled me more than once yes but kellen sputtered that was before i was a helpless cripple gesade said sweetly shalkan snickered i pity the person who thinks youre a helpless cripple kellen said feelingly good gesade said giving him an encouraging nudge thank you for healing me i am very pleased to be alive and i intend to extract every moment of pleasure from life that i can now drink your tea and then go find out what that other silly human child wants hereand then be sure to come back and tell us all about it first kellen said accepting a mug of tea from menerchel gratefully tell me what you know not much shalkan said flicking his ears back and forth andoreniel sent hyandur to armethalieh to warn the city about them as you know the city wouldnt let him in to give his warningas you knew as he was leaving the gates opened and they threw cilarnen out wrapped in a felons cloak hyandur had already seen the remains of another body torn to pieces by a scouring hunt so he knew what was coming he took cilarnen with him over the borderfortunately it wasnt very far and they reached it before dawn he went on to stonehearth to warn them and left cilarnen there and that would have been the end of the matter except for the fact that some moonturns later a centaur wildmage named kardus received a task a centaur wildmage kellen asked but centaurs cant do magic whos telling this story shalkan demanded karduss taska mageprice to anyone elsewas to go to stonehearth and help the human boy he found there he arrived at the same time that a part of the centaur levy was mustering there preparing to head over the border well one of them showed up mistook cilarnen for youso cilarnen saysand tried to destroy the village to cover up its mistake kardus cilarnen and wirancea high reaches wildmageworking together managed to kill it but the levy took heavy losses and so did the village cilarnen decided he had to come and talk to you and since karduss task was to help cilarnen along they came with what was left of the centaur levy which is all anybody knows except that hes definitely not a wildmage and he does have magic once again kellen was impressed at how much shalkan managed to find outthough the unicorn certainly couldnt be sneaking around the main camp picking up gossip he couldnt imagine how shalkan did it or did everyone come to him to tell him the news all it did was add to the mystery why me kellen asked do come back and tell us shalkan said archly and now i suspect everyoneincluding redhelwarwould like an answer to that question reminded of his other responsibilities kellen quickly finished his tea and bid farewell to the unicorn knights mounted firareth again and rode down into the main camp seeing gesade again had made him feel better he hadnt thought it wouldhed thought being reminded of his failure would make him feel terriblebut somehow it didnt her refusal to wallow in selfpity even after her maiming reminded him that no matter how terrible the loss there was always something left with which to begin anew when he reached the horselines there was a message waiting for him to report to redhelwar at his convenience kellen grinned to himself and turned firareth over to one of the ostlers for untacking brushing down and turning out hed dawdled long enough he presented himself at redhelwars pavilion relieved to see only familiar faces there redhelwar adaerion and idalia he bowed redhelwar regarded him with a lifted brow idalia has told me of your sortie into the caverns and what you foundor rather did not findthere and adaerion has acquainted me with your suggestion that the lady vestakia attempt to communicate with the crystal spiders perhaps there is something that you will wish to add to that which they have told i am sure they have told you everything that i would have said kellen said all i have to tell that they do not know is that i have seen gesade and that she is well and in good spirits i ask that you forgive my tardiness but i wished to know how she was he added awkwardly it could have been viewed as manipulation of the most blatant sort to offer up that excuse for his lateness but redhelwar had once been a unicorn knight himself and kellen knew he would understand besides it was no more than the truth redhelwars expression softened you did all you could for her kellen kellen grinned and so she told mevery firmly and since the unicorns know all the gossip i think i know as much as anyone does about our guest guest the word tasted sour tarnishing his good humor and what we know of him certainly doesnt add up to a logical whole idalia said hes used magiceveryone agrees about that but when a mage is banished they burn the gift from his mind before they cast him out so hell have no chance at all against the scouring hunt they must have done that to you kellen she finished her voice puzzled no kellen said but then i wasnt even a student apprentice i was the worst student in the entire history of the magecollege i could barely light a fireor so everyone assumed i did know a couple of first level spellsi wasnt supposed tobut as far as anyone knew i hardly had the gift at all i think ive forgotten them now he thought hard i suppose lycaelon was supposed to do it when he came to see me anyway just in casebut i made him so furious i guess he just forgot dredging up those old memories required an act of will and kellen was surprised at how much they hurt lycaelon was a great one for forgetting things idalia said caustically and when you were banished the boundaries were so vast that there shouldnt have been any way for you to get across them before the hunt caught up to you even if youd had an intact giftin fact even with shalkans help you didnt manage it if you hadnt been a knightmagetobe youd be dead but cilarnen was a good student kellen said resentfully hed already been a student apprentice forever and that was last spring theyd certainly have burned him but they didnt idalia said hes cast fire magelight and mageshield from what the centaurs say the first two are also spells of the wild magic dont look so surprised kellen an awful lot of magic comes from the same root and the high magick has to have come from the wild magic originallybut i cant cast anything like mageshield well neither can i kellen said sulkily well and truly irritated now it was a simple spell too a first level spell one that a student apprentice had to master for his own safety before moving on to more elaborate and dangerous work most of the first level spells didnt even require wand and sigil work just visualizations and cantrips but hed never managed to learn them he shook his head disgusted with himself it was sickening how quickly all that deadnumbing rote memorization came flooding back into his mind as if hed never left the city at all as if he were still trapped within its walls buried alive and hed had a chance to think about thisan armethaliehan mage arriving here at this time this placeand he didnt like the conclusions he had come to idalia watched her brother with carefullyconcealed dismay it was as if the past halfyear had suddenly been stripped away this was the old kellen the boy shed first metunhappy uncertain angry if kellen had a weak point it was armethalieh he hated and loved it at the same timeshe was positive even he wasnt sure which the same way he stillhated and loved lycaelon thoughand she was quite positive of this hed convinced himself he didnt care about his father at all and since lycaelon was archmage of armethalieh father and city were very nearly the same thing certainly lycaelon had always thought so she knew nothing about cilarnen volpiril except that his father was lycaelons rival on the high council but from what kellen said about him it was obvious that kellen saw cilarnen as everything he had never succeeded in being excellent student beloved son and now cilarnen was here reminding him of every failure every fault and kellen wasnt thinking clearly at all well as a knightmage you have precious little use for mageshield now do you idalia said trying to draw him back to the present and make him focus on what he did have kellen looked at her startled i suppose not he said slowly it would be good to know just why he was banished from the city idalia continued ruthlessly that is something he has told no one adaerion said and we do not know enough of the ways of the human city to know for what cause it casts out its folk kellen looked at idalia she was relieved to see that he seemed to have come back to himself a bit you and i were banished for studying the wild magic he said hesitantly but they would have let me stay if id apologized and given it up well we can rule out studying the wild magic idalia said because we know he hasnt done that she frowned theres hardly anything else the mages banish someone for for any other crime you either do penance pay a fine get your memories excised or all three idalia kellen said after a moments silence an odd note in his voice what is studying the wild magic if youre a high mage if someone has studied the wild magic what actual crimethe name of the crime i meanare they committing against the city idalia thought hard it had been almost half her lifetime since shed discovered her three books in the records room of the council hall and from the moment theyd come into her hands shed known she was committing treason she said to study the wild magic is to commit treason and heresy against the light ah said redhelwar with satisfaction we progress no said kellen we dont we could talk until the sun came up and get nowhere he added harshly what we need to do is ask cilarnen questions not each other so ill see him ill question him and if i dont like his answers ill kill him kellen idalia gasped stunned thats what im here for isnt it kellen said bleakly and now idalia could see the pain in his eyesthe pain of a man carrying a burden far too heavy for him to bear to kill things we can discuss why hes here and how he got here for as long as we like but in the end it comes down to one thing a wildmage brought cilarnen to me because thats his mageprice i dont think there was anything in that price about me letting him live idalia would have liked to deny the truth in thatbut in all honesty she couldnt i dont know why an armethaliehan magewhatever his rank banished for treason or notis here it doesnt seem really likely that theyd let him go with his gift intact or when they knew an elf was lurking around outside the city ready to help him escape the scouring hunt it sounds like a trap to me ill see kellen finished simply and certainly there will be time enough for that on the morrow redhelwar said as smoothly as if kellen had not just proposed to murder a guest under elven protection tonight i believe he still recovers from his ordeal in the blizzardi know not where for yourself kellen i am certain a warm bath a hot meal and a good nights sleep will be welcome before you are called upon to try this strangers motives the tea that can be brewed in the caverns so i am assured by adaerion is foul and you will wish for better belepheriel has made you a gift of some of the armethaliehan black that you favor i shall send dionan to your pavilion to brew it for you after you have bathed and see you to your rest for a moment idalia thought kellen would object but he caught himself in time he bowed deeply you do me too much honor redhelwar it is cold in the caverns and colder without it will be good to spend the night in reflection and i will welcome the tea he bowed againto redhelwar to adaerion to idalia and left quietly there was silence in redhelwars pavilion for a time someone please tell me that kellen didnt just suggest killing cilarnen idalia thought if the mageborn boy is indeed a threat adaerion began then kellen will deal appropriately with him in the morning redhelwar said i trust him to do as the wild magic wills but not i notice enough that you were willing to let him know where cilarnen is now idalia thought bowing she took her own leave he was sure redhelwar was right he thought he was sure actually he wasnt sure of anything other than that he was cold hungry and tired but a hot bath and fresh clotheshed spent the last sennight living in his armor and it was certainly time for a changedid much to make kellen feel better as did a hot fresh meal that hadnt started life as blocks of journeyfood after that he returned to his tentwhere dionan was waiting to brew the promised teaand drank the entire pot while giving his armor and sword a thorough cleaning it made him feel betteras long as he didnt think about cilarnen the uppermost emotion in kellens mindhe was honest enough to admitwas outrage how dare cilarnen come here this was kellens place kellens lifehed worked hard to make a place for himself here and now cilarnen was coming to take it all away is that what you really think kellen snorted surprised disgusted and amusedall at the same timeby the direction of his own thoughts even if cilarnen were a fully invested high mage with an army at his backwhich he wasnthe couldnt do that but what if he isnt cilarnen at all what if hes a demon whos figured out some way to pass the bounds of the elven lands and conceal himself from vestakia unlikely but possible what was slightly more possible was that he was some other kind of enemy something vestakia couldnt sense something that could pass the bounds of the elven lands but an enemy nonetheless if hes an enemy ill deal with him but you have to deal with yourself first a small inner voice said kellen sighed and set his sword and armor asideboth gleamed with oil and polishand sat down crosslegged on his sleeping mat he sat quietly not emptying his mind but letting it fill with whatever it chose his losses came first ciltesse petariel the dead friends he had not yet had time to mourn in the need to cleanse the caverns of duergar the lost members of his thirty replaced already by nearstrangers who had not yet had time to become friends he was afraid to get to know them well afraid to lose them too elves were supposed to live for centuries there were elves in sentarshadeen as old as armethalieh they were supposed to be living in peace in their beautiful cities studying crafting making life itself into an art they werent supposed to diedrowning in their own blood spilling their guts out on the snow vomiting and convulsing as they died of shadowed elf poison screaming as they were eaten by acid they werent supposed to die but they do die kellen told himself they die so their children will live they die so the centaurs will live they die so the trees will live he remembered the barren wasteland he and jermayan had ridden through on their way to the black cairnthe land that so jermayan had told him had been a lush and fruitful forest before the last time shadow mountain had gone to war yes they fight because of that if there had to be war that was a good reason to fight because to see the whole world turned into thatand worsewas unthinkable anything his friends had to do to stop it was worth it even die but gods of the wild magic he would miss them he let his grief wash over him and through him and when its first violence was past he looked deeper hatred anger fear they came racing into his consciousness like coldwarg over the snow all centered on the image of a young man he remembered only dimly envy spite malice he hoped that cilarnen had suffered every step of his journey here had loathed falling into the hands of the lesser races had been terrified of the elves grief despair he hoped when cilarnen had heard the gate slam shut behind himhed realized his highandmighty father had betrayed and abandoned himhed realized that the high mages cared for nothing but power for nothing but themselves that everything hed done every day of his life to excel to please had come to nothing in the end kellen realized he was crying silently tears streaming down his face is that it he thought wonderingly even as his heart ached with loss and despair but i dont care apparently he did i dont he whispered aloud wiping at his eyes he had everything here friends a life work that mattered a gift to cherish and train but the thought of cilarnen coming here frightened him because cilarnen wasor had been at leasteverything that kellen had once desperately wanted to be and it was as if as if im afraid that if when i see him again everything will go back to being that way ill be kellenthefailure again and hell still beperfect it was a ridiculous thing to fear in armethalieh cilarnen had belonged and kellen had been outofplace here kellen fit in only he didnt not really he was a knightmage knightmages didnt fit in there that was the root of his anger and fear he didnt fit in here either he was just as alone here as he had been in the city kellen bit back a heartfelt sob oh it was a completely different situation of course in armethalieh conformity was the highest goal here everyone valued him for being different his knightmage gifts were esteemed and honored but he was still different set apart in a way that even idalia wasnt and now if cilarnen came and fit in youll be jealous youll still be jealous of him kellen managed a shaky laugh and wiped his face dry once more but he thought hed worked his way to the heart of the problem it had been as painful as lancing an infected boil but he felt better now and he thought that tomorrow when he faced cilarnen he could judge him fairlyfor whatever he was i wont like it i wont like him but i can do it thoroughly exhausted now kellen rolled into his bedclothes and doused the lanterns with a gesture chapter twentyfour shadows of the past calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink cold air and a hint of movement woke him kellen rolled out of his bedclothes and grabbed his sword in one fluid movement someone was moving toward him he reached out and grabbed the front of the intruders tunic flinging him to the bedroll hed just vacated the edge of his sword at the shadowy figures throat hey the intruder yelped he must have felt the cold of the steel at his throat then because he went absolutely still with a gesture kellen lit the lanterns and stared down at someone who could only be cilarnen volpiril hed seen that face kellen realized with a shockand since his banishing it was the same face that had appeared in idalias scrying bowl the day hed gone to ashaniel to ask her to warn armethalieh russet hair pale blue eyes narrow aristocratic mageborn features he was freshly shaved and his hair was still cut short in the manner of the city but no proper mageborn son would have a complexion so roughened by wind and weather cilarnen volpiril kellen said in disgust getting to his feet close the flap he said without turning around its cold in here when he turned to pick up his sword sheath he got a good look at his second guest the centaur had waistlength hairblack with a broad white streakand uncommon for male centaurs was cleanshaven his tail had a white streak in it as well and he had three white feet charms were braided into both his hair and his tail and around his neck over his tunic he wore a necklace from which were strung many more kellens mind caught up with his body and he knew then what this was all about you must be kardus kellen said sheathing his sword how a centaur could still be a wildmage without having magic was a question for another time he reached for his tunic and pulled it on im kellen is your task fulfilled yes kardus said my task was to bring cilarnen to you but i have grown fond of him on our journey i would stay to help him if i may for a moment kellen thought of ordering him out then shrugged itll be cramped but sure tea he was glad now that dionan had left the teathings behind it occurred to him that maybe hed better apologize for nearly decapitating cilarnen ah sorry about the welcome we sleep lightly around here it wouldnt be the first time that the enemy has tried to infiltrate the camp he rummaged around until he found his camp boots and slipped them on and began setting up the tea brazier dont you want to know why im here cilarnen demanded when hed awoken in the healers tent several days agounutterably relieved to discover that kardus had kept the wildmage healers away from him hed wanted to see kellen immediately only kellen it seemed wasnt here nobody was willing to tell him whenor even ifkellen would be back either and so for nearly a sennight cilarnen had waited in the centaur camp hoping for word tonight hed finally heard that kellen had returnedfrom a wildmage healer who had been with kellen at someplace called the further cavernbut still the invitation cilarnen impatiently expected didnt come finally hed taken matters into his own hands hed demanded that kardus show him the way to kellens tent or hed go by himself and a little to his surprise the centaur wildmage had agreed without argument he hadnt expected the tent to be green silk he certainly hadnt expected to be attacked when he opened the flap and stepped inside i said he repeated probably to annoy me kellen answered coolly and went on with his tea preparations as if cilarnen wasnt there cilarnen regarded kellen with a mixture of fear and despair he had to listen to what cilarnen had to say but this was not the same kellen he and his cronies had taunted back at the magecollege oh theyd called him kellen farmboy even then because of his hulking size but now he was muscled like a docklaborer and surely even taller than hed been then there was nothing of the mageborn about him he looked nothing like lycaelon tavadonhe looked like one of the high reaches folkand his hair was long enough to braid and then there was that sword as large and heavy as a ritual tool but kellen handled it as if it weighed no more than a practice rapier and his speed cilarnen had never seen anyone move that fast in his lifenot even the centaur warriors hed barely taken two steps into kellens tent before hed been seized and flung to the floor feeling something cold and sharp at his throat and when kellen had lit the lanternsby magic wild magiched seen that kellen was holding that monstrous blade to his throat glaring down at him with a face like death itself and now he was making tea my news is urgent cilarnen said it concerns the good of the city it can wait until the tea is ready kellen said maddeningly or of course it can wait until the morning i really dont like being woken up in the middle of the night youre still thinking only of yourself cilarnen said bitterly but then you always did have you always been an idiot kellen asked pleasantly or did frostburn addle your brains you dont know anything about me youve come halfway across the world to ask for my help and now youre insulting me what would your father say hes dead cilarnen said bleakly i killed him what oh good going kellen youve really put your foot in it this time what was it about cilarnen that sent him back three seasons in his manners as if the elves hadnt taught him better by now leaf and starif hed thought about it the most annoying thing he could have done was to have been completely polite and if he hadnt then he wouldnt have put himself in the wrong cilarnen i you dont care cilarnens voice was flat why should you your father and mine were enemies my father condemned me to death actually kellen replied slowly he wanted me dead so badly he sent three packs of the scouring hunt after me when he found out i was still alive living outside city lands he expanded the boundaries so he could try to hunt me down again whatever our fathers are wereto each other we are not enemies or at least we shouldnt be as he said it he felt a sense of presence a price to pay forgive an enemy yes cilarnen had been his enemy perhaps not for what he had done though kellen had certainly suffered enough from his youthful tormentingbut simply for what he wasthe symbol of what kellen could have been as much so as the other kellen he had confronted at the black cairn cilarnen had beenand still washis enemy forgive an enemy forgiveforgetit was time to pay the price of gesades healing kellen swallowed hard hed thought then it was a small price a light price i forgive you cilarnen i think it will be the hardest price i have ever paid but i forgive you i think you were as much a victim of the city as i was he got up to reach out to cilarnen no kardus said quietly the touch of a wildmage is uncomfortable to him kellen settled back and concentrated on preparing tea saying nothing this was no simple price over and done with in hours or days he would be paying this price for moonturns to come perhaps for the rest of his life i can try he thought desperately i can only try my best was that why lycaelon wanted to expand the city bounds cilarnen asked in horrified wonder kellen took a deep breath and forced himself to sound calm he could act as if cilarnen werent his enemy that was a beginning the sense of presenceof listeningwithdrew so he nodded and made his expression serious but open and pleasant yes were fairly sure anyway when we found out my sister and i escaped into the elven lands because we knew that no matter what the council wouldnt dare push the bounds past the elven border and then everything went wrong and the council drew back the bounds to the walls cilarnen said taking up the story as if it were his to tell as well well maybe it washe knew what kellen did not what had gone on inside the city the farmers stopped sending foodthey said with so much rain in the fall they would need all their food for themselves there were no weather spells to protect them anymore you see i was an entered apprentice then i saw all the storehouses there was a hint of desperation in his voice they were halfempty and every day it was worse the price of grain kept rising the council agreed to buy grain from the selkens but of course nobody knew if they would send it and it made us look so weak the tea was ready kellen poured and held out a cup to cilarnen dropping several honeydisks into it for good measure in the cold honey was energy the boykellen couldnt help thinking of cilarnen as a boy though he knew cilarnen was a year older than he wastook it automatically heavy rains when the black cairn had burst it had affected the weather everywhere normally that wouldnt have included the delfier valley granary of armethalieh but when the mages had restricted the bounds they had removed the weatherspells from the valley exposing it to the full force of the freak storms anything still in the fields would have been beaten down and drowned rotted he hadnt known of course if he had it still wouldnt have changed anything but you couldnt let that go on kellen said quietly we had to stop them cilarnen said passionately the high council wouldnt listenmy father wouldnt listen it was his plan to reduce the bounds to the walls to shame archmage lycaelon and he would not reverse his position the archmage would have listened i know that now i know it but i thought he wouldnt because of who my father was and i couldnt see the city starving before my eyes odd as it was to imagine kellen thought lycaelon would have listened leaving the city without any way to feed itself was suicidal but if the rest of the council had backed volpiril and not lycaelon and i couldnt see the city starving before my eyes at that moment kellen felt something he hadnt expected for cilarnen respect as mageborn cilarnen would have been one of the last to suffer in fact the hardships of the city would scarcely have touched his life at all yet he had taken on the responsibility his elders were too enwrapped in political wrangling to claim what did you do he asked gently we made umbrastone cilarnen said miserably light deliver me i dont even know why now there were six of us and master raellan jorade isas geont pentres kermis lalkmair tiedor rolfort margon ogregance and me margons father was on the merchants and provenders council so he knew exactly how bad things were kermis was the one who had the recipe for umbrastone it eats magici think we thought that if we made enough of it we could get into the high council chambers and make them listen to us leaf and star kellen said softly treason theyd guessed back in redhelwars tent and here it was conspiracy to overthrow the high council and meddling with forbidden magic hed read about umbrastone in the ars perfidorum the book of forbidden acts it was one of the products of the art khemitic and as such as much anathema to the high mages as the wild magic was we were arrested before we even made the first batch cilarnen said sounding baffled and griefstricken i dont know how they found out but we had all the ingredients so that was good enough for the high council i dont know what happened to any of my friendsi think at least one of them was banished before me and died hyandur said there was someone in a felons cloak and the hunt i didnt believe him then or maybe undermage anigrel said my father was dead when he came to burn away my gift he said the conspiracy was lord volpirils idea he lied kellen said instantly though the mention of anigrels name made him want to twitch it wasnt only kindness that motivated his words but common sense why would lord volpiril instigate a conspiracy whose sole purpose was to overthrow him and support lycaelons position anigrel must have been lying cilarnen held up a hand that doesnt matter he said his voice rough with grief this does undermage anigrel came to burn away my gift i still have it kellen started but didnt interrupt for a long time i didnt maybe cilarnen interpreted kellens expression of startlement as skepticism because he nodded vigorously truly even you have to believe id know whether it was there or not i spent two moonturns at stonehearth and i didnt have itjust the worst headaches you can imagine then the day that thing cameit came back and its all there kellen wasnt sure quite what he was asking or what good the information would do him he knew how the high mages fueled their spellsby power stolen from the citizens of armethalieh through their city talismans even if cilarnen hadnt had his gift burned out of him he had nothing now beyond his personal power to draw on to fuel his spells yes cilarnen said smiling bitterly for a moment for what good it does me i was nearly ready to test for journeyman when i was banishedbut here without tools without spellbooks what good am i unless of course you need someone to take care of horses i can light fires and boil water but just touching those cursed books you wildmages are so proud of makes me feel sick and theres something missing when i try to cast a spell but i dont know what it is i do kellen thought and bless leaf and star that anigrel was so willing to parade his superior knowledge before me that day i can explain to you how the high magick really works and why your spells dont but whether that was something he should do would require more thought and he wasnt sure that even if he did explain it would help cilarnen would still need a power sourcequite a lot of them in factand they would have to donate their power freely and willingly im glad that you told me all this kellen said and i really am sorry about your fathernot because i liked him or any of the high mages but because i think he was unjustly killed and i know that you and your friends were unjustly punished it should have been the first thought of every high mage on the council to take care of the city not to spend their time in wrangling over who was to blame but this isnt why you came is it no cilarnen said i came because of what the dething told me at stonehearth he closed his eyes obviously concentrating and when he spoke again eyes still closed kellen sensed he was reciting something he had carefully committed to memory so archmages son kellen what a surprise to see you here have you tired of the children of leaf and star and think to make your way back to the golden city you have nothing to return to now your father claims another as his son he has given him the seat on the high council that was to have been yours and daily our foothold in the city grows stronger kellen rocked back on his heels the words striking him like separate blows the demons were in armethalieh or wait he was fairly sure the demons couldnt enter armethalieh any more than they could enter the elven lands if he could trust a single word lycaelon had said to him that night in his cell the high mages did remember the demons and were still terrified of them so theyd have spells to keep them out of the city but a foothold that was bad enough it would have to be a foothold of a different sort than they had here in the elven lands with the shadowed elves something that could pass the citywards and flourish unnoticed but what well cilarnen demanded arent you going to do something yes kellen said im going to have another cup of tea and im going to think think cilarnen cried what good is thinking going to do youve got to stop them really kellen replied his tone dry one would be interested of course to hear how this was to be accomplished at all much less this instant i cant go back to armethalieh and neither can you and even if we could fight our way in do you think the high council would listen to us would the archmage listen to me and lycaelon rules the council now he must now that volpirils dead i have to talk to idalia about this she kept watch on the high council for years shell have a better idea of how the power would have shifted with volpiril gone and lycaelon has adopted someone and given him volpirils council seat who so youre going to leave them to die cilarnen said bitterly i knew you would he started to get to his feet sit down kellen said firmly drink your tea and think cilarnen by leaf and star you were the best student at the magecollegeyou must have some brain in that pretty head of yours i wouldnt give my worst enemy over to themim certainly not giving them a whole city of innocent people to play with their sorcery is fueled by torture and deathand the more powerful the gift in their victim the more power they gain from destroying him if they take armethalieh if they can take armethalieh then they win theyll be unstoppable its cold cilarnen muttered sulkily sitting back down kellen lifted the pot cilarnen held out his cup kellen refilled it cilarnen sipped now its bitter he said a faint whining note in his voice kellen sighed inwardly he wondered if hed ever been anything like cilarnen probably he refilled his own cup i dont make very good tea ask anyone he said mildly he passed cilarnen the jar of honeydisks and sipped his own tea it tasted fine to himstrong but that was just as well he hadnt gotten much sleep you say youre going to help but you dont say what youre going to do and the only reason youre going to help is because if those things destroy armethalieh itll be bad for the elves who are the only ones you really care about cilarnen retortedbelligerently a few moments later if kellen hadnt had something really important to worry about now if he hadnt had the paying of his mageprice fixed firmly in his mind he might actually have gotten angry as it was he simply stared at cilarnen in bemusement why in the name of anything you cared to call upon was the boy trying to pick a fight with him because cilarnen was afraid the intuition came to him suddenly he glanced up at kardus and saw acknowledgment in the centaur wildmages darkeyed gaze cilarnen was terrified for armethalieh kellen had been afraid when hed been banished but only of the unknown from the moment armethaliehs gates closed behind him hed been looking forward not back but cilarnen cilarnen missed armethalieh the way idalia would miss jermayan he imagined vaguely or he would miss shalkan cilarnen felt about armethalieh the way jermayan and ancaladar felt about each other but a city is wood and stone it cant love you back he supposed that didnt matter the elves loved ysterialpoerin and had fought desperately to save it he had fought desperately to save it compassion warmed his next words yes many of the elves are my friends but id help anyway even if armethaliehs destruction werent a danger to them if they destroy armethalieh their victory will be bad for more than just the elves it will give them the power to destroy every creature of the light every tree every blade of grass until theres nothing left in the world but them and their slaves they tried twice before the first time was before there were humans and the elves fought them alone the last time was around the time armethalieh was built everyoneelves humans centaurs unicorns dragons and otherfolk who dont exist anymoreall joined together to defeat them they thought theyd won forever they were wrong cilarnen just shook his head plainly it was more information than he could handle kellen will aid armethalieh cilarnen and so will the elves for all the races of the light depend on one another like a spiders web cut one strand then another and soon there is no web at all do you see kardus said as simply as if he were talking to a small child but the elves went to ask the city for help cilarnen said shaking his head and we wouldnt give it why should they help now kardus glanced at kellen questioningly well the elves werent actually asking for help andoreniel already knew that the high mages wouldnt fight for the elvesor for anyone outside the city kellen said trying to keep his explanation simple he was only trying to warn the city so they could protect themselves but they wouldnt let hyandur in cilarnen said angrily they wouldnt let him warn themand he still saved my life roiry and pearl could have been killed outrunning the scouring hunt but he still helped me kellen wasnt sure but from the context roiry and pearl seemed to be hyandurs riding animals odd that one of the mageborn should care about anything like that young magesintraining didnt have pets or favorite mounts any more than they had girlfriends they were supposed to focus their entire being on the high magick to the exclusion of everything else if what the creature you met at stonehearth told you is true kellen said still thinking his way slowly through everything cilarnen had told him hyandurs being barred from the city may have saved not only your life but his he probably wouldnt have been left alive to deliver his messagedepending on the nature of this foothold cilarnen looked surprised as if the thought had never occurred to him so it worked out for the best he said tentatively it went as the wild magic wills kellen said automatically cilarnen recoiled in disgust wincing faintly kellen sighed ruefully cilarnen was more difficult to talk to than the elves of ysterialpoerin you cant have that much objection to the wild magic you came here with a wildmage he said with just a touch of chiding in his voice it was an hour before dawn now he wasnt going to get any more sleep tonight he might as well get dressed and take cilarnen to be fed at a slightly more civilized hour he could present him to redhelwarhoping cilarnen did not insult the armys general too thoroughlyand they could begin to plan what to do kardus is different he doesnt make my skin crawl cilarnen said with a shattering lack of tact and anywayim already banished what difference can it make who i associate with but wild magic it doesnt make any sense kellen looked at kardus puzzled as you know i have no magic yet when the books came to me i did my best to live by their teachings and to follow the great herdsmans path there are times when i know what others do not and in payment for these knowings i am always set a task i knew in merryvale that i must go to stonehearth and help the human child i would find there when i reached stonehearth my knowing unfolded further and i realized after the attack that my task was to bring him to you in order to give him the help he truly needed both wirance and i found that his magic was of a kind neither of us knew we tested him with the wild magic and found that wirances books caused him true distress where mine did not though he could read neither wirances set nor mine yet their spells worked together well enough at stonehearth huh kellen said one more mystery well given time and enough information this one could probably be unraveled too he pulled off the tunic hed grabbed at random and opened his clothes chest what are you doing cilarnen asked nervously getting dressed for some reason kellen was starting to feel like cilarnens much older brother its almost dawn then the three of usby your courtesy kardus wildmageare going to go and eat because i didnt get much sleep and im hungry and as the mountainfolk say sleep is food and food is sleep by then the daywatch of the camp should be on duty so ill go to dionan or ninolion and see when we can see redhelwarthe general of the elven army cilarnen and hes the most important person here so try to be extremely polite the elves set a great store by politeness then when we do see him you can tell him what youve told me and well figure out what to do about it as he spoke he finished dressing and buckled on sword dagger and spurs it was a little cramped with kardus in the tent but he managed quickly running a comb through his hair he braided it into a tight club at the base of his neck tied it with a ribbon swung his cloak around himself and picked up his gloves cilarnen was staring at him jaw hanging you look like an elf he blurted scrambling to his feet kellen bit his lip hard cilarnen have you actually seen any elves i look about as much like one of them as a draft horse looks like a unicorn come on he doused the lanterns and worked his way around kardus to the door of the pavilion cilarnen followed the other two out of the nowdark green tent gasping a little as the sharp bite of the cold air it was still black as night for all kellen tavadons talk of it being nearly dawn and snowingof course at least tavadon had listened though cilarnen wasnt really sure how much he understood he had kept talking about things that had happened a thousand years ago not about what had happened back in the village and about elves always elves cilarnen seethed with resentment like any properlyraised mageborn cilarnen knew about elves they were deceitful they were one of the lesser races of coursehe felt a wash of confusioncentaurs were a lesser race too and sarlin and kardus were centaurs but they were different they didnt make him feel quite so unfinished elves bothered him they were so haughty so terribly aloof and the chronicles of the light specifically said that elvenkind had been created by the light as a rebuke to humankind that elves never told the truth but hyandur had been coming to tell the truth about the demons hadnt he cilarnen felt his head begin to hurt this was not how things were supposed to be going the dining tent was bright and warm the night watch was there lingering over their meals before retiring to their beds with the caverns cleared the army by the grace of leaf and star would be granted a breathing space to heal itself before it must fight again kellen caught cilarnen gazing around himself curiously as if hed never been here before youve been staying with the centaurs he asked that would make sense if hed been in karduss care the centaurs had a separate section of the camp with everythingincluding their eating placearranged to accommodate their physical requirements cilarnen nodded dumbly we can move one of the benches for you kardus kellen said but im afraid the table will be low it is of no matter the centaur said kindly the food here is excellent he switched his tail in anticipation they went and collected trays of food kellen noticed there were few items on cilarnens tray and added more will you stop doing that cilarnen demanded irritably after kellen put on the third dish im not that hungry its cold out there you need to eat kellen said spying a platter of honeycakes fresh from the oven and taking several warm they were delicious cold both shalkan and firareth liked themand he knew hed have to make time today to get up to the unicorn camp to tell them the news bad as it was i dont need to eat cilarnen said pettishly and if i did you couldnt make me i could tie you in a knot and feed you your own feet kellen said making his tone pleasant just to keep the boy off balance he had the feeling that the more he kept cilarnen bewildered the better chance there would be for new ideas to sink into that toopretty skull at least drink if you wont eat not if its more boiled grass cilarnen said peevishly at least he kept his voice downnot that it mattered as the elves could hear him perfectly well kellen added a tankard of hot cider to cilarnens tray boiled grass hell drink tea in redhelwars pavilion if i have to strangle him kellen and kardus worked their way steadily through hearty breakfasts kellen as was his usual habit wrapping several of the honeycakes on his plate in a cloth and tucking them away for laterwhile kellen took the opportunity to catch up on news from the wild lands since kardus had come from merryvale haneida was wellkellen was grateful to hear that as the elderly beekeeper had refused to leave the village when the scouring hunt had come and master eliron as well kardus said smiling still in his place still swearing he is too old and too busy to serve as a councilor most of the villagers returned to their places in the wild lands as soon as the new bounds collapsed and merana and cormo kellen asked eagerly kardus bowed his head suddenly grave cormo is here merana was lost upon the road as many were kellen swallowed around the sudden lump in his own throat lost if idalia had guessed right to demon raids im sorry i hope she died quickly out of the corner of his eye he could see that cilarnen was only picking at his food in fact he didnt look well at all but hed seemed fine back in kellens pavilion and he hadnt eaten or drunk anything kellen hadnt as kellen watched he set down his eating knife and rubbed fretfully at his eyes hed mentioned having headaches back in stonehearth look why dont we go over to the healers tents and find you something for your headache kellen suggested youll probably feel more like eating then and you need a clear head when you talk to redhelwar cilarnen stared at him in a combination of misery and shock you look awful kellen said in explanation didnt they give you something for your headaches in stonehearth yes cilarnen finallyreluctantlysaid i dont know what it was brown it had dreamhoney in it i took it twice a day but i havent had any headaches since his voice trailed off kellen managed to keep his face still but it took all the practice hed had living among the elves what little he knew about healingcordials hed learned listening to idalia but he knew that dreamhoney was powerful stuff not used lightly well the healers will be able to come up with something and this is probably just because of a weather change but what if im losing my gift again now cilarnen had an edge of panic in his voice kellen thought he knew why and for just a moment he felt a little sympathy magic after all was all that cilarnen had left of his old life and the thought that he might lose even that must make him mad with fear cilarnen kellen said firmly getting to his feet you know much more about the high magick than i do you know you cant just lose a gift the high mages either burn it out of your mind or they dont so since they didnt no matter what happens or what you feel you still have it cilarnen stared up at him the same dumb fear in his eyes as a cornered hare kellen shook his head this should have been the moment when he felt superior at long last to the tooperfect boy who was everything kellen tavadon should have been and wasnt but he didnt oddly all he felt was irritation now come to the healers tent he said gruffly or be carried its all one to me by the time they reached the healers tent cilarnen was staggering along between kellen and kardus mechanically and very nearly was carried there they brought him inside the tent designated for minor injuriesa mere headache no matter how bad could not compare with the severity of the injuries the healers usually treated cilarnen sank down on a waiting bench and leaned forward his forehead nearly touching his knees even a sennight after the battle at ysterialpoerin the healers tents were still filled with recuperating wounded for the wildmages could only cure so many and the rest must be left to heal by more conventional means a healer approached as soon as they entered i see you kellen knightmage i see you healer yatimumil kellen said bowing to the elven healer here is cilarnen a human high mage he suffers from headaches that centaur healers in stonehearth were treating with a potion containing dreamhoney we thought the cause of those headaches was past and this headache may not be of the same sort it came on very suddenly yatimumil bowed again looking at cilarnen critically idalia is here i will send for her i think perhaps that a human should look into this a few moments later idalia and vestakia entered the tent so you found him idalia said neutrally say rather that he found me kellen said grimacing idalia moved toward cilarnen no kellen said quickly dont kardus says that wildmages make him uncomfortable he shrugged i dont know why well im not a wildmage vestakia moved forward and knelt in front of him cilarnen please look up i need to see your eyes cilarnen looked up recoiled tensed oh no kellen had long since stopped noticing what vestakia looked like she was just vestakia his comrade in arms sometimes his weapon in battle and by now everyone in the elven army thought of her the same way but when cilarnen had looked up he hadnt seen vestakia hed seen a demon he scrabbled for the knife on his belt his face white with terror if he kills heror so much as hurts herthe elves will kill him if i dont kill him first kellen dove between them knocking cilarnen and the bench over backward before anyone else had a chance to move he measured himself fulllength atop cilarnen one hand clasped over the wrist of the hand that held the knife a centaurmade blade heavy and sharpthe other firmly clasped over cilarnens mouth lest he say words that could not be unsaid im sorry he said into cilarnens ear im sorry i should have warned you i didnt think shed be here i didnt think her names vestakia shes a friend her father was one of them but her mother was a great wildmage and she worked a powerful spell so that vestakia would be human and goodinside where it counts cilarnen struggled violently but he was no match for kellens strength kellen supposed he was hurting himone way or anotherbut right now he had no choice i promise you that shes never hurt anyone in her lifeit was stretching the truth a bit but certainly vestakia had never hurt anyone goodand she isnt one of them think would kardus be standing here quietly if she were finally cilarnen lay still and kellen dared to take his hand from over his mouth i but she but women cant do magick cilarnen sputtered irrelevantly behind them both idalia made a noise like an exasperated cat kellen plucked the knife from cilarnens hand and tossed it into the middle of the room then hauled him unceremoniously to his feet stepping back warily youll find that women can do a great number of things probably even high magick if the high mages werent so unreasonable about it kellen told him though not as sternly as he might have you have a good mind cilarnen volpiril see with your own eyes hear with your own ears and use what you find to draw logical conclusions he glanced around cautiously vestakia was cowering back against idalia looking stricken kellen looked away quickly kardus picked up the discarded knife and moved to stand beside vestakia and idalia it is true he said she is a daughter of the light i will prove it to you now from one of the pouches at his belt he removed a short coil of shining white rope kellen recognized what it was instantly unicorn hair braided into a thin rope child i beg you of your courtesy he has seen friends die at their hands kardus said to vestakia tears welled up in vestakias eyes she held out her arm pushing the cuff of her tunic back to expose the skin slowly and deliberately kardus wound the length of rope around her arm kellen turned away he could not watch how many times did vestakia have to prove herself instead he watched cilarnen cilarnen was staring at kardus and vestakia intently at last he moved forward slowly stepping over the fallen bench kellen forced himself to turn to keep cilarnen in sight but he still would not look at vestakia citizen vestakia cilarnen said bowing before her he stopped obviously searching for words i beg that you will accept my very humble apologies i have been unjust it must be a terrible thing to be seen as as what you seem instead of as what you are citizen not sure of her rank cilarnen had chosen to address her by the honorific that properly belonged to any inhabitant of the city from high mage to docklaborer from someone who still thought of himself as an armethaliehan it was an incredible honor kellen hoped idalia would explain it to vestakia later vestakia held out her hand cilarnen took it without hesitation we shall both blame kellen for this and not each other she said decisively for he should certainly have warned you she shook her head as over a careless child and kellen felt himself flushing sometimes she said with a sidelong glance at kellen he is not very practical now come and sit we must still discover the cause of your headache oh it doesnt hurt now cilarnen said hastily then it will not hurt you to be examined vestakia said implacably leading him over to another bench i am a healer and you must allow me to do my duty kardus followed kellen picked up the fallen bench when he straightened he found idalia looking at him still want to kill him she asked kellen shook his head in exasperation if you happen to see a selken trader though i wouldnt mind stuffing him in a sack and selling him to them still i suppose if id gotten dropped in things as thoroughly as he has i wouldnt have handled things much better he took her arm and led her to the far side of the tent and continued in a lower voice he told me his news its bad very bad he shook his head at her unspoken query not here where she said whenever redhelwar can see us but he wouldnt eat this morning so i brought him here that was after he sneaked into my tent last night and i nearly killed him poor kellen idalia said with fulsome sympathy bearded by the terrible high mage in his bedroll entered apprentice kellen corrected absently and ready to test for journeyman which means he knows the spellsif he could figure out a way to use them vestakia came over to them then he has no head injury and it is not any kind of cold sickness i know nor poisonand kardus says that if a spell had been cast upon him he would probably have been a great deal sicker than he was kellen did you see what happened to him kellen thought about it nothing happened we were in my pavilion drinking teaarmethaliehan black i drank it and so did kardus he was fine then we went to eat he was sick by the time we got there i think idalia shrugged vestakia looked baffled well he swears his head does not hurt now she said we cant just knock him over and have a passing knightmage sit on him every time he develops a headache idalia retorted it wouldnt be convenientand you might start to like it kellen she tapped her lips with one finger thinking ill make up a cordial for him to take if his head starts hurting again if it doesnt work bring him back ohand you might want to see about getting him something warmer to wear what hes got is good enough for stonehearth or for camp but if we have to go any further north hes going to freeze and he must be cold already kellen sighedhe seemed to be doing a lot of that lately but when had he been appointed cilarnens nurse still proper mageborn like cilarnen were small and slender they might even be able to fit him from the clothing the dead had left behind it was a gruesome thought one he wouldnt have had a moonturn ago but it came to him now with simple matteroffact practicality ill see to it he said in fact hed tell isinwen to see to it that way cilarnens clothes would not only be warm but suitable idalia went to see to the making of the cordial taking vestakia with her kellen went over to cilarnen he really did look better whether it was the sudden shock or just because the headache had run its course he seemed to be fully recovered im sorry i didnt mean to hurt her feelings cilarnen said quietly i didnt think no kellen thought they didnt teach any of us to think in the city did they but you started thinking thereor trying toand thats what started all your problems just the way it started mine the fault was mine he said i didnt think either and as a result i gave you a terrible shock and she was upset let it be forgotten if i will not be needed here kardus said there are matters elsewhere that require my attention follow the herdsmans path cilarnen kellen will be your friend i have kept you too long already cilarnen said with automatic courtesy go with the light the centaur trotted quickly from the tent leaving kellen and cilarnen to share an awkward silence a few moments later idalia came back with a bottle of amber liquid and a horn spoon here you go she said to cilarnen its not the same thing you were taking in stonehearth from what yatimumil says but if your head starts hurting again take two spoonsful of it if that doesnt work come back here yes cilarnen said thank you he was regarding idalia curiously as if there were questions he longed to ask her but didnt quite dare kellen feltstronglythat those questions had better go unasked just now cilarnen might have been able to repair his lapse with vestakia but vestakia had an essentially forgiving nature he wasnt quite sure how idalia would react to any questions along the lines of how shea mere femalehad managed to learn magic come on he said giving cilarnen a quick gentle shove toward the opening of the tent now he said once they were outside we are going to see redhelwars adjutant whoever is on duty he may offer us tea drink it believe me it is an honor to be offered tea do not tell him it tastes like boiled grass do not even think that it tastes like boiled grass elves have very sharp hearing and dont ask them any questions cilarnen suggested right kellen said relieved that cilarnen had figured out that much they may ask you questions dont be surprised its called war manners and this is an army in the field so in an emergency the forms of etiquette are relaxed but generally questions are considered incredibly rude like he groped for the proper comparison like barging into someone elses house and making yourself at home i guess you lecture like master tocsel cilarnen grumbled shivering how long did it take you to figure all this out i didnt figure any of it out kellen told him honestly fortunately idalia my sisterhad lived with the elves before and she told me so i wouldnt make well too many mistakes sister cilarnen said blankly he might not have noticed the last time kellen had mentioned having a sister but he did now just too late kellen remembered that cilarnen would have known perfectly wellalong with everyone else in the citythat kellen tavadon was archmage lycaelons only child for a brief moment he wondered how lycaelon had managed that cilarnen was kellens age or near it certainly he wouldnt have known about idalia any more than kellen knew about cilarnens family but there was volpirilor cilarnens mother who might actually have known idalia kellen wondered for a moment how many other nasty little secrets the mageborn families shared shes my older sister lycaelons firstborn banished for practicing the wild magic ten years before i was kellen said you never mentioned her in all the intimate conversations we had at the magecollege lycaelon made sure i didnt remember her kellen said briefly i dont think thats right cilarnen said a new hard note in his voice then a few moments later he spoke again kellen yes cilarnen trying very hard not to sigh if she was banished ten years before you were you would have been seven and i would have been eight was it a full legal banishing his voice was full of a sharp urgency did she appear before the high council did she wear the cloak did they send the hunt yes and yes and yes and yes and why does it matter kellen said beginning to get irritated despite his best intentions cilarnen swallowed audibly it matters because of a course at the magecollege you never took jurisprudence of the city they taught that there hadnt been any banishings for over a century that it was an ancient custom from the dark times fallen into disuse now and now there was yet another note in his voiceone that said the bottom had fallen out of his world they lied kellen kellen stopped and turned around yes cilarnen they lied he said patiently about the banishings about wild magic being evil about the socalled lesser races abouttoo many things to go into right now the entire city is built on lies were going to save it anyway i hope dionan was not there when kellen and cilarnen arrived only dionans assistant who was tidying the tent and setting out the tea service after a moment kellen dredged up his name alenwe i see you kellen knightmage alenwe said bowing courteously i see you alenwe kellen said i make known to you mage cilarnen of armethalieh i see you mage cilarnen alenwe said bowing again i see you alenwe cilarnen said following kellens lead perhaps if you are not called elsewhere it would please you to enter and take tea for i know you have been welcome in dionans tent many times before alenwe said to be welcomed into dionans tent is always an honor each time as much as the first kellen said there was no need for alenwe to send anyone in search of dionan even if dionan werent planning to return immediately from whatever errand had called him away the elven gossipchains that ran faster than a bolt of summer lightning would ensure that he knew kellen was here and in fact before the teawater had boiled dionan came walking into the tent as unhurriedly as if hed been out for a morning stroll i do thank you for your patience with me alenwe and your hospitality to my guests let us find something new for kellen to try and to honor the visitor from armethalieh i think perhaps golden pearl would be suitable it is an excellent warming tea as the tea was prepared they discussed the weather which according to dionan would continue hard and cold but without any more blizzards like the one they had just weathered or so the wildmages said at least kellen and dionan discussed the weather cilarnen remained resolutely silent though kellen could sense his growing frustration and bewilderment as if it were itself a gathering storm the tea was poured kellen sipped most elven teas were herbal some were heavilyspiced as well this was one of the heavilyspiced ones it tasted not like freshbaked bread but like the idea of freshbaked bread warm with more than heat it reminded him of honey though it was unsweetened yet it had a subtle biting undertaste he couldnt quite identify perhaps we shall allow our guest to give his opinion first dionan said cilarnen high mage perhaps you would wish to favor us with your opinion of this brew of your kindness oh please dont let him say it tastes like boiled grass kellen thought in neardesperation cilarnen considered the matter for a moment taking a second sip of the tea it lacks the body of a curedleaf tea of course though perhaps that is not a flaw as it allows the subtle interplay of flavors to bloom more fully upon the tongue i taste saffron and gingera very slight hint of chamomileand i think rendis the illusion of sweetness along with the complex hot finish makes this as you say an excellent warming tea but i do not believe it would keep well or repay oversteeping of course he finished modestly i am no expert my own tastes as i have said run to the curedleaf teas kellen stared at cilarnen nonplussed cilarnen shot him a triumphant look an excellent description indeed dionan said with approval his gaze shifted to kellen expectantly i must thank cilarnen for giving me the words to say what i am yet too untutored in the way of tea to yet express kellen said firmly suppressing a flash of jealousy i could only have said that it made me think of homely things like bread without knowing why it did and i would give much to know how a thing can seem sweet and yet not be so ah you would be instructed in all the arts of tea dionan said with the faintest of smiles if leaf and star permit someday you will not only brew properly but blend what a joyous day that will be for us all but i have indulged myself sufficiently perhaps you would wish to share with me your purpose in coming to drink tea before the day has fairly begun for i know you came weary from your labors at the caverns yesterday i had hoped if it was not inconvenient that it might be possible to make cilarnen known to redhelwar were redhelwar not occupied with more important matters it would please me greatly if idalia might also be present to hear what might be said then and whoever redhelwar thought prudent that cilarnen might be made known to all at once though he has journeyed for many sennights through the elven lands he has seen little of elven ways and what he would speak of is a grave matter indeed indeed and grave matters must be conducted with unseemly haste dionan agreed present yourselves at redhelwars pavilion in three hours and all shall be as you desire i thank you for your courtesy and your quickness kellen answered he stood and bowed a bell and a half is unseemly haste cilarnen demanded once they were a few yards away unless someone is actually attackingyes kellen said elves live a thousand years and they do not hurry he shrugged well think about it if you lived for a thousand years what would a few bells seem like to you and we have plenty to do between now and then and for somebody who thinks elven tea tastes like boiled grass you certainly seem to be able to say a great deal about it awful wasnt it cilarnen said grimacing give me a good pot of phastan silvertip any day still you dont spend hours in the golden bells without being able to talk about tea no matter what it tastes like and you said to be polite their first stop was isinwens tent kellens second was still asleep but kellen showed no pity he shook the bells until isinwen unpegged the flap and stood in the doorway his long black hair was still loosely braided for sleep and he had hastily thrown his cloak on over a tunic and leggings but he regarded kellen alertly alakomentai he said i make known to you cilarnen of armethalieh kellen said idalia assures me he will surely freeze if we do not find him something warmer to wear and we are to go before redhelwar in three hours so it would be as well if we could present him to advantage isinwen said stepping out of his tent to regard cilarnen critically armor will be impossible not in three hours he is no knight kellen said but hell need something soon not today though clothing however he is in great need of artenel will rejoice to hear it isinwen said blandly i go upon the wings of the wind though leaf and star alone know what i shall find i shall leave my poor scavengings in your pavilion i thank you for your help and courtesy kellen said and i am sorry to have interrupted your rest at that isinwen said slanting a glance at cilarnen i think i must have gotten more than you did but we were all sure you could handle two intruders by yourself thanks a lot once more kellen was reminded of the utter lack of privacy in the camp but if isinwen had heard anything of what cilarnen had said to kellen early this morning he would be far too polite to say so to kellen at least as always you instruct me kellen said bowing with overelaborate courtesy isinwen retreated into his tent to dress and kellen took cilarnen off again if you havent figured it out everyone here heard you come to my pavilion last night he told cilarnen they didnt stop me cilarnen said doubt warring with accusation in his tone they knew they didnt need to kellen said let cilarnen figure out the rest right now he was trying to decide what to do with cilarnen for the next couple of hours he wasnt sure that taking him up to the unicorn camp was a good idea for one thing he wasnt sure the unicorns would tolerate himhe didnt know that much about cilarnen after all and celibateas the young mageborn weredidnt necessarily mean chaste for another it would only be appropriate to give redhelwar the bad news first but he didnt really want to be alone with him either paying his price was one thing refraining from throttling cilarnen for new annoyances was another have you seen much of the camp he finally said cilarnen shook his head after i thawed out i stayed with the centaurs comildhe became the leader of the levy that gathered at stonehearth after kindrius diedsaid it was best to stay out of the way of the elder brothers as much as possible good advice as far as it goes only you arent going to be able to do that anymore youll never be an elf but theyll make allowances for that your manners are good when you bother to use them so pay attention and learn how to fit in the elves dont seem very useful cilarnen said tentatively all they seem to do is talk about tea and the weather and half the time i cant figure out what theyre saying and their armoryour clothesits all so pretty from cilarnens tone pretty was not a compliment elven ways are not human ways sometimes they dont make sense at first sometimes they never make sense to humans at all kellen tried to sum up everything he had learned in a few simple sentences they love beauty so much that they try to make everything into an art that means fighting and weapons too let me tell you that pretty armor is strong and tough and flexible its saved my life more than once as they spoke kellen found that he was walking in the direction of the horselines a good destination thered be time to give firareth a little exerciseand to test cilarnens riding skills as well by the time they got there though he was weary with more than a nights lost sleep every answer he gave cilarnen seemed to breed more questions so he had armor was he a knight if he was a knight where had he learned to fight how could magic teach someone to fight though kellen knew that half cilarnens questions were an honest attempt to gain the information that would allow him to fit in to his strange new world and the other half an attempt to distract himself from his worries they still nibbled at kellens composure like a swarm of hungry mice at a bread loaf leaf and starhe didnt know the answers to half of themand the ones he could answer he didnt know how to not in any way cilarnen could understand any mention of the wild magic seemed to simply baffle cilarnen like attempting to explain color to a blind man true it had confused kellen when he began to study it but even then hed realized that there was a pattern within it somewhere cilarnen seemed wholly unable to grasp that patternor even the idea that there could be a pattern hes not a wildmage hell never be a wildmage they reached the horselines and cilarnenblessedlyshut up staring at the waiting ranks of destriers i thought wed go for a ride this morning ill have to go out and catch firareth first though what were you riding when you came cilarnen seemed to wilt slightly a mule a very nice mule of coursehis name is oakleaf butkellen the elves keep their promises dont they did someone promise you something kellen said carefully when i came from stonehearth lady sarlin gave me a horse her name was tinsin she was a plowhorsethe centaurs didnt have any riding horses of course she wasnt very fast nemermetour guidedidnt like that he took her away from me he said shed be well treated just as if she were elven stock and returned to stonehearth in the spring but then she will kellen said firmly the elves honor their allies and if you told nemermet that tinsin was your responsibility hed take that very seriously oh cilarnen said he seemed to relax a little i wasnt sure be sure kellen said seriously dont ever call an elf a liar dont even think it or you might find yourself in a challenge circle and im not even sure you can lift a sword remember about them making everything into an art their honor is an art too and they spend a lifetime perfecting it they walked out into the herd kellen stopped to pat familiar friends looking for firareth he should be with the nearer herd those who still had riders theyre all so beautiful cilarnen said longingly elvenbred from the fields of vardirvoshan and trained for war kellen said we should be able to find you something faster than a muleyoull need it to keep up with the army when its on the move how well do you ride better than you do cilarnen said smugly thats the last straw kellen turned to the nearest horse handler who was moving through the herd i see you anamitar it would please me greatly to know if anganil has yet found a rider chapter twentyfive gifts and promises calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink the young black stallion was yet unpartnered by the time kellen had brought in firareth and saddled him anganil had been brought to the horselines and his gear had been brought from storage he wore no armor and his saddletrappings were now all in white by the time anganil was saddled theyd collected something of an audience kellen supposed it wasnt very nice of him to set cilarnen up for a quick flight into a snowbankbut leaf and star the boy needed to stop making so many assumptions hes wartrained kellen warned swinging into his saddle hes young and he hasnt been ridden for a while if he likes you and you can stay in the saddle hes yours to ride for as long as youre with the army he felt safe in making that much of a promise especially since cilarnens possession of anganil wasnt likely to extend much beyond the next five minutes after that they could find him something he could handle he tried not to think of ciltesse who had chosen anganil hoping kellen would ride him ciltesse would have enjoyed this moment very much or been appalled by it but apparently cilarnen did know something about horses he took the time to make friends with the stallion stroking his nose and speaking gently to him kellen offered him a piece of honeycake and cilarnen fed anganil the stickysweet morsel so far so good when anganil had accepted his presence cilarnen quickly mounted the stallion held perfectly still merely lifting one hind hoof and setting it down again once theyd ridden away from camp however it was a different story it was just as well that cilarnen wasas hed claimeda good horsemanas anganil was fresh playful and very very bored after the third time the stallion plunged sidewise in feigned panic at a swirl of winddrifted snow kellen said youd better give him a run before he really starts playing up come on he spurred firareth into a canter then a gallop anganil was only too happy to follow kellen figured theyd probably have time for a good gallop up to the end of the camp and back in the distance he could see others taking advantage of the rest and the comparatively good weather there were teams of draft mules out clearing a level practice field for the cavalry units to drill on later and groups of elves were even building the elaborate and mysterious snowsculptures hed seen back in sentarshadeen after the first heavy snowfall anganil overtook firareth and kellen let him cilarnen still seemed to be in control but kellen could tell he was having to work for it then he saw shalkan shalkan was pacing them several hundred yards farther out the white unicorn was a ghost against the snow running effortlessly along the top of it kellen waved and shalkan tossed his head in response then suddenly cilarnen saw shalkan as well he stared transfixed at what was obviously the first unicorn hed ever seen for one moment no part of his attention was on anganil and anganil knew it the stallion put on a burst of speed then leaped into the air he came down on his forehand ducked his head and kicked out hard with his hind legs cilarnen went flying over his head into the snow anganil sprang sideways and began to run in good earnest oh no kellen had wanted cilarnen to take a fallbut not that hard a fall he checked firareth and vaulted from the saddle running to where cilarnen lay sprawled in the snow are you all right he demanded if hes deador hurtidalia will kill me and ill deserve it stupid stupid stupid but cilarnen seemed only to be breathlessand indignant he threw me off cilarnen said disgustedly allowing kellen to help him to his feet he looked around searching for anganil and now hes bolted he knew you werent paying attention those are some of the war moves i told you about kellen helped him up almost giddy with relief dont worry shalkan will bring him back thatwas a unicorn cilarnen said once hed mounted up behind kellen and they were riding off in the direction anganil had gone yes it was kellen smiled a little at the wonder in cilarnens voice his name is shalkan and hes my friend theres a dragon here too his name is ancaladar youll probably see him later shalkan had herded anganil in a wide circle and now the destrier was running toward them the unicorn at his heels kellen moved firareth to block the young destriers path anganil sensing that the game was up stopped and stood quietly switching his tail innocently you have the oddest ideas of fun shalkan said coming forward i suppose this is cilarnen it can talk cilarnen blurted kellen groaned inwardly and closed his eyes poor cilarnen when shalkan got done with him oh my yes shalkan said in his archest tones quite as well as a human isnt that surprising of course ive had a great deal more practice at talking than you seem to have why i can form complete sentences and say exactly what i mean for example but i mean i didnt that is cilarnen stuttered kellen ignored the byplay he dismounted walked over to anganil led the young stallion over to firareth and tied his reins firmly to firareths saddle he didnt intend to spend the rest of the morning chasing anganil through the snow if anganil took it into his head to dash off again then he walked over to shalkan he doesnt know about unicorns because nobody teaches anything about them in the cityanything important anyway kellen said in a voice low enough that cilarnen probably wouldnt hear which you know already and i havent had time to explain everything to him yet cilarnen clambered down from firareths back and came over to them apparently shalkan was willing to permit his approach for the unicorn stayed where he was cilarnen was staring at shalkan oblivious to the falling snow can i touch him he asked and the note of raw longing in his voice would have melted a much harder heart than kellens you have to ask shalkan kellen said its not my decision may i cilarnen asked speaking directly to shalkan now i didnt mean to insult you its just youre so beautiful hell give you a honeycake kellen said cunningly rummaging in his tunic bribery shalkan scoffed lowering his head and pawing at the snowbut apparently the combination of contrition bribery and flattery was sufficient after crunching his way through the honeycake held on cilarnens outstretched hand shalkan allowed himself to be touched from the look on cilarnens face he was willing to stand there forever stroking the soft fur of shalkans neck we need to get back kellen finallyreluctantlysaid he actually hated to tear cilarnen away the boy looked utterly smitten will i get to see you again cilarnen said to shalkan sounding forlorn kellen could tell that shalkan was trying very hard not to laugh but the unicorns voice when he answered was admirably steady oh have kellen bring you up to the unicorn camp whenever he likes you can meet the rest of us there with that shalkan turned and trotted off cilarnen turned to kellen his whole face a question you didnt think shalkan was the only one did you kellen said come on hed expected cilarnen to ride back with him but cilarnen moved confidently toward anganil cilarnen yes yes yes hes thrown me once and now hell see if he can do it again i know he looked over his shoulder at kellen with determination in the line of his jaw but you said i could try yes idalia would kill him and shed skin him first but how could he not give the boy a chance he was learning he was learning faster than kellen had in some ways go ahead try not to get killed he waited holding anganils headstall until cilarnen had mounted and then handed him the reins the ride back went pretty much as kellen had assumed it wouldwith one exception cilarnen was not thrown again once anganil realized that this very entertaining spectacle was not to be allowed to repeat itself he quieted down completely and the two destriers trotted sedately sidebyside back to the horselines cilarnen had only a little difficulty removing the unfamiliar tack and soon they were on their way back to kellens pavilion again and there was no doubt whatsoever that although meeting shalkan must have been the high point of cilarnens life riding the destrier had been the second highest he was so full of wonder and ebullience that a little of it actually bubbled over and made kellens spirits rise ive never ridden a horse like that before cilarnen said excitedly youve never seen a horse like that before kellen corrected him hyandur cilarnen began rode a palfreya riding horse not a warhorse anything elvenbred is beautiful kellen conceded but the destriers are special very very special kellen opened the flap of his tent and stepped inside calling light into the lanterns to brighten the gloom he noticed that isinwen had already lit the brazier and stoked it high it was actually warm in the tent and isinwen had indeed been busy there was a ewer and bowl waiting on the low table that had previously held the tea service and piled on the clothes chest were cilarnens new clothes not only was there a full outfit including boots gloves and cloakwith kellen did not doubt more to comeit all matched at least as far as kellen could tell and since it looked turquoise in the light of kellens tent it was probably blue kellen picked up the gloves now here was something odd there ought to be a pattern woven into the leggings embroidered on the tunic stamped into the leather of the gloves and boots but there wasnt how he wondered had isinwen managed that here you go he said gesturing at the clothing get dressed you might even have time to get something to eat before were supposed to be there assuming your appetites back cilarnen had carried the tunic over to the doorway and was studying it in the light blue he said in disgust like a student thats purely accident kellen said forcefully isinwen chose the color because he thought it would be becoming to you the clothes are warm youre not a knight so youre not stuck with the color you can change it you can ask for clothing to be made for you later in any color you like to my house colors maybe kellen tried to remember what they were and couldnt not if the elves dont think theyre suitable for your complexion though and only knights really have specific colors is that why everything you have is green here we go again it matches shalkans eyes as youve probably noticed now it would please me greatly if you would honor me by getting dressed youll be warmer and youll be appropriately garbed for the occasion cilarnen pulled off his gloves and began to unlace his short cloak i suppose since youre my friend youre telling me the truth about the clothes he said dubiously im not your friend kellen said with simple bluntness certainly not yet perhaps not ever cilarnen stopped then why did you give me anganil kellen thought hardand honestly to teach you he finally said cilarnen removed his cloak and set it aside for a few minutes he was occupiedin silencewith changing from old clothes to new stopping for a quick wash in between isinwen had even been able to provide a belt with a couple of carryingpouches though cilarnens own centaurmade knife would have to retain its own sheath until a new one could be made it would look odd but if he wore it toward the back it would be hidden by the cloak when cilarnen was dressed he tucked his gloves through his belt in the fashion of armethalieh and smoothed his hand down the thick velvet you wanted to teach me that this is neither armethalieh nor stonehearth he said understanding in his voice yes kellen said once more you must begin again i hope you can he held out the cloakhooded anklelength and lined in ermine cilarnen no longer looked like a rustic wild lands farmer he looked elegant and patrician kellen cilarnen said in a troubled voice remember that i told you i saw the thing at stonehearth as if ive forgotten that for an instant it looked human at firstwhen it spoke to me it was wearing odd clothes all white clothes id never seen before until now not exactly like these but similar it was dressed like an elf kellen wasnt sure what that meant but he was sure it was something meaningful and bad youll need to draw what you saw for us as exactly as you can it may be important he thought hard for a moment in fact every tiny little detail you can remember might be critical cilarnen nodded soberly colors mattered to the elves white was the color of the unformedanganils tack had been white because he had no master it was also the color of the shrouds the elves used to suspend their dead in the trees the color of unmaking when kellen and cilarnen arrived at redhelwars tent the senior commanders and some othersjermayan idalia vestakia representatives of the centaur and high reaches fighting forces a few other wildmageswere already there the honored guest arrives last kellen reminded himself he hadnt expected quite so large an audience for cilarnens speech but he suspected that rumors were already flying about the camp and it would be just as well to be able to provide hard information in as many directions as possible as quickly as possible to keep those rumors from growing small cups of tea were served a token formality only you have spoken with cilarnen highmage of armethalieh kellen redhelwar said coming quickly to the point what have you learned i believe him indeed to be cilarnen volpiril kellen said carefully best to settle the obvious questions first vestakia sensed no taint in him nor did shalkan object to either his presence nor his touch i would say he is who he seems and the reason for his presence here redhelwar asked in stonehearth one of them spoke to him as if he were me he looked at cilarnen curiously why had kardus brought cilarnen to him hed never thought to ask i had to tell someone cilarnen said someone who could help kardus said to tell you the wild magic gave kardus the task of bringing cilarnen and his information to me kellen said setting the pieces of the puzzle into a form the elves would easily understand from the look upon both your faces the news that cilarnen brought is of grave importance belepheriel said it would be good if you would share it with us tell them what it said to you kellen said once more cilarnen recited the words the demon had spoken to him in stonehearth he might have dropped a bolt of lightning in their midst and gotten less reaction a foothold in the human city padredor exclaimed impossiblethey could not breach its wards any more than they can breach our own yet if i ken these words aright they have breached them adaerion pointed out yet one does not properly understand what catspaws could they use in a place where everyone must be human and all magic but magemagic is banned we have to find out kellen said he looked at idalia she shook her head i havent had any luck seeing the city since we fled the last scouring hunt the gods know ive tried but nothing and putting that together with this news makes me very uneasy there is another matter i would raise concerning cilarnen kellen said choosing his words with care i do not speak against his honor yet it is a mystery he is here because he was banished as i was from armethalieh it is the custom of the high mages to burn the magegift from the minds of those they banish that they did not do it in my case was an oversight and the work of the wild magic he did not doubt yet cilarnens was not destroyedonly suppressed until the day of the battle at stonehearth who was supposed to do it idalia asked if were looking for treasonous mages theres a place to start it was undermage lord anigrel cilarnen said i suppose master anigrel could have been elevated kellen said doubtfully but he was lycaelons private secretary you might as well expect lycaelon himself to be plotting to overthrow the city could it have gone wrong idalia asked could he have tried to burn it out and just missed cilarnen shook his head i am no mindhealer my ladyone must study for years to become adept at thatbut i know a little of the theory to miss would have killed me to leave me whole but without my gift that is as delicate a thing asas taking the spice out of brewed tea to simply put it to sleep so i didnt even know it was there that is more delicate work still yet he shook his head yet i think now that is what was deliberately done could a journeyman do it kellen asked that had been anigrels rank and by the way the city worked it would be for years to come cilarnen shook his head again smiling painfully it is not what i studied would have studied but mindwork is only done by a master undermage and work so delicate i would say would require a magisterpractimusa full high mageat least how delicate kellen asked is it just that you need a light touch or a mind for details or what exactly i dont know kellen i was only an entered apprentice id barely begun my studies in the art magickal cilarnen protested you know more than anyone else here kellen said youre going to have to make your best guesses and tell us all you can ill tell you what i know cilarnen said hesitating over the last word you know the mageborn swear oaths not to speak about the high magick to the commons but dont worry that ill hold anything back ive already broken those oaths he looked miserableno more than that lost kellen didnt know what to say to comfort him when you were banished from your city cilarnen high mage your people took your name and your rank from you belepheriel said with the gravity of a judge in doing that they also took from you all your sworn oaths in speaking now you violate nothing and may save many it is a new way you must learn now but this is a time of learning new ways thank you cilarnen said softly bowing his head unconsciously he touched his chest where his citytalisman would have hung it looks like anigrel is where we need to start idalia said briskly and i very much want to see whos sitting on the high council these days if theres been a shift there and who lycaelon is now claiming as his son the question is how that is a matter to be settled among wildmages redhelwar said firmly what my commanders and i must know is the extent of this foothold it spoke of so that we may determine what to do idalia bowed we will bring you this information as quickly as we can redhelwar she and the other wildmages left the pavilion kellen and cilarnen remained behind redhelwar regarded kellen brows raised kellen bowed you would speak redhelwar observed i would kellen agreed you know it has long been in my mind that this campaign has been their attempt to keep us from seeing what needs to be seen and it is now in your mind that while we dally here they strike first at armethalieh redhelwar said not dally kellen said and not strike i believei believe that this is a very different sort of warfare than they have ever practiced before the mageborn i believe remember them and fear them though they keep the fact a closelyguarded secret i do not believe that a foothold could be taken by force but by seduction as one of them tried to seduce me at the black cairn if it had workedif i had believed its liesperhaps i would now be the agent you were all searching for in armethalieh no redhelwar said somberly for we would all be dead of drought and wildfire but should armethalieh fight for the darkness instead of the light go with idalia kellen see what knightmagery and high magick can do to assist her kellen bowed again and left taking cilarnen with him they caught up to the other wildmages at the edge of the mountainfolk camp redhelwar sent us to see what we could do to help kellen explained i cant think of a thing i can do he added shrugging not until we have some idea of what were going to do idalia agreed she turned her attention to cilarnen i know there are wards but ive never worked on them he said so i have no idea of how to get past them the little ones for things like keeping mice out of grainive helped with those what about distanceseeing spells idalia asked cilarnen looked perfectly blank why idalia how could you ever imagine that any of the mageborn would ever want to see anything that happened outside the city kellen thought mockingly if such spells existed in the arsenal of the high magick they were undoubtedly restricted to the higher ranks of the mageborn cilarnen wouldnt have begun to learn them for yearsdecades well well get started i want to try a few thingsand have jermayan and ancaladar try them too atroist and some of the lost lands wildmages have arrived and they know a number of ways of doing things im not familiar with but i dont think well need your help yet join us here for dinner and ill let you know how far weve gotten bring wine kellen laughed shortly at the morose tone of idalias voice wine it is he said come on cilarnen well go up to the unicorn camp and catch them up on the gossip shalkan will pin my ears back if i dont they stopped first at the dining tent to collect a cold lunch and some treats for the horses and soon were riding up to the unicorn camp anganil behaved himself far better on this journey than he had on the last so we dont have anything to do for the rest of the day cilarnen asked you may not kellen said when we get back im going to see if the practice field is free if it is ill take my troop out for a couple of hours of drill you should see artenel about getting some armor fittedyou may not be able to use a sword but youll still need armor i can use a sword cilarnen protested master kalos said i would have made a fine swordsmani studied with him thrice a sennight reedblade kellen said struggling to keep his voice neutral cilarnen was right to be proud of his skill but it was useless in war it is not the sort of sword we carry in the field you think its useless cilarnen said stung pay attention to your mount i did not say that i have never studied reedblade the quickness and coordination those skills will probably transfer to another weapon if you wish to learn one but the swords we use take a great deal of strength and learning any weapon takes time and you are a mage not a knight youre both cilarnen pointed out and im not much of a mage leaf and star send me a selken trader kellen kept his voice patient im a particular kind of wildmage called a knightmage im very good at fighting not as good at wildmagery its nice to know theres something youre not good at cilarnen muttered kellen wondered if cilarnen had meant him to hear the remark it was odd to think that cilarnen must be just as offbalance and resentful as he was now that their situations were reversed here kellen must seem to have all the advantages cilarnen had once possessed plus a higher rank than cilarnen had ever held well the truth wouldnt hurt at the moment youre the best high mage in a thousand leagues you are our only expert in high magery and as for magecraft who knows what the future may hold you cant believe the city would ever take me back cilarnen said in disbelief i believe i do not knowand neither do you kellen said firmly if there is one thing ive learned its that you should be very careful how you use the words never and forever because you might have to eat them one day they reached the unicorn camp in the distance beyond the camp kellen could see plumes of snow arcing from the ground as the remaining unicorn knights engaged in elaborate war games theyre practicing kellen said lets go watch before hed gotten his own command hed participated in a few of these games but even a knightmages skill couldnt quite make up for years of practice and he still hadnt entirely mastered the long elven lance both teams were armed with the lance the object of the game was a small leather ring to be picked up on the lance point carried off and defended there were as far as kellen could tell no other rules he and cilarnen stood well back from the edge of the field as the unicorns darted in and out among each other springing like deer as their riders vied strenuously for possession of the mostlyinvisible object occasionally one unicorn would leap right over another and woe to the rider who didnt duck in time they ride them cilarnen asked sounding surprised by mutual consent kellen said why are they all the way out here cilarnen asked kellen suspected the direction this conversation was going to go but he really had no choice there were things cilarnen needed to know and if he found out things kellen would rather he didnt know in addition well that was a part of paying his price unicorns are creatures of magic magic has limitations as well as advantages what did they teach you about unicorns in armethalieh cilarnen frowned their horn is proof against poison that they share the nature of both the goat and the lion and only virgins can tame them their horns purify just about anything their nature is their own and no one can actually tame a unicorn but only virgins can be around them kellen corrected virgin meaning someone who is both chaste and celibateand they can definitely tell so thats why theyre all this way from the rest of the camp cilarnen said accepting kellens explanation without a blink thats right come to tell us whats going on shalkan asked before cilarnen could come up with any more questions or is the game more interesting oh im sure theyve come for a quiet chat gesade said kellen looked over his shoulder the two unicorns were standing behind them lets go back to the unicorn camp he said to cilarnen when they reached the edge he swung down off firareth and patted his shoulder drop anganils reins to the ground and tell him to stand kellen said to cilarnen he wont wander cilarnen looked dubious but followed kellens suggestion they made their way to the center of camp kellen added more charcoal to the communal brazier the two unicorns waited expectantly gesades ears flicked back and forth as she followed the sound of his movements if cilarnen noticed her blindness he had the sense not to mention it kellen told his part of the story and encouraged cilarnen to add his own just as he had told it to kellen early this morning i hardly think that was fair gesade said when cilarnen had finished you were trying to do the right thing i didnt think cilarnen said still sounding confused by his own actions mymy father would not have listened the whole city knew that but any of the mageborn has the right of personal appeal to the archmage it would have been a hideous scandal i would certainly have been disowned but it would have been better it wouldnt have worked kellen said flatly i dont say this because because hes a hidebound monster who tried to kill me twice kellen we all knew cilarnen said tactfully you and lycaelon didnt get on yes kellen said but dont you see cilarnen its like war lycaelon was on one side the other twelve members of the high council were on the other those odds are not good for winning and we now know that they are involved somehow a thought struck him i think that all of this might have been arranged to empty a council seat your friendsdid any of them have connections to the high council cilarnen didnt even have to think unlike kellen he must have had the ranks and lineage of every one of the mageborn committed to memory jorade was the greatgreatgrandnephew of lord isasand his heir geont was a pentres but the pentreses are allied to the breulins and lord breulin sits upon the council so of the six of you three had council connections what of master raellan he helped us a great dealwithout him we would never have found each other but im sure he had no connection to the high council he was a journeymanof a minor house at best perhaps even the son of a commoner like poor tiedor he never did give a family name and we thought it would be tactless to ask but you trusted him with all your lives because he was mageborn kellen didnt ask what had happened to master raellen it would be too cruel cilarnen didnt know what had happened to any of them by now they were either dead living somewhere in the city stripped of their magegift and their memories orif theyd been incredibly luckysimply didnt remember anything about the whole conspiracy at all kellen you dont think it all happened just so someone else could take a council seat cilarnen sounded horrified kellen didnt answer it seemed likely to him in the normal course of things there wouldnt have been a vacancy for yearseven decades if one of the tainted is on the council they have more of a stranglehold than a foothold gesade said assuming i understand how your high council works what does redhelwar plan shalkan asked to see what idalia and the others can come up with to see into the city kellen said and to make his plans depending on what they do see scrying was not the answer idalia and the others ruled that out quickly enougheven jermayan with ancaladars power to draw on could not force the scrying bowl to show him armethalieh flowers idalia said in rueful exasperation looking at the image in the bowl very nice i dont think im happy to know that spring will come of course but it isnt very helpful to send a spy into the city was impossible to send anything but magic across the citywards was impossible but they had to find the right spell it was atroist who provided the first clue to the answer the lostlands wildmages were accustomed to speaking to one another over far distancesidalia and jermayan had seen such a spell at work when atroist spoke with drothi but it needs a focus at the other end atroist said and i do not think you will find one in your golden city of mages then combine it with a scrying spellor parts of one anyway tarik said that doesnt need a focus but scrying is unfocused idalia pointed out it shows you what you need not what you wantand this time we need to see exactly what we want then blend in some hunt magic tarik suggested when you go hunting for deer its no use at all calling hares to see is well and good jermayan said but you do not need merely to see you need also to know so this must be not just a spell of seeing but a spell of knowing such as kellen uses it does you no good to see if you do not understand what you see there is a spell the forest wife teaches us a wildmage named kavaaeri said slowly she was one of the few female wildmages to have come with the high reaches folk we use it for herbs and mushrooms so that we are sure of them before we use them it is not a knightmage spell but it is a spell of knowing the discussion went on at dusk kellen collected cilarnen from the centaur encampment and went to join the wildmages hed worried about whether cilarnen would be able to stand the proximity of so many wildmageshe suspected from what kardus had told him that being around wildmages for cilarnen was like being around nonvirgins for shalkan its not too bad cilarnen said its just it feels as if something terrible is going to happen but nothing ever does i can stand it as long as nobody casts a spell on me he added darkly wed almost always ask your permission kellen assured him unless you were unconscious and it was for a healingor to keep you from harming someone else well i dont ever want a spell cast on me cilarnen said fervently to heal me or for anything else if im going to hurt somebody stop me some other way kellen didnt answer he wasnt about to make a promise he might not be able to keep the wildmages were gathered together in one of the great lodgetents of the mountainfolk a structure large enough to accommodate several dozen people at once and tall enough at its domed center for kellen to stand comfortably upright even kardus was there kneeling among the others and looking perfectly at ease though kellen wasnt sure how the centaur had managed to negotiate the narrow doorway both kellen and cilarnen were carrying rucksacks though wine was difficult to find in an elven camp with vestakias and isinwens help kellen had managed to assemble a number of bottles of things that moreorless fit the definition from mead to hard cider to elven fruit cordials to some actual bottles of wine he hoped idalia appreciated the effort the lodge was filled with the good smells of roast meat and fresh bread and the residue of enough magic to make him want to sneeze though cilarnen didnt seem to react to it looking around kellen saw a seat by idalia and moved toward it cilarnen went to sit by kardus you look tired kellen said folding himself easily into a crosslegged position beside his sister a long day of battering my head against the merely difficult idalia said gloomily we are to call hares and become mushrooms jermayan explained kindly presuming kindolhinadetil will grant us the loan of a mirror yes of course kellen said with only a touch of irony that makes perfect sense he opened the rucksack and passed idalia one of the wine bottles spoiled fruit jermayan pronounced regarding it kellen grinned and offered him one of the cordials the food had been cooked elsewhere now the platters of meatroast muttonand baskets of bread began to pass around the meal was conducted in the style of the high reaches with several people sharing a communal platter as they ate idalia filled him in on what theyd accomplished that day so while we think we may have a spell that will allow us to see whats going on in the city we arent sure we have enough power to cast it she finished there were three components to each spell of the wild magic the power to cast the spellalways paid personally by the wildmagethe power of the spells workwhich could be shared among manyand the mageprice which the wildmage alone paid idalia was saying that this spell was so powerful she didnt even have the power to cast it kellen looked at jermayan not even ancaladar and i i have spoken to him and there is yet another difficulty were i to be the one who cast this spell one we know theyll notice its only a matter of time thered probably be a little more time if a human were to cast it instead of an elf two its not just a spell of seeing but of knowing idalia said which means it would work best of all if somebody familiar with the city cast it kellen finished because theyd already have some idea of what they were seeing and wouldnt have to learn as much that means you me or cilarnen that means me idalia corrected cilarnens not a wildmage and youre a knightmage id have the best chance of successif i had the power to cast it what about using a keystone kellen said like before idalia shook her head firmly we thought of that and drelech cast the talking stones to see if that would work it needs to be a living source as the platters were cleared away the discussion returned once more to the spell kellen could tell that the wildmages were now covering ground they had covered before hoping for a solution he could see cilarnen and kardus talking quietly between themselves jermayan was watching them alertly probably able to hear what was being said at last cilarnenwho had obviously needed to be persuaded of somethingmade his way into the middle of the lodge and got to his feet the discussion stopped i am unfamiliar with your magic he began hesitantly and i do not mean to offend but kardus tells me i must ask why do you not simply link your magic as the high mages do kellen had rarely had the pleasureif that was the wordof seeing his sister so completely nonplussed sit down over here she said explain cilarnen darted an agonized glance at kellen kellen did his best to look encouraging cilarnen came and sat down in front of idalia doing his best to keep a respectable distance between them in armathalieh cilarnen said obviously searching for just the right words the high mages work together sharing their power it is part of every mages training to learn to meld the power each holds into a greater whole for the good of the city i had thought he faltered to a stop but it was something wildmages never learnednever needed to learn because wildmages were usually solitary creatures who drew their power from themselves from willing donors and from paying their mageprices its true kellen said shrugging anigrel told me they may steal the citizens personal power with the talismans and use that instead of their own but they still share the power among themselves when they do a working somehow is that cilarnen began staring at kellen idalia interrupted him do you know how this is done cilarnen can you tell me i know how to do it cilarnen said slowly i can tell you what the high mages dobut i cannot do it with you not with a wildmage his voice held unfeigned horror i promise you cilarnen if we figure this out i will only practice on another wildmage idalia said gently jermayan would ancaladar consent to be a part of such a sharing i do not know jermayan said his voice was troubled first we must see if such a thing can be learned but before even that could be attempted it had to be explainedand there they nearly came to grief for cilarnen was a high mage of the golden city and high magick and wildmagery were nothing alike prayers to the light fasting proper incense huntsman strike me if i do any such thing a wildmage named kerleu growled a few moments into cilarnens explanation nor am i going to wave my hands and babble to empty air like a mad thing cilarnen muttered under his breath patience friends wirance said his hands out in a placating gesture before things could grow more heated we will take what we can usebut we cannot do even that if you do not let the boy finish his explanation proper preparation proper intent kellen said struggling to translate between the magic he only dimly rememberedand hadnt studied all that closelyand the one he knew shielding of course the working areas are shielded cilarnen snapped even you should remember that kellen held on to his temper with an effort what comes next he asked evenly cilarnen explained and explained again and again well try this again tomorrow idalia said with a sigh maybe it will make more sense then i dont know about anyone else but im tired cilarnen youve been very patient and you look like you could use a good nights sleepand i know you can kellen and better to call a halt now before tempers were well and truly lost kellen thought right come on cilarnen they were the first out of the lodge but waited outside for kardus ill see you back to your tent kellen said you dont have to cilarnen said oh but how else will i know where it isso i can wake you up in the middle of the night kellen said lightly they walked a little to the side out of the path of the emerging wildmages why cant they understand it cilarnen said in frustration its so simple its a different kind of magic kellen said its likelike trying to learn to play a lute when youve only ever played a trumpet wildmages generally work alone its even possible a wildmage might not meet another wildmage in his or her entire life cilarnen shook his head obviously finding the very concept unnatural what you said back thereabout the city talismans its why your spells dont work very welland why the high mages are so powerful kellen replied instantly glad for the opening to let the boy know the truth about the talismans here outside the city the only thing that fuels your magic is your own personal power havent you felt weak after casting a spell yes but thats why youre only using your own power not the power gathered from the whole city kardus joined themsquirming less than gracefully out through the lodges doorway which had certainly not been designed for centaursand the three of them began to walk toward kardus and cilarnens tent but then im not ever going to be able to use most of the spells i know cilarnen said maybe kellen said anigrel told me that everyone has the power that fuels magery nonmages have no use for it so the mages figured out a way to harvest and store it his voice hardened they didnt ask permission and they dont pay for what they take thats wrong no cilarnen said slowly they do pay for itwith all the spells they do for the city the power has to come from somewhere you said so the mages work hard to keep the city runningi worked hard when i was an entered apprentice but now he nodded youre right about one thing they should still tell people what theyre doing the commons have a right to know that theyre helping the city too it was a way of looking at the matter that kellen hadnt considered before and it was true that the city was a pleasant place to liveif you followed the rules so youd have the high mages tell the people what they were doing he asked curiously what if someone didnt want to have his power harvested he held his breath waiting for cilarnens answer let it be the right one its just another taxlight knows there are taxes enough cilarnen said shrugging dismissively if they didnt want to pay this one theyd have to leave i suppose because theres no way to live in the city without getting the benefit of the spells and it wouldnt be fair to everyone else to let them stay a season mucking out stalls in one of the delfier villageslike i did in stonehearthmight convince them theyd rather pay the tax or they might like to farm and not pay it but either way theyd know what was being taken and whether or not they were willing to pay it its not right to take it without telling them kellen let out his breath in a long sigh the right answer indeedand a number of ideas that would have the entire high council in spinning fits if it ever heard them there may be a solution to your problem of a power source but well need to solve idalias first kellen said theyd reached the tentand just in time the snow which had been falling in a thin powdery dust began to thicken and kellen felt the sting of sleet sleep well he said and turned away kellen and his troop spent the following day with vestakia at the further cavern as she attempted to communicate with the crystal spiders it was frustrating worknot because the gentle otherworldly creatures werent willing to help but because they were vestakias mind was flooded with images and information she found it impossible to interpret i think she said sitting up in the midst of a ring of softly glowing spiders that they do sense their kindred in other caverns and i think there is at least one more cavern of shadowed elvesif i am understanding anything they tell me but kellenif they never leave their caverns how can they tell me where the cavern is kellen shook his head there had to be a solution to that riddle if they could only find it at least we know we need to keep looking maybe theres something well distinctive enough that someone could recognize it if i could describe it vestakia said but im getting a proper headache seeing the world through eight eyes instead of two then you need to stop tell them youll come back and talk with them again maps we need maps showing where all the caves beneath the elven lands are too bad there arent any vestakia sighed and lay back down the crystal spiders moved over her in a softlyglowing wave and then retreated once she had spoken to them moving quickly into the far depths of the cave she rolled to her knees kellen turned away and isinwen moved forward to help her to her feet he mustnt think about her mustnt care if she was cold or tired because if he did hed never be able to stop and hed never stop with just thinking i know what youre going to ask jermayan waited the remains of ancaladars breakfastvestakia had brought the bullock up before shed left for the cavernwas nothing more than a few smears of blood upon the snow the dragon was a tidy eater keeping him fed had not precisely been a strain on the armys resources but it had required careful planning still a promise was a promise ancaladar had not had to hunt for himself since he had accepted jermayans bond last night after the wildmages conclave jermayan had come here to the place he and ancaladar often shared it was an icepavilion similar to others he had built but large enough to hold ancaladar comfortably and shelter the dragon from the wind and the snow there was even stabling for valdien for ancaladars pavilion was a certain distance from the camp almost at the edge of the forest to discourage idle sightseers jermayan had explained everything that had taken place perhaps it was only an act of courtesyjermayan was still not entirely certain how much of his thoughts the dragon sharedbut he found that talking matters over with his friend helped to clear his own mind he had asked for nothing ask then the dragon was coiled halfout of his pavilion his sinuous neck curved about so that his jaw rested on the snow just before his foreclaws jermayan swung down from valdiens saddle and walked forward will youwill wejoin in this link idalia proposes i do not yet understand how it may be done but she seems to feel it can be learned and cilarnen is anxious to teach it i could say no ancaladar said jermayan knew that the dragons greatest fearbordering on paranoiawas to be takenused as nothing more than a reservoir of magical power he knelt in the snow by ancaladars head beloved i will let no one harm you at least it is a risk all will share equally every wildmage without our power i do not think it will succeed and nothing can destroy our bond if i said no you could force me ancaladar said very softly you could take what you needed but i would not jermayan said reaching out to stroke ancaladars head i would only ask for your help i would never take what you did not wish to give ancaladar hesitated jermayan could feel the dragons fear and felt it begin to ebb yes ancaladar said at last we will share in the spells when kellen and his party reached the camp again there was good news awaiting them weve solved the problemthe first of them anyway idalia said thered been a message waiting at the horselines for kellen to come and see her and hed finally tracked her down in her tent he was surprised to see cilarnen there as well he was lying on idalias bedroll a compress over his eyes idalia shrugged following kellens look oh he doesnt want any spells cast on him but he doesnt have any objection to casting spells on someone else so after we spent the morning getting nowhere kardus finally got the idea of asking him about the other spells he knew he cast something called knowing on atroistall with permission of courseand put the spell directly into atroists mind atroist got a hideous headache and cilarnen passed out but then atroist knew exactly how the high mages perform the linking spell and was able to explain it to the rest of us were going to try it tonight now that kindolhinadetils mirror has arrived we dont need the link for that but its a good idea to practice it and how was your day less exciting kellen said blinking at idalias matteroffact summary if you had asked him two days ago just how likely this wasa high mage casting a spell on a wildmagehed have assumed the questioner was mad to even think the idea vestakia says the crystal spiders think theres at least one more cavern to clear but shes having trouble finding out just where it is he was still trying to wrap his mind about what shed just told him so blithely idalia cilarnen atroistsomething could have gone wrong he finished inadequately they both knew the risks we all discussed them before we tried it they both agreed it was probably more dangerous to atroist all things considered considering kellen thought that cilarnen was a less than halftrained high mage it was entirely possible that he could have killed atroist but this was war and they had both known the risks and it did work cilarnens voice sounded faint and very hoarse he sat up with a stifled groan running his fingers through his hair and blinked owlishly at kellen there were dark shadows under his eyes and he looked as if hed just recovered from a high fever and i didnt kill anybody no idalia said and you certainly put on quite a show kellen wondered what it was cilarnen had done exactly i dont think i could light a candle right now cilarnen said he felt around himself obviously searching for something its over here idalia said indicating the table i had one of the healers not a wildmagebring it after you dropped it i didnt know if a wildmages handling it would make a difference neither do i cilarnen shrugged its just a tool but no one but one of the mages would ever touch one in the city kellen glanced over at the table lying on it was a crudely finished length of ash wood a mageborns wand he shifted to spellsightit was truly secondnature nowand saw the residue of power eddying through the wood fading slowly the more it was used the more attuned to its owner it would becomeor so magetheory held youll want to finish that he heard himself saying artenel can loan you the tools and give you the proper grade of silver for the caps youll need a beltcase too just as if i were a proper mage cilarnen said a note of bitter humor in his voice now all i lack is a dozen other tools a library of spellbooks and a lifetime of training it is not meet to harvest the fruit before the seed is planted kellen said quoting master belesharon once more in other words the future will take care of itself idalia said and i wouldnt be too surprised to find that some of those things could come into our hands if we need them now kellen well need your help with this spell because i want you to be my anchor for the big one for that well need somebody keeping an eye on things in case well just in case and no one better than a knightmage so youll need the practice as well kellen nodded he wasnt looking forward to any of thisif someone was going to poke a stick into the hornets nest hed much prefer it to be him rather than idalia but he had to admit that her logic was sound a wildmage would be better at a spell of pure wildmagery than a knightmage and a wildmage raised in armethalieh would have the best chance of all lady idalia would it be permissible for me to watch cilarnen asked not if it is forbidden of course he added quickly on the condition that you stop calling me lady idalia its just idalia and if you think you can walk that far idalia said who knows we might make a wildmage of you yet she added with a smile the eternal light forfend cilarnen replied but for the first time it sounded as if he had a bit of a sense of humor about it he got carefully to his feet and tucked his wand securely inside his tunic it would have been impossible to gather the wildmages together properly for this work in any of the structures within the camp except the main dining tent and that would have inconvenienced far too many people since they would need it for at least two days so jermayan and ancaladar had once again created an icepavilion for the work as they had for atroists calling spellonly this one was several times larger than that had been the icepavilion was circular and glowed with coldfirean eerie sight in the dusk its polished surfacea faithful though enormous replica of a traditional elven campaigning tentwas already crusted white with newfallen snow ancaladar was coiled around it kellen guessed from cilarnens lack of reaction that hed already seen ancaladar for the first time earlier today ah the dragon said the young mage who makes such lovely colors come to see what the wildmages will do with the fruits of your wisdom indeed i have cilarnen said his voice shook only slightlythough with cold wearinessor astonishment at conversing with a dragonit was difficult to say but i think i can safely promise not to learn anything ancaladar laughed go inside before you freeze and behold the wonders of kindolhinadetils mirror the three of them stepped inside some of the other wildmages were already present jermayan had crafted a bench that ran all the way around the edge of the pavilion and cilarnen moved toward it quickly idalia had seen the mirror before kellen hadnt he stared it was a perfect oval as tall as he was set in a wide standing frame the frame was of a lightcolored finegrained wood intricately carved but it was hard to say with what each time kellen was certain he had identified an object depicted in the frame and the basefruit and flower tree and birdit seemed to change was that a deer or a wolf or was it a vine he gave up but then he looked directly at the mirror it was made of a single thick pane of flawless rockcrystal backed with elvensilver and the reflection it gave back was utterly perfect kellen hadnt had much time for mirrors lately thered been none in the wildwood and hed paid little attention to the small ones in the house in sentarshadeen since then well he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a mirror was this him he faced a stranger a man and one he wouldnt want to face in battle either he towered over cilarneneven after several moonturns working in stonehearths stables youd never mistake cilarnen for anything but an armethaliehan mageborn kellen theyd call me a high reaches barbarian trying to pass for an elf he thought with an inward grin well if he wanted nothing to do with the city the city had obviously returned the favor he turned away from the mirror its certainly impressive he said it will serve our needs jermayan said with a dismissive shrug the rest of you have had all day to figure out this spell kellen said as more wildmages began to arrive now youre going to have to explain it to me chapter twentysix against all odds calibrelink calibrelink calibrelink well at heart it seems to be most like a healing spell that you stop in the middle idalia said and no actual healing takes place everyone who uses magic has personal shieldswith every gift comes an equal weakness wildmages can sense more of the world around them than nonwildmageswithout shields to block that out sometimes wed drown in all that information or be far more vulnerable to spells cast against us than nonwildmages or just to the random influences of magical otherfolk even if they didnt mean to affect us you dont have that problem as much as we do but then i cant cast spells as well kellen finished right idalia said pleased that he understood the matter so easily and seemed willingso farto go along with her plans a natural balance so we need to drop those shields blend our powers and act as one she tried to sound confident and assured shed refused to accept jermayans betrothal pendant for fear that it would establish a deeper form of just such a link as she was proposing to forge nowallowing him to see into her mind and perhaps glimpse her unpaid price in its fullness but that had been before so many things his bond with ancaladar for one the discovery of precisely how much trouble they were all in for another she could just hope that with so many minds joined all focused upon their task the secret of her unpaid mageprice would remain unshared tonight we charge the mirror with our shared energy idalia announced formally once everyone had arrived even kardus was therethough the centaur wildmage had no innate magic nor any ability to cast spells he was as much a wildmage as any of them making it possibly the largest keystone any of us has ever seen tomorrow in the lightat noonwe will work the spell and see what we can see of armethalieh in addition to his mirror kindolhinadetil has sent namanar from ysterialpoerins flower forestghostwoodwhich we will need for the spell i have spoken with redhelwar tonight he will speak with the army and see who will share in the price of the spell not the healers wirance said they may be needed and not all the army kellen said even if they all volunteer we could still be attacked agreed idalia said kellen you and redhelwar make the disposition of the units that will not be involved theyll need to be well away from here when the spell is cast and now lets get to work normally the charging of a keystoneeven a big onewould have been simple but for this they needed a circle of protection as well idalia walked around outside the edge of the gathering drawing a faint line on the snow floor of the pavilion with her walking staff then she returned to the center and threw a handful of herbs on the waiting brazier kellen felt the wall of protection go up around them and a sudden sense of utter quiet descended upon him and more than that it was like that night at the battle for the farther cavern when he had used his battlesight to see every unit of the army at once only now it was the wildmages around him that he sensed and he realized that he could draw upon their power as easily as he could call upon his own but right now that was not his task kellen relaxed as much as he could remembering what idalia had saidthat this was like a healing he concentrated on not concentrating on being a vessel of power for another to draw from he felt the magic shift and flow through himhis own othersstrange but not uncomfortable and then it was done kindolhinadetils mirror radiated power like a furnace the clear crystal sheet of mirror glowing with an inward light to the senses of a wildmageor knightmage one more of that will be more than enough for me wirance said firmly as soon as the shields had been dismissed still it will work and i think it is something we shall do more of in the future atroist said glancing at his fellow lost lands wildmages with such strength to draw on even the most difficult healing could be made easy to each fox his own hare wirance said agreeably the assembly began to disperse jermayan ancaladar and idalia would remain here tonight to ensure that the mirror was not tampered withfor even the most benign of reasons kellen took the opportunity to walk back with atroist he wanted to hear how the migration of the lostlanders into the wild lands had gone all came as drothi promised atroist said by the grace of the good goddess it was as if the attention of the dark folk was turned elsewhere for that time for if their creatures had harried us upon the way we would not now be here and the firstlings met us far outside their own borders with mules and wagons to speed the journey and see us safely through their own lands once we are settled in the west the young men and the rest of the wildmages will return to honor our bargain and join with the army though it is not comfortable to hear that the dark folk have been seen in the western lands as well i did not know it when i asked your aid kellen said im not certain how they manage it nevertheless the west is a soft and pleasant land atroist said much in need of strong backs and hard workers to make it bloom the springtide will be a glorious sight if any of us lives to see it kellen thought his work that night was far from done but fortunately the spell of preparing the mirror had taken very little of his energy he went from the icepavilion to redhelwars pavilion where he briefed the armys general on idalias plans and the part the army would share in the spell for a healing a physical link was needed between the wildmage and those who shared in the price fortunately that wouldnt be necessary in this caseor vestakia could weave a cartload of blankets out of all the hair that would have to be gathered you say you would wish to withhold certain elements of the army from sharing in the spellprice redhelwar said it is unlikely that any will wish to refuse to pay the price so it will save time to make our dispositions now the wounded will not participate of course nor will the healers kellen said i would wish to withhold a third of the army and support troopsin case of attack and to deal with those matters which cannot be set aside such as the care of the horses those who participate they could fight if they had to but they will be exhausted losses would be heavy and we have had too many losses already so redhelwar brought out a thickand muchamendedscroll listing each unit by name and they got to work when their dispositions had been made redhelwar summoned his senior commanders and kellen had to explain the entire matter again albeit in a much shorter version this time next the senior commanders would brief their subcommanders who would explain matters to their commands tomorrow at the morning meal redhelwar would address the army when those of his komentaiia who were to share in the price brought him their consent to participate in the wildmages spell they would also bring the consent of every person serving under them redhelwar would consent to share the price of the spell and in doing so would bring with him the consent of all the others if there were an attack it would deprive the army of its general which was why kellen had been careful to exclude two of the senior commanders from the price but it was the only way in magical terms redhelwar was the army just as in sentarshadeen andoreniel was the city only redhelwar could properly give consent to participate on behalf of the entire army otherwise the wildmages themselves and not proxies would have to hear consent from each of the soldiers individuallyand theyd still be listening a sennight from now but though redhelwar would be the only one formally asked all who participated in the spell would have been asked and consented that was the way it must be with that accomplished kellen had one last task before him tomorrow he would be acting as a knightmage which meant he must ask his troop to share in the price he gathered them together in a corner of the dining tent of the original thirty he had been given to command there were less than a dozen left the others were all new to him added to his command since the battle of the farther cavern briefly he explained to them what was to be done tomorrow and the part they would be asked to play and now i must ask is there anyone here who will share in the price of the spell the elves exchanged glances foolish human ambanireone of the new recruitssaid we all will of course the others nodded kellen you know you dont have to ask isinwen said no actually kellen said i do trust me thats the way wild magic works there is no such thing as implied consent isinwen tomorrow you have command ill be busy afterward youll all be very tired i dont know more than that so i suggest you all get a good nights sleep there was someone in his tent kellen didnt need the footprints outside in the fresh snow to tell him so he knew and it didnt take a knightmages gift to tell him who it was even here in a war camp the threshold of ones own dwelling was sacrosanct no elf would cross it without permission even if its owner were not present but a human especially a young human entirely untutored in the courtesy that came so naturally to the elves what do you want cilarnen he said stepping into the tent cilarnen had left it dark kellen lit the lamps cilarnen was sitting on the low stool that was the tents only seatingprobably to keep himself awake for he had been halfdozing when kellen arrived and sat up with a jolt kellen could smell a faint unfamiliar medicinal smell in the air idalias cordial well exhaustion and strain could bring on a headache as well i i wanted to talk to you before tomorrow alone kellen didnt want to talk he wanted to sleep but it must be something importantat least in cilarnens mindto bring him here when he was obviously so desperately tired youre here it isnt tomorrow and were aloneas much as thats possible kellen said he couldnt begin to imagine what cilarnen wanted to see him about but after all that cilarnen had done to help make tomorrows spell a success he owed cilarnen a hearing no matter how much hed rather be sleeping tomorrow i want to be with the rest of you with the wildmages kellen could not have been more stunned if cilarnen had announced he suddenly wanted to become a wildmage in the circle inside the shields with us cilarnen nodded why kellen asked bluntly kellen you said i was the smartest student at the magecollege i dont know if you were right or not but ive been thinking ever since well i finally saw you again these thingstheyre smart too arent they as smart as we are kellen said grimly maybe smarter but the one in stonehearth mistook me for you and we look nothing alike you know cilarnen said seriously so theyre either stupidor theres some reason for them to confuse the two of us if you think like them or see like them kellen waited cilarnens reasoning made sense so far though he didnt like where it was going soa reason but i cant figure out what it is i cant think like a that i cant even think like one of you but vestakia and kardus both say im not tainted with dark mageryvestakia said shed know and that if she didnt shalkan would thats true kellen said whatever else we have to worry about we dont have to worry about that cilarnen smiled though it clearly took an effort to do so i think id rather die than be anything like the thing i saw at stonehearth it killed and it killed and it laughed but you see kellen maybe im supposed to be there tomorrow because youll be there tomorrow maybe it saw something nobody else has seenbut not something bad maybe something it was afraid of something that could help it was possible kellen decided all they really knew about demons was that they were evil terribly powerful immortal could assume any shape and fueled their magic through the blood and pain of others it was not impossiblein fact it was highly likelythat they could sense things nondemons couldnt and he couldnt think like a demon any more than cilarnen could oh he could guess at their tactics imagine their strategysome of the time but truly think like one no creature of the light could manage that maybe youre right kellen said slowly maybe your being there could help or maybe it will kill you cilarnen looked directly at him startled this was obviously not what hed expected to hear yes i mean to scare you kellen said i want you to know exactly what youre asking for this will be the most powerful spell any of us has ever attempted a spell of the wild magic youll be right in the middle of it we dont control the wild magic not entirely it works through us in its own way though always for the good were its tools not the other way around you might find yourself linked to several dozen wildmages if just being around us makes you uncomfortable think what that would do think hard kellen watched as cilarnen pictured in his mind what kellen had suggested he could tell the boy was imagining something intolerably painful i still wanti needto be there ive brought the message my work karduss tasktheyre done the elves will take tinsin back to stonehearth and anganil will find another rider if the light forsakes me cilarnen said slowly and if smiling had cost him an effort there was no doubt in kellens mind that those words cost him every bit of courage and will that he had leaf and star send that it doesnt kellen said now go to bed here its too late and too cold for you to walk all the way back to the centaur camp nowyoud probably fall asleep in the first snowdrift you found take the pallet ive slept rougher than this before he opened his clothes chest and began pulling out his extra blankets and spare cloak theyd make an adequate bed for the night and his coldwargfurlined cloak was warm enough to serve as a sleeping pallet in its own right but cilarnen began no arguments im saving all of mine for idalia tomorrow kellen said cilarnen was quickly asleep kellen lay awake a few moments longer wondering if he were doing the right thing then decided there was no point in worrying about it he slept the funerals for the high mages perizel and arance eclipsed in splendor even that of high mage vilmos two moonturns earlier though they were held much more privately in the chapel of the light at the magecollege at least vilmos had died with dignity and honorgiving his all for the good of the city in a great working perizel and arance had been murdered it was impossible that the commons should learn of it of coursebut every mageborn in the mage quarter knew almost before the magewardens had arrived at the houses of the deceased they were poisoned lord archmage anigrel said entering lycaelons office as dawn bells sounded its single lonely carillon we know how but not by whom my agents are questioning the servantsand the families it seems that you were right my son lycaelon said heavily motioning for anigrel to seat himself this monstrous conspiracy of wildmages strikes at our very marrow but how could they be poisoned it seemed as if the archmage had aged a year for every sennight that had passed since the banishings of early winter in one sense this was the time of his greatest triumph since as far as lycaelon tavadon knew the reins of power settled more firmly into his hands each day but apparently its emptiness ate at him like a wasting disease that owed nothing to any spell of anigrels at the moment anigrel had no interest in hurrying his new father to reunion with the light he found the archmage too useful where he was an enthusiastic partisan of anigrels policies one whose purity of motive and loyalty to the city were unquestionableand unquestioned lord perizel is accustomed to take a cup of kaffeyah before he retires anigrel said taking care to sound as if presenting the news pained him lord arance is fond of ividion redhis servants say he generally takes wine in his library while looking over his collection of rare books we did not find poison in either the glass or the cup nor would we because we found traces of umbrastone it would make any poison undetectable father light deliver us lycaelon groaned he looked at anigrel beseechingly i will discover our enemies i swear it but until i do i must ask you do not fill those vacancies we know that arance and perizel were good and loyal men it is possible that we will not be able to say the same of any who put themselves forward to take their place yes lycaelons eyes narrowed at a time like this i must have no one about me whom i cannot trust you are right anigrel but with only eight upon the council and you and i called so often to other duties i fear the great workings will suffer the city expects so much of us i have a plan that i hope will lift some of that burden from your shoulders anigrel said lowering his eyes modestly he took a deep breath forcing himself to remain calm he was so very close now for many years against the possibility this day might come he had been working upon an elaborate configuration of spells tiny modifications of the city wards his changes would be undetectable to a casual inspectionbut they would allow his dark lady and her kindred to send their magics through the citywards unhinderedand undetected and where spells could go bodies could soon follow ah my son you are always thinking of the good of the city even as you work yourself to exhaustion you must share your thoughts with me lycaelon said eagerly quickly anigrel outlined his plan all mages of sufficient rank had always assisted in the great workingswhy not dedicate specific groups of high mages to specific tasksweather spells water purification spells bellsetting the citywardsfreeing the more powerful and experienced council mages to lend their expertise to those unique and delicate problems that were sure to appear some of us could work with them at first of courseto be sure everything runs properly but other mages often work in the great circles it is in my mind to recruit from among their numbers those whom my magewardens deem suitable of course it is an excellent plan lycaelon said the council will approve it it must and anigrel i hesitate to ask this of you but you must lead the circle that charges the citywards i can trust no one but you with a task so vital to our welfare you must choose the mages for this circle as welland let as many of them be magewardens as possible it is a heavy burden you lay upon me father anigrel said gravely but i will try to bear it wellfor the good of the city the day of the working dawned pale and overcastand far too cold to snow kellen noted that fact almost automaticallyand turned over and went back to sleep a few hours later he was rousedall the way from sleep this timeby the ringing of his bellrope he was on his feet without being quite awake sword in hand wondering vaguely why hed slept in his clothes he unpegged the tent flap to find kharren standing before him knightmage she said courteously a last duty to discharge as alakomentai before you may leave your command to isinwen adaerion gathers the first of the subcommanders in his pavilion in half an hour i shall be there kellen promised bowing he closed the tent flap again and glanced over at cilarnen let him sleep as long as he could kellen added his own blankets to the ones already covering cilarnen kellen had just time to thrust his feet into his boots comb his hair straight and tie it backno time for braidingand buckle on his weapons before running all the way to adaerions pavilion the day was just as cold as hed suspected it would be in adaerions pavilion he along with a dozen other subcommanders gave his sworn oath upon his honor that he and all his command agreed to share in the price for the work to come afterward kellen felt both relieved and nervous all the duties and responsibilities of the army had been lifted from him all that remained was his service to the wild magic none of the wildmages was certain of what would happen when the spell was cast it could be as safe as a scrying spellor as dangerous as the assault on the black cairn there was no way to know except by doing what if this is a trap cilarnen is innocenti truly believe thatbut what if this is still a trap the demons have given us information before knowing we would have no choice but to act upon it if they arranged for him to find out what he did they would also know we would do everything in our power to investigate further making ourselves vulnerable and just as with the discovery of the shadowed elves there was no way to turn away from such a task if what cilarnen said was trueif there was any possibility that it was truethey had to know they had to do exactly what they were doing now someday kellen vowed grimly we will no longer dance to your piping shadow mountain someday we will choose the battlefieldand the battle and we will win two hours before noon redhelwar addressed the army on the drill field just outside the camp he spoke slowly pausing between each sentence for his words must be relayed to the edges of the command he spoke of simple thingsthe drought that was past the depth of the winter snows the glory of the springtide to come he did not speak of what the wildmages were about to do he did not need to we shall not go down to the dark consenting he said at last we shall fight who will share with me in the price of the spell it was now that the senior and allied commanders were to have come forward bringing the oaths of their commands instead something unrehearsed unplanned and unprecedentedespecially in the lives of the elves who lived by ritual and ceremonyhappened the entire armyevery elf every centaur every human thereshouted out their consent over and over again light deliver us cilarnen said softly listening to the roar of the army he and kellen had remained behind to watch kellen had wanted to hear redhelwars speech they were mounted on their destriers a few hundred yards from where the army had gathered for they would need to be inside the icepavilion before those who were sharing in the spellprice surrounded it consentasked and granted kellen said without it we are thieves and the wild magic will turn against us come on its time to go they rode anganil and firareth all the way to the pavilionthose of the army sharing in the price would follow on footand when they got there kellen dismounted looping his reins back over firareths saddle and motioning for cilarnen to do the same home he said to the destrier pointing back at the camp and giving him an encouraging slap on the rump you too he said to anganil both animals trotted off toward the camp theyll go where theyre used to being fed kellen said noting cilarnens look of disbelief the handlers will bring them in and take care of them theres no magic involved its one of the commands they know like dump your rider in the snow cilarnen suggested with a faint nervous smile if were both still alive tomorrow maybe there will be time to start training you to make use of what anganil knows kellen said absently i doubt youll ever be a knight but you have the makings of a fine rider they walked toward the pavilion each occupied by his own sober thoughts the other wildmages were already gathered here though not all were yet inside the mountainfolk undoubtedly thought this was a fine calm dayeven warmand the lostlanders were used to even harsher conditions some were gathered around a brazier brewing their thick black tea and talking quietly others paced back and forth their heavy furs dark against the snow it was the calm before battle ancaladar was coiled around the pavilion as immobile as if hed decided to become a part of it the dragon raised his head as they approached his large golden eyes fixed on cilarnen this should be interesting ancaladar commented lowering his head again they went inside idalia was standing near the mirror talking intently to jermayan she looked up as kellen entered and saw cilarnen last night kellen had told cilarnen he was saving all his arguments for idalia now he wondered if arguing was going to be good enough idalia walked over to them good morning kellen have you decided to murder cilarnen after all or is there another reason hes here her violet eyes flashed dangerously she knew they all knewof cilarnens particular sensitivity to the wild magic this was the last place he should be he believes he has a good reason to stand in the circle with us ive heard his reasons and i agree kellen said matching bluntness with bluntness ive told him it may kill him he has still chosen to come cilarnen idalia began idalia kellen said gently no one is asking your permission idalia stared at kellen as if seeing him for the very first time jermayan appeared at idalias side even in plain sight even in a crowd of people the elven mage could appear and disappear with a silent grace that owed nothing to magic to know these reasons would make good hearing jermayan said quietly putting a hand on idalias arm its a question kellen said to cilarnen when cilarnen said nothing keyedup as he was cilarnen might not have understood and jermayan was being very polite answer it or not as you choose i think cilarnen faltered to a stop and started again the thing in stonehearth saw something in me something that made it confuse me with kellen i need to be here to help if i can there was another silence idalia looked from cilarnen to kellen and back again at last she noddednot permitting but accepting as kellen says its your choice stand where you like kellen said to cilarnen i dont think it will matter ill want you in the center with me kellen idalia said come on ill show you she took his arm and walked with him over to the space before kindolhinadetils mirror her stave leaned against it there was now an iron brazier set before itone of the largest the elves possessedfilled with pieces of namanar wood on a square of cloth beside it lay a small herb bundle that would also be needed youve grown up little brother im glad idalia said you always knew i would kellen pointed out and ive had good teachers and better examples did she think hed grown up because hed argued with her he wondered or because he hadnt the best i hope now ill stand here youll stand behind me youll see what i seeeveryone will i think just like a regular scrying spell but if this spell goes the way i think im the only one who will know whatever there is to know but you should be able to sense how the spell is running and interfere if it becomes necessary and hope the wild magic shows me what i need to do kellen thought soberly soon all the wildmages had moved into the pavilion and the army had moved into position outside redhelwar stepped through the opening and bowed to idalia idalia returned the salute gravely today we will attempt to see beyond the wards of the city of a thousand bells called armethalieh and know what takes place within her walls idalia announced formally who will share with me the price of the working the army and its allies will share in the price of the working wildmage idalia redhelwar said in token i bring this he held out his hand resting upon the palm was a tiny circlet a band made of three strands of redhelwars hair intricately braided into an endless ring i accept your oath and your gift idalia said taking the ring may the gods of the wild magic favor us this day leaf and star will that it be so redhelwar answered bowing and retreating from the tent idalia returned to the center and lit the brazier as the ghostwood began to kindle she took her staff and began to walk around the outer edge of the group of wildmages drawing a line in the beaten snow she refused to let herself think beyond each moment there was one last reason why she was the only possible person to be the caster of this spell all her prices were now paid save for one for any other the mageprice for a spell such as this would surely be heavy she returned to her place in the center of the circle between kellen and the brazier he stood as calmly as if he were already in deep trance as alertly as if he might be called upon to fight at any moment waiting shed said hed grown up and he had whatever past trouble there had been between him and cilarnen it was over now he no longer needed herhe might still value her opinion but he would never again depend on it instead of his own the work of bringing him to adulthoodand vital work it had beenwas done if disaster struck those she lovedand who loved herwould survive idalia knelt and took up the bundle of dried herbs and the ring of hair she slipped her dagger from her belt and scored a long line down her palm then clutched the herbs and hair in that hand tightly moistening both with her blood then she cast them onto the brazier of burning wood the smoke coiling upward changed color abruptly and she felt the shimmer as the dome of protection rose around them all expanding outward to enfold the army as well the link formed the power of the assembled wildmages joining together becoming one becoming hers she felt the spell uncoil within her as she inhaled the smoke she reached out toward the mirror show me what i need to see tell me what i need to know it glowed bright as the moon growing larger and larger until it was all there was she was in the city not nowbut then what she saw was in the past for a moment she was puzzled then realized she must need to see this as well the temple of the light an adoption ceremony the spell let her know the meaning of everything she saw and so she knew that what she saw was anigrel being adopted into house tavadon and that later this same day he would be appointed to the mage council and take volpirils seat she knew that breulin and isas had been forced to resign she knew that anigrel was cilarnens master raellan there is no conspiracy there never was anigrel started it all with dreamlike swiftness the hours and days of anigrels life unfolded to her the formation of the magewardens and the commons wardensthe network of spies to inform upon the people of armethalieh and sow terror among them every thread of unholy darkness woven through the golden fabric of the city was spun from anigrels hands she watched as he murdered lord vilmos and she saw she saw deep in the darkness of the world without sun savilla came out of her entrancement with a strangled cry of rage though it was long before the proper time for her rising someone was tampering with her slave she felt it through the souldeep link she shared with her mageman the festering sickness of the light approached him they will not with the fresh horrors of not one but two murders to convince themand not merely murders of mageborn but of members of the mage council itselfhigh mage anigrels proposals for special dedicated highly secure groups of mages to handle the routine magick of the city had passed by unanimous council vote no one had suggested filling the empty council seats no one had dared they were beginning to learnslowly but they were learningthat to disagree with any of anigrels proposals could well be seen as a sign of sympathy with the burgeoning wildmage menace and certainly there was no one better than the chief magewarden to see to the security of the citywards themselves tonight his plans would bear their first fruits tonight he and highly loyal acolytes would begin to change the wards surrounding the city and soon soon the citywards would keep out only what anigrel wanted kept out the circle was assembled the hour was correct the braziers were lit and the air was thick with the proper incensea compound anigrel had crafted personally the nine mages of the points of the light began to draw the elaborate sigils chanting out the spell as they did so while anigrel and the remaining three sang the complex antiphon the great sword warmed in his hands soon it would be time to draw the first of the seals idalia watched in sick horror it was worse than she had imaginedworse than anyone had feared anigrel was the demons creaturehad been for years and now hed managed to reach a position where he could strip away armethaliehs defensesand let the demons in he was going to give them the city and all she could do was watch savilla stood naked in her ivory chamber the walls were spattered with blood and the remains of halfadozen dismembered slaves lay scattered about for shed had no time to be neat or elegant the obsidian bowl was filled to overflowing with hot fresh blood and more pooled on the ebony table and ran down its legs to the floor her mageman was doing his citymagicthat made everything much easier she could touch what overlooked him wildmages savillas fury grew until it nearly choked her how dare they meddle in her plans she bared her fangs in savage glee as she tested the power of their spell and followed it to its source theyd worked so hard and so diligently to penetrate the human citys defenses but a breech for you is a breech for me my darlings savilla purred to herself in sudden delight in their desperation they had made themselves vulnerable she struck with all her might kellen saw all that idalia sawthey all didbut without the knowing it meant little to him he let the images go concentrating on feeling the currents of power that flowed through them allthrough the ring of wildmages into idalia from the army into the ring of wildmagessearching constantly for anything out of place the spark that was cilarnen was like a bright ember different apart but not wrong jermayan another sort of difference not wrong kellen ignored them both then no shoutedwhisperedthoughthe did not know which of these he did but disasterhe sensed itcomingalready herehe didnt know which he reached out to idalia she had to end the spell he was too late time seemed to slow the surface of the mirror faded to darkness and bowed outward as if its surface were not crystal but oil it reached for idalia if it touched her they would all die he was sure they all felt they were doing somethingeven kardus was staring into the mirror as if he could see something other than the reflections of idalia and kellen and everyone else here standing around in a circle all cilarnen knew was that the icepavilion was filled with smokevery little of it was escaping through the smokehole in the roofand it made him want to cough and that hed never been so uncomfortable in his life it was like when hed handled wirances booksbut worse it was like being terrifiedonly his mind wasnt terrified at all his mind could see no reason for fear standing in a smokefilled house made of ice but his heart was beating so hard that his entire body shook and inside his gloves his palms were slick with sweat and then he heard kellen cry out cilarnen flung mageshield over idalia at the exact moment jermayan cast his own shield kellen felt cilarnen reach the end of his own power in seconds and felt ancaladar bolster cilarnens power with his own freely given kellen heard freely given cilarnens shield strengthened held the two shieldsone of high magick one of elven magerysparked and boiled over each other the emerald and purple refusing to blend they have to hold kellen felt as if the whole force of both forms of magic neither hiswas pouring through him tearing him apart but the power of the circle was his as well he drew upon it forcing the two shields together his pain was a distant thing he forced it still farther from his consciousness focusing all his intent upon holding the two shields together now he could see them clasped in a faint blue tracery his will the will of a knightmage which could not be turned aside from its purpose save by death a bolt of pure darkness struck their combined shield he heard cilarnen scream felt jermayans agony ancaladar bellowed in pain and outrage the shield held and he held though he felt as if every atom of his body was being torn asunder he held and held and held by will alone and then as his will eroded and he felt even that failinghe was filled again with power with a pure white power that held every color of magic there ever was within itself and what little remained of his ability to think put a name to that power shalkan this was why shalkan held back from the other workings even when it was to heal one of his own kind this was what shalkan had been saving himself for without knowing exactly what would be needed only that it would he fed the very essence of unicorn through the bond that tied him to kellen and into kellens will into cilarnen because cilarnen was as virgin as kellen into the shield so that all powers fused into one color that held all with a lightless flash and an earsplitting shriek of backlash the darkbolt recoiled upon itself the mirror dissolved the link was gone and so was the dome of protection the shields vanished beneath kellens grasp and with them his need to hold them suddenly alone in his own skin kellen tried to take a step and went sprawling without the spell to concentrate on all that was left was the pain he felt drained unnaturally drainedas if his body had given up more than it could safely give and he hurt from the energies he had forced through himself never be a high mage kellen thought groggily he tried to get to his knees but he was too sick and dizzy to move cilarnenjermayani have to get up stay down its all right i know what they want someoneidaliasaid i know what theyre doing darkness transmuted to light fountained forth from the obsidian bowl shattering it into a thousand razor shards that embedded themselves in the demon queens flesh far worse than that was the backlash of her spellsavilla had struck against the hated enemy with all her might and her own power had turned against her to strike her down drained of power she lay insensible until prince zyperis found her it was he who carried her back to her resting chamber in secret who drew the stone shards from her flesh and tenderly sucked each wound clean rest darling mama he said lovingly soon you will be strong again prince zyperis regarded his mother with every expression of tenderness and why not for the first time in his life he had seen her helpless and vulnerable for now it was their secretand one zyperis intended to share with no one else but secrets were power among the endarkened and now he knew how yethlenga had died by the power of the wild magic and the high magick combined it was a fearful thing to know that the puling creatures of the light could slay themthey who were meant to live forever by the favor of he who is on the other hand it was also an opportunity he had not been ready to exploit it this time nor had queen savilla been te weak enough but if he arranged matters properlyif he made sure that the wildmages pet high mage flourished then perhaps his beloved mother could meet with a timely accident the next time she faced the forces of the light and there would be a new king in the world without sun the cost of the spell to see into armethalieh had been higher than any of them had imagined no one had died but that was as much as anyone could say if there had been an attack in its aftermath the army would have been slaughtered for of those who had shared in the price many had fainted where they stood and the rest were too weak to as much as lift a sword it would be sennights before the army was able to fight at full strength once more those who had not shared in the spellpriceand it was fortunate that so many had been exemptedfound themselves occupied caring for those who hadhelping the troops from the field around the icepavilion and then returning to carry away the unconscious wildmages and cilarnen shalkan too had been found unconscious guarded by the rest of the unicorn herd until a healer could be brought to help him somehow the demonsnot the mageshad seen the spell and had managed to turn it against them if cilarnen had not been hereif ancaladar had not granted him the power he had needed to use his magickif he and jermayan and kellen had not somehow been able to fuse their powers and shalkan had not added his own unique power to the lot she would be dead and the wildmages linked to her so mindblasted that they might never have been able to serve the wild magic again cilarnen she was not sure what would have happened to him nothing good if and if and if but all had gone as the wild magic willed their spellshields had protected herit was why she was still standing and nowas soon as there was someone conscious to tell it toshe would be able to tell what she had learned tears of fear and frustration gathered in idalias eyes as she thought of what she had seen in the mirror she was able to speak to redhelwar that evening though the armys general was still confined to his bed she summarized what she had learned through the spell and soon the human city will be theirs and all its mages redhelwar said his voice flat with exhaustion and grief as kellen said there was something they needed before they were willing to move openly they dont have it yet idalia said and i pray to the gods of the wild magic we can keep them from getting it it was the next day before she dared to try to wake kelleneven jermayan with ancaladars inexhaustible vitality to draw upon still sleptbut kellen had to know what she knew as soon as possible they had to plan dont wake him idalia isinwen begged as she entered kellens pavilion the elven knight was sitting crosslegged beside the sleeping pallet though he looked as if he ought to be in one himself the pavilion was warm obviously isinwen was here to see that the brazier remained full and lit i have to isinwen idalia said gently there are things he needs to know and they cannot wait any longer then let me make tea first isinwen said resignedly lighting the tea brazier when the tea was ready isinwen left no one can make you feel quite as guilty as a loyal servant idalia thought with an inward sigh and isinwen certainly seemed to have appointed himself to that position she went over and knelt beside her sleeping brother idalia was calling him but he was so tired with an effort kellen forced himself to consciousness the mirror the spell the attack idalia knows cilarnen he said his voice a croak shalkan alive idalia said theyre all alive i think hetheywill all be okay theyre still asleep but i need you now kellen tried to sit up his body wouldnt obey and that alarmed him enough to give him the strength to pull himself into a sitting position idalia steadied him and put a mug of tea into his hand kellen took a deep breath clearing his head and gulped at the tea it was hot strong and horribly sweetjust what he needed exhaustion still dragged at him but his mind was clearing quickly they attacked us here yes idalia said she shook her head in selfdisgust something i should have thought of i suppose we made a link to their servant in the city we expected an attack from the mages but but an opening is an opening and they could use it just as well kellen finished but their attack didnt work just like at stoneheartha wildmage and a high mage working together can hurt them kill them i think idalia i think thats what the high magick was originally for to help kill them it would be nice to think so but i dont think knowing that is going to do us a lot of good now kellen had finished his tea idalia refilled his mug adding several more honeydisks idalia i saw what you saw but i didnt understand it anigrel hes on the council now hes the one cilarnen was told about in stonehearth lycaelon has adopted him made him a high mage and put him on the council hes the traitorhe has been for years theres moremuch morebut the main thing is this hes changing the wards of the city so that their spells can pass through them his body might be exhausted but kellens mind was fully alert it was the missing piece of the puzzle hed searched for for so long once they can bespell the city they can take the wards down entirely and enter it in the flesh but not not just for prey they could have stripped the lost land bare any time they liked if that was all they wanted they want something more allies but they are the ancient enemy of the mageborn too lycaelon would never hell do what anigrel tells him to idalia said grimly and anigrel is telling him that wildmages are the ones out to destroy his precious cityand have been for generations xaqiue kellen said were the wildmages so were the enemyus the elves the allies idalia it all makes sense now they dont want to face us in the field they never did and if they destroy us even armethalieh might noticeand fight but if they can get armethalieh to do their fighting for them then light destroys light and they destroy whats left idalia said despairingly now we know what they want kellen said and we know what we have to stop and he felt a strange elation as strong as idalias despair knowledge is power idalia andi thinkweve only begun to understand ours epilogue calibrelink calibrelink the first working had been accomplished successfully there had been a momentjust as he was about to inscribe the first of the seven sealswhen for a moment the council chamber had vanished from anigrels sight dissolved first in intolerable brightness and cold and then in darkness and the scent of freshlyspilled blood but it had only been a moment the web of the working had held of course anigrel wondered about the cause but none of the other mages had sensed any disruption in the spell and his own subsequent investigations had revealed nothing perhaps someone in the mage council had been attempting to overlook the working next time he would make doubly sure that any uninvited spectators received a more lasting greeting than they could imagine each day now it would be safer to openly use those powers that were his true heritage he had waited impatiently for his dark lady to use her new freedom to contact him and as the days passed and she did not he grew close to despair he knew his spells had not failed how then had he displeased her at last the time came for him to make his own attempt even now he dared not deviate from his schedule lest his presumption displease her further besides moondark was the time of greatest power for those spells he had learned under her tutelage at last the fortnight passed he retreated to his rooms filled the iron bowl with blood and waited you please meand disappoint me came the voice in his mind her touch was stronger than ever he could almost feel her soft hands upon his flesh anigrel dropped to his knees in confusion ii have done all you asked of me i will do more yes you must do moreand quickly did you not notice upon that night you worked to loosen the chains that bind your city against me that the wildmages struck at your life it was only through my intervention that you still live if i am to protect you further those fetters must be loosed entirely and you must convince the archmage to ally himself with us at once but hed known it was their ultimate goal but it would not be an easy one to achieve another yearperhaps twoto soften lycaelons mind further at once i have indulged you for long enoughdo this now or face the ruin of all our hopes her fury was like a lash anigrel cringed from her displeasure even as he longed for the pain of her touch yes mistressi swear to you i shall do this for you armethalieh shall be yours before the first flowers bloom much sooner i hopefor your sake my sweet anigrel do you not know how deeply i yearn to make you mine entirely do not make me wait much longer i swear to you mistress the city shall be yours to do with as you will and ii shall be yours as well
